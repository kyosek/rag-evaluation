A player gains points through actions such as 'attacking' and 'building'.\n\nAn unaffiliated 3rd party processes that data (in particular, it accumulates statistics on point change) to generate 'heatmaps' of player activity which can help deduce player online times (which has a direct impact on game strategy) and publishes it on their website. For players with high activity, this may lead to sleep pattern/time zone deduction.\n\nDoes GDPR affect the publication of game data like player points?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sleep pattern and timezone deduction are arguably not \"personal data\" within the meaning of the GDPR. Personal data is defined in [Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) as:\n\n> any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\n\nSo, if the published data is *solely* activity that could theoretically create a heatmap of activity and determine someone's timezone and *does not* include any other data (e.g. their online tag/identifier, etc.) then publishing just the activity data would not seem to involve any GDPR personal data obligations.\n\nHowever, if the published data can be correlated with other identifiers or other data that can directly or indirectly identify a specific person, then you have a duty as the controller to take appropriate steps to safeguard the privacy of that person. That may include limiting the data you publish to third\\-party processors in such cases.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A gaming company publishes real-time strategy game data, including player usernames and points earned through various actions. An unaffiliated third party processes this data to create heatmaps of player activity, potentially revealing sleep patterns and time zones. Under GDPR, which of the following scenarios would most likely require the gaming company to take steps to safeguard player privacy?\n\nA) The third party publishes only aggregated heatmaps without any identifying information.\nB) The third party publishes individual player activity data without usernames, but includes unique player IDs.\nC) The third party publishes player usernames along with their activity heatmaps.\nD) The third party publishes only time zone information for each player without any other data.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Aggregated heatmaps without identifying information would likely not be considered personal data under GDPR, as they cannot be linked to specific individuals.\n\nB) While unique player IDs don't directly identify individuals, they could potentially be used to indirectly identify players when combined with other data, making this a grey area.\n\nC) This is the correct answer because publishing player usernames along with activity data clearly identifies individuals, making it personal data under GDPR. The gaming company would need to take steps to protect player privacy in this scenario.\n\nD) Time zone information alone, without other identifying data, would likely not be considered personal data under GDPR.\n\nThe key point is that GDPR applies when data can be linked to an identifiable individual, either directly or indirectly. Publishing usernames with activity data creates a clear link to specific individuals, triggering GDPR obligations."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Arnie is a registered entrepreneur who sells raw wood. He was contacted by Bob. Bob works in a state organization (not private), and was tasked with building several garages on one of the streets of a city. Bob was given a budget, and needs to buy materials for the construction. In this example it's metallic parts (carcass, armatures, or whatever).\n\nSo Bob contacted Arnie, and here is what they do:\n\n1. Bob transfers a part of the money from the governmental bank account to Arnie's official account, as if he is purchasing metal from Arnie.\n2. Arnie withdraws this money from an ATM, and gives almost all of it to Bob. Bob gives some \"tip\" to Arnie\n3. Bob buys metal and other resources from wherever Bob wants, not from Arnie. The governmental money is now cash, therefore it's not tracked anymore. Now Bob can spend this money any way he wants.\n\n**Bob DOES NOT get anything from Arnie** \\- neither wood nor metal.\n\nArnie just withdraws the money, takes a tip and returns the balance to Bob.\n\nIt seems that Bob is actually keeping the part of the budget for himself and then buying cheap low\\-quality materials (or even steals them from somewhere else), employing cheap illegal workers, and saving a lot of money on this construction into his pocket.\n\nMy country, as far as I know, doesn't care whether the materials were purchased from an entrepreneur who actually sells them (Arnie doesn't sell metal). So according to papers, Arnie sold some metal to Bob, but in reality, Arnie just gave the money back to Bob, in cash after taking a \"tip\". This makes a backdoor for manipulations like this one.\n\nSo it seems to me that Arnie basically launders stolen money. Is this true?\n\nAnd if it is, what would be the legal consequences of someone unconnected to the transaction who knows about it reporting or not reporting it? For example, does not reporting it give rise to a risk of civil or criminal liability?\n\nETA: the country is Ukraine.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nUnder U.S. law in almost every U.S. jurisdiction this would be illegal conduct. Arnie would be a co\\-conspirator with Bob in money laundering and in embezzlement of government funds. These would usually be criminal felonies.\n\nThe government (or a private whistleblower called a \"relator\" in what is called a \"[qui tam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam)\" action, conducted in a procedurally proper way which afford the government an opportunity to sue itself before bringing the private qui tam action) could also sue Arnie and Bob and hold them liable, jointly and severally, for the funds diverted to Arnie and Bob in this scheme, and probably for punitive damages and/or civil penalties as well.\n\nIf the role played by Arnie was instead played by a U.S. publicly traded multinational company doing business in another country (or by an official of such a company who has knowledge of or is involved in the transaction with Bob), and it was also illegal to do this in that country (whether or not that law was enforced in that country), then the U.S. multinational company involved would also have violated the [U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act) (FCPA). As noted at the link:\n\n> The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and\n> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which apply criminal and\n> civil penalties respectively.\n\nSo, in that case, it would be a violation of both U.S. and the other country's laws, in all likelihood giving rise to liability to both criminal and civil consequences in both countries.\n\nIt isn't patently obvious that this conduct would be illegal under the law of every country, although it seems likely.\n\nFor example, a sheriff operating a prison in Alabama can do something very similar (skim money off prison operation funds by obtaining low bids for prison service contracts) legally.\n\nSimilarly, if Arnie had actually gone out and purchased metal parts from a third party at Bob's direction and then delivered those metal parts to Bob's government employer, that would be entirely legal almost everywhere (although any kickback to Bob, if that was what was really happening would still probably be some form of embezzlement in which Arnie might be conspiring).\n\nAlso, while this is considered corrupt in most of the developed world, in many developing and undeveloped countries, civil servants are paid almost nothing and kick backs for supervising government contracts are tolerated at a minimum as a matter of unstated official policy by senior managers of the government entities that unofficially sanction or encourage this conduct by their subordinates. This reality is one of the main reasons that the U.S. FCPA is heavily criticized politically and in academic commentary.\n\n> what would be the legal consequences of someone\n> unconnected to the transaction who knows about it reporting or not\n> reporting it? For example, does not reporting it give rise to a risk\n> of civil or criminal liability?\n\nNormally, someone not involved in Arnie's company, like a family member of Arnie, would have no legal duty to report this conduct upon learning of it, and would face no legal consequences for failing to report it, if the person not reporting it wasn't actually involved in the scheme.\n\nSomeone who cared about Arnie might want to counsel him that he is engaged in very risky conduct that could have catastrophic consequences if discovered and prosecuted. They might advise him that while this scheme does generate funds for Arnie that might not be worth the risk. Ultimately, as a practical matter, if that person didn't want to harm Arnie, however, that person would have to let Arnie decide for himself what to do.\n\nIf subpoenaed to serve as a witness, someone who knew about Arnie and Bob's conduct (other possibly than Arnie's spouse and his lawyer if his lawyer learned about the conduct only after the fact), could be compelled to testify in a court of law against Arnie about what the person who knew about this scheme knew, possibly contributing to Arnie going to prison and facing monetary penalties.",

Under U.S. law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences for Arnie?\n\nA) Arnie would only face civil penalties, as he is not a government employee.\nB) Arnie could be charged with money laundering and embezzlement, both likely to be criminal felonies.\nC) Arnie's actions are legal as long as he reports the income on his taxes.\nD) Arnie would only face consequences if Bob is caught and implicates him.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, under U.S. law, Arnie's actions would likely be considered illegal. He would be seen as a co-conspirator with Bob in both money laundering and embezzlement of government funds. These offenses are typically classified as criminal felonies in most U.S. jurisdictions. The answer states that Arnie could face charges for both these crimes, which accurately reflects the severity and nature of his involvement in the scheme as described in the original text.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Arnie would face more than just civil penalties; criminal charges would also apply. Option C is wrong because reporting the income on taxes does not make the underlying criminal activity legal. Option D is incorrect because Arnie's actions are independently illegal, regardless of whether Bob is caught or implicates him."

After some searching, the specific law seems to be 18 DCMR 2201\\.4 Driving the wrong way on a one\\-way street.\n\nRegarding the fine, on the ticket the $100 box is checked, however when I looked it up it is a $50 fine. I am not as concerned about this as I am about the circumstances of the traffic stop.\n\nI was going down a two\\-way street, arrived at an intersection with a one\\-way street which only allowed traffic to flow from left to right. As I arrived at the intersection, I had my left signal on. I had the right of way (everyone had stop signs), but I had to wait because a few pedestrians were crossing. As I passed the stop sign (after stopping) and entered the intersection, a cop car on the same road as me but going the opposite way stopped at their stop sign. The cop turns on his lights, and I turned left to pull over because there is open parking spot on the right side of the one\\-way street (only at this point I am facing the wrong way on the one\\-way) and the cops writes me a ticket. I would like to emphasize that before the cop pulled me over, my car was facing the correct direction. I only pulled into the left because I was being pulled over and it was the safest way to get out of the way. Not that it matters at this point\u2026 but I probably should have continued going straight when the cop turned on his lights. However, I vaguely remember the cop car as well as another cop car sort of blocking me from doing that (there were two police vehicles involved in this stop).\n\nI can either mail in an explanation or request a hearing with the cop present in front of an Administrative Judge. I have no evidence, so I plan to file a FOIA request for the dash cam and body cam video. Since situations involving legal issues have the tendency to blindside, I would deeply appreciate any guidance on the best way to go about fighting this ticket. I am happy to answer any questions.\n\nI am including an illustration of the situation:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MGdEq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/MGdEq.png)\n\nI would like a perspective from someone who has experience with legal defense.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> 2201\\.4 Upon a roadway so designated for one\\-way traffic, a vehicle shall be driven only in the direction designated at all or such times as shall be indicated by official traffic control devices.\n\nI'm failing to see the \"... except when pulling over for the police\" subclause. Equally there is no \"... unless you think you should\" subclause.\n\nIf you choose to have a hearing the evidence will show unambiguously that you drove the wrong way in a one way street and you will testify as to your reasons for doing so. For you to avoid the violation you would need to convince the examiner that a) you are telling the truth and b) that your mindset is in any way relevant. Unless the officer clearly directed you to pull into that spot, the decision to do so appears to be yours.\n\nI'd pay the fine if it was me.",

It states that \"Congress shall make no law\" regarding the establishment or free exercise of religion. This protection has been extended to state governments through the incorporation doctrine. However, it does not apply to parents' decisions about their children's religious education.

In what order are the collateral and guarantees used to pay off the creditors who own the loan? For example, is the collateral security from Company C used up completely first and then the guarantees from Company B relied on next, or is it pro\\-rata somehow between the security and guarantees, or something else entirely? Is there a standard part of an indenture or credit agreement where I can check this, or a convention if not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To start with, this is a highly technical issue upon which different jurisdictions may differ, and in which different rules may apply in different circumstances either by agreement or by statute. Also, similar situations are sometimes treated differently in this regard in bankruptcy and out of bankruptcy.\n\nThe majority rule is that the lender may choose which remedies \\- such as collateral and guarantee rights, to enforce, and the lender may choose in which order to enforce them.\n\nFor example, most jurisdictions allow a lender to collect from a guarantor even when collateral is available to the lender, in lieu of foreclosing on the collateral. \n\nSometimes, however, special rules apply.\n\nFor example, if the guarantor is a government agency (e.g. the Small Business Administration or the Veteran's Administration), often the lender is required to take all reasonable efforts to collect from the borrower and recover the amount owed from collateral, before the guarantee can be invoked.\n\nSimilarly, sometimes the law distinguishes between an accommodation party who receives no consideration in a transaction who signs as a direct debtor, and one who signs in a guarantor capacity. Those jurisdictions may require a good faith effort to collect from direct debtors (often including attempts to foreclose upon collateral) before attempting to collect from guarantors who sign as such.\n\nThere are also arrangements, such as credit default swaps or a situation when a consumer provides a credit card payment authorization which a creditor can use in the event of a default (or the large dollar amount equivalent of such an arrangement called a \"letter of credit\"), in which the line between what constitutes collateral and what constitutes a guarantee can be blurred.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Company X takes out a loan from Bank Z. The loan is guaranteed by Company Y and secured by liens on Company W's assets. Company X defaults on the loan. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Bank Z's options for recovering the loan amount?\n\nA) Bank Z must first exhaust all collateral from Company W before pursuing the guarantee from Company Y.\n\nB) Bank Z is required to pursue recovery from Company X and Company W simultaneously before invoking the guarantee from Company Y.\n\nC) Bank Z has the discretion to choose which remedies to enforce and in what order, unless specific agreements or regulations dictate otherwise.\n\nD) Bank Z must proportionally recover from Company W's collateral and Company Y's guarantee simultaneously.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the majority rule, the lender (Bank Z in this case) typically has the discretion to choose which remedies to enforce and in what order. This means Bank Z can decide whether to first pursue the collateral from Company W, invoke the guarantee from Company Y, or attempt to recover directly from Company X, unless there are specific agreements or regulations that dictate a particular order.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's usually no requirement to exhaust collateral before pursuing a guarantee. Option B is also incorrect as there's generally no obligation to pursue the borrower and collateral simultaneously before invoking a guarantee. Option D is incorrect because there's typically no requirement for proportional recovery from collateral and guarantees simultaneously.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that specific circumstances, jurisdictional laws, or contractual agreements could potentially modify this general rule, which is why the correct answer includes the caveat \"unless specific agreements or regulations dictate otherwise.\""

Could I be entitled to compensation? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In all but a few U.S. states the answer is that you are not entitled to any compensation. This is grossly unfair, but is the dominant rule by far in most jurisdictions in the U.S.\n\nAs a matter of legal doctrine this is justified on the grounds that a criminal prosecution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and many people who are actually guilty may be acquitted anyway because the standard of proof in a criminal case is so high. The classic example of that distinction is the [O.J. Simpson murder case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case), in which O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murdering his wife in a criminal prosecution, but was found liable for murdering her by the lower civil action preponderance of the evidence standard in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by her family.\n\n(In reality, most acquittals involve juries who think that the defendant was innocent, but that isn't reflected in the choice before them to convict or acquit a defendant.) \n\nThe only compensation to which you are entitled as a matter of law if you are acquitted of a crime, per the U.S. Supreme Court, is a refund of any fines or costs payable only upon conviction of a crime, which you paid or had taken from your assets, prior to your acquittal. *See [Nelson v. Colorado](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/581/15-1256/opinion3.html)*, 581 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017\\).\n\nThere would an exception if you can show that a law enforcement officer intentionally brought charges without probable cause [in a civil lawsuit you bring against the law enforcement officer](http://www.virginialawreview.org/sites/virginialawreview.org/files/Kossis_Book.pdf), which is realistically impossible in almost all cases. ([Prosecutors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutorial_immunity) and [judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_immunity) and jurors (see, e.g. [here](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/132.210))) have absolute immunity from liability for their official acts related to the court process.)\n\nThere are a few jurisdictions where you could bring a civil lawsuit for compensation based upon \"actual innocence\", rather than law enforcement misconduct. In those places, you could receive compensation if you could prove by a preponderance of the evidence (or with a prosecutor's affirmation) that you were actually factually innocent, so you could get some compensation even in the absence of an intentional violation of your civil rights. Texas is one state that has such a scheme, with important limitations, as explained in [this linked case](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2009/dec/15/ex-prisoners-acquitted-for-insufficient-evidence-may-not-sue-texas/).\n\nYou would probably have to hire a lawyer with your own funds to bring either kind of lawsuit, and realistically, you wouldn't have been incarcerated for eight months pending trial if you had enough money to do that, because you would have posted bond and been released pending trial.\n\nThere may be one or two states (I can't recall any from memory) where there might be a right to compensation merely because you are acquitted, but this would be an extreme outlier in terms of U.S. law.\n\nOutside the United States, outcomes could vary dramatically from one country to another. They relevant law in England and Wales is discussed in an answer to [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23506/defendant-compensation-after-not-guilty-verdict) at Law.SE. [International human rights law](https://academic.oup.com/jicj/article/8/2/407/848174) does not recognize a right to compensation in these circumstances.",

This is one of the rare circumstances where compensation might be possible.\n\nOption B is incorrect because in most U.S. states, there is no entitlement to compensation merely for being acquitted, even if the defendant suffered personal and financial losses.\n\nOption C is incorrect because prosecutors have absolute immunity from liability for their official acts related to the court process.\n\nOption D is incorrect because if the officer had probable cause, even if mistaken, this would not typically be grounds for compensation.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Before law enforcement can search a property, they need to obtain a search warrant (with some exceptions). That is, they request the warrant from a judge/magistrate/court, that then decides whether to grant the warrant or not. It is clear that this system is intended to prevent arbitrary searches, as the judge might simply decline a warrant request if there is no reasonable justification behind it.\n\nHow often does this actually happen? I've never heard of a warrant request being declined by a judge, but surely there must be statistics about it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Disclaimer: there are whole sections of criminal law courses that deal with this issue and the various laws and precedents that have shaped american jurisprudence relating to right of privacy, expectation of privacy, and search and seizure. So, this is more of a primer than a comprehensive answer. \n\nThat being said, the Fourth Amendment, which protects the people from unreasonable search and seizure by the government, dictates that there must be probable cause for a search warrant to issue. However, in addition to the restrictions that are imposed by the Fourth Amendment, several states\u2019 constitutions, as well as a variety of state and federal statutes, rules of procedure, and law court rulings interpret these edicts further, limiting the process for obtaining a search warrant (a state can add additional safeguards, or impose more stringent requirements, but not less than the 4th amendment demands). On the federal level alone, the laws on search and seizure are also limited in scope by sections appearing in Title 18, Part II, Chapter 205 \u2013 Searches and Seizures. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101\\-18\\. Federal warrants are further governed by Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nOnly Judges and magistrates may issue search warrants. To obtain a warrant, law enforcement officers must show that there is probable cause (i.e. grounds) that search is legally justified. Officers must support this showing with sworn statements (affidavits) under oath, and must describe in particularity the place they will search and the items they will seize. Judges must consider the totality of the circumstances when deciding whether or not to issue the warrant. When issuing a search warrant, the judge may restrict how and when the police conduct the search.\n\nPolice officers (a broad term I'm using for ease of discussion to include all manner of state and federal investigators operating under color of law) seeking a warrant do not need to show that the people being searched (or those whose property is being searched) actually, or even probably, committed the crime(s) in question. Rather, officers merely need to show probable cause exists to show that the evidence sought\\-after is likely there and upon discovery may implicate some person or persons in criminal activity (that has been committed).\n\nA landmark case that resulted in some reforms is *Zurcher v. Stanford Daily*, 436 U.S. 547 (1978\\), in which the Supreme Court opined that a search conducted by the police at a student newspaper, where the newspaper was not implicated or connected to any criminal activity, was a legal search under the Fourth Amendment, because the police *suspected* it had photographic evidence of the identities of demonstrators who assaulted police officers. Afterward, however, some jurisdictions responded by passing laws restricting or forbidding these kinds of searches \\- so again, what stands as acceptable procedure is not static.\n\nWhile you may not often hear of requests for warrants being denied, it does happen if there is insufficient PC pled in the affidavit; General unawareness is not surprising as it is not something often made public, although there are instances. Most officers know when they have enough for a warrant and know how to adequately swear out an affidavit so that PC is present enough for the judge to sign the warrant in good faith. However, some Judges are more stringent and demanding than others with regard to how the PC was obtained,the scope of the warrant under those facts, etc. Certainly, not every application is granted.\n\nCornell has a great primer of this issue and you can find article when application for a warrant was denied...especially in higher profile investigations.\n\n<https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/search_warrant>",

According to the information provided, including the case of Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, a search warrant may be granted even if the entity being searched (in this case, the newspaper) is not implicated in or connected to criminal activity. The police officer needs to show probable cause that the evidence sought is likely to be present and that it may implicate some person or persons in criminal activity. The officer does not need to prove that the newspaper committed a crime (ruling out option D), nor will the warrant be automatically denied just because the newspaper isn't suspected of wrongdoing (ruling out option A). While the officer must swear under oath, this alone is not sufficient for the warrant to be granted without question (ruling out option B). The judge must consider the totality of the circumstances and determine if probable cause exists."

If a wall has to go from floor to ceiling, I can easily create a smoking space that is walled in putting in a 6\\-inch gap, say.\n* For that matter, is the wall (presumably with an entrance) between the outdoor part and my establishment included in the perimeter, under any of those interpretations?\n\nWhich of these meanings, or any other, is at play in Ireland's laws regarding public smoking?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The word \"perimeter\" must be read in line with the [Interpretation Act 2005, Section 5(1\\)](http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2005/act/23/section/5/enacted/en/html#sec5) if there is any doubt about the meaning of the word:\n\n> 5\\.\u2014(1\\) In construing a provision of any Act (other than a provision that relates to the imposition of a penal or other sanction)\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) that is obscure or ambiguous, or\n> \n> \n> (b) that on a literal interpretation would be absurd or would fail to reflect the plain intention of\u2014\n> \n> \n> (i) in the case of an Act to which paragraph (a) of the definition of \u201cAct\u201d in section 2 (1\\) relates, the Oireachtas, or\n> \n> \n> (ii) in the case of an Act to which paragraph (b) of that definition relates, the parliament concerned,\n> \n> \n> the provision shall be given a construction that reflects the plain intention of the Oireachtas or parliament concerned, as the case may be, where that intention can be ascertained from the Act as a whole.\n\nIn this case, the word \"perimeter\" would likely be given its ordinary, plain, every\\-day meaning.

Regarding outdoor spaces, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the law's intent when interpreting the term \"perimeter\" in relation to smoking restrictions?\n\nA) The perimeter should be calculated using strict mathematical definitions, considering only the linear boundary of the space.\n\nB) The perimeter should be interpreted based on the total surface area of the walls surrounding the space.\n\nC) The perimeter should be understood in its ordinary, everyday meaning, as intended by lawmakers and interpreted in line with the Interpretation Act 2005.\n\nD) The perimeter calculation should exclude any wall containing an entrance to the establishment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct interpretation of \"perimeter\" in this law should follow the guidance provided by the Interpretation Act 2005, Section 5(1). This act states that when a provision is ambiguous or could lead to an absurd interpretation, it should be construed to reflect the plain intention of the lawmakers. In this case, \"perimeter\" would likely be given its ordinary, everyday meaning rather than a strict mathematical or technical definition. This approach aligns with the law's intent to regulate smoking in public spaces in a way that is practical and understandable to the general public, rather than relying on complex calculations or technicalities."

Therefore, a police officer can theoretically attempt to gather digital evidence against a suspect by traveling to the immediate vicinity of the suspect, using his or her computer's wireless networking card to capture any packets in the area, then analyzing the packets to try to glean information that could be useful for an investigation.\n\nIn *Kyllo v. United States*, SCOTUS ruled that the Drug Enforcement Agency's warrantless use of thermal imaging unconstitutional, but they based their ruling on the unavailability of the device used to the general public. \n\nAs the police can always use software that is available to the general public \\- such as Wireshark \\- one could argue this satisfies the *Kyllo* test and is, therefore, Constitutional.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Apart from 4th Amendment questions, there is specific statutory protection regarding wiretapping. At the federal level, [chapter 119 of Title 18](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119) is relevant. [Section 2511](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511) generally prohibits \"wiretapping\", via the concept of \"intercepting\", so whether there is a physical wire for transmitting the signal or the the message wafts across the air, it's the same. Subsection 2 lists a vast collection of situations where interception is allowed. If the agent is a party to the communication, or has the permission of one party to the communication, then it (warrantless interception) is legal, as long as the purpose of the interception is not law\\-breaking. \n\nSubsection (e) allows a US agent \"in the normal course of his official duty to conduct electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as authorized by that Act\". Subsection (i) allows interception in circumstances involving a computer trespasser, which does not seem applicable. Overall, a warrant is required for wire\\-tapping, and the existence of a physical wire is not required.\n\nA potential escape hatch is subsection (g)(i) which says that \"It shall not be unlawful under this chapter or chapter 121 of this title for any person to intercept or access an electronic communication made through an electronic communication system that is configured so that such electronic communication is readily accessible to the general public\". It turns out that \"readily accessible to the general public\" is a technical term defined in 18 USC 2510 (16\\). Certain things make a signal not readily accessible, one being encryption. Many of these don't seem likely to be applicable, but one has potential, in subpart (e) that the communication is \n\n> transmitted on frequencies allocated under part 25, subpart D, E, or F\n>  of part 74, or part 94 of the Rules of the Federal Communications\n>  Commission, unless, in the case of a communication transmitted on a\n>  frequency allocated under part 74 that is not exclusively allocated to\n>  broadcast auxiliary services, the communication is a two\\-way voice\n>  communication by radio\n\nI cannot hunt down a translation into plain English.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) This action is constitutional based on the Kyllo v. United States ruling, as Wireshark is publicly available software.\n\nB) This action is legal without a warrant as long as the wireless network is not encrypted.\n\nC) This action is legal if the officer has permission from one party in the communication being intercepted.\n\nD) This action generally requires a warrant under federal wiretapping laws, regardless of the software or method used.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While the Kyllo v. United States case might suggest that using publicly available software like Wireshark could be constitutional, federal wiretapping laws (specifically Chapter 119 of Title 18 U.S. Code) generally prohibit the interception of electronic communications without a warrant, regardless of the method or technology used. The \"readily accessible to the general public\" exception is narrowly defined and typically wouldn't apply to most private Wi-Fi networks. Additionally, many modern Wi-Fi networks use encryption, which would exclude them from this exception. Option C is incorrect because while having permission from one party can make interception legal in some circumstances, it doesn't apply to capturing packets from a third-party's network. Therefore, in most cases, the officer would need a warrant to legally intercept wireless network packets, making option D the most accurate statement."

I understand that if I want to store anything, I need to ask users for consent.\n\nHowever, I'm confused by exactly how to abide by the Cookie Law. How do I know if the user has agreed to storage if I can't check the storage? Is it more that I am allowed to check local storage to to see if the user has agreed previously? ie I don't store anything until the user agrees, but I may check local storage to see if the user has agreed to anything.\n\nI might be digressing, but the way I interpret the law was that if I track anything that can give insight into who the user is, that's bad. But if it's used for a purely frontend application for the website (eg a personal blog that may have a search backend, but the storage items aren't used for that), I don't have to worry so much? Esp if it's storage for things like color modes or positioning of navbar (left, right, up, down)?\n\nI guess what I'm getting at is what's a reasonable flow to be compliant at the same time as leveraging cookies so the site doesn't reset to vanilla and consent banner doesn't pop up *every* time the user visits?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, a site may check for a cookie indicating past consent before prompting for consent to read and store cookies\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen people speak of the \"Cookie law\" they usually mean the [ePrivacy Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002), (ePD) more formally the **Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC**. The full text of the directive is [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:en:HTML)\n\nFirst of all, being a directive and not a regulation, the ePD is not itself legally binding. Instead it instructs the legislatures of member states to implement it, which they generally have done. So the actual binding law is the law of a particular country, which could vary from the wording of the directive. However, in this case, my understanding is that the implementations do not vary significantly. An updated and revised ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) has been proposed, which would replace the ePD and complement the GDPR. But there has been dispute over the proposed terms of the ePR, and it has not yet been passed.\n\nArticle 5 section (3\\) of the ePD reads:\n\n> 3. Member States shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, *inter alia* about the purposes of the processing, and is offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller. This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out or facilitating the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user.\n\nNotice that this covers both writing (storing) and reading (gaining access to) cookies **and** other information stored on a user's device. Cookies ar one form of such locally stored information (LSI).\n\nNote that the GDPR, which replaces Directive 95/46/EC, is used to define \"consent\" in the ePD.\n\nIn general, one must have consent to read or store, and consent must be sought only when the user has been given \"clear and comprehensive information ... about the purpose\" of the stored information. The relevant exception for this question is that information (including cookies) which is \"strictly necessary\" to provide a service specifically requested by the user.\n\nHere the user has requested access to the web site, and may have previously agreed to accept cookies. The site must prompt for consent if the user has not previously consented (and the site will store cookies not strictly needed), and should not if the user has. Therefore, it is strictly necessary to check for and read if present a cookie indicating that such consent has previously been granted. If such a cookie is not found, no consent has been granted.\n\nStrictly required LSI should not have a dual purpose where one purpose is not strictly needed. For example, an \"I accept cookies\" cookie should not also be used for tracking. That should be done (if at all) with a separate cookie, and only after consent is received.\n\nNote that there should be an easily found and easily used method or link on the site (preferably on each page of the site) to review the purposes of stored or accessed LSI, and to withdraw previous consent. If consent is withdrawn, the cookie indicating that consent has been granted should be erased, as should any cookies or other LSI not strictly needed to provide the services requested by the user.\n\nKeep in mind that the legal distinction is not between cookies that contain \"technical\" information and those that do not. That is not relevant. Nor is the distinction between cookies that might be used to identify a person and those that do not. The legal distinction is between cookies (or other LSI) that are strictly needed to provide the services requested by the user, and all other LSI. Strictly needed LSI does not require consent, all other LSI does.\n\nFor example, a random string, used to determine the number of unique visitors, but not linked to any identifying info about the user, does not help to identify an individual user. But it is not strictly needed, so it can only be stored with consent.\n\nData that are associated with an identifiable natural person (human being, not a firm or organization), are governed by the GDPR (where it applies). There must be a lawful basis for processing such data, which includes reading them from LSI, and storing them. Consent is one of the six possible bases for such processing, but consent need not be obtained if another lawful basis applies. When consent is the basis, it must be easily withdrawn by the user. Note that this applies to **all** data (PI) that is associated with a person, not just data that can readily be used to identify the person (PII).\n\nNote that other workflows are also lawful. For one example, if a site is a strictly membership site, it could prompt for a login before reading or storing any LSI, and then read previous preferences stored on the server by that user to determine whether consent for cookies has been granted.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nA cookie indicating that consent to access and store cookies hs previously been given by a particular user can lawfully be read before a user is prompted for consent, under the ePD and its implementing laws.",

Change insurance policy from CA to MD\n2. Get a MD drivers license\n3. Get a vehicle safety inspection test\n4. Get MD title and registration\n\nIn order to title and register my car I need a MD drivers license first. When I get this they will take my CA drivers license from me. Between receiving my MD drivers license and registering my car, will I be able to use my car with CA plates? If I get pulled over on CA plates and present a MD license, is this a problem?\n\nI understand that getting a license and registering a car are separate things, but I want to be sure I can legally use my car as I switch from CA to MD.\n\nFor context, I'm originally from the UK and have been in the US for 2 years, so I am not fully familiar with changing states. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have nothing to worry about. Your driver's license is only \"connected\" to your vehicle registration insofar as it is a valid form of identification proving your address in order to register your vehicle in many states. It is mainly used by states as a way of verifying that you actually *live in* that state. They generally don't want to register vehicles to people who don't live there.\n\n**Side note:** Not all states actually *require* a license to register a vehicle, but rather just proof of address. When you get a license, proof of address is a requirement in order to get the license, which transitively makes your license *also* proof of address since it was verified in order to obtain the license. There are some legitimate reasons why a person might register a vehicle *without* actually having a driver's license, and few states actively forbid the practice. The catch is that you'll have a much more difficult time getting an insurance company to issue you a policy when you're unlicensed in the state, and most states require auto insurance in order to register the vehicle.\n\nAt any point, you can surrender your driver's license and your vehicle registration will remain active until its own expiration date. You just won't be able to renew it without getting a new license. This is essentially what you're doing by getting a driver's license in Maryland \\- you are surrendering your California license to Maryland, and Maryland will notify California that you've done that so California can invalidate your license there.\n\nSo moving to a new state, your old vehicle registration continues to be valid from that state until its set date of expiration, *regardless* of what current license you have, until the state is notified otherwise. A police officer will think nothing of an out\\-of\\-state plate combined with an in\\-state license (or even vice versa), so long as both are currently valid.\n\n**What you need to worry about:** Most states have their own laws that require you to re\\-register your vehicle under that state within a set amount of time after you've moved (usually between 30 and 90 days), regardless of how much time is left on your out\\-of\\-state vehicle registration. **In Maryland, that grace period is 60 days.** So don't worry about your California registration \\- just make sure you get your car registered with Maryland within 60 days of your move and you're set.\n\nOnce your vehicle is registered in Maryland, you'll always want to contact the DMV in California about the registration. Some states require you to submit a form by mail claiming that you've moved, and some even require you to surrender your old license plates. The DMV will tell you what, if anything, you need to do after\\-the\\-fact.",

What judges are called this in the us and what other addresses are designated for judges?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes**\n\nAn American would spell it as \u201cyour honor,\u201d but yes, this is how we refer to all judges.\n\nThis is simply a custom that shows respect. There is no law or concrete fact I could cite that requires this; it is more of a \u201ctradition.\u201d But I have seen plenty of court proceedings (mostly on TV), and I can confirm that all judges, ranging from small claims court to the Supreme Court, are called \u201cYour honor.\u201d (The chief justice of the Supreme Court is sometimes addressed as \u201cChief Justice.\u201d) Googling articles about courtroom etiquette also mostly leads to people who agree with this.\n\nApparently, there are some countries where it is customary to say \u201cmy honor,\u201d or even something else altogether. Sometimes people from these countries immigrate to the US and continue using their local terminology in a US court. Although every judge is different, my perception is that most judges try to be inclusive of other cultures, and if whatever term they use is intended as a sign of respect, most judges will usually just interpret it as it was intended.",

This applies to judges in small claims courts, higher courts, and even the Supreme Court (though the Chief Justice may sometimes be addressed as \"Chief Justice\"). This form of address is a tradition that shows respect and is widely used in American courtrooms.

Instead, I leave it on my desk because I still have to deposit funds to cover the check. Unbeknownst to me, the landlord enters my apartment while I'm away, sees the check, assumes he should take it, attempts to cash it, and it bounces. Am I liable for writing a bad check? Is the landlord liable for theft?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll take Washington state law to be typical. [RCW 9a.56\\.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.060) is the criminal law governing rubber checks. Writing a check which you know at the time of drawing or delivering a check that has insufficient fund with *intent to defraud* is a crime. That's not the case here. It might appear to be [theft](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.020) on the part of the landlord, except that\n\n> In any prosecution for theft, it shall be a sufficient defense that:\n> (a) The property or service was appropriated openly and avowedly under\n> a claim of title made in good faith, even though the claim be\n> untenable\n\nThat is, he quite reasonably believed that it was intended for him (it *is* made out to him). As for civil liability, your \"liability\" arises from your contract with your bank, and unless you have a remarkable \"not my fault\" clause in the checking account agreement, you can't sue the bank to avoid the overdraft fees (except if bank breaches a promise to not cash a postdated check until the date written on the check, and the check is dated for some time after the check was deposited). You might attempt to sue the landlord, since his action caused you harm: if his act was negligent. If the rent was already due and you were in arrears, the landlord's act of taking the check to apply to your rent obligation (thus saving you from rent late fees) is what a reasonable person would do. But if the check was for rent due a month in the future, a reasonable person would know that they are not owed the rent at this time, and it is highly unlikely that you intended to hand over the check right now: taking and depositing the check would be neglectful of the ordinary care that the landlord owes you as a tenant, and he could be found liable for the damage that he did.\n\nIt is suggested in a comment by Ryan M that violation of the [notice requirement](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.150) under the Residential Landlord\\-Tenant act negates a good faith defense. [State v. Hicks](http://courts.mrsc.org/supreme/102wn2d/102wn2d0182.htm), 102 Wn.2d 182 concludes that\n\n> \"Animus furandi\", or the intent to steal, is an essential element of\n> the crime of robbery\n> ...\n> the good faith claim of title defense negates the intent element of robbery\n\nNothing in the statutes or case law exists which demands completely clean hands in invoking a good faith defense. Use of force is illegal; but use of force in self defense is legal. The courts have not ruled that a person is deprived of that defense if they have committed a criminal act (landlord entering a residence is not a crime, it is a civil wrong), or if they have committed a tort act.",

You could say it is a hobby for me.\n\n**Context:** I was reading about 'mistake of law' defense on a website (I do not know how credible or outdated this website may be). In short, here is what they had to say \\-\n\n> \"Mistake of Law:\n>  A mistake involving the misunderstanding or incorrect application of law with regard to an act or transaction. The defense of mistake of law raises two issues. The first issue occurs where, because of a mistake of law, the\n>  defendant did not have the requisite intent to commit a crime. The\n>  second issue occurs where, because of a mistake of law, the defendant\n>  did not know that an act that he committed intentionally was criminal.\n>  It is important to understand the distinction between these two issues\n>  because, while mistake of law will usually be allowed as a valid\n>  defense in the former situation, it will generally not be allowed in\n>  the latter situation.\"\n\nIt had a quiz at the end so you could test yourself to see if you understood the subtle difference. I answered the first two questions correct, but only because there were similar examples in the article that set a precedent for how I answered. I have a few closely related questions regarding the two scenarios in the quiz, and the defense in general. I provide screenshots of the quiz below:\n\n[![Question1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wUdaA.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wUdaA.png)\n\n[![Question2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cq9wN.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cq9wN.png)\n\n**Analysis:** From the highlighted definition / explanation of 'mistake of law' defense above, and the green highlighted explanations in the pictures \\- this website is implying that the distinction between a successful application of mistake of law defense and unsuccessful mistake of law defense entirely boils down to 'requisite intent' \\- although they do not give a clear definition of this. My interpretation of the arguments for defense in the scenarios is as follows:\n\nArgument for Scenario 1:\n\n1. Defendant comes into possession of lost property.\n2. Defendant falsely believes that a law exists stating that if lost property is not claimed within two months finder gains ownership of lost property.\n3. Defendant waits two months.\n4. Because of the mistake, at this time defendant falsely believes lost property becomes defendants property.\n5. As defined in the question larceny requires the intention of permanently depriving an owner of their property.\n6. By (4\\) \\- at the time defendant made the transaction that would constitute permanently depriving plaintiff of ostensible property, defendant believed ownership was transferred to defendant.\n7. Defendant did not have intent to commit larceny\n8. By definition defendant is not guilty of larceny.\n\nArgument for Scenario 2:\n\n1. Defendant comes into possession of lost property.\n2. Defendant believes \"the law allows for someone to do whatever they want with lost property even if they know who the rightful owner is\".\n3. Defendant sells necklace \\- purposely and permanently depriving the owner of their property.\n4. By definition, defendant has committed larceny.\n\n> **Actual Questions:**\n> \n> \n> 1. In scenario 2, to say \"the law allows for someone to do whatever they want with lost property even if they know who the rightful owner\n>  is\" seems like a laymen way of saying the defendant believed that\n>  finders of lost property immediately acquired ownership. It also seems\n>  from the analysis that had this been the defendants statement \\- it\n>  would have been a 'successful' application of the defense. Is the\n>  wording of the defense the tipping point of what makes this an\n>  'unsuccessful' application?\n> 2. Both of these examples and scenarios are 'isolated' to help get a point across to a reader, that said \\- just because we have argued that\n>  defendant is not guilty *of larceny* in scenario 1, could the charge\n>  be adjusted to a crime that does not specifically require intent?\n>  Could a judge 'overrule' that defendants 'mistake' was 'unreasonable'?\n>  By the contrived example of scenario 1 it seems it would be a valid to\n>  defense to simply claim that every defendant thought a law existed\n>  that somehow removed their intent to commit the crime as defined, but\n>  surely this cannot be.\n> 3. No longer specific to the examples above, do mistake of law defenses actually occur in modern legal situations?\n\n**Closing Remarks:** Please note that I am new to this stack exchange community. I tried my best to keep my question on\\-topic as defined in the help page \\- but please feel free to offer advice regarding social norms of this community, e.g. feel free to tell me if my question is silly child's play and this community is for more serious questions. I also had a hard time choosing appropriate tags since 'legal defenses' is not a tag, please adjust as needed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. I don't think that's an accurate interpretation of the statement. The key difference between the two scenarios is the defendant's legal assessment of who owns the necklace. In the first he thinks he is the owner and can claim mistake of law; in the second, he he thinks someone else is the owner, so he cannot. To say he believes \"the law allows for someone to do whatever they want with lost property even if they know who the rightful owner is\" is very different from saying he thinks he's the owner. He doesn't think he's the legal owner, he just thinks he has legal rights that include some rights associated with ownership. \n\nSo if the defendant's statement had actually been, \"I thought I was the owner,\" that would have been a successful defense when the crime requires depriving the owner of the property. The defense was actually, \"I thought I was allowed to deprive the owner of the property,\" which is an admission of guilt when the crime requires depriving the owner of the property.\n2. There are a couple questions here:\n\n**a.** A different crime that did not require intent \\-\\- or even required a different kind of intent \\-\\- could still lead to a conviction. A legislature is free to define larceny differently, so it could say that anyone who recklessly or negligently deprives another of property is guilty. Or it could say that your state of mind doesn't matter and that depriving another of property is larceny regardless of intent. \n\n**b.** In most cases, the mistake of law defense requires that the defendant honestly believe in the mistake; unlike mistake of fact, it does not require that his belief also be reasonable. Either way, the question of reasonableness would probably be a question for a jury, so a judge wouldn't be able to reject it (except in a bench trial).\n\n**c.** Mistake of law is a potential defense to any crime that requires an intent to do something that requires an assessment of what the law is. So if it's illegal to intentionally have sex with a woman who is not your wife, and you mistakenly believed you were in a legal marriage, sex with your non\\-wife would not be a crime.\n\nIt has potentially very broad implications, but keep in mind that in many cases, the mistake a defendant would have to claim would be pretty far out there. If it were illegal to intentionally let anyone under 21 years old into your bar, I guess you *could* argue that you only let a 20\\-year\\-old in because you thought the law started calculating at conception, but I doubt you'll convince a jury.\n3. Mistake of law defenses still pop up pretty regularly. [Here's one just yesterday from the Tenth Circuit](https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/17/17-2008.pdf).

The Kansas case, though, uses the more modern definition of mistake of law, which also includes reasonable reliance on official statements from the government. In that case, the felon's parole officer had told him that it was OK to carry a pocketknife, but in reality, the law titled \"[Criminal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon](https://law.justia.com/codes/kansas/2014/chapter-21/article-63/section-21-6304)\" prohibited carrying knives, as well.",

See [CRS 18\\-8\\-610](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-18-criminal-code/co-rev-st-sect-18-8-610.html):\n\n> A person commits tampering with physical evidence if, believing that an official proceeding is pending or about to be instituted and acting without legal right or authority, he:\n> \n> \n> (a)\u2002Destroys, mutilates, conceals, removes, or alters physical evidence with intent to impair its verity or availability in the pending or prospective official proceeding;\n\nIf you cause a crash, you should certainly believe that you are going to be sued, and a lawsuit is definitely an official proceeding. And it sounds like your purpose in deleting the footage is to prevent it from being used in that lawsuit. So you'd be clearly guilty under this law. It is a class 6 felony, carrying a [sentence](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-18-criminal-code/co-rev-st-sect-18-1-3-401.html) of 12\\-18 months in prison and a fine of $1,000 to $100,000\\.\n\nIt may be counterintuitive, but [according to a law firm](https://www.shouselaw.com/co/defense/laws/tampering-with-physical-evidence/), a digital video would be considered physical evidence:\n\n> Physical evidence may include electronic records, videos, or audio recordings. This includes emails, text messages, social media messages, image files, video files, and computer files.\n\nIf you don't delete the video, it is likely to be demanded by the plaintiff during the *discovery* process so that it can be entered into evidence. Rule 37 of the [Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2019-court-rules.pdf) lists the *sanctions* that can be imposed if you refuse, such as:\n\n* charging you for legal fees incurred by the plaintiffs in trying to obtain it\n* assuming that the video proves whatever the plantiffs say it would show (e.g. that you were speeding, driving recklessly, etc)\n* entering a default judgment against you (the plaintiffs automatically win the suit, as if you had refused to show up in court)\n* holding you in contempt of court, which can lead to you being put in jail until you choose to comply, as well as fined.",

This crime carries a sentence of 12-18 months in prison and a fine ranging from $1,000 to $100,000. Digital video is considered physical evidence under this law.

I just signed a contract for an apartment **(APT1\\)**, which requires me to complete the entire payment (for 51 weeks).\n\nThe date I signed the contract (12 August) is actually later than the due date that appeared on the lease (8 August), so after signing the contract, the landlord's agent sent me an email that informed me of a new due date (25 August). However, I'm not ready to send such a big payment as I don't have enough money in my bank account. The agent told me they cannot hold my room too long due to the high volume of interest in booking the rooms.\n\nI actually wanted to give up my tenancy on this contract, as a just found another apartment **(APT2\\)** that has a more reasonable payment requirement. However, on my current signed tenancy letter it says:\n\n> Once you have signed this agreement you will be liable for the full rent set out in the agreement unless released from your tenancy by the Landlord or Management Company.\n\nMy question is do I have any legal responsibility to pay for the entire rent by the new due date (25 August) for **APT1**? If they told me they cannot hold my booking any longer, do I need them to confirm **in writing** that I'm released from the agreement? I emailed them with my request but haven't received a response.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Jurisdiction: [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")\n\nPreliminary issues\n------------------\n\nFirstly, as some of the comments have highlighted, this could be a scam. I have personally come across such a scam on two occassions. The scammer rents a property short term (e.g. 2\\-3 weeks) on AirBnB. They then pose as a landlord or letting agent and advertise the same property as a long term let. They collect a deposit and rent from any person who wants to be a tenant. They may even copy the keys and give each \"tenant\" a set. On move in day, you arrive at the property to find that you are not the only person trying to move boxes in.\n\nIt has always struck me that landlords are generally very careful to vet their tenants by checking ID, proof of address, obtaining references, and running credit checks. Yet tenants rarely do any vetting at all of their landlords.\n\nA very basic and easy check you can do is to purchase the **title register** (not title plan) for the property [from the Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/search-property-information-land-registry). This costs \u00a33 and will give you the name of the person who owns the property. If the property is an apartment then you will generally want the *leasehold* title register (not the freehold). Once you have the name, you can then ask your landlord to provide proof that they are that person.\n\nSecondly, you've tagged the question [united\\-kingdom](/questions/tagged/united-kingdom \"show questions tagged 'united-kingdom'\"), but the UK is actually comprised of multiple legal jurisdictions and housing law varies among them (particularly in Scotland). I'm answering this on the basis of [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\").\n\nThird, questions asking for legal advice on real situations are off\\-topic here. My answer will just address the general issues and shouldn't be taken as advice for your situation.\n\nContract and due dates\n----------------------\n\nThere is nothing in contract law which prevents obligations from arising *before* the date that the contract is agreed. It is not unusual for parties to draft contracts which govern past behaviour. In that sense, it is perfectly acceptable to agree a contract on 12 August which requires rent to have been paid on 8 August (albeit it would be inadvisable to agree such a contract as you would immediately be in breach if you had not already paid). On the other hand, a contract which purports to have been agreed on a date which is earlier than when it was actually agreed, can amount to fraud.\n\nI would be wary of a subsequent email which purports to allow a later due date which contradicts the contract. Unless there is a clause in the contract allowing for the landlord to postpone due dates, the email is unenforceable and your real due date is still 8 August. The attempt to change the due date is effectively a variation of the contract, and a variation which is not permitted in the contract itself needs to be executed as a second contract. That means you need all the elements of a contract: offer/acceptance, intention to be bound, and consideration. The problem here is the latter. The landlord is providing consideration (a later due date) but you are offering nothing in return.\n\nHolding the room\n----------------\n\n\"*The agent told me they cannot hold my room too long due to the high volume of interest in booking the rooms.*\"\n\n\"*Once you have signed this agreement you will be liable for the full rent set out in the agreement unless released from your tenancy by the Landlord or Management Company.*\"\n\nThese two positions are contradictory. If you agreed a tenancy (as implied by the second quote), then you have a contract which is legally binding on both parties. The first quote is incorrect \\- there is nothing to \"hold\" because the room is already yours.\n\nOn the other hand, it may be that what you agreed was a *holding deposit agreement* (rather than a tenancy agreement) which is merely a commitment on the part of the tenant to forfeit a sum of money (which by law [cannot exceed 1 week's rent](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/4/schedule/1/paragraph/3)) in the event that the tenant (as opposed to the landlord) decides not to proceed with the tenancy.\n\nThe wording from the second quote (liability for full rent) implies that it is a tenancy agreement rather than a holding deposit agreement. Or, in the alternative, that it is an illegal holding deposit agreement which asks for more money to be forfeited than is lawful.\n\nYou'll need to read your full contract to understand what it is. If it's a tenancy agreement, it will be obvious from the wording that you have actually rented the property.\n\nObligation to pay rent\n----------------------\n\n\"*My question is do I have any legal responsibility to pay for the entire rent by the new due date (25 August) for APT1?*\"\n\nUnfortunately, if you have signed a tenancy agreement, then you are legally bound to fulfill your obligations under it (provided such obligations do not break the law). If it contains a clause stating that you must pay 51 weeks's rent, then that is what you must do.\n\n\"*If they told me they cannot hold my booking any longer, do I need them to confirm in writing that I'm released from the agreement?*\"\n\nAs a general rule of contract law, nothing needs to be in writing unless (a) the law requires it to be in writing or (b) the contract requires it to be in writing. You agree non\\-written contracts all the time when you go shopping, use the bus, etc. The same applies to taking actions which are governed by a pre\\-existing contract e.g. giving your taxi driver verbal directions once you are en\\-route.\n\nThe phrase \"*unless released from your tenancy by the Landlord or Management Company*\" says nothing about the release needing to be in writing; therefore it can be verbal (provided that there isn't another clause somewhere else in the contract which requires it to be in writing). Be aware however that verbal statements can be difficult to prove.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the student's legal obligations?\n\nA) The student has no legal responsibility to pay rent for APT1 because the contract was signed after the original due date.\n\nB) The student is legally bound to pay the full 51 weeks' rent for APT1 by August 25th, as per the agent's email.\n\nC) The student is legally bound to the original contract terms, including the August 8th due date, unless a proper contract variation is executed.\n\nD) The student can verbally cancel the agreement with the agent without any written confirmation, avoiding all rent obligations for APT1.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The original contract signed on August 12th is legally binding, including the August 8th due date. The agent's email attempting to change the due date to August 25th is not automatically enforceable, as it lacks consideration and may not constitute a proper contract variation. Without a clause in the original contract allowing for such changes or a properly executed contract variation, the original terms remain in effect. The student is bound by these terms unless released from the tenancy by the landlord or management company. Verbal agreements to cancel could be legally binding, but are difficult to prove, making written confirmation advisable."

Which holds, the original typed contract, or the contract with handwritten changes?\n\nJurisdiction is the UK.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The written document is given very high priority, so parties will be held to what is in the document. Both parties sign at the bottom, as a way of signalling their agreement with the terms specified in the document. If conditions are added or subtracted (by crossing out), especially with pre\\-printed forms, the \"customer\" (person who didn't write the contract) can initial such modifications, as a way of clearly signalling that they indeed agree to the deletion of such\\-and\\-such clause. Since both parties have a copy of the signed agreement, this is not strictly necessary. The potential issue would be that an unscrupulous person could cross out a clause after the contract was signed, and claimed that they aren't bound by that clause. A comparison of the two copies would then reveal that the unscrupulous person was attempting fraud. There is nothing special about handwriting in or crossing out conditions, except that it poses a potential evidentiary problem as to what exactly was agreed to, if for example one party threw away their copy and then maintained that the crossed\\-out clause had *not* been crossed out. (So, keep your copy).\n\nIn case you are proposing a scenario where one party is unaware of a change, i.e. at the very last minute Smith crosses something out and signs it, and Jones did not see that happen, then both copies would be the same and Jones would be legally bound to what's in the paper. Smith *should* announce to Jones that a clause was being deleted. We might suppose that there are innocent reasons why Smith made changes without making an announcement to Jones, in which case the parties do not have an agreement. There may be amicable ways to deal with that situation, but push could come to shove, in which case the written form of the document is generally taken to be the most important piece of evidence (though not always the *only* admissible evidence, unless you're in Colorado, Florida or Wisconsin).",

A week later, the landlord claims the original clause is still valid. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The original typed clause is valid because handwritten changes are not legally binding.\nB) The crossed-out clause is invalid, but only if the tenant can prove the landlord saw the change before signing.\nC) The crossed-out clause is invalid, as the signed document with visible alterations represents the agreed-upon terms.\nD) The contract is void due to the unilateral modification by the tenant.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the UK, the written document holds very high priority in contract law. When both parties sign a contract with visible alterations (such as crossed-out clauses), it's generally understood that they are agreeing to the document as it appears at the time of signing. The tenant's act of crossing out the clause and initialing it, followed by both parties signing the entire document, indicates mutual agreement to the modified terms. The landlord's signature on the altered document implies acceptance of the changes, even if they weren't explicitly discussed. It's the responsibility of both parties to review the document before signing. Option A is incorrect because handwritten changes can be valid if agreed upon. Option B is unnecessary; the landlord's awareness is implied by their signature on the altered document. Option D is too extreme; a modification agreed to by both parties doesn't void the entire contract."

Even short samples will generally be infringing.\n\nThe leading case is *Heim v. Universal Pictures Co.* 154 F.2d 480 (2nd Cir. 1946\\) in which one of the intermediate U.S. Courts of Appeals held that infringement could be proven if \"a single brief phrase, contained in both pieces, was so idiosyncratic in its treatment as to preclude coincidence,\" and is not instead a copy of an indistinguishable snippet of music that is in the public domain.\n\nThe lower threshold is probably that the sample needs to be long enough for a human listener to discern that it is a sample of some particular recognizable copyrighted work, if the listener is familiar with the original work.\n\nThe speed of the sample and the distinctiveness of the sampled material would influence this determination.\n\nA single generic middle C on an ordinary piano held for a whole note at an allegro pace might not qualify as an infringement. A very distinctive three note sequence with a very distinctive vocal or sound quality in a fast tempo piece might be only a fraction of a second long and still be infringing.\n\n> The specific use case I'm interested in involves build a database of\n> audio samples for a musical algorithm (e.g., detection of genre or\n> mood) with the intention of later distribution of the database.\n\nThe hard and close question, in my mind, is not the size of the individual audio samples, but whether the form in which the samples are used is sufficient to constitute an infringement of one of the specific sticks in the bundles of rights that come with a copyright (e.g. reproduction, distribution, performance, derivate works) that is protected by a copyright. In other words, is an audio clip that is buried as part of training set data for an app that only an IT professional can access with a device other than the one upon which it would be typically used really distribution of a copy, or a performance, or a derivative work.\n\nThe implication of this description of the proposed activity is that a user of the software can't actually listen to any of the audio samples, which simply constitute a training data set for a machine learning process.\n\nWhile copyright is broader than simply a right to prevent someone from commercially appropriating the value imparted by the creative innovations of the original work (e.g. copyright can be used to prohibit a charitable or free distribution of a copyrighted work), copyright law is also interpreted in light of its purposes. And, the primary purpose of copyright law is to prevent the commercial or non\\-commercial appropriation of the original work without permission from the author (or a mandatory license to perform one's own cover version of an original musical composition for a fee set by an administrative agency), and is interpreted in that light.\n\nThe value of this software to its users doesn't seem to meaningfully implicate this interest since the user doesn't benefit from any one particular individual work, so it isn't obvious to me that audio samples used in this manner are infringing.\n\nThe safer course of action, however, would be to do the machine learning process from the audio samples before distributing that software, and to include only the sound processing model that flows from that machine learning process, rather than the training set data of audio clips themselves, in the distributed product. To allow users to understand the training set and its influence on the end machine learning product, the software could be distributed with a bibliography citing to all of the works from which audio clips were taken that were used in the training data with pinpoint citations to the portions of the cited works from which audio clips were used.",

Even very short samples can be infringing if they are distinctive enough.\n\nOption B is flawed because even less distinctive parts of a song can be protected by copyright, and 1-second samples might still be long enough to be recognizable.\n\nOption C is problematic because the threshold for infringement is not solely based on human recognition, and this approach still involves distributing portions of copyrighted works.\n\nOption D is the safest approach.

The possibilities of consent by poster seem infinite.\n\nOr, although I've seen posters like this for at least 5\\-6 years (one back then was in a business location open to most of the public), has this never been tested in court and is the poster system probably not a valid substitute for a signature, even for mentally competent English\\-fluent adults not in a rush and allowing that certain contexts wouldn't allow it (e.g., civil court settlements and plea bargains couldn't rely on the poster system)?\n\nOr if you didn't have a reason to read the poster (surely no one has to read every writing that's visible) and simply walked through the area in question without reading it you're not bound by it but someone who did happen to read it must accept its terms?\n\nIf the geographical boundaries are unclear so that reading the poster gives you no clear remedy by walking away, does that change the law on the validity of consent by poster?\n\nWebsite terms often say that using the website constitutes consent to the terms and often reading the terms to discover this requires using the website before you start reading, but I doubt that's legal consent, but maybe consent will be found after you've read them and didn't try to revoke consent, e.g., by not using the site any longer.\n\nIn the United States, this all might well vary by state and may depend on common law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I gather that the numerous ramifications you outline are merely contexts and that your main concern is about the application of contract law (contract law in the U.S. does not really vary among states). Thus, I will not really delve in the intricacies of \\-\\-for instance\\-\\- privacy or copyright issues arising from the commercial use of a person's likeness that you mention in one of the scenarios.\n\nAs a starting point, one needs to bear in mind that:\n\n1. a contract is an exchange of considerations under terms and conditions entered *knowingly and willfully* by the parties, which can be evidenced by the parties' *subsequent conduct* (that is, not just by signing a document); and\n2. a contract is unenforceable if it contravenes public policy and/or the *covenant of good faith and fair dealing*.\n\nAccordingly, the questions are (1\\) whether a person knew or *reasonably* should have known about the terms \\& conditions at or by the time of those events which trigger obligations pursuant to the contract; and (2\\) whether the provisions therein are unreasonable, illegal, or tantamount to a penalty, especially in the event that the party breaches or repudiates the alleged contract (see the *[Restatement (Second) of Contracts](https://www.nylitigationfirm.com/files/restat.pdf) at \u00a7 356(2\\)*).\n\nThe scenario of *house for sale* entails various difficulties as per contract law and otherwise. Here are some of those issues:\n\n* Are visitors properly (including \"beforehand\") notified about the \"walkway clause\"? If not, the contract is void because it cannot be said that visitors knew about \\& accepted that condition.\n* Does the house provide alternatives for lawful \\& informed visitors to safely avoid the walkway? If not, then the seller/owner might end up incurring *premises liability* with respect to those visitors who get injured in making their reasonable effort not to trigger the \"walkway clause\".\n* Is the house owner realistically able to prove that use of the walkway by lawful \\& informed visitors is sufficiently \"*inconsistent with the offeror's ownership of offered property*\" so that triggering a house sale is a reasonable consequence (see *Restatement* at \u00a769(2\\))?\n* Is the owner\\-imposed mortgage rate compliant with state law pertaining to granting of credit \\& loans?\n\nThese exemplify only some of the burdensome complications when trying to enforce \"contracts\" which are extravagant or quite one\\-sided.\n\nLastly, as a side note, the presumption that \n\n> a person reading the poster and walking in the intended area does not thereby receive consideration\n\nis not necessarily accurate. As an example, the \"intended area\" could have been devised by an entity in the business of enjoyment and recreation, such as a private park. The person who deliberately walks in (regardless of whether he read the poster) certainly receives a consideration, which is the amusement or recreation for which the park was designed.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company puts up a poster on a public sidewalk stating that by walking in the area, individuals consent to the commercial use of their likeness without payment. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal validity of this \"consent by poster\" approach?\n\nA) The poster creates a binding contract for all individuals who walk in the area, regardless of whether they read it or not.\n\nB) The poster is only binding for those who read it and continue to walk in the area, as this demonstrates their acceptance of the terms.\n\nC) The poster is likely not legally enforceable as it lacks key elements of a valid contract, such as mutual consideration and clear boundaries.\n\nD) The poster is enforceable only if the company has video evidence of individuals reading it before entering the area.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement. The \"consent by poster\" approach likely lacks legal enforceability for several reasons:\n\n1. Lack of consideration: As mentioned in the passage, there is no clear exchange of consideration between the company and the individuals walking in the area.\n\n2. Absence of knowing and willful agreement: People may not have a reason to read every poster they encounter, and simply walking in a public area does not necessarily imply consent to terms they may be unaware of.\n\n3. Unclear boundaries: If the geographical limits of the \"consent area\" are not clearly defined, it becomes difficult for individuals to knowingly avoid or accept the terms.\n\n4. Potential conflict with public policy: Such broad claims to commercial rights without clear consent may conflict with privacy laws and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.\n\n5. Lack of alternatives: If this is posted on a public sidewalk with no clear alternative route, it may be seen as an unreasonable imposition on public access.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they assume too much enforceability for this type of notice. Option D is incorrect because video evidence, while potentially helpful, does not inherently make the terms enforceable if other elements of a valid contract are missing."

And they have to file appeals while serving their sentence. Is the converse not true, i.e. if the judge finds someone not guilty and the government appeals, then doesn't the person contest the appeal as a free person?\n\n1 Of her 24 previous extradition hearings, Vanessa Baraitser [ordered extradition](https://theintercept.com/2020/10/06/julian-assange-trial-extradition/) in 23\\.  \n\n2 Vanessa Baraitser is overseen by Emma Arbuthnot who has refused to formally recuse herself despite family [connections to people cited for criminal activities](https://theintercept.com/2020/10/06/julian-assange-trial-extradition/) in documents published by WikiLeaks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two reasons for jail:\n\n* Applying the sentence\n* Denying the accused the opportunity of fleeing, destroying evidence or doing the same felonies again.\n\nThe last part is always a difficult one, as the accused has still not received a veredict but has his rights severely curtailed. In general it is intended as a last ditch measure, and the circumstances of the case must be considered.\n\nIn this case, after Assange spent several years holed in at Ecuador's embassy in the UK, and given that he did not surrender himself voluntarily, it is not that unreasonable to believe that he would try again to flee, as the matter is not still settled and he is still at risk of being extradited.\n\nI do not know about England, but in some countries (e.g. Spain) if you are kept in preventive custody but later found to be innocent you are automatically entitled to an indemnity.\n\nAlso, for the larger question, that is not true either at least in some countries. After a guilty veredict a judge may postpone incarceration while appeals are reviewed (again considering things like flight risks). Of course, if you have condemned someone who has not been given bail due to being considered too risky, they remain in jail during the process.\n\nAlso `Presumably, his jail term began immediately upon sentencing`. In many jurisdictions, the time served before the sentence is counted towards the sentence. If you spent 4 weeks in jail before the sentence, you have already passed 4 weeks of your sentence.\n\nIf the time already spent is close to the time you would have been sentenced, the sentence specifies that you are condemned \"to time served\" and released immediately.",

This was because he was being held pending extradition hearings. The key reason for this continued detention was the concern that he might attempt to flee, given his history of seeking asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy for several years to avoid extradition. \n\nOption A is incorrect because his continued detention was not illegal, but rather a preventive measure. Option C is incorrect as there's no mention of additional sentences related to WikiLeaks. Option D is also incorrect as there's no indication that Assange voluntarily chose to remain in prison.\n\nThe answer illustrates the concept of preventive custody, where an individual may be held in detention even without a final verdict if there are significant concerns about flight risk or potential interference with the legal process."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I would like to know if there is legal precedent protecting the freedom of speech in distributing an open letter or something similar.\n\nA friend owns a unit in a condominium, and since day one she has been subjected to random fines and hostility from certain neighbors. The condominium is managed by a private company, and the manager finds every opportunity and every excuse to slap fines on her, for all kinds of random things that she didn't do. She tried and fought back by filing complaints with fair housing organizations, but it has had little effect. The management company retracted some fines but still shows express hate and hostility toward her and fines her whenever they can.\n\nMy friend has requested a meeting with the HOA board many times in email to the manager, which have all been ignored or denied. Then an extremely discriminatory and hateful thing against her happened. With her access to the board blocked, she had no choice but to write an open letter to other residents, asking for their help, and leave the letters at their doors. A few weeks later the management company found out and slapped her with several other fines, claiming her act of distributing an open letter constituted a violation. (Funny thing is the section they cited in the Condominium Bylaw in regard to the violation doesn't even exist.)\n\nAre open letters protected under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution? Are there other specific clauses on the federal and/or state level that are relevant in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **No.**\n\nIt is an often repeated misconception that \"Freedom of Speech\" means that no one can restrict speech ever. This is not the case. Let us look at the US Consitution's First Admendment, which contains the \"Freedom of Speech\" clause:\n\n> **Congress shall make no law** ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\nAs one can see, the First Amendment only restricts government actions. (It also stops other branches of government from restricting speech, because those branches are innately weak with very few powers granted to them by the constitution; the majority of executive or judicial branches powers are granted to them by a law passed by Congress, and Congress cannot give a power to another party that they do not possess).\n\nA Home Owner Association (HOA) is not a government or government agency; it is a private organization (and it is not the same as the \"private management company\" that manages the condominium, which is probably in the employ of the HOA; which also means that emailing the manager is not emailing the HOA board). Their power stems from a contract, one that your friend signed when they bought the property (one of the conditions agreed to is that a member who sells or gifts their HOA\\-member property can only do so to someone who also agrees to the contract).\n\nThat said, HOAs can be horribly abusive and many states have laws that restrict what kinds of rules and penalties can be applied by an HOA. But that is not a constitutional matter (at either the Federal or State level), nor a question of \"Freedom of Speech\", but rather a limitation on the kinds of behaviors that can be enforced by contract.",

HOAs derive their authority from contractual agreements with property owners, not from governmental power. While there may be state laws that limit certain HOA practices, these are separate from constitutional protections. The First Amendment does not directly apply to private entities like HOAs, allowing them to potentially restrict certain forms of speech or communication within their communities through agreed-upon rules and bylaws."

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the scope and potential implications of this provision?\n\nA) This provision exclusively applies to EU diplomatic missions and consular positions in non-EU countries.\n\nB) This provision allows the EU to unilaterally expand GDPR's jurisdiction to any country without limitations.\n\nC) This provision applies to areas like diplomatic missions and potentially allows for future expansion of GDPR's scope, based on the Lotus principle in international law.\n\nD) This provision automatically extends GDPR's jurisdiction to all countries that have diplomatic relations with EU member states.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate and comprehensive answer. The provision indeed applies to places like diplomatic missions and consular positions, as explicitly mentioned in the GDPR's recitals. However, it goes beyond just these specific examples. The answer also correctly references the Lotus principle from international law, which potentially allows for future expansion of the GDPR's scope. This principle states that a country (or in this case, the EU) can claim extra-territorial jurisdiction as long as there's no explicit prohibition in international law. \n\nOption A is too narrow, as it limits the application only to diplomatic missions and consulates, ignoring the potential for broader application. Option B is overly broad and ignores the constraints of international law. Option D is incorrect as it suggests an automatic and overly broad application that isn't supported by the actual text or interpretation of the GDPR."

The correct course of action would be to contact animal control or appropriate authorities to have the elephant removed and properly cared for, likely in a zoo or sanctuary.

I always thought that this version was a fiction, but a quick search brings it up on Wikipedia and on LegalZoom.\n\nI have seen plenty of alternate versions online, such as \"can **and may**\", which seems plausible, or the simple \"can\", which also seems reasonable.\n\nBut on what basis can one say \"can *and will*\" when the officer doesn't yet know the contents of what the interrogated party might say? Have we explicitly encoded nonsense into an important legal statement?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [holding of the Miranda decision](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/384/436/) says:\n\n> (d) In the absence of other effective measures, the following\n>  procedures to safeguard the Fifth Amendment privilege must be\n>  observed: the person in custody must, prior to interrogation, be\n>  clearly informed that he has the right to remain silent, and that\n>  *anything he says will be used against him in court*; he must be clearly informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to\n>  have the lawyer with him during interrogation, and that, if he is\n>  indigent, a lawyer will be appointed to represent him\n\nThe body of the opinion also says\n\n> The warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied by the\n>  explanation that anything said can and *will be* used against the\n>  individual in court.\n\nalthough also\n\n> He must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to\n>  remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a\n>  court of law\n\nWhen SCOTUS says do this, that is the law. Since SCOTUS say can, will, and can and will, the only safe course of action is to say can and will.\n\n[This page](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/plain_language/articles/mandatory/) has some interesting discussion about the problem of the meaning of modals in a legal context. The Miranda warning does not constitute a contractual promise between the arresting officer and the arrestee, so \"will\" cannot be construed as a binding promise to prosecute and use the evidence in court. \"Will\" can only be construed as a prediction, as do \"may\" and \"might\". If the warning said \"can, and mightmay be used against you\", that choice or wording would suggest that the probability of statements being used against you is low \u2013 that would be totally misleading. The strongest modal should be used, because the probability is high that some statement will indeed be used against the person. Simply saying \"can\" suggests that it's a mere possibility, as opposed to a probability. \"Can and will\" is thus the appropriate construction for conveying the *probability* that your confession will be used against you.\n\n\"Shall\" shall not be used (it is confusing since it doesn't mean what the legal profession sometimes thinks it means); \"must\" is just plain wrong (it's legally meaningless to say \"anything you say must be used against you\", when many things that a person says would be inadmissible).",

With this service, clients could request that I transcribe a song (or parts of a song) for them in exchange for a fee. I would then send the client a PDF version of my transcription.\n\nFrom my understanding, it is illegal when you sell or give away any derivative form of a copyrighted song (including sheet music). With this service, I do not intend to publish or sell sheet music. I would merely create the transcription, and give it to the client that requested it for a fee. \n\nI understand it is perfectly legal to transcribe a song you purchased yourself, as long as it is for personal use. Does this become copyright infringement when someone else pays you to transcribe a song they've purchased, and this person is the only one who will get the transcription? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not \"perfectly legal\" to transcribe music for personal use. It is pretty likely that you can get away with it. The first thing to understand is that the act of transcribing is the creation of a derivative work (see the [definitions part of Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101)). The core protection is [section 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106), which states that the owner of copyright has the exclusive right to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work. So it is not permitted to prepare derivative works, e.g. transcriptions, without permission from the copyright owner. There is a big however: [section 107](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107) provides a possible loophole, \"fair use\". If you were to be sued for violation of copyright in making an unauthorized derivative work, your attorney might well advise you to set forth a fair use defense. This [question and answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/7683/4501) summarizes the basics of the fair use defense. Probably the most important factor would be the 4th factor, the effect on market \\-\\- in the circumstance that you describe, the effect is likely to be low. If you do this as a paid service for others and not just for personal amusement, then a fair use defense becomes a stretch.",

According to copyright law, transcribing music is considered creating a derivative work, which is an exclusive right of the copyright owner. While personal transcription for one's own use might potentially be defended under fair use, offering this as a paid service to others would likely be seen as copyright infringement. The service involves creating unauthorized derivative works (transcriptions) for profit, which goes beyond the scope of fair use and infringes on the rights of copyright holders. Neither the clients' ownership of the original songs (A) nor the personal use by individual clients (B) would make this service legal without permission from copyright owners. Transcribing only portions of songs (D) doesn't resolve the fundamental issue of creating unauthorized derivative works for profit."

Start of the semester, I had to shell out about 100 bucks for the privilege of being able to access the course I already paid for. Part of the 3rd party software is testing that requires yet another browser extension for proctoring tests. One feature that this plugin has that the college\\-provided testing platform does not is that if it thinks you are attempting to exit the full screen proctoring page, after 30 seconds of continued attempts it will lock you out and end the exam.\n\nThe issue: I was taking my final on my family computer which I have taken other proctored tests on before without issue, and when I was mostly done, a pop\\-up windows notification came up, putting the window out of full screen. The page and computer froze since the laptop is not high end, and by the time it unfroze, 30 seconds had passed and the exam was closed. I emailed my instructor about it immediately, requesting that it be reopened, but the next morning I got a reply that it could not be reopened without resetting all progress on the exam, which was not an option.

The original creator's absence and lack of involvement in Alice's derivative work means they likely can't enforce the license for Alice's version.\nC) Correct. As the creator of the derivative work, Alice owns the copyright to her improvements and additions. She has the right to enforce the GPL license for her version of the software.\nD) Incorrect. The abandonment of the original project doesn't negate the rights of those who create derivative works based on it.\n\nThe key point is that there are now two separate works: the original abandoned project and Alice's derivative work. Alice, as the copyright holder of her derivative work, has the right to enforce the GPL license for her version if it's violated, such as in Bob's case."

While posted signs can serve as a warning, they don't offer the same level of proof that the customer has been informed and has consented to the risks involved. A signed document demonstrates that the individual has read (or at least had the opportunity to read) and agreed to the terms, making it more difficult for them to claim ignorance of the risks later. Option A is incorrect because signed waivers are not legally required in all jurisdictions, as evidenced by the example of European gyms. Option B, while potentially true, is not the primary legal reason for preferring signed waivers. Option D is incorrect because posted signs can be admissible as evidence, though they may carry less weight than a signed document."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Alice's potential copyright infringement?\n\nA) Alice is definitely infringing copyright by possessing the encrypted version of the software.\nB) Alice is not infringing copyright as long as she never decrypts or uses the software.\nC) Alice is only infringing copyright if the encryption method she used is weak and can be easily broken.\nD) Alice may not be infringing copyright by mere possession, but the encrypted version could be used as evidence of infringement if other factors are present.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Mere possession of copyrighted material, even in encrypted form, does not itself constitute copyright infringement. Copyright law does not prohibit possession of unauthorized copies, nor does it grant copyright holders an exclusive right to possession. However, the encrypted version could potentially be used as evidence of infringement if other factors suggest Alice copied the work without authorization. The encryption doesn't change the copyright analysis, but it might make investigation more challenging. \n\nOption A is incorrect because possession alone is not infringement. Option B is also incorrect; while not using the software might make infringement less likely to be detected, it doesn't guarantee non-infringement if other evidence of copying exists. Option C is incorrect because the strength of encryption is irrelevant to copyright infringement analysis."

The [UK](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=089cfa18-2549-4123-b89c-7032a32a0364) is one example where certain circumstances can lead to criminal liability for directors of a firm in the event of a breach. \n\nThat said, your company should care.

Can I expect trouble if I make an electronic copy available on my blog?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Factual assumptions\n-------------------\n\nohwilleke's answer is entirely correct. However, it makes factual assumptions based on the standard meaning of \"journal\" and \"author\", which I believe to be unwarranted. From the question, it seems likely that we are talking about a *scientific paper*, which operates under a [very different economic and legal model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_journal).\n\nI am going to assume that:\n\n* the authors sent a draft of the paper, the *preprint*, to the journal editor;\n* the journal editor sent the draft to external experts (the *reviewers*); those reviewers, and possibly the editor, gave some feedback;\n* the authors modified their draft based on that feedback to produce the final version;\n* throughout all this, the authors, editor and reviewers agreed with the journal\u2019s policies;\n* the journal policies require a transfer of copyright to the *publisher*, a legal entity that \"owns\" large number of journals and provides some technical services (article typesetting, maintenance of a web site with the journal contents, maintenance of DOIs, etc.);\n* neither the authors, nor the editor, nor the reviewers received monetary compensation for their work (this is a key economic difference from non\\-academic journals, but as we shall see, it has little legal effect)\n\nIn theory, all depends on the copyright release agreement\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen the author(s) submit a draft to a journal, they have to click through an agreement to release copyright. Such a clause could, in theory, be anything the authors and the publisher agreed that does not violate contract law. In practice, because the publishers are a small oligopoly, the agreements are more or less standardized.\n\nThe \"sample publishing agreement\" given as example at <https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright> (as downloaded on March 2, 2023\\) is more or less representative:\n\n> I hereby assign to the Copyright Owner the copyright in the manuscript identified above (where Crown Copyright is asserted, authors agree to grant\n> an exclusive publishing and distribution license) and any tables, illustrations or other material submitted for publication as part of the manuscript (the\n> \u201cArticle\u201d). This assignment of rights means that I have granted to the Copyright Owner the exclusive right to publish and reproduce the Article, or any\n> part of the Article, in print, electronic and all other media (whether now known or later developed), in any form, in all languages, throughout the world,\n> for the full term of copyright, and the right to license others to do the same, effective when the Article is accepted for publication. This includes the\n> right to enforce the rights granted hereunder against third parties.\n\nThe authors are the sole intellectual contributors to the preprint version, but a copyright release agreement could still bar them from publishing it. The vast majority of agreements between novel authors and publishing houses forbid the author from selling the book rights to another publisher or posting drafts of the novel on the author\u2019s website (two actions that would result in greatly diminished sales for the publisher).\n\nThe published version incorporate revisions where the reviewers and possibly the editor contributed significant intellectual contributions. Again, all depends on the copyright agreement \\- the publisher terms could in theory require that the reviewers and editors release their contribution under an irrevocable license to the authors. In practice, all goes to the publisher.\n\nThe financial structure is irrelevant\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe fact that authors (and reviewers, and editors) are not paid by the publisher is irrelevant. Yes, a contract (in [common\\-law](/questions/tagged/common-law \"show questions tagged 'common-law'\") countries) requires consideration from both sides; however, consideration needs not be monetary.\n\nThere is not much doubt that publication of an article is \"consideration\", at the very least because that is considered prestigious among a significant fraction of the population. In addition, there is ample evidence that funding agencies and university HR staff evaluate and promote scientists based primarily on the papers they publish in scientific journals.\n\nIn practice, preprint rules are lax\n-----------------------------------\n\n[The vast majority of academic publishers allow authors to publish the preprint version](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_academic_publishers_by_preprint_policy) although conditions vary (only the preprint, only on a personal website, only for a limited time, only after some embargo period, only if you cite the final article with the correct DOI, etc.).\n\nI would speculate that this is the result of cultural pressure. Many academics decided to post their articles (sometimes the preprint before sumbission, sometimes the published version) on the internet without much regard to pesky questions of copyright law, because they viewed publishers as gatekeeping greedy monopolistic parasites. The publishers decided to embrace the practice in order to be able to put some limits on it, rather than try to mass\\-fire lawsuits against the people who provided them with free labor.\n\nRegardless of whether that speculation is correct, the current arrangement is not the inevitable result of legal rules, and publishers could conceivably decide to change their preprint sharing policies at any moment.\n\nLimitations to the copyright of research papers\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nThis section is quite obviously not exhaustive, but given that the original question does not specify a jurisdiction, I\u202fdid not search beyond what I already know.\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), works produced by employees of the federal government as part of their work duties are generally public domain ([17 U.S. Code \u00a7 105](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105); do note that subsection (b) means certain works produced by certain institutions still are under copyright). Hence, if the authors were both researchers at a federal research institution, the preprint is public domain and can be republished irrespective of the publisher\u2019s will. (I am led to believe, however, that most US researchers are *not* employees of the federal governments, but rather of private or state universities.)\n\nIn [europe](/questions/tagged/europe \"show questions tagged 'europe'\"), as a result of public pressure against publishers (see \"greedy monopolistic parasites\", above), the European Commission published non\\-binding guidelines ([2012/417/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32012H0417)) asking that\n\n> there should be open access to publications resulting from publicly funded research as soon as possible, preferably immediately and in any case no later than 6 months after the date of publication, and 12 months for social sciences and humanities\n\nThat (non\\-binding) recommendation has been adopted with varying adaptations in various EU countries. The exact implementation in a given country should be checked before relying on it. For instance, in France, [article L533\\-4 du code de la Recherche](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033205794/2016-10-09) allows authors (after the six or twelve months embargo period) to post the published version (not just the preprint), irrespective of what what signed with the publisher, as long as at least half of the funding for the research came from public funds.\n\nI will assume neither of those apply.\n\nThe copyright owner is likely still around\n------------------------------------------\n\nAcademic journals are born and die regularly. However, academic *publishers* rarely do (Elsevier is almost 150 years old).\n\nAs ohwilleke says, the copyright release contract signed 40\u202fyears ago is likely still valid; even if the publisher folded, it would apply to the publisher\u2019s legal successor. (The question of how legal rights are liquidated in a bankruptcy would be an interesting question that I am not competent to answer; it is plausible that under certain circumstances the contract would be dissolved.)\n\nIf the authors can access the copyright release they signed back when they submitted the article, you might be able to determine that posting the preprint or the final article is acceptable. (I realize that this is a fairly ludicrous hypothetical, given that the paper was published 40\u202fyears ago.)\n\nOtherwise, it is extremely likely that the publisher would be able to sue, even if the publication occurs with the authors\u2019 full support. Whether they are likely to do so, and whether publishing anyway is ethical, are of course non\\-legal questions.",

You should talk to your supervisor and others up the chain of management about what is happening with your work environment.\n\nAnd when you do, it's a good idea to document what is said, either at the time in your meetings (written notes; ask permission to digitally record), or afterward in your notes. (And document if you are not allowed to document.)\n\nIt's a good idea to document a few days of your customer interactions, *unless your employee handbook forbids this.* Don't use real names or customer IDs, but write a few general sentences about each interaction for use later in mediation or legal venues.\n\nOutside the company, a Google search will give you information about a human rights commission or NGO in your state that deals with worker rights; contact them about the rights you have that supersede any company policies.\n\nAnd a quick Google search for \"Verizon working conditions\" gives lots of information and various NGO sites dealing with Verizon and unionizing, outside support systems for Verizon employees, possible on\\-going and current litigation against Verizon, and more.\n\nLastly, there are attorneys who would do a no\\-fee initial assessment of your situation; check the web or the phonebook.\n\nYour situation appears to be sadly common, but take some legally permissible steps to get help from management and outside sources.",

These laws generally impose criminal and/or civil liability on the person taking the photo without the permission of the subject of the aspect of the photo that is problematic, without regard to who owns the premises.\n\nSince original artwork has a copyright by operation of law, taking a picture of it without permission and distributing that picture to the public on social media could be a copyright violation. But standing to seek remedies for copyright infringement would belong to the copyright owner, i.e. usually the author of the copyright or a transferee of the copyright (in this case the friend), and not to the homeowner, if the homeowner is someone different than the copyright holder of the art.\n\nAmong other things, the friend who is the person who made the art could validly file a takedown notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act with the Social Media company in question.\n\nThere are common law privacy torts (i.e. grounds for private lawsuits) for public disclose of private facts. But normally, this would not extend to the appearance of someone's bedroom unless there were an express non\\-disclosure agreement, or a relationship (e.g. confessional priest, attorney, psychotherapist, treating physician) to which a duty of confidentiality arises by operation of law.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Tom's legal options?\n\nA) Tom can file a lawsuit against Jane for invasion of privacy, as she photographed his private space without consent.\n\nB) Tom can only request the social media platform to remove the photo if he can prove he owns the house where the bedroom is located.\n\nC) Tom can file a DMCA takedown notice with the social media platform based on copyright infringement of his artwork visible in the photo.\n\nD) Tom has no legal recourse as the photo was taken by Jane, who has full rights to share images she captures.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, Tom, as the creator of the original artwork visible in the photo, holds the copyright to that art. Even though Jane took the photo, she has inadvertently captured and distributed copyrighted material without permission. Tom can file a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown notice with the social media platform to have the photo removed based on copyright infringement of his artwork.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there are some jurisdictions with laws against secretly photographing others, the common law privacy torts typically don't extend to the mere appearance of someone's bedroom unless there's an express non-disclosure agreement or a special relationship imposing confidentiality.\n\nOption B is incorrect because ownership of the house is not relevant to the copyright claim on the artwork.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while Jane has rights to her own image, she doesn't have the right to distribute images of copyrighted material without permission.\n\nThis question tests understanding of copyright law, privacy rights, and the limitations of personal photography rights when they intersect with others' intellectual property."

Art 15 has some overlap in the information requirements, but is not identical. The relevant recitals 60\u201362 offer no further guidance. They state that there's no information obligation where the data subject already posesses the information, but don't account for the case that the information has been lost.\n\nTherefore: the GDPR does not provide an explicit right to receive information per Art 13 \\& 14 a second time.\n\nHowever, I'd see a 40% chance that were such an issue presented to the CJEU, the court would find an extended obligation for the data controller to provide this information again on request, as long as the relevant processing is still ongoing and. Such an obligation could be derived from the Art 5(1\\) transparency principle, and the Art 12(1\\) obligation to take *appropriate measures* to provide this information.\n\nIn practice, a request for the legal basis is not terribly interesting:\n\n* In many contexts, the appropriate mechanism for fulfilling the information obligations per Arts 13\u201315 is to publish a privacy policy on a website, so that it is freely available to you.\n* Non\\-shady data controllers are unlikely to reject a request for this information, even if they are not obliged to fulfil it.\n* The list of legal bases is typically very uninformative, since most data controllers only list all used legal bases, but do not explain which processing purpose uses which legal basis.

The availability of counsel for the indigent in cases involving petty crimes varies, but not in a way systemically related to the common law v. civil law distinction. It has more to do with the available supply of lawyers.\n\nThe lawyer's job isn't very different, despite the fact that the lawyer has an audience of a panel of judges rather than a judge presiding over a decision making jury, although obviously lots of fine details (e.g. concerning the procedures for presenting evidence) are different.\n\nIn both cases, defense lawyers call the attention to the facts favorable to the defendant's case, offer up evidence that tends to exonerate the defendant if the lawyer can obtain it, argues to the court regarding how the evidence should be interpreted and what inferences should be drawn from it, and argues regarding any ambiguities in how the law should be applied to these particular facts.\n\nFurthermore, in most criminal cases, in both civil law countries and in common law countries, guilt or innocence is not the primary issue. The primary issue for criminal defense counsel in most cases is assisting the judges in determining the right sentencing option on the right charges for a defendant who pleads guilty or is found guilty at trial of some crime, based upon the character of the crime and offender that is presented to the court by the lawyer. This part of the process is very similar indeed in the two systems.\n\nTypical issues might include an assault case where the issue is whether there was serious bodily injury, justifying a more serious sentence, or mere ordinary bodily injury, justifying only a less serious sentence, in a case where it isn't clear cut at the guilt and innocence phase, or arguing whether probation and a fine, or incarceration is a better fit to a minor offense, in the sentencing phase. It isn't entirely or primarily about \"legal loopholes\" in any system, although \"legal loopholes\" tend to be more important in U.S. criminal law than in many legal systems.\n\nThere are some places in which civil law courts are more open to consider a defendant's arguments than others (and many civil law countries decide serious criminal cases with a panel that is a mix of legally trained judges and lay jurors), but that can vary wildly from country to country and within a country as well.",

The product in the photo is in light red, while the product on his photo is in dark red.\n\nThat aside, in my ToS, I cleary specify that the colors of the photo in the store are only illustrative and the colors of the product the clients are going to get may differ a little bit.

This is supported by several key points:\n\n1. Consumer protection laws often favor the buyer, making it difficult to contest claims even with terms of service agreements.\n2. PayPal's business model is built on consumer trust, meaning they are likely to side with the buyer in disputes.\n3. Contesting chargebacks can lead to negative publicity and damage to the business's reputation.\n4. The advice explicitly states \"chargebacks are a cost of doing business - set your prices accordingly.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the advice discourages contesting chargebacks due to the low likelihood of success. Option B is wrong as it ignores the opportunity to turn a complaint into positive publicity through good customer service.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I thought I found the answer in [California Firearms Laws Summary](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/firearms/pdf/cfl2016.pdf) :\n\n\"Unless otherwise unlawful, any person over the age of 18 who is not prohibited from possessing firearms **may have** a loaded or unloaded firearm at his or her place of residence, temporary residence, **campsite** or on private property owned or lawfully possessed by the person.\"\n\nHowever, the same section has this note:\n\n\"If a person\u2019s place of business, residence, temporary residence, campsite or private property is located within an area where possession of a firearm is prohibited by local or federal laws, such laws would prevail.\"\n\nCalifornia gun laws are, generally speaking, very restrictive, and I don't know whether any \"local or federal laws\" would prohibit a person without a CCW permit to bring it to a campsite in a county park.\n\nThe specific park I'm interested in is the [Sanborn park](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/parks/parkfinder/Pages/Sanborn.aspx) in Santa Clara County.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally, it is forbidden on Santa Clara County property. Santa Clara County Ordinances section [B19\\-10 (a)](https://library.municode.com/ca/santa_clara_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITBRE_DIVB19FI_CHIIREFIAMCOPR_SB19-10PRPOSADIFIAMCOPR):\n\n> It shall be unlawful for any person to bring onto or possess a Firearm, loaded or unloaded, or Ammunition, or both, on County Property. This subsection shall not apply where the possession of Firearms or Ammunition is prohibited by State law.\n\nThere is, however, an exception at [B19\\-11 (n)](https://library.municode.com/ca/santa_clara_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITBRE_DIVB19FI_CHIIREFIAMCOPR_SB19-11EXANPO) that may be relevant:\n\n> Subsection B19\\-10(a) does not apply to the following: \\[...] (n) A person lawfully possessing an unloaded Firearm or Ammunition, or both, in the locked trunk of, or inside a Locked Container in, a motor vehicle;\n\nSo the prohibition would not apply if you keep the firearm unloaded and locked in your trunk the entire time you are on county property. It isn't clear whether that is what you had in mind.\n\nAs for parks specifically, there is [B14\\-31\\.1 (a)](https://library.municode.com/ca/santa_clara_county/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=TITBRE_DIVB14PARE_CHIIIGEPUCO_ART1FIWE_SB14-31.1FIWE):\n\n> No person shall set, leave or deposit, or have in his or her possession, any weapon, spear, missile, sling shot, trap or hunting device, air or gas weapon, throwing knife or axe, or any other weapon or device capable of injuring or killing any person or animal, damaging any property or natural resource, except in areas established for such use or while in direct transit to or from such areas and available parking.\n\nIt's not clear to me whether this would prohibit a weapon in the trunk. You'd be well advised to ask the park officials for their interpretation; they might also be able to tell you if there are other relevant regulations.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John plans to camp at Sanborn Park in Santa Clara County. He wants to bring his unloaded firearm for personal protection. Under which of the following circumstances would John be in compliance with local regulations?\n\nA) John keeps his unloaded firearm in a locked container inside his tent at the campsite.\nB) John carries his unloaded firearm in a holster while hiking within the park.\nC) John stores his unloaded firearm in a locked container in the trunk of his car parked at the campsite.\nD) John keeps his unloaded firearm in a locked container inside his RV parked at the campsite.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Santa Clara County Ordinances, firearms are generally prohibited on county property, including parks. However, there is an exception stated in B19-11 (n) that allows for \"A person lawfully possessing an unloaded Firearm or Ammunition, or both, in the locked trunk of, or inside a Locked Container in, a motor vehicle.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because the firearm would be outside of a motor vehicle. \nOption B is not allowed as it involves carrying the firearm on county property, even if unloaded. \nOption C is the correct answer as it complies with the exception allowing firearms to be stored in a locked container in a motor vehicle. \nOption D is incorrect because an RV, while a vehicle, is also considered a temporary residence when parked at a campsite, and the exception specifically mentions motor vehicles, not temporary residences.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to interpret complex regulations and apply them to a specific scenario, considering multiple factors such as location, storage method, and vehicle type."

She said that she was married and lived with an\nabusive husband while renting an apartment locally.\n* She knowingly lied in person and on the application about her ability\nto pay.\n* She knowingly lied in person and on the application about her current\naddress listing it as out of state.\n* She knowingly lied in person and on the application about her\nprevious addresses within 5 years listing only one out of state address.\n* Listed relatives as references that were complicit in the\nmisrepresentation.\n\nShe misrepresented herself and filled out the application while being evicted locally. The online background check was unable to present an eviction that was in process and uncontested. Her notice to quit, court filing, and being served was before the application was filled out and before I even spoke to her. \n\nI am quoting from: [http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType\\=HTM\\&ttl\\=18](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18)\n\nTitle 18, Chapter 39, Sub\\-chapter B, 3922, (a), (1\\) Theft by Deception\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n> **\u00a7 3922\\.

With tenant landlord laws as they are, the landlord is deprived of their property and ability to rent the property simply by virtue of the fact that someone now has access. Gaining access to property through (gross) deliberate deception with the express purpose of gaining access to property knowingly without the ability to pay is denying a landlord of their property and capital with intent and tantamount to Theft by Deception.\n\nThe result of this is that I am unable to rent the apartment in question and am now dealing with a tenant that intends to continue the deception without paying. They did pay just enough money to get in, however, the lies and deceptions to continue with intent to deceive and retain property for personal gain.\n\nTo make matters worse, this tenant did this with the previous landlord which evicted her.\n\nBefore anyone says there is remedy available in court, I will remind you that this tenant, as it turns out, does not have a pot to pee in and does not have enough real property to recover damages and losses. As well, the law allows appeals and extensions making the situation worse. In otherwords, often the remedy results in court costs and fees for the landlord as well as losses that cannot be recovered.\n\nI realize that lawyers and courts are reluctant to call this fraud and theft, however, can you help an old guy understand why this specific and clear attempt to defraud and deprive a property owner of access rights to their property would not be considered illegal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As you note, it does appear that this tenant has committed one or more crimes.\n\nIn Pennsylvania crimes are prosecuted by the state, and you can begin the process by filing a private criminal complaint with your local Magisterial District Court, which will forward it to your county's District Attorney for review and prosecution.\n\nYou've essentially written the complaint here; now you just have to file it. The criminal process would proceed independently of whatever civil processes you might be pursuing.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord discovers that a recent tenant provided false information on their rental application to gain access to an apartment. The tenant lied about their rental history, ability to pay, current address, and previous addresses. The landlord believes this constitutes theft by deception under Pennsylvania law. What is the most appropriate initial legal action for the landlord to take in this situation?\n\nA) File a civil lawsuit against the tenant for fraud\nB) Immediately evict the tenant without going through legal proceedings\nC) File a private criminal complaint with the local Magisterial District Court\nD) Report the tenant to a credit bureau for providing false information\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate initial legal action for the landlord to take is to file a private criminal complaint with the local Magisterial District Court. This is because:\n\n1. The tenant's actions may constitute a crime under Pennsylvania law, specifically theft by deception.\n2. In Pennsylvania, crimes are prosecuted by the state, not by individuals through civil lawsuits.\n3. Filing a private criminal complaint initiates the process for potential criminal prosecution.\n4. The Magisterial District Court will forward the complaint to the county's District Attorney for review and possible prosecution.\n5. This action allows the criminal process to proceed independently of any civil actions the landlord might pursue.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while civil action might be possible, it's not the most appropriate initial step for addressing potential criminal behavior. Option B is illegal and could lead to legal troubles for the landlord. Option D, while potentially useful, does not address the criminal aspect of the tenant's actions and is not a legal remedy."
