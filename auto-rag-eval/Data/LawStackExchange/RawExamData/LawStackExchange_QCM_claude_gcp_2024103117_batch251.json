In the Canadian legal system, when both a corporate officer and the corporation itself are prosecuted for a criminal offense, the individual may face imprisonment as specified in the Criminal Code. However, corporations cannot be imprisoned and are instead subject to monetary fines. The Criminal Code provides specific factors to be considered when sentencing organizations, as outlined in section 718.21. Answer A is incorrect because while the corporation cannot be imprisoned, it's not true that only fines are possible for all offenses. Answer B is incorrect as there is no standardized scale for converting prison terms to fines for corporations.

I was standing outside of my apartment next door. I do have a key for that building and stated that I did but when he asked me to use it, I refused stating that I am not supposed to. He stated that I could be cited for refusing to assist him. He said he was there to talk to a sex offender. I did not ask if he had a warrant and he did not say he had one. I left after providing the contact info for the building's landlord.\n\nAfter some googling I found that it is a crime to not assist an officer but it seems to be limited to when that officer is making an arrest:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refusing\\_to\\_assist\\_a\\_police\\_officer\\#Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refusing_to_assist_a_police_officer#Colorado)\n\n* Country: United States\n* State: Colorado\n* City: Denver\n\nMy Question: since the officer did not state he was making an arrest and did not provide a warrant, was I legally required to assist him in opening the door?\n\nSide Note: the officer was nocking on several people's windows and even tried to jimmy the lock with one of his keys. I also looked at the sex offender registry afterwards and did not find anyone in that building or near by. He also asked for my name and apartment number and wrote them down. The situation seemed shady.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This all depends upon where you are. I am a landlord and I am answering based upon the laws of the U.S. and the states that I operate in.\n\nFirst things first. You are not the property owner. While this does not limit the answer, it is a factor. You do not have the right to the property even if you have a key and the permission of the tenant. You are not the property owner, do not represent the property owner nor the tenant, and by contract do not have legal rights to the apartment. It does put you in a different situation.\n\nAs a landlord, it is against the law for me to provide access to a tenants apartment to anyone without authorization. This, of course, precludes emergencies such as welfare checks. In the case of the police, a warrant is required or a form that the police fill out that allows the police to gain access. This would be used in cases such as when a spouse requires the recovery of personal property during a domestic dispute. A judges order is not always possible in these cases. These are often limited cases and the form absolves the landlord of liability even in cases where the police act incorrectly.\n\nSo without a warrant or a form that certifies any lawful request, anyone including the landlord can be arrested for a crime.\n\nFor your situation, a quick call to the landlord would have been appropriate. Without a warrant or certification, the police still had options including waiting for the person in question to either leave or return to the apartment or even request a warrant by phone. Often, the warrant, once signed by the judge, can be read over the phone. Any landlord should always have a paper copy provided within minutes since some cruisers will have a printer and can print the warrant.\n\nYour refusal appears to be legal. However, in the future, you can ask for a copy of the warrant that you provide the landlord.\n\nI do not wish to paint a negative image of the police who do the hard work that most people will never take on, they are after all heros, however, some do not know the law perfectly well especially tenant landlord law. As well, some will try and get away with skirting the law trying to get an important job done. It does happen. I hired a lawyer just last week for an illegal request unrelated to the question here.\n\nAddressing the OPs comment:\n\n> Hello, I believe I misstated the situation a bit in that the locked\n>  door in question was for the apartment building and not a tenet's\n>  apartment itself. I have edited my question. Does this change\n>  anything?\n\nTechnically, this does not change much of anything, however, the request by the police can be seen as a reasonable one. They just may want to talk to the individual which is reasonable. In this case, I might have let them in if the access I was giving them was to a common space such as a hallway. In this case, the outer door locks are only to keep Intruders from entering the building and not meant to restrict access for valid purposes.\n\nAre you in trouble? I would say no. If anyone asks, you can give reasonable arguments for your situation. However, the next time, consider what I have written here. The police have a tough enough time doing their jobs. If you can help and stay within the proper boundaries of what the law allows, that would be best.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado, a police officer asks a resident with a key to open a locked apartment building door so he can speak to a sex offender inside.

The law requiring assistance to police officers in Colorado is limited to cases where an arrest is being made, which wasn't stated here. Without a warrant or the landlord's permission, opening the building could potentially be illegal.

Cheers\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I assume this is perfectly fine if I don't use imagery or artistic inspiration from the show?\n\nYou are correct. The idea of an elimination context is an old one, going back at least to the late Roman Republic. In can case ideas, methods and procedures are never protected by copyright.\n\n> \\[What] if a face resembling the creepy little girl's face from Game\\#1 is featured in various screens on the app?\n\nThat image is almost surely protected by copyright. Any use of it without permission from the copyright owner (whoever that might be, quite possibly the production company for the show) would be unlawful, specifically copyright infringement, unless an exception to copyright applies.\n\nIn the US that would be ***fair use***, which is a highly fact\\-driven determination. But it this case it seems unlikely that fair use would apply if you are in the US. See [Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use? What if I don't make any money off it?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) for more on fair use\n\nThe exceptions to copyright in non\\-US law are generally narrower and more specific than fair use, and it is rather less likely that any such exception would apply. (see [What is the practical difference between \"fair use\" and \"fair dealing\" in Copyright law?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48359/what-is-the-practical-difference-between-fair-use-and-fair-dealing-in-copyri) for more on this.) In short you may not lawfully use that image without permission from the copyright holder.\n\nIn addition, the person whose face is shown in the image may well have \"personality rights\" or \"rights of publicity\" separate from any copyright, depending on your jurisdiction (such rights are recognized differently in different places, and some jurisdictions do not recognize them at all.) She could possibly sue if her image was used without her permission.\n\nIf a game developer creates a more generic image, not directly based on any image from the show, or gets someone else to create such an image and buys or is given the copyright or a license to use the image, there should be no legal issue with regard to any image copyright.\n\nTrademark issues\n----------------\n\nIn addition to copyright issues, there could be trademark issues here.\n\nIf you use the actual name of the show \"Squid Game\", that might seem to be trading off the reputation of the show, and implying that your game is authorized or sponsored or endorsed by the show's creators. That might well be trademark infringement, unless you get permission from the trademark owner.\n\nHowever, what is a protected trademark is specific to a country. What is protected in one country is often not protected in another. Only a relative few very popular products are protected in every country.\n\nIn addition \"Squid Game\" is a rather descriptive, generic name. In the US, and in other countries with similar laws, it would probably receive only limited protection. Still it is safer to use a different and unique name.\n\nA different name, such as perhaps \"Squid Battle\" which does not invite confusion with the TV show or imply endorsement by the show's creators is less likely to result in a trademark suit.\n\nAny images or logos used to identify the show could also cause trademark claims if copied or imitated.\n\nNote that in the US one can claim protection for a trademark in actual use, even if it has never been registered.

That is clear from the fact that the party seeking to rely on the strict legal position must be the same party that is required to provide reasonable notice, as the passage suggests. Strict legal position cannot mean promissory estoppel and is used to distinguish the (equitable) estoppel position. The requirement of court action is obviously a good practical point, should the promisee deny any obligation to revert to the strict position. \u201cProbably\u201d is appropriate because, of course, it may be that the promisee does consent to reverting to the strict position, but given that it is likely to perceive that it has an agreement with the promisor as to the amended payment or other obligation (whatever the subject of the promise), in practical terms it is often unwilling to do so. High Trees supports this point (and, tellingly, it is High Trees, not Tool Metal, cited in support).

The House of Lords confirmed that serving a counterclaim was itself sufficient notice to restart the obligation to make compensation payments. This demonstrates that formal court action is not always necessary to revive strict contractual rights, and that legal proceedings themselves can serve as notice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because court action is not always required if reasonable notice is given and accepted. Option B is incorrect because while the promisee's consent makes the transition smoother, it is not legally required if proper notice has been given. Option D is incorrect because promissory estoppel is generally considered suspensory rather than permanently extinguishing rights, as evidenced by the Tool Metal case and the concept of revival through notice."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67152/what-laws-regulations-statutes-must-lexisnexis-follow-regarding-opt-out-privileg", "docs_id": 67152, "title": "What laws/regulations/statutes must LexisNexis follow regarding opt-out privileges of certain groups", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One can go to [LexisNexis](https://optout.lexisnexis.com/) to suppress information.\nThere are several options on why you want your information suppressed, but three stood\\-out:\n\n* I am a public/elected Official\n* I am a law enforcement officer\n* I am a judicial officer\n\nWhat federal laws regulate LexisNexis handling of these members' information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main purpose of suppressing information is to suppress information that would make \"doxxing\" inaccessible. Doxxing is the sharing of personal contact and address information about people without their consent, generally with an intent that the people with whom the information was shared with protest, stalk, or harm the individual doxed.\n\nOne category not listed in the OP under U.S. federal law is [18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f119](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/119) (enacted in 2008\\) which prohibits sharing certain information about jurors and certain witnesses in certain kinds of cases.\n\nMultiple states have passed or considered passing similar laws, including [Colorado](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/19/us/colorado-doxxing-law.html), some of which have been challenged in court (such as [a Washington State law that was blocked by a judge](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/federal-judge-blocks-washington-state-cyberstalking-law/) as potentially unconstitutional).

One typically consents for this data to be processed when completing associated paperwork. \n\nOnce the check has concluded, would the company be obliged (if requested by the subject of the check) to purge all personal data that was gathered prior to and during the check? Furthermore, upon receiving the request, would any third parties with which the screening company shares the data also be obliged to purge it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Intro\n=====\n\nI assume that the background screening you are referring to is made in connection with applying for a job. If so, it would generally be the applicant's (prospect) employer that is primarily responsible for the processing of the personal data in relation to the applicant. The employer outsources the background screening to a service provider, which in GDPR terms is considered a controller\\-processor relationship (the service provider processes personal data about the applicant on behalf of the employer/the controller). \n\nThe same principles generally apply irrespective of whether the data is collected prior to or during the screening. However, depending on the content of such data, different safeguarding requirements may apply.\n\nConsent possibly not reliable\n=============================\n\nThe employer must identify legal grounds for processing the data that a background screening collects (see [Article 6 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). It could be argued whether consent is valid ground for background screening considering the imbalance between the parties. In many jurisdictions within the EU, consent in an employment context has generally been very difficult to rely on. If consent could not be relied on, the employer would typically have to argue for that there is a legitimate interest to process the data. (See also [Article 88 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-88-gdpr/).)\n\nStorage time\n============\n\nA general principle in GDPR is storage limitation ([Article 5(1\\)(e)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/)). It means that a controller (or a processor) may not store personal data for a longer period than necessary. Hence, once the background screening is completed, the employer is not likely allowed to store the data for a longer period than is necessary for completion of the recruitment process. The background screening company should likely not have any use of the data after having provided the background screening report to the employer. The employer may however argue that the information must be stored for some time to be able to manage the recruitment.\n\nDeletion upon request\n=====================\n\nThe applicant has no absolute right to request a deletion of data (which is a common misunderstanding of GDPR). The \"right to be forgotten\" is a bit different depending on the context of the processing (see [Article 17 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/)):\n\n* If the processing is based on **consent**, the applicant may request a deletion, which in general must be complied with, but the employer might find other grounds for keeping the data.\n* If the processing is based on **legitimate interest**, the applicant may request a deletion, and the employer will have to re\\-assess its grounds for keeping the data. If the grounds are still valid, the employer is not obliged to remove the data.\n\nSharing with third parties\n==========================\n\nYour question touches upon the issue of parties with which the screening company would share the screening information. Except for with the employer (which has a direct relationship with the applicant), it should be noted that there is very little room in GDPR for the screening company (or the employer) to share the data with any other party, unless the applicant has explicitly consented thereto. Such a third party would then likely be a controller in itself, and the third party would then have a direct responsibility and liability towards the applicant. It would then likely be possible to withdraw the consent, which triggers an obligation to purge the data.\n\nThird party deletion\n====================\n\nIf the employer is obliged to purge the data (e.g. if consent is withdrawn or there is no remaining legal ground for continuing the processing/storing of data), the background screening service provider should also delete the data. Although also the service provider is bound by GDPR, some responsibility falls upon the employer to stipulate the conditions for such deletion in a contract between the parties (see [Article 28(3\\)(e) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/)).\n\nConcluding remarks\n==================\n\nThis area is a bit tricky and disputed, see for instance [here](https://www.sterlingtalentsolutions.com/blog/2018/04/gdpr-impact-background-screening-program/), [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pre-employment-background-screening-under-gdpr-frivaldszky-dr-llm-/) and [here](http://www.scesolicitors.co.uk/news/background-screening-and-gdpr#.Wz3V19UzaUk). A good advice is therefore to review the privacy notices that the employer must provide along with any request to provide information for a background check. \n\nIt could also be worth mentioning that a background screening company is generally prohibited from dealing with data relating to criminal convictions and offences ([Article 10 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-10-gdpr/)), which to my experience is quite common.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under GDPR, when a background screening for employment is completed, what are the data subject's rights regarding the deletion of their personal data?\n\nA) The data subject has an absolute right to demand immediate deletion of all personal data from both the employer and the screening company.\n\nB) The data subject can only request deletion if the processing was based on consent, but not if it was based on legitimate interest.\n\nC) The data subject can request deletion, but the employer may refuse if they can demonstrate ongoing valid grounds for keeping the data.\n\nD) The data subject has no right to request deletion of their data until a specified retention period has passed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the data subject (applicant) does not have an absolute right to demand deletion of their personal data. If the processing was based on consent, the applicant may request deletion, which generally must be complied with. However, if the processing was based on legitimate interest, the applicant can still request deletion, but the employer is required to re-assess its grounds for keeping the data. If the employer can demonstrate valid ongoing grounds for retaining the data, they are not obliged to delete it. This aligns with the principle of storage limitation in GDPR, where data should not be kept longer than necessary, but also recognizes that the employer may have valid reasons to retain the data for a certain period after the screening is complete."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/62533/is-the-requirement-to-have-positive-attitude-discriminatory", "docs_id": 62533, "title": "Is the requirement to have positive attitude discriminatory?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many companies list \"positive attitude\" as a requirement for the candidates, including job positions that have nothing to do with customer service or management (for which jobs it could be reasonably justified).\n\nHowever, some people have major depression or an anxiety disorder that makes it impossible to maintain a positive attitude due to the mere nature of the illness. Would it violate the Americans With Disabilities Act or any other law to discriminate against such a person for their failure to maintain a positive attitude, **given that the disability doesn't prevent the employee from doing their job**? (I have to emphasize this part, as many answers simply ignore it).\n\nPositive attitude, from the top definition in Google:\n\"In general, having a positive attitude means being optimistic about situations, interactions, and yourself.\"\n\nA few things that I have to clarify due to common misconceptions:\n\n* having major depression isn't same thing as \"being grumpy\", as some people here suggested.

See, e.g., [Lopez\\-Mendez v. Lexmark Intern., Inc., 680 F.Supp.2d 357, 375 (D.P.R. 2010\\)](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914b0eaadd7b04934755e02)\n\n> \"This incident, however, is not sufficient to constitute direct evidence of discriminatory animus...**\\[Defendant's agent]'s anecdote could be interpreted as emphasizing the importance of a positive attitude, rather than plaintiff's interpretation that it expressed a preference for younger male employees...This benign interpretation** seems more plausible...In light of these facts, there does not appear to be any evidence on the record that gives a 'high degree of assurance' that discriminatory animus was behind the decision to terminate plaintiff\" (emphasis added).\n\n**NOTE**: OP's original question was simply whether listing 'positive attitude' on a job description was illegal. OP has now changed the question to whether making employment decisions based on a depressed individual's lack of a positive attitude is illegal. Although I have great sympathy for those with mental illness and personally wish the law were different, my answer is still that this is almost certainly legal.\n\nAnother example of a court finding attitude to be a legitimate reason upon which to base employment decisions is: Martin v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 126 F.Supp.2d 809 (M.D. Pa 2000\\). In this case, the court accepted as a legitimate reason for promoting one individual over another that the promoted individual \"demonstrated good interpersonal skills.\" *Id*. at 817\\.\n\nA third example is Lloyd v. Swifty Transp., Inc., 552 F.3d 594 (7th Cir. 2009\\). In this case, the Seventh Circuit explicitly noted that \"\\[t]he employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and we will not second\\-guess that decision.\" *Id*. at 601\\. It then went on to affirm dismissal of the plaintiff's ADA claim because the employer \"said that lead drivers must have knowledge of the mechanics of the trucks and **be able to manage the other drivers on the truck through a positive attitude and ability to get along well with others. But the supervisors in charge of hiring lead drivers testified without contradiction that \\[the plaintiff] had a negative attitude that drew complaints from other drivers**.\" *Id*. at 601\\-602 (emphasis added).\n\nAfter a relatively exhaustive search, I've found no case to counter these pretty clear statements that basing employment decisions on 'attitude' is legal.\n\n**FURTHER NOTE**: OP has now modified the question again to add the qualification that the lack of a positive attitude \"doesn't prevent the employee from doing their job.\" IF this were actually true, then the answer likely becomes that illegal discrimination has occurred because then the employee would be 'otherwise qualified' (a key phrase in employment law litigation). BUT, there is an inherent contradiction in premises in OP's question now because if X is a requirement of a job, and Y employee cannot do X because of Z, then Z is preventing Y employee from doing that job. In other words, if a job requires a positive attitude, then one can't do that job without a positive attitude. Ultimately, what OP's question is really trying to get at is 'what if the employer makes 'positive attitude' a job requirement, but I don't think it should be a job requirement?' Unfortunately, there's almost certainly no legal recourse for this *as long as it's a legal job requirement* because, to reiterate the 7th Circuit, \"\\[t]he employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and \\[a court] will not second\\-guess that decision.\" *Id*. at 601\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software development company lists \"positive attitude\" as a job requirement for all positions.

If you paid $2000 for the photo, you might want to check to see if it came with a licensing agreement.\n\n**Background**\n\nOne way to view this is through the lens of privacy. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A subjects privacy invaders to liability for the resulting harm to the *interests* of the other. Because you mention public personas and your facts don't involve disclosing private details, negative publicity, or interfering with seclusion, one might think appropriation of name or likeness applies.\n\n> [Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/privacy/Privacy_R2d_Torts_Sections.htm)\n> \n> \n> One who appropriates to his own use or benefit the name or likeness of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy.\n\nComment (a) to this section explains that a person's identity is in the nature of a property right. Courts have tended to recognize an individual's interest in the exclusive use of his or her own identity, going so far as to require licensing for usage.\n\nThe most common way to violate this \"property right\" is by appropriating someone's name or likeness to promote a business or product. Cases abound on the subject, but a classic one is [*White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc.*, 971 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1992\\)](http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/mburke/Classes/Property_Current_Year/White_v_Samsung.pdf). To summarize, Samsung ran a [picture\\-based ad](http://legalstudiesclassroom.blogspot.com/2011/03/featured-case-white-v-samsung.html) featuring a futuristic robot dressed in an evening gown and turning \"Wheel of Fortune\"\\-styled letters. Vanna White was nonplussed and brought suit, which she won on appeal. In its opinion, the Ninth Circuit argued the operative question wasn't *how* Samsung appropriated her likeness, but *whether* they had done so. The point of citing *White* here is simply to observe that a person's \"likeness\" probably extends even further than mere photo reproduction.\n\nBack to your facts: posting actual images of celebrities for a commercial purpose appears a much more clear cut appropriation of likeness than *White*. While it may seem similar, I'd distinguish your situation from that of restaurant \"Walls of Fame\"\\-\\-\\-which showcase signed photos of celebrities with the owner\\-\\-\\-in that the celebrities you mention weren't using your product or service at the time of the photograph.\n\nYou might argue the photos aren't being used for advertising, but the plaintiff would counter that you posted them on a client\\-facing business website. In the Ninth Circuit this would be a question of *whether* there was an appropriation, not the way in which it was accomplished.\n\nFor argument's sake, assume the court agrees your usage isn't commercial. Even that doesn't necessarily mean you're in the clear. In \u00a7 652C, and varying state\\-by\\-state, non\\-commercial purposes are also subject to scrutiny:\n\n> Comment (b). Apart from statute, however, the rule stated is not limited to commercial appropriation. It applies also when the defendant makes use of the plaintiff's name or likeness for his own purposes and benefit, even though the use is not a commercial one, and even though the benefit sought to be obtained is not a pecuniary one. Statutes in some states have, however, limited the liability to commercial uses of the name or likeness.\n\nIt's important to remember the Restatement isn't binding: it simply attempts to \"restate\" what courts (which are binding) have had to say on the topic.

But, in these cases, the law enforcement agency is effectively an \"independent contractor\" in relationship to the judge with considerable discretion regarding precisely how and when a writ is carried out. Somebody in the law enforcement agency to which a writ is directed is required to take action, but no individual law enforcement officer is personally compelled to comply with this order.\n\nThe quote in question is not a statement about the legal authority of a judge, however. It is a statement of \"realpolitik\". The judge can't physically force or threaten law enforcement to do what they are told to do by a judge. The cops have the guns, not the judges.\n\nInstead, the judge relies upon law enforcement obeying the judge's orders because that is what law enforcement officers do. It's right in the job title. But, if law enforcement chose to ignore judges, in general, there is very little that judges could do about that (and in some countries, law enforcement does routinely ignore judicial directions).\n\nSome forms of executive branch authority to defy judicial orders is even legally codified, most starkly in the case of the pardon power.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A judge orders a police officer in the courtroom to immediately arrest a witness who has just committed perjury.

However from what I've read of it the Constitution is very broad. It rarely dives into specifics but rather gives a high level statement, seemingly to be carried out by legislation and the judicial process.\n\nFor example \"cruel and unusual\" in the 8th amendment. Justice Anthony Scalia, one of the biggest proponents of originalism, [stated](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/02/13/scalia-on-death-penalty-torture-piers-intv.cnn) that the death penalty wasn't included under it because it was legal at the time the text was written. Under originalism modern society needs to amend the Constitution if it wants to include the death penalty or anything else under \"cruel and unusual\".\n\nDo proponents of originalism suggest the new amendment use the phrase \"cruel and unusual\" but with the understanding that those words now mean something different? Or that it specifically call out the death penalty and everything else?\n\nI wonder because the former would be strange and possibly confusing, and the latter greatly restricts amendments by not allowing them to paint with a broad stroke as the original text did.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The actual method of amending the Constition is spelled out in Article V \u2013 originalism would reject the position that there are other ways to amend it. We can see the result in the [ratified amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Originalism is a theory of interpretation, not a theory of drafting, and it hold that the words of the law, be it the Constitution or a particular statute, are to be understood as would be understood by people originally. (There are numerous versions of originalism, so one can't be more precise than than until you decide whether you mean original understanding or original intent, the latter now being a minority viewpoint). It does not hold that new laws should be drafted in the language as it existed in the 18th century, as indeed they are not. Thus the [26th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text) is written in contemporary style befitting the fact that it was drafted recently, and the [27th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text) is written in older style befitting the fact that it was drafted in 1789\\.\n\nAs for \"changing values\", each ratified amendment represents some change of values, whereby originally a right was not recognized (or was), and by the amendment, that value changes.

The passage indicates that originalists like Justice Scalia believed the death penalty was not considered \"cruel and unusual\" when the Eighth Amendment was ratified.

First, what is better for you? You usually start an LLC to protect yourself (the person) from liability in case things go wrong. Worst case, you lose all the assets of the LLC. So if the LLC owns the copyright, that is an asset, which can be lost if the LLC goes bankrupt. So I'd say it's better for your protection if you own the copyright personally. \n\nIf you created the software in your own time, before the LLC was started, then you own the copyright. You should create a proper contract saying that the LLC has the non\\-exclusive right to market the software and keep profits from the sale of the software, and that this agreement can be cancelled by you at any time. Signed by you, as a private citizen, and by the director of the LLC, which happens to be you as well, on behalf of the LLC. \n\nThat will give you maximum personal protection. On the other hand, investors won't be willing to invest in your LLC, because it basically owns nothing of any value.

By retaining personal ownership of the copyright, the developer protects this valuable asset from potential bankruptcy of the LLC. Granting a non-exclusive license allows the LLC to operate and profit from the game while giving the developer the flexibility to cancel the agreement if needed. This approach offers strong personal protection for the developer.\n\nOption A provides the least personal protection, as the copyright becomes an asset of the LLC that could be lost if the business fails. Option B, while offering some protection, may be less attractive to investors due to the exclusive nature of the license. Option D doesn't provide clear separation between personal and business assets, which could complicate matters legally and financially.\n\nWhile option C may make the LLC slightly less attractive to potential investors (as the LLC doesn't own the copyright outright), it still allows for business operations while maximizing the developer's personal asset protection, striking the best balance given the information provided."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81781/can-a-u-s-state-bring-action-before-the-supreme-court-against-another-state-for", "docs_id": 81781, "title": "Can a U.S. state bring action before the Supreme Court against another state for equal rights of its own citizens when they visit the other state?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let\u2019s make this hypothetical. Two U.S. states, East Lumbago and West Lumbago, which share a common border. It\u2019s a First Amendment issue, specifically: *\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d* We\u2019ll presume that it is settled law that state and local governments are held to these standards.\n\nIn East Lumbago, any organizer who wants to stage a group demonstration must apply for an assembly permit. The organizer must show a certificate that they have taken an East Lumbago\\-approved course in Safe Public Assembly and pass a background check that confirms that they have never been convicted of riot or other serious crimes related to demonstrations. All common\\-sense restrictions to protect the public. Any person who organizes a demonstration without a valid assembly permit is subject to arrest and imprisonment.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: under state law, East Lumbago assembly permits are only issued to residents of East Lumbago. If you live in West Lumbago or any other state, you can\u2019t get an East Lumbago assembly permit, so if you go ahead and organize a demonstration, you\u2019ll be arrested and prosecuted.\n\nThere have been grumbles about East Lumbago\u2019s assembly permits, but the state makes a convincing argument that in the interest of public safety, the government must know about a demonstration in advance and take steps to prepare for it, and known, convicted troublemakers must lose the right to organize demonstrations for life. And the residency requirement? East Lumbago\u2019s legislature, in the preamble to their public assembly law, spoke of the need to end the scourge on society of outside agitators and rabble rousers coming to their fair state and causing trouble, and for this reason, only East Lumbago residents are eligible to organize a demonstration.\n\nWest Lumbago activists and organizers feel that due solely to their residence in a state other than East Lumbago, they suffer unequal protection of their First Amendment right of assembly / petition by being denied assembly permits in East Lumbago.

They could expect to be questioned about anything they say under oath that contradicts something else they said under oath. It\u2019s not illegal for an expert to admit they were wrong before, or that there are other facts that support a different conclusion\u2014indeed, a witness on the stand might be obligated to\u2014but it might not do their professional reputation and their credibility with the jury any good, either.\n\nIn the U.S., the opposing counsel is generally allowed to contact a witness, and take a statement, but may not ask the witness to testify falsely or offer any inducement prohibited by law. (See Supreme Court Rule (SCR) 173/Model Rule (MR) 3\\.4\\.)

Putting the witness on the stand would give the other side an opportunity to cross\\-examine them. Grilling your own expert as a hostile witness, even if the judge allowed it, would only make your position seem tendentious.

While there are no immediate legal repercussions for an expert witness contradicting their earlier statements, they may face credibility issues with the jury and potential damage to their professional reputation. It's not illegal for an expert to admit they were wrong or present new facts that support a different conclusion, but doing so can undermine their credibility.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because contradicting earlier statements is not automatically perjury; experts can change their opinions based on new information or analysis.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there are indeed potential consequences, primarily in terms of credibility and professional reputation.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the attorney is not required to continue direct examination.

The law states that self-defense is not considered a \"lawful excuse\" for carrying a weapon. Even everyday items can be classified as offensive weapons if intended to be used as such. The case of Patterson v Block [1984] established that carrying a weapon for defense can still amount to intent to cause injury. While option C might seem plausible, the key distinction is the intent - carrying an item for a genuine lawful purpose (like a work tool) is different from carrying it specifically for self-defense.

While the original Mozart symphony is in the public domain, a creative arrangement for brass quintet could be considered a new, derivative work eligible for copyright protection. However, the protection would only extend to the original elements of the arrangement, not to the underlying Mozart composition. It's important to note that copyright protection is not automatic and depends on the specific creative choices made in the arrangement process."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/92354/what-is-the-legal-situation-if-you-perform-a-citizens-arrest-on-a-security-guar", "docs_id": 92354, "title": "What is the legal situation if you perform a citizen&#39;s arrest on a security guard?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The law on citizens arrest is [here](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/24A) and summarised by the police [here](https://www.westyorkshire.police.uk/ask-the-police/question/Q508):\n\n> 2.

However you must inform the person you are arresting as soon as possible what you are doing, why you are doing it and what offence you believe the person has committed.\n\nSuppose one is physically restrained by security guards, [similar to that in this news story](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/mar/23/boy-handcuffed-civilian-security-staff-shop-chichester-superdrug). At no point during the restraint do they inform you they are arresting you, why they are doing it and what offence they believe you to have committed. After the 20 seconds or so that is shown here, you say \"I am performing a citizen's arrest upon you.

Unless you have a contract with your employer or a collective bargain agreement negotiated with your union that limits your responsibilities, the employer can assign you whatever duties the employer wishes.\n\n> I doubt this even abides my financial compliance/GAAP accounting laws,\n> etc.\n\nIf the company is not publicly held and is not under a contractual obligation to do so, GAAP accounting is not required. What you are doing isn't inherently inconsistent with either GAAP accounting or with HIPAA (for health care information) either. GAAP accounting (which is compelled by securities laws), HIPAA and similar laws governing record keeping and databases don't govern the mechanism by which data is put into or retrieved from databases or records (other than required security measures for the data in the case of HIPAA and some banking laws) or the precise format of databases/records.\n\nThe employer has made an implicit decision to do work in a stupid and inefficient way and to pay you to do it, rather than to do it in a cheaper and more conventional way, but that is the employer's prerogative. The employer would be perfectly within the law and its rights to have you use an abacus and cuneiform ledgers in mud with a stylus if it wished, so long as the ledgers were kept in a secure environment.\n\nThe tax laws merely require that a company keep records adequate to comply. It is poor business practice but probably not illegal. Workplace.SE would probably have suggestions about how to get an employer to be less stupid.\n\nIt may even put the company at risk of liability for negligent misrepresentation to a third party causing a customer harm occurs if an error is made and then reported to a collection agency and the error prone method is found to be negligent by a judge or jury. But, it would not be illegal and would not give rise to liability, unless an error that negligently causes harm to a customer actually happens.\n\nAlso, first party debt collections (as opposed to debt collections through a third party debt collector) are not subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

So, you could be fired without negative consequences for the employer if your boss gets angry.

Considering ISO 12100 is or used to be one of the most important standards on risk assessment and safety integrity requirements (required for determining how 'safe' a complex system is), I'm confused by the MD simply dropping the reference from its normative list. It has now moved to the Bibliography, which doesn't hold the same value.\n\n### Question\n\nLast I checked, everything 'normative' in these standards is basically law. Did the value of ISO 12100 change within the scope of the MD so far that compliance is no longer required? Relevant parts are now part of the 60204, but not even close to everything.\n\nIt's entirely possible I've misunderstood something here, but are we no longer required to comply with ISO 12100 like we used to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I have not the slightest clue about this area of the law, so don't take this as an actual answer, rather as some sort of suggestion that doesn't fit into a comment:\n\nAs far as I can see, ISO 12100\\-1:2003 and ISO 12100\\-2:2003 (which you ask about) were revised and summarised in the new ISO 12100:2010 (Safety of machinery \u2014 General principles for design \u2014 Risk assessment and risk reduction). The ISO 12100:2010 standard was subsequently published in the Official Journal ([2011/C 110/01](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52011XC0408(03))), where it is stated that it will supersede EN ISO 12100\\-1:2003 and EN ISO 12100\\-2:2003, giving 30 November 2013 as the \"Date of cessation of presumption of conformity of superseded standard\".

There are laws requiring reporting of *receipt* of cash [31 USC 5313](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5313) which applies to banks, which are regulated, but Ordinary Joe is not subject to this law.

And, the same string of words in an insult could be slanderous when directed at one person in one setting, and not when directed at another person in another setting. The intended meaning, as the audience when it is uttered would understand it, is what matters.\n\nIn close calls, we let the trier of fact decide if the statement was or implied a literal statement of a presently existing fact, or if it was not meant in that sense, following a trial if necessary.\n\n> For instance, if Ronald calls Donald a \"retarded bastard son of a\n> senile crackwhore\", he's (going by the literal meaning of the\n> individual members of this string of insults) claiming that Donald is\n> intellectually\\-disabled and was born out of wedlock to a\n> crack\\-cocaine\\-addicted prostitute suffering from dementia, all of\n> which are things that could potentially be true, even if taken\n> literally.\n\nIf Donald is a U.S. Senator or a school teacher, this probably isn't going to be taken literally by a reasonable person hearing it. If Ronald is a guidance counselor at a school who would have reason to know the real facts and Donald is a janitor who was a former student at the school and these things aren't true, it might be slanderous.\n\nThe retaliatory insults would almost surely not be slanderous no matter who said them and if the retaliation were stated in that way it would also tend to make the original statement less likely to be taken as a genuine statement of fact as opposed to a generalized insult, because Donald is not treating the insult as if it was true or might be true.\n\nUnlike the U.S., in Germany, insults of these sorts would often be actionable because under German law, gross rudeness, in and of itself, is actionable even in the absence of the fraud element required in U.S. law.

In U.S. defamation law, context is crucial in determining whether an insult crosses the line into actionable slander. The key factor is whether a reasonable person would understand the statement as asserting an actual, presently existing fact about the person, given the specific context in which it was said.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even seemingly specific claims are not automatically considered slander.

So, the punishment is further multiplied.\n\nFinally, how is it ethical for the State to conspire with a defendant to create and perpetuate a lie? Plea bargains are lies \\- both the defendant and the prosecution know that the plea is something other than the truth yet they conspire to a falsehood and then go before a Judge swear that falsehood is truth under oath.\n\nSeems shoddy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In short: Plea bargain benefit society as a whole.\n\nIf a defendant exercises his/her constitutional right to a jury trial, the trial takes up a lot of time and preparation. A jury trial costs a significant amount of time and money. Additionally, judges have to set aside court time for the trial, when instead they could be doing other things. In most states where there are elected judges, judges want to have a large number of criminal convictions, ie. Plea deals so they can say they are tough on crime. In states with appointed judges, judges will get promoted based on their number of finished cases in a year or their efficiency.\n\nFor prosecutors, they favor plea agreements because a plea agreement removes any chance the defendant will have his/her conviction overturned. When one agrees to a plea one waives any and all right to appeal one's conviction; otherwise, all defendants are guaranteed at least one appeal, which are once again expensive. Additionally, defendants can petition for habeas corpus. When they plead guilty the government won't have to defend against these petitions.\n\nDefendants win because they get a lower sentence.\n\nIn the end pleas are ethical because they help society as a whole making the system more efficient.

They reduce the time and resources required for full trials, allow prosecutors to secure convictions without the risk of appeals, and often result in lighter sentences for defendants. While there are concerns about the ethics of plea bargaining, the system views them as a pragmatic solution that benefits society overall by making the legal process more efficient and manageable.

A federal court\u2019s authority is laid out in Article III of the federal constitution and in federal statute, which (per Article VI) is supreme over anything in the laws or constitution of any state.\n\nThere have been times where states attempted to challenge federal supremacy. Normally, this is handled by going to federal court. Decisions in state courts can ultimately be appealed to the US Supreme Court, which can reverse them if they incorrectly applied federal law. Most of the time, that\u2019s the end of matters: when a federal court rules, state officials comply.\n\nOccasionally, that\u2019s not enough. If a state disobeys the orders of a federal court, they can be enforced by federal agents.

This principle, known as federal supremacy, means that both state and federal courts are bound to apply federal law, regardless of anything in state laws or constitutions. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges established same-sex marriage as a constitutional right. Therefore, despite the state's attempt to prevent judicial review, both state and federal courts would be required to apply federal law and strike down the state law banning same-sex marriage.

According to the documentation, contracts do not inherently promise protection against future government actions like new taxes. Unless the buyer and seller specifically included a clause making the contract conditional on tax regulations remaining unchanged, they are bound by the original terms of the contract and any new laws that come into effect before the closing date. The government's implementation of a new tax is similar to other external factors that might affect a property transaction, such as changes in the neighborhood or city planning decisions. Buyers cannot automatically appeal or claim exemption from the tax simply because they signed the contract before the law was enacted, unless such provisions were explicitly included in their agreement."}}
