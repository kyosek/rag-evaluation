Does Bob have a case/standing?\n\nYes, this is a reasonably straightforward contract dispute. Once you contract to do something and you then don't do it, you are liable for damages. Contractual damages are assessed on an expectation basis \\- the innocent party is entitled to be placed financially in the same position as though the contract had been completed without the breach. Bob is entitled to have the item and not to be out\\-of\\-pocket more than he agreed to pay.\n\nBut ...\n-------\n\nThere may not be a contract \\- see [What is a contract and what is required for them to be valid?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6263/what-is-a-contract-and-what-is-required-for-them-to-be-valid)\n\nA contract is formed when the parties reach an agreement and most website terms and conditions are clear that this is **NOT** when the customer pays for it. For example, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000&ref_=footer_cou) says:\n\n> The Order Confirmation E\\-mail is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e\\-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched the product to you (the \"Dispatch Confirmation E\\-mail\").\n\nSo, here, two things have to happen before Amazon and you have a contract: they have to physically dispatch the goods *and* they have to send you an email saying they have. If they do one without the other, there is no contract. If your vendor has similar terms, you don't have a contract with them and are not entitled to contractual damages.\n\nYou would not have a case in equity because they were clear that there was no contract until these things happened.\n\nYou *might* be able to argue negligence if they sent the email without dispatching the goods but your damage basis would be different. Tort damage is calculated on a restoration basis, not an expectation basis, so you can recoup your losses but not claim any lost profits. It makes no difference here but if you had had a buyer who was going to pay you twice the price you paid, in contract you are entitled to the lost profit, in tort, you aren't.\n\nHowever, if the contract has a dispute resolution clause, that would normally have to be complied with before you can go to court. In some cases, this may prevent going to court at all, for example, if the dispute resolution clause included binding arbitration or expert determination.\n\nIf there is a choice of law clause then this will usually be binding, however, if this is a consumer contract in New Zealand then NZ consumer law will apply in addition.\n\nSimilarly, courts will usually observe a choice of venue clause.\n\n> With what reasonable time lapse between (false) shipment notification of the original order and placing the eBay order?\n\nA reasonable time. Depends on what the product is and what normal delivery times are. For a 5mm screw, a reasonable time is probably measured in months. For an aircraft carrier it's probably measured in decades.\n\n> 2. Does this sort of a claim fall under the jurisdiction of small claims court (given that the amount is less than the threshold)?\n\nNeither New Zealand nor England \\& Wales (bearing in mind Scotland and Northern Ireland are different jurisdictions) have small claims courts.\n\nThe correct venue in New Zealand is the [Disputes Tribunal](https://www.justice.govt.nz/courts/civil/claims-you-can-take-to-civil-court/) which is not a court, and in England and Wales it is the [County Court](https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money).\n\n> Procedurally, would it be more advantageous for Bob to file the claim in the UK or in New Zealand?\n\nAsk a lawyer in each jurisdiction.\n\n> Now Bob wants to claim damages from the store in the amount \"Total for the eBay order less total for the original store order\" \u2014 on top of full refund of the original order.\n\nBob is not entitled to a refund. He is entitled to damages.

The validity of Bob's claim depends on several factors:\n\n1. Whether a contract was actually formed, which often requires both dispatch of goods and confirmation of dispatch, according to many online retailers' terms.\n2. The specific terms of sale from the UK store, including any dispute resolution clauses.\n3. What constitutes a reasonable timeframe for delivery, considering the item and usual shipping times.\n4. The potential for a negligence claim if no contract exists.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because small claims courts don't exist in the UK or New Zealand for this purpose, and automatic entitlement to both damages and a refund is not guaranteed.

Answer D is too limiting, as Bob may be entitled to damages beyond a simple refund if a valid contract exists and was breached."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25813/can-schools-in-australia-fail-vce-students-for-missing-class", "docs_id": 25813, "title": "Can schools in Australia fail VCE students for missing class?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My high school has an attendance policy in place where you are allowed to miss 6 periods of class with a medical certificate and six without.

But, even then the U.S. Constitution had some narrow provisions that were applicable to the states including a ban on religious tests for public office that also applied to state and local governments. Also, most states also separated church and state in their own state constitutions, often in language parallel to the First Amendment, but sometimes stronger.\n\nFor example, the parallel provision adopted in Colorado's Bill of Rights when it became a state in 1876 stated:\n\n> Section 4\\. Religious freedom. The free exercise and enjoyment of\n>  religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall\n>  forever hereafter be guaranteed; and no person shall be denied any\n>  civil or political right, privilege or capacity, on account of his\n>  opinions concerning religion; but the liberty of conscience hereby\n>  secured shall not be construed to dispense with oaths or affirmations,\n>  excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with\n>  the good order, peace or safety of the state. **No person shall be\n>  required to attend or support any ministry or place of worship,\n>  religious sect or denomination against his consent. Nor shall any\n>  preference be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of\n>  worship.**\n\nThe [Treaty of Tripoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli) (1796\\), for example, made clear that Christians and Muslims were equal and that the government favored neither, and was not a Christian nation. At that time, France (an ally of the United States) was pretty much the only other country in the world without an established national church. \n\nMany of the notable Founders were [deists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism).\n\nIn all or most of the Southeast United States. there was never an established church. The last established churches in the United States (in New England, see, e.g. [here](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195399677.001.0001/acprof-9780195399677-chapter-4)), were disestablished before the Civil War. The successor denominations to the established churches of New England are the Congregational churches, the United Church of Christ, and the Unitarian Church (which later merged with the Universalist Church, a church which was never an established church but had similar doctrines).\n\nThe Bill of Rights eventually started to be applied to state and local governments relying doctrinally on authority granted in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution adopted during the Reconstruction era (specifically, in 1868\\). The incorporation doctrine applying the Bill of Rights to the states via 14th Amendment was [first applied in 1897](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights). Portions of the First Amendment had been incorporated not later than 1925\\. The free exercise clause of the First Amendment was incorporated in 1940\\. *[Cantwell v. Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantwell_v._Connecticut)*, 310 U.S. 296 (1940\\). It was all but inevitable that *Everson* (see below) would be decided that way that it was when it eventually came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1947, many years before the U.S. Supreme Court made that ruling. Like all major U.S. Supreme Court rulings, this ruling was preceded by lower court rulings reaching the same conclusion.\n\n> Black wrote the majority opinion in the 1947 US Supreme Court case\n>  Everson v Board of Education which redefined the separation of church\n>  and state as a barrier to church/state cooperation \u2013 reversing over\n>  150 years of legal precedent in which it had been recognized as a\n>  facilitator of church influence in government.

Board of Education* (U.S. 1947\\) followed already well established law and doctrine. There has never been a time in U.S. history after disestablishment in which facilitation of church influence in government was recognized. This is fake history produced by [Christian Dominionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_theology) to further their own political ends.\n\nThis isn't to say that *Everson v. Board of Education* wasn't an important holding. But, it was not a sharp departure for prior law. It was merely clarification of the details of existing law that was well established in particular stark and quotable terms. \n\nTo quote a brief portion of the Atlantic article linked in the question:\n\n> The attack on separation began as an attack on a letter by Thomas\n>  Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association, dated Jan. 1\\. 1802\\. \n>  Jefferson assured the Baptists that \"I contemplate with sovereign\n>  reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that\n>  their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of\n>  religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a\n>  wall of separation between Church \\& State.\" In 1985, then\\-Justice\n>  William Rehnquist wrote that \"unfortunately the Establishment Clause\n>  has been expressly freighted with Jefferson's misleading metaphor for\n>  nearly 40 years.\"\n> \n> \n> But this argument ignores a historical fact.

So you can't force them into a contract simply by accepting their offer. The default rule is that an ad is an invitation to make an offer rather than an offer that can be accepted.

Without knowing which country you're speaking of, it's impossible to be specific about possible consequences.\n\nThe first question would be whether using a VPN to access content outside of the US is a violation of Netflix (US) terms of service. The [TOS](https://help.netflix.com/legal/termsofuse) states\n\n> You may view Netflix content primarily within the country in which you\n>  have established your account and only in geographic locations where\n>  we offer our service and have licensed such content.

Additionally, \"household\" does not mean \"any relative\", so arguably any sharing of the account between siblings who live in different countries is a violation of the TOS. The fact that your brother is paying doesn't matter, nor does his citizenship matter. What does matter the most, to them, is that they have to license content from others, and the copyright holders may well impose prohibitions on distributing content outside a particular geographical zone. So they may have permission to distribute a film only in the US, and they are liable if the film is also distributed outside the US. \n\nBecause your brother has allowed you to access this content, they might terminate his account. They might also take you to court for copyright infringement, since any watching / downloading of video requires copying, and all copying requires permission (granted under the terms of service). You do not have any permission to watch stuff on Netflix. If they sue you in Delaware, they would have to get the judgment enforced in Tanzania (picking a hypothetical country), so the question is whether Tanzania would enforce infringement judgments. Or, they could sue you in Tanzania (since Netflix has actual presence in most countries).\n\nIt is impossible to know in advance whether Netflix would actually sue a person for illegally accessing content with a VPN, rather than just thwarting your attempt.

Additionally, the TOS states that content may only be viewed \"primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content.\" Therefore, sharing an account with a sibling in another country and using a VPN to access content not licensed in one's own country would violate these terms, regardless of who is paying for the account or where the account owner resides."}, "13": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60844/are-companies-at-sexual-discrimination-risk-for-using-whiteboard-interviews-duri", "docs_id": 60844, "title": "Are companies at sexual discrimination risk for using whiteboard interviews during the job interview?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Background**\n\nCurrently, many companies hiring software development engineers use a whiteboard algorithms interview technique.

If you are a corporate attorney and it was your job to minimize legal risks to that company, would you recommend to human resources that whiteboard interviews are now too legally risky and the company should avoid them, or do you believe instead that it is nothing to worry about and it is okay to do business as usual?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Barrister to instructing solicitor: \u201cAm I working for the plaintiff or defendant?\u201d\n\nPlaintiff\n---------\n\nYour honour, this excellent study and the expert testimony you have heard from the authors, clearly demonstrates that whiteboard testing is sexual discrimination by another name. The clear correlation between the gender of the interviewee and their ability to perform this task, which is unrelated to the job and is actually a test of how good the person is at handling performance anxiety, is being used to prejudicially and unlawfully screen out female applicants.\n\nDefendant\n---------\n\nYour honour, this discredited paper and the inconsistent testimony of the author clearly demonstrated that the methodology was flawed and the conclusions are unsupportable. When pressed, it turned out that the number of females encompassed by the catch\\-all word \u201call\u201d was 6 \\- hardly a sample big enough to draw any meaningful conclusions from. Further, it turned out that the number of men who also improved was unknown because *they didn\u2019t test them*! So we have the authors of a study with gender discrimination in its very methodology drawing asinine conclusions from it about gender discrimination!\n\nIt may be that whiteboard testing is better at finding competent actors than programmers and this may make it a terrible recruitment tool.

With respect to directors, this authority is formally expressly primarily at [8 Delaware Code \u00a7 141(a)](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.html).\n\nControl of a corporation doesn't have to align with beneficial economic ownership of a corporation under Delaware law (or for that matter, in for profit corporations in most U.S. jurisdictions).\n\nIt isn't uncommon in a Delaware corporation for control of a corporation to be vested in shareholders (and even some non\\-shareholders) who control only a minority of the economic value of a corporation's shares.\n\nThere are several different ways that this can be documented from a nuts and bolts legal perspective, but the bottom line is that he who controls the board controls the corporation, and that selection of the board of directors can be varied by agreement as expressed in the governing documents (always a certificate of incorporation, usually bylaws, and sometimes also some sort of shareholder's agreement or voting trust)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Delaware corporation, Investor B owns 5% of shares but controls 3 out of 5 board seats.

The law allows for significant flexibility in structuring corporate control, and it's common for control to be vested in parties who may not have majority economic ownership. In this case, even though Investor B owns only 5% of shares, their control of 3 out of 5 board seats gives them effective control of the company, assuming the governing documents allow for this arrangement.

Your hypothetical seems to match the facts of that case:\n\n> Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air. When a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a menu on Aereo\u2019s website. Aereo\u2019s system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna, which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet. A server saves the data in a subscriber\\-specific folder on Aereo\u2019s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber\u2019s screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over\\-the\\-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that Aereo infringed the copyright owner's exclusive right to transmit or communicate a work to the public.\n\n[Here is more background on this case from SCOTUSblog](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/american-broadcasting-companies-inc-v-aereo-inc/)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company called StreamSat develops a service that allows users to watch free-to-air satellite TV channels over the internet.

Users can then access these streams on their devices without needing their own satellite dish. Based on the Am. Broad. Cos. v.

The case of Am. Broad. Cos. v. Aereo, Inc. established a precedent that services which retransmit broadcast signals over the internet, even if those signals are freely available over the air, are infringing on the copyright holders' exclusive right to transmit their work to the public. Even though StreamSat is dealing with satellite rather than terrestrial broadcasts, the principle is likely to be the same. The fact that the original broadcasts are free-to-air doesn't change the copyright implications of retransmitting them. Option A is incorrect because free-to-air status doesn't override copyright.

A trademark protected in France, say may well not be protected in the US and vice versa.\n\nDomain registration is a different thing, and are not necessarily tied to a trademark (although registering a domain that infringes an existing trademark will often be disallowed).\n\nThe [Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2012-02-25-en) (UDRP) is applied in disputes over the ownership of domain names. It states in section 2 that:\n\n> By applying to register a domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby represent and warrant to us that (a) the statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; (b) to your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party; (c) you are not registering the domain name for an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. It is your responsibility to determine whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone else's rights.\n\nIf you have registered a domain name, and another person or firm complains that the name is \"confusingly similar\" to an existing name or to a valid trademark, you might be required to participate in an arbitration proceeding under the UDRP, or else forfeit the registration. Note that noting happens if no one complains.\n\nSection 4(s) of the policy reads:\n\n> You are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a \"complainant\") asserts ... that\n> \n> \n> * (i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n> * (ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n> * (iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\n> \n> \n> In the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present.\n\nNote that\n\n\"Bad faith\" can be shown by evidence that you obtained the domain for purposes of selling or renting it, not for use; that you intended ti prevent a valid trademark owner from obtaining the name, and have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; that your purpose was to disrupt the business of the other; that you intended to attract users who were looking for the other site.\n\nNote also that the complainant bears the burden of proof of the elements of the complaint, including the bad faith in use of a domain. Evidence of actual use for legitimate purposes will be relevant to this. But note that a valid trademark from any jurisdiction will be considered in a n arbitration under the policy, not just US marks.\n\nNote that an arbitration is not a court case, and court rules do not apply. But under section 4k of the policy:\n\n> The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded.\n\nSo the case may become a court case.\n\nIn an actual trademark case, the first user of the mark in the relevant jurisdiction often has a key advantage. In domain name disputes, this is less true. However, having had the name registered before it began to be used by a complainant can be evidence of lack of bad faith, which can be very important.\n\nThe UDRP is generally included in all contracts to register a domain name, so you are almost surely a party to this agreement already."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in the US has been using a domain name for 16 years, which they registered without knowledge of a foreign company's trademark. The foreign company recently registered their trademark in the US, 5 years after the domain was registered. The foreign company now wants the domain name. Under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), which of the following is most likely to be a successful defense for the domain owner?\n\nA) The domain was registered before the US trademark, so the owner has absolute rights to it.\nB) The foreign company's trademark is not valid in the US, so they have no claim to the domain.\nC) The domain owner can prove they have been using the domain for legitimate business purposes without intent to disrupt the foreign company's business.\nD) International trademarks carry no weight in UDRP proceedings, so the foreign company's claim is invalid.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most successful defense under UDRP would be to demonstrate legitimate use without bad faith. Option C addresses this by showing the domain owner has been using the domain for legitimate business purposes without intent to disrupt the foreign company's business. This directly counters the \"bad faith\" element that a complainant must prove.\n\nOption A is incorrect because earlier registration doesn't guarantee absolute rights. Option B is incorrect because the foreign company now has a US trademark, and even foreign trademarks can be considered in UDRP proceedings. Option D is incorrect because international trademarks can be considered in UDRP arbitrations, even if they don't have the same weight as in court proceedings."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45894/in-the-us-is-there-any-law-that-governs-the-amount-of-pollution-generated-on-pr", "docs_id": 45894, "title": "In the US, is there any law that governs the amount of pollution generated on private land?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm thinking about a scenario where one does car repairs, shoots in their backyard, and handles industrial materials.

It's not easy to get a handle on these laws. \n\nOne problem, which you mention, is our federalism. In the US, you are likely to be subject to federal, state and local governments. And each of those governments is likely to have different rules covering different aspects of keeping air, water and ground clean. Those different rules may be enforced by different agencies, or different parts of the same agencies. Finally, regulatory agencies each have their own processes for making and enforcing law. \n\nPut these various governments, statutes, rules and procedures together and the result can be overwhelming and baffling, even to experts. \n\nUnfortunately, if you want to understand what laws you will need to pay attention to you, you have to make sense of this system.

If you know the big picture, it's easier to keep track of the various detailed parts you come across as you dive into the rules regarding specific topics.\n\nAs far as the law of hazardous waste, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) has some nice web pages covering various aspects of the law of hazardous wastes. You should probably start with their [learn\\-the\\-basics](https://www.epa.gov/hw/learn-basics-hazardous-waste) page. At the federal level, hazard waste is covered by the RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act). EPA has a page giving an [overview](https://www.epa.gov/rcra/resource-conservation-and-recovery-act-rcra-overview#how%20does%20rcra%20work) of the RCRA generally, and a page giving an overview of its [application](https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic/regulatory-information-topic-waste) to hazardous waste.\n\nOnce you've digested these, you'll be in good shape to use your favorite search engine to do more focused searches.

The police have the power to enforce existing law, but not the power to create new crimes. Part of police power is the power to use force to enforce laws. If a person is trying to kill another (which is a crime), the police can use force to stop the person from committing this crime.\n\nPolice power can be statutorily encoded (Parliament passes a law saying what police can and cannot do), or it could be part of common law. As for laws regulating a suspect, there may be a specific statutory prohibition \u2013 \"you may not reach into your pocket\" \u2013 or there is a common law inference to be made, that if the police have the power to order you to not reach into your pocket you may be forced to comply.\n\nThe subtle distinction here is that if it is a crime to reach into your pocket when told not to, you can be prosecuted and imprisoned. If there is no such crime, you just have the consequence that you can be roughed up to some extent for disobeying the police order.\n\nOne act of Parliament is the [Offences against the Person Act 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38) \u00a738 which says\n\n> Whosoever . . . shall assault any person with intent to resist or\n> prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of himself or of any other\n> person for any offence, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being\n> convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to\n> be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years,\n\nNB \"assault\" does not require physical contact: creating apprehension suffices. Another law is the [Police Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89) \u00a789 which says\n\n> Any person who resists or wilfully obstructs a constable in the\n> execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the\n> execution of his duty, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on\n> summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month\n> or to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale, or to both\n\nThese laws do not exhaustively list all of the things that are forbidden (e.g. they do not say \"may not bite. nor scratch, nor kick...\"), instead, the prohibitions fall under the general rubric of assault and resisting.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it is possible that the person could be criminally prosecuted, but even in lieu of a prosecution, it is strongly probable that the police use of force in this instance was lawful.

While there is no specific law that explicitly forbids reaching for pockets during a stop and search, such an action could be interpreted as resisting or obstructing a police officer in the execution of their duty.

How do I stop this immediately?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It may depend on the structure of your company's arrangement with the credit card company, as well. I am familiar with at least one setup where each cardholder is issued a card **in their own name** to be used as a charge card, pending reimbursement from central accounts for approved expenses.\n\nFor that organization, each cardholder is responsible for paying off their card balance each month (one can claim expenses mid\\-trip, if necessary), and failure to pay it off is a hit on their personal credit \\- which would explain why the bank needs the home address for each cardholder. Essentially, they have a card which is only authorized for official expenses, but any mistakes made (eg, improper charges, failing to file an expense report in a timely manner, etc) fall to the cardholder to remedy. I think this is meant to provide more incentive for proper management of funds, as they are also rather aggressive at searching out misconduct and fraud among those provided with charge cards.\n\nFor that organization, the answer to your second question (how can I stop that) would be to return the card to the credit card issuer.

Is there a similar doctrine that applies to\n> argumentation in the same brief?\n\nNo.\n\nThe general rule is that a party is permitted to argue inconsistent positions in the alternative within a brief. When a party does so without expressly saying so, it is assumed that they are arguing in the alternative unless the party clearly indicates otherwise (and is just being illogical).\n\nBut the law in the context of arbitration is a special case that doesn't align perfectly with the general rule, and makes different distinctions sometimes.\n\nUnder the substantive law of arbitration clause validity, sometimes a party can be forced to arbitrate even if there is a possibility that the underlying contract is unenforceable, with the arbitrator making that decision. But, a party cannot be forced to arbitrate in every case where the validity of the underlying alleged agreement is in doubt, simply because an agreement, on its face, contains or references an arbitration agreement.\n\nUnder the Federal Arbitration Act, certain preliminary decisions are vested in the courts even if a written arbitration purports to provide otherwise, if a party choses to raise those issues. A dispute over which of two significantly different competing arbitration agreements applies to an issue between the parties could be such a circumstance.\n\nThus, a term that provides that \"delegates threshold questions such as the 'applicability, existence, scope, or validity' of the agreement to the arbitrator,\" is partially void as a matter of public policy under the Federal Arbitration Act, although some of its retains its validity.\n\nFor example, you can't delegate the question of the existence of an arbitration agreement to an arbitrator if that question is disputed, even if the contract says otherwise.\n\nIn arbitration cases, there is a rather elaborate jurisprudence governing what issues are for a court to decided and what are for an arbitrator to decision when the right of a party to arbitrate, and/or the validity of the underlying contract, are disputed, that makes some very fine distinctions between different kinds of arguments.\n\nFor example, if a party claims that he never had dealings with a party that presents an unsigned document that is a contract and also asserts that this party is bound to an arbitration agreement, that question can be decided by a court.\n\nBut, if a party signed an agreement with a plain vanilla arbitration clause but claims it is unenforceable because it was induced by duress or undue influence, the arbitration will usually go forward with the arbitrator deciding the validity of the contract.\n\nWhen a decision is decided by a court, or by an arbitrator, is not easily summarized or manifestly obvious without a review of the relevant case law which is voluminous and intricate. *See, e.g., Samson v.

It is *not* to prevent forgery; claims that a signature was forged are *vanishingly* rare, as are actual forged signatures. The difficulty of forging a signature is not particularly a factor in whether or not it can legally be used, although it may be a factor in how much a jury believes it. And you can introduce other evidence to justify the existence of the contract, like negotiation documents and the conduct of both sides. \n\nThe primary point of a signature is to show *acceptance*.

Here is [one real life example](https://www.myopiaprofile.com/does-low-dose-atropine-cause-blurry-vision).\n\n> **Incorrect dispensing.** A key consideration is a pharmacy dispensing error. In Australia, a [number of cases were reported in 2018 and 2019](https://www.optometry.org.au/patient_care_management/optometrists-urged-to-write-must-be-compounded-on-atropine-scripts-to-avoid-dispensing-errors/) where 1% atropine was dispensed to children where 0\\.01% atropine had been prescribed. In response, Optometry Australia recommended that atropine prescriptions include the specific note 'MUST BE COMPOUNDED' to avoid this dispensing error.\n\nBut Pharmacy denies any wrongdoing, and insists that it dispensed the correct medication.\n\n### Question\n\n#### How can Patient get his compounded medication audited and inspected, to determine if the pharmacy dispensed exactly what the doctor ordered? Would Patient submit a sample of this medication to a laboratory? What kind of laboratories can assist Patient?\n\nFor example, presuppose a physician prescribed 0\\.01% Atropine. Then Pharmacy labelled the end product 0\\.01% Atropine. But it's impossible to distinguish 0\\.01% from 0\\.02%, 0\\.05%, etc. Atropine by eye. How can Patient determine if pharmacy truly dispensed 0\\.01% Atropine, or negligently dispensed some other wrong concentration?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You get a lab to test it\n------------------------\n\nYou should clearly document the chain of custody (ideally with photos) from the unopened packaging to the lab.

For example, if the good not yet purchased was damaged through the negligence of the buyer, or was custom built for the buyer, the risk of loss would be on the buyer due to exceptions to the general rule. The cause of the damage would also matter in terms of analysis of the buyer's warranty rights that might be setoff against a claim from the seller. But, that is a typical format (ideally with more full elaboration of the analysis and the source of the rule) for an answer to a question like that one.\n\nOften those four bullet points would be proceeded by a heading: \"Facts:\" setting for the facts of the case as set forth in the question. A really first rate \"Facts\" section would also set forth facts that could conceivably be relevant to an answer that are not currently known.\n\nIf you prefer a more informal presentation, skip the headings and simply provide that information in that order in successive paragraphs.\n\nOf course, you would also typically set forth the name of the people answering the question (with contact information, if necessary), an identification of the class it is filed in and the question it is in response to (e.g. \"Regarding: Chapter 7, Exercise 4 assigned September 30, 2019\") if applicable, and the date that your response is submitted. This would typically go in a heading of some type on the top of the first page of the response.\n\nIf there are multiple pages, you should have page number and a sufficient header or footer on the second and subsequent pages to identify which answer it is a part of if the pages are printed and then dropped and jumbled with other people's responses.\n\nOf course, first, you should read the syllabus and any specific instructions regarding that assignment from the instructor and should disregard anything in this answer that is contrary to that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a business law exam, you are asked to analyze a scenario using the IRAC method.

As the person who owns the actual photos, what are my rights? Do I own the copyright, and if I post them online, do people need permission from me to use them? Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The only way you could own the copyright (as a non\\-creator) is if you have purchased or inherited that right. You might have inherited the right to a photo taken by Aunt Tillie, but there would have to be an explicit transfer of ownership of the right from the former owner to you.\n\nFailing that, the question is what the copyright status of the photo is. The first question is whose law you are dealing with: US? UK? France? Under US law, there is a higher probability that copyright has expired. Assume these are US photos. Then the next question is whether the photo was published: let's assume it was not (it if had been published that could work to your advantage because but you would have to prove that it was published). Then you must determine whether it was registered: again, assume it was not. The point is that copyright could have expired under certain conditions, under US law. Unregistered unpublished works are protected according to the provisions of [\u00a7302 of US copyright law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/302) (as specified in [\u00a7303](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/303)), where the rule is \"70 years after the author's death\". Then you have to know when the author (photographer) died. If it was before 1949, the work is not protected by copyright.\n\nIn short, you have to know a lot of facts about a work, in order to be able to know whether it is still protected. [This pamphlet](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf) by the US Copyright office explains the rules pertaining to copyright duration.

John wants to post these photos online and claim copyright.

According to U.S. copyright law, for unpublished and unregistered works (which these photographs likely are), copyright protection lasts for 70 years after the author's death. If the photographer died before 1949, more than 70 years would have passed, and the works would be in the public domain. John doesn't automatically own the copyright by purchasing the physical photos (eliminating A), and the antique shop likely didn't have the copyright to transfer (eliminating C).

The location where the LLC members live is not the determining factor for registration. What matters is where the business actually conducts its operations. Even if the LLC is registered in Wyoming, if the entrepreneur is doing the work in Florida, they would need to foreign file in Florida. Additionally, while having a mailing address in Wyoming doesn't automatically establish it as the place of business, conducting operations in Florida would necessitate foreign filing there. The answer also aligns with the principle that foreign filing is required in states where the company does business, regardless of where it's initially registered.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the requirement to foreign file where business is conducted.

These could be based on some artwork they've seen, a movie character, or some other fictional being.\n\nNow, I do want my users to be able to upload image 'references' to these things. But again, I'm afraid this will fall under copyright infringement.\n\nHowever, I've also heard about something called 'transformativeness'. Does writing a story or using artwork as references for roleplay count as 'transformative'?\n\nIn the Wikipedia page about it, [link here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformativeness), it says:\n\n> In United States copyright law, transformativeness is a characteristic of some derivative works that makes them transcend, or **place in a new light**, the underlying works on which they are based. **In computer\\- and Internet\\-related works, the transformative characteristic of the later work is often that it provides the public with a benefit not previously available to it, which would otherwise remain unavailable.** Such transformativeness weighs heavily in a fair use analysis and may excuse what seems a clear copyright infringement from liability.\n\nAnd I'd argue that putting a history, personality, setting, and acting those things out among other roleplayers would count towards both putting the artwork into a new light as well as bringing a new benefit for the public that wouldn't otherwise be there.\n\nIn addition to the above.
