A judge in Northern Ireland had made an anonymity direction in the case, but Mr Eastwood used parliamentary privilege to circumvent this and publicly name Soldier F. As the linked article shows, the media have resolutely refused to repeat Mr Eastwood's identification, but it is not clear to me if this is for legal or ethical reasons.\n\nCan anyone in the UK (especially anyone in Northern Ireland) now name Soldier F in the context of directly quoting Mr Eastwood's remark? Is the anonymity direction now a dead letter, or does anyone using the name in the context of quoting Mr Eastwood and are they thus protected as a consequence of parliamentary privilege? Or does the order still apply to everywhere outside of Parliament, and one could be arrested for contempt of court for using the name in public?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At common law, parliamentary privilege does not extend to the republication of words spoken in Parliament: [*Stockdale v Hansard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockdale_v_Hansard) (1839\\) 112 ER 1160\\. To overcome this, Parliament passed the [*Parliamentary Papers Act 1840*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Papers_Act_1840), which provides absolute privilege for a report published \u201cby or under the authority of either House of Parliament\u201d (ie. Hansard).\n\n[Section 3 of the Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/3-4/9/section/3) provides qualified privilege for publishing an \u201cextract or abstract\u201d of Hansard. In relation to statements made under parliamentary privilege in breach of a court order, the Committee on Super\\-Injunctions wrote in its report on [Super\\-Injunctions, Anonymised Injunctions and Open Justice](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Reports/super-injunction-report-20052011.pdf) (May 2011\\):\n\n> In order to obtain the benefit of the immunity from civil or criminal proceedings under section 3, the individual must prove, before a jury, that the relevant material was published in good faith and without malice. It is an open question whether publication of any extract from or abstract of Hansard which had the effect of frustrating a court order and was deliberately intended to do so would be held to be in good faith and without malice \u2026\n> \n> \n> Where media reports go beyond, or fall outside, the ambit of protection provided by the 1840 Act, it is the common law which determines whether there is any protection from contempt proceedings for breach of court orders. Mr Woolf noted that while *Wason v Walter* (1868\\) 4 QB 73 established a limited common law protection in defamation proceedings for honest, fair and accurate reporting of Parliamentary proceedings, there was \u2018no reported case which authoritatively decides the extent of protection against proceedings for contempt available in respect of fair and accurate reports of proceedings of Parliament\u2019 \u2026\n> \n> \n> It therefore appears to be an open question whether, and to what extent, the common law protects media reporting of Parliamentary proceedings where such reporting appears to breach the terms of a court order and is not covered by the protection provided by the 1840 Act. What is clear is that unfettered reporting of Parliamentary proceedings (in apparent breach of court orders) has not been established as a clear right.\n\nIn its report on [Parliamentary Privilege](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtprivi/30/30.pdf) (June 2013\\), the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege said that the *Parliamentary Papers Act* would generally not apply to the contemporary media, and that the defence of qualified privilege was limited to defamation actions:\n\n> An \u201cabstract\u201d was defined by the 1999 Joint Committee as a \u201csummary or epitome\u201d. Thus media reports of what goes on in Parliament, even if they draw on documents published by order of the House, such as Hansard, do not generally enjoy the (qualified) protection afforded by section 3 of the 1840 Act\u2014a point confirmed by Sarah McColl, Solicitor Advocate in the BBC Editorial Legal Department, in her oral evidence on behalf of the Media Lawyers Association \u2026\n> \n> \n> Outside the field of defamation, it does not appear that media reports of parliamentary proceedings (as opposed to extracts or abstracts) enjoy legal protection. This arises most obviously in the case of breaches of court injunctions \u2026\n\nThe Joint Committee recommended that the law should be reformed:\n\n> On balance, we do not support extending absolute privilege to all reports, including media sketches and summaries, of proceedings in Parliament \u2026 we consider that the existing protection of qualified privilege\u2014that is, that all fair and accurate reports are protected, unless they can be proved by the claimant to have been made maliciously\u2014already provides a robust defence of press freedom \u2026\n> \n> \n> At the same time, we acknowledge that the media need clarity and certainty. The *Parliamentary Papers Act 1840* provides qualified protection for all \u201cextracts and abstracts\u201d of parliamentary publications (including broadcasts), but as we have already said these terms do not appear to cover media reports or editorial comment \u2026\n> \n> \n> We endorse the recommendation of the 1999 Joint Committee that \\[the] *Parliamentary Papers Act 1840* should be replaced by modern statutory provisions \u2026 We recommend that these new provisions should \u2026\n> \n> \n> * establish that qualified privilege applies to all fair and accurate reports of parliamentary proceedings in the same way as to abstracts and extracts of those proceedings;\n> * provide that in all court proceedings in respect of such fair and accurate reports, extracts or abstracts, the claimant or prosecution shall be required to prove that the defendant acted maliciously \u2026\n\nHowever, it appears that Parliament has not taken up the Joint Committee\u2019s recommendation, and the extent of any common law protection remains an open question. Accordingly, the article linked in the question states that \u201cThe BBC is not naming Soldier F for legal reasons.\u201d", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A journalist in the UK is preparing an article about Colum Eastwood's recent naming of \"Soldier F\" in Parliament. The journalist wants to include the soldier's name in the article, quoting Eastwood directly. Given the current state of parliamentary privilege and media law, what is the most accurate assessment of the legal risks involved?\n\nA) The journalist can safely publish the name, as parliamentary privilege extends full protection to media reports of parliamentary proceedings.\nB) The journalist should refrain from publishing the name, as doing so would definitely result in contempt of court charges.\nC) The journalist can publish the name with qualified privilege, provided they can prove it was done in good faith and without malice.\nD) The journalist has absolute protection under the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 if they publish an exact extract from Hansard.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Parliamentary privilege does not automatically extend to media republication of words spoken in Parliament (Stockdale v Hansard).\n2. The Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 provides qualified privilege for publishing an \"extract or abstract\" of Hansard under Section 3.\n3. For statements made under parliamentary privilege that breach a court order, the individual must prove the publication was made in good faith and without malice to benefit from immunity.\n4. The extent of common law protection for media reporting of parliamentary proceedings breaching court orders remains an open question.\n5. The contemporary media generally cannot rely on the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 for protection, as noted by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege.\n\nOption A is incorrect because parliamentary privilege does not automatically extend full protection to media reports. Option B is too absolute, as there are potential defenses available. Option D is incorrect because the Act's protection is qualified, not absolute, and may not apply to contemporary media reports.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, understand the nuances of parliamentary privilege and media law, and apply this knowledge to a complex, real-world scenario involving freedom of the press and court orders."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21649/due-process-hearing-concerning-returning-to-work-after-medical-leave", "docs_id": 21649, "title": "&quot;due process&quot; hearing concerning returning to work after medical leave", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My wife works at a local university as an accountant. Or perhaps I should say \"worked\" ... she suffered a brain injury in late December. She has recovered physically for the most part, but still has significant issues with short\\-term memory. So knowledge work is not a very realistic option at this point, and consequently, she is still on medical leave.\n\nWe just (yesterday) received a letter from the university. They want to convene a \"due process\" hearing to determine whether she can return to work and what accommodations might be necessary.\n\nIt's not (IMO) unreasonable for them to ask whether and/or when she intends on returning to work. And we live in a state (Ohio) where employment is \"at will\" (either the employee or employer may sever the relationship at any time).\n\nAt the same time, recovery from this type of injury is typically 1\\-2 years. (That doesn't necessarily mean everyone makes a full recovery. It means that, however much a person recovers, 90%\\-95% of that is going to happen withing 12\\-24 months.) So December 2017 / January 2018 would be a more appropriate time to have a discussion about her long\\-term capabilities.\n\nAnd I am somewhat concerned that the hearing is next week, and they want a list of people who will testify on her behalf by the end of this week (three days from now). It was probably unlikely that I could get any of her doctors or therapists to this meeting; but with so little notice, I have zero chance of getting any of her medical providers to the meeting.\n\nI'm not looking for specific legal advice so much as I'm wondering if this type of hearing is a standard procedure ... and if so, I'd like to have a rough idea of what to expect.\n\n**Update / Clarification:**  \n\nMy wife's employer is a state school (not private). I don't know for certain whether her position would be classified as civil service or not; but I would guess that it is (civil service), since she is required to contribute to the state employees' retirement fund.\n\nI do not believe her position is covered by a collective bargaining agreement \\-\\- as I understand it, most positions at this university are not (although some functions, e.g. maintenance or campus police, may be an exception).\n\n**Update 2:**  \n\nThe university agreed to postpone the hearing. And I did contact an employment attorney. His opinion was that this was probably just a routine formality \\-\\- policy does say that medical leave should be reviewed at or about six months \\-\\- they would probably just extend her leave, and it would be a waste of time for him to attend the meeting with us.\n\nHe was partially correct. The meeting certainly was a formality, and it probably would have been a waste of time for him to attend. But as to the outcome ... they had obviously already made the decision to terminate her employment.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are procedural rules in place in the state universities pertaining to any negative action, but the exact rules depend on the nature of the position. Faculty for example have one set of rules, students another, and staff yet others. A hearing is thus required to do anything significant (such as fire an employee), so it is very common. The function of a \"due process\" hearing is to make certain that the rules are followed before visiting a negative outcome on an employee. This is not a matter that you should try to deal with on your own: you need an attorney.\n\nThere are two distinct issues involved in such a procedure. One is whether the hierarchy of fact\\-finders follows the process. Usually there is a technical screw\\-up (I was part of the process in Ohio), but typically not anything that would lead to overturning a final decision. The other is whether there are specific disability or work\\-related injury protections.\n\nThe timing of such a hearing and matters of notice would figure prominently in the first response from an attorney. Three days notice is not inconceivable, but it is arguably unreasonable, which is one of the first things that an attorney would tell them.

In 1869 there was [*Griffin\u2019s Case*, 11 F. Cas. 7, 2 Am. Law T. Rep. U. S. Cts. 93; 8 Am. Law Reg. N. S. 358](https://cite.case.law/f-cas/11/7/?full_case=true&format=html). This was tried by Chief Justice Chase, in his role as a Circuit Justice, not as a Supreme Court case.\n\nOne Caesar Griffin was accused of shooting with intent to kill, tried before a Virginia state court, convicted, and sentenced to two years in prison. He then filed a writ of *Habes Corpus* claiming that his imprisonment was unlawful, because the jusge before whom he was tried, Hugh W. Sheffey, (in the words of Justice Chase):\n\n> in December, 1849, \\[Sheffey] as a member of the Virginia house of delegates, took an oath to support the constitution of the United States, and also that he was a member of the legislature of Virginia in 1862\\. during the late Rebellion, and as such voted for measures to sustain the so\\-called Confederate States in their war against the United States; and it was claimed in behalf of the petitioner, that he thereby became, and was at the time of the trial of the petitioner, disqualified to hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state ...\n\nSeveral other people tried and convicted before Judge Sheffey in the circuit court of Rockbridge county, including some convicted of murder, filed similar *Habes Corpus* petitions, claiming that Sheffey was prohibited by Section 3 from holding office, and that therefore their convictions were invalid. Judge Sheffey had been appointed to the office of Judge after the end of the US Civil War by the reorganized government of Virginia, the one recognized as valid by the Federal Government. He was appointed before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. There was no dispute that he fit the letter of the group of prohibited persons in Section 3\\.\n\nJustice Chase wrote:\n\n> The general question to be determined on the appeal from this order is whether or not the sentence of the circuit court of Rock\\-bridge county must be regarded as a nullity because of the disability to hold any office under the state of Virginia, imposed by the fourteenth amendment, on the person, who, in fact, presided as judge in that court.\n\nJustice Chase rejected the suggestion that all official actions by Sheffey and anyone in a similar position were automatically void and of no authority because of sectio0n 3\\. He wrote that:\n\n> The proposition maintained in behalf of the petitioner, is, that this prohibition, instantly, on the day of its promulgation, vacated all offices held by persons within the category of prohibition, and made all official acts, performed by them, since that day, null and void.\n\nAfter pointing out that many of the offials of the reconstructed governments of the sothern states were withign the terms of the prohibition of section 3, Chae went on to write:\n\n> If the construction now contended for be given to the prohibitive section, the effect must be to annul all official acts performed by these officers. No sentence, no judgment, no decree, no acknowledgment of a deed, no record of a deed, no sheriff\u2019s or commissioner\u2019s sale \u2014 in short no official act \u2014 is of the least validity. It is impossible to m\u00e9asure the evils which such a construction would add to the calamities which have already fallen upon the people of these states.\n\nAs a further reason not to construe section 3 as instantly and automatically removing all such officials, Chase wrote:\n\n> Now it is undoubted that those provisions of the constitution which deny to the legislature power to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, or to pass a bill of attainder or an ex post facto, are inconsistent in their spirit and general purpose with a provision which, at once without trial, deprives a whole class of persons of offices held by them, for cause, however grave. It is true that no limit can be imposed on the people when exercising their sovereign power in amending their own constitution of government. But it is a necessary presumption that the people in the exercise of that power, seek to confirm and improve, rather than to weaken and impair the general spirit of the constitution.\n\n...\n\n> Is there, then, any other reasonable construction? ... The object of the amendment is to exclude from certain offices a certain class of persons. Now, it is obviously impossible to do this by a simple declaration, whether in the constitution or in an act of congress, that all persons included within a particular description shall not hold office. For, in the very nature of things, it must be ascertained what particular individuals are embraced by the definition, before any sentence of exclusion can be made to operate. To accomplish this ascertainment and ensure effective results, proceedings, evidence, decisions, and enforcements of decisions, more or less formal, are indispensable; and these can only be provided for by congress.\n\n...\n\n> \\[I]t seems to put beyond reasonable question the conclusion that the intention of the people of the United States, in adopting the fourteenth amendment, was to create a disability, to be removed in proper cases by a two\\-thirds vote, and to be made operative in other cases by the legislation of congress in its ordinary course.\n\nChase also note that, 2 months after the conviction of Griffin:\n\n> in February, 1869, congress adopted a joint resolution entitled \u201ca resolution respecting the provisional governments of Virginia and Texas.\u201d In this resolution it was provided that persons, \u201cholding office in the provisional governments of Virginia and Texas,\u201d but unable to take and subscribe the test oath prescribed by the act of July 2, 1862 \\[12 Stat. 502], except those relieved from disability, \u201cbe removed therefrom;\u201d\n\nand that this indicates that such people were regarded by Congress as having remained in office and not beign automatically removed.\n\n*Griffin's Case* seems to establish that **some** proceeding is needed to establish when a person falls under the exclusion rule of Section 3 of the 14th. In 1869 this was done by military order. In 1870 Congress passed a statute providing for criminal proceedings in such cases. This was repealed at the end of Reconstruction.\n\nCurrently [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2383](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383) makes \"rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof,\" a crime, and provides that anyone convicted of it \"shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\" This is not quite the same as the section 3 disqualification. One the one hand, it does not depend on a prior oath to support the constitution, and on the other it does not appear to ban holding a state or local office. But it shows how a similar law could be drafted by Congress.\n\nLegislative declaration\n-----------------------\n\n> Can a Congressional resolution, or a Federal statute declare that specific people have so engaged?\n\nThis is probably prohibited as a *Bill of Attainder*, that is, a legislative declaration, without trial, that particular persons are guilty of particular crimes.\n\nOther Proceedings\n-----------------\n\n> What proceedings would be needed to establish that a person had \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\"?\n\nIf a person subject to the section 3 disqualification was elected to either house of Congress, that house could refuse to seat such person, or expel him or her, as the Constitution permits.

The governor wants to remove this legislator from office immediately based on Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. Which of the following approaches is most legally sound and consistent with historical precedent?\n\nA) The governor can unilaterally remove the legislator, as Section 3 is self-executing and requires no additional action\nB) The state legislature must pass a resolution declaring the legislator engaged in insurrection before removal\nC) The legislator must be criminally convicted of insurrection in federal court before removal\nD) A separate legal proceeding, established by Congress, is likely necessary to determine if the legislator falls under Section 3\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the 14th Amendment's Section 3 and its historical application. The correct answer is D, based on several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. Griffin's Case (1869) established that some proceeding is needed to determine when a person falls under Section 3's exclusion rule. Chief Justice Chase argued that it's impossible to exclude a class of persons from office by a simple declaration without ascertaining which individuals are embraced by the definition.\n\n2. Chase concluded that the intention of the 14th Amendment was to create a disability that would be \"made operative in other cases by the legislation of congress in its ordinary course.\"\n\n3. Historically, Congress has taken action to implement Section 3, such as the 1870 statute providing for criminal proceedings (later repealed).\n\n4. The documentation suggests that a legislative declaration targeting specific individuals (option B) would likely be prohibited as a Bill of Attainder.\n\n5. While criminal conviction of insurrection (option C) would clearly lead to exclusion, it's not explicitly required by Section 3.\n\n6. Option A is incorrect because the documentation clearly argues against automatic removal without due process.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the nuanced legal and historical context of the 14th Amendment's application."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59476/definition-of-relative-in-uk-contract-law", "docs_id": 59476, "title": "Definition of &quot;relative&quot; in UK contract law", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a contract that requires a witness signature.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states that there is no universally applicable definition of \"relative\" in contract law, and definitions vary across different areas of law and jurisdictions.\n\n2. While the third cousin might seem distant enough, the lack of a clear definition means using them could potentially breach the contract's terms, even if not actionably so.\n\n3.

The correct answer, C, balances legal obligations with practical considerations:\n\n1. Setting aside funds ensures the homeowner is prepared to pay when the invoice arrives, avoiding potential cash flow issues that could lead to default.\n2. Waiting for the invoice aligns with the contract terms, which state that payment is due within 5 days of the invoice date. There's no explicit obligation for the homeowner to pursue the invoice.\n3.

Spenceley*, [\\[1972] 2 O.R. 429](https://canlii.ca/t/g17r5) (C.A.)):\n\n> The Court was referred to a number of cases under the law as it then stood whereby it was strictly required that special damages be set forth in the pleading and whereby no plea of general damages would be entertained. This was changed in England by the Defamation Act, 1952 (U.K.), c. 66, s. 3 (1\\), and here by a similar section, s. 19(a) of the Libel and Slander Act, 1958\n> (Ont.), c. 51 ...\n\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal quoted from *Clavet v.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. S3(1)(a) of the Act states that it's not necessary to allege or prove special damage if \"the words upon which the action is founded are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and are published in writing or other permanent form.\"\n\n2.

When opening a bank account she used her correct social security number, but used her similar planned new name instead of her current legal name. Well of course she discovered it was much harder to have your name legally changed than she believed, and you are required to post about it in the papers which somewhat defeats the point. So she may have committed a kind of fraud or forgery for very innocent reasons, not financial gain.\n\nWhat sort of legal repercussions might this have? She would like to get her old financial records from this now closed account, but her ID does not match. Might she have any way to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an interesting question and one that does not have a uniform answer.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, while there is a court proceeding by which you can change your name, there is also case law precedent that says your legal name is what you go by even if it doesn't match your birth certificate or other official records.\\* \n\nFor example, I have a client who has a birth name completely different from the one she uses in day to day life (as different as, for example, \"Sophia\" and \"Betsy\" are from each other) that she picked up in college and just started living under for reasons that she could never really fully explain to me in a way that made sense. Under Colorado law, the name she used on a day to day basis is one of her legal names, even though there was never a legal name change proceeding conducted in a court.\n\nI happen to know someone who set up a bank account with a name other than on their official documents and with their own Social Security number at a bank and it caused no problems, because banks don't routinely check Social Security numbers against names (employers, in contrast, routinely do cross\\-check).\n\nNot every state recognizes \"common law\" name changes, or even every bureaucratic entity within a state that expressly does have that as their law. Most bureaucrats in both the public and private sector don't understand the concept of a common law name change even in places where that is the law, because it doesn't fit with bureaucratic logic.\n\nIt is not forgery, which would involve signing with an intent to appear to be some other actual person who you are not. \n\nWhether or not it is fraud turns on intent. If you use a different name to evade a creditor or to cash a check that wasn't intended to be payable to you, that is fraud. But, simply changing a new to avoid family members who mistreat you is not fraud.\n\nIn terms of getting the bank records, the best thing to do is to try to explain the situation to the bank official (ideally with, e.g., a Social Security card and other evidence such as the name of a former employer or a person to whom checks were regularly written to corroborate your story).\n\nName disconnects aren't that unusual in banking. For example, I was beneficiary of an account established by my late father that identified me by my pre\\-marital name of 23 years ago. But, the rule of law is that a beneficiary designation is valid if the intended person is clear, even if the names don't exactly match, for example, because your name changed in the meantime. As a result, I am able to deposit checks payable to my pre\\-marital name. So, a lack of a name match shouldn't be a strict bar to getting old banking records of your own account.\n\nFor another purpose, it is also permissible to have checks whose name don't match the name on the account, and to have \"trade name\" accounts of an unincorporated individual supported only by an obscure trade name filing for businesses. \n\n**Post\\-Script: Some Similar Concepts**\n\n* In the same vein, Colorado recognizes common law marriage that arises when two people agree that they are married and hold themselves out to the public as married, without any formal paperwork. If you just start calling someone \"my husband\" and you both mean it, it is true.\n\nEmancipation of a minor in Colorado is a similar concept. An emancipated minor in Colorado is a minor who provides most of his or her own support and lives independently. Courts in Colorado don't declare that a minor is emancipated causing the minor to become emancipated following a petition requesting emancipation. Instead, courts in Colorado determine as a factual matter if given the way that the minor lives his or her life, he is or is not emancipated. The emancipation determination of a court flows from the reality on the ground, rather than the other way around.\n\nThe race\\-notice recording system for real estate also works this way. Ownership of real estate flows from transactions that happen outside the recording system and can be private. Recording real estate documents provides evidence of an underlying reality and provides a means of weighing evidence when there is a dispute over who owns real property, but recording a document with the clerk and recorder of a county in not what actually causes title to that real estate to change, unlike the situation in title registration jurisdictions like the UK and Germany and South Africa where the filling with the government office is the moment at which title is changed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A woman, fleeing from an abusive family, opened a bank account using her planned new name but her correct Social Security number.

I am going to take a few moments to give an overview of both and then get to the question of self\\-prescribing.\n\nExpanded Access has been around for about 30 years, when it began as a way to make experimental HIV drugs available to patients during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has been used since them to make drugs available for a variety of diseases (like [cancer](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/compassionate-drug-use.html)), and most recently for COVID\\-19\\.\n\nThe Right to Try Act is similar in that it makes experimental drugs available to patients before they have received full regulatory approval. The mechanism for that availability is a different, and it has since it is a law it has the explicit approval of Congress. Here are a [journal article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081483/) and a [very good table breaking down the differences](https://triagecancer.org/expanded-access-vs-try-patients#:%7E:text=What%20is%20the%20Food%20%26%20Drug,access%20to%20investigational%20medical%20products.) between Right to Try and Expanded Access.\n\nNeither of these modify the patient/doctor relationship, so they do not effect whether a prescriber can write their own prescriptions either way. **A doctor could probably prescribe COVID\\-19\\-related treatments for themselves approved for widespread use under Expanded Access; they would likely be unable to self\\-prescribe other more medically\\-complex, higher\\-risk treatments like chemotherapy.** See below.\n\n---\n\n**Self\\-prescribing is legal under federal law.** As noted by the [Emergency Care Research Institute](https://www.ecri.org/components/HRC/Pages/AskHRC111219.aspx):\n\n> Under federal law, physicians in the United States are not prohibited from self\\-prescribing medications.

Many prohibit prescribing of Schedule II drugs to family members. I have found several sources that claim some states outright prohibit self\\-prescribing, but whenever I follow those back to the actual statute they only apply to Schedule II drugs.\n\nProfessional organizations like the American Medical Association strongly discourage their members self\\-prescribing, stating in their [Code of Ethics](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/treating-self-or-family) that \"treating oneself or a member of one's own family poses several challenges for physicians, including concerns about professional objectivity, patient autonomy, and informed consent.\"\n\nThe greatest barrier to self\\-prescribing lies at the pharmacy, where pharmacists are able to refuse prescriptions when they question the medical necessity or standard of care that lead to the prescription.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: Dr. Smith, a physician specializing in infectious diseases, is considering prescribing herself an experimental COVID-19 treatment that has been approved under the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization.

I have Allstate insurance. The police came and gathered insurance information from both parties and gave each of us copies. I believe they later made a report.\n\nI have been working with my insurance company to get this resolved and I feel like they are purposely blowing me off. First, Allstate said they couldn't contact the other party in the accident so I will have to pay for my car repair myself. Second, they said that no fault is assigned and each party pays for their own damages. I know the police don't assign fault when the accident is on private property, but surely fault still exists.\n\nAre these statements true? What rights do I have and what ability do I have to get my insurance company to go to bat for me? I assume their statements are false. Otherwise, I could drive around hitting cars in private parking lots with an uninsured car with no consequence?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"No fault\" is a term of art in this case. In a \"no fault\" insurance regime, such as [the one in place in Utah](http://www.all-about-car-accidents.com/resources/insurance-law/car-insurance/utah-auto-insurance-law), minor car accidents are covered by the insurance company of the person who suffers the damage, and not by the person who is at fault in the accident.\n\nUtah's \"No\\-Fault\" Insurance System\n\n> Utah is a \"no\\-fault\" car insurance state. This means that when a car\n>  accident occurs, the people injured in the crash turn to their own\n>  insurance coverage first (and sometimes exclusively), filing what is\n>  known as a \"first\\-party\" claim. This insurance is required to pay at\n>  least $3,000 in Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits, regardless\n>  of who was at fault for the accident. For minor accidents, that may be\n>  the extent of the process \\-\\- an injured person receiving a settlement\n>  from their own car insurance carrier. Because Utah is a no\\-fault\n>  state, its laws limit the situations in which people injured in car\n>  accidents can step outside the no\\-fault rules and file a liability\n>  claim or lawsuit seeking compensation from others who may have caused\n>  the accident. Before filing a lawsuit after a car accident in Utah, an\n>  injured person must first have incurred $3,000 in medical expenses\n>  stemming from the accident, or must have suffered certain kinds of\n>  serious injuries as a result of the accident. In Utah, the kinds of\n>  injuries that qualify under this \"injury threshold\" are:\n>  \\- permament disability\n>  \\- permanent impairment\n>  \\- permanent disfigurement, or\n>  \\- dismemberment\n\nWithout knowing more details about the damages suffered and the terms of the respective policies, it is hard to determine if your claim is or is not beyond the threshold where private lawsuits are allowed. It could be that property damage is not covered by \"no fault\" at all, or that it could be covered by \"no fault\" but that you have waived that coverage.\n\nIf this is a case where private lawsuits are allowed, someone who is injured would hire a private personal injury lawyer, unaffiliated with their insurance company, to sue the person at fault in the accident to recover the damages not covered by your no fault coverage due to the other driver's fault. This would not be the responsibility of your insurance company, unless you have uninsured motorist coverage and the other driver was uninsured, which does not seem to be the case.\n\nIn non\\-no fault states and in cases in a no fault state where a lawsuit is allowed, your insurance company (after paying any PIP benefits) would not be involved and cannot help you sue the other driver. If you sue the other driver, the other driver's insurance company will hire a lawyer to defend him and would have authority to settle the case up to the policy limits of the other driver's insurance policy.\n\nThe insurance company has a duty to affirmatively help you obtain the rights you are entitled to under your policy and if they fail to do so this is called a \"bad faith breach of insurance contract\".

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Utah is a no-fault insurance state, which means that for minor accidents, each party's own insurance covers their damages, regardless of fault.\n\n2. The medical expenses ($2,500) are below the $3,000 threshold for stepping outside the no-fault system for personal injury claims.

The property damage ($4,000) is not mentioned as being part of the no-fault system in Utah. The documentation suggests that property damage claims may be pursued against the at-fault party.\n\n4.

Option D is the most strategic approach because:\n\n1. Trademarking \"GreenSpark\" protects the brand name, which is crucial as it will be used across multiple products in the line.\n\n2. Filing for a separate trademark on \"UltraShine\" with a disclaimer for exclusive use acknowledges that \"UltraShine\" might be considered somewhat descriptive or generic. This approach attempts to gain some protection for the product name while recognizing its limitations.\n\n3. This strategy provides the most flexibility for future products.

It's more comprehensive than option A, which doesn't attempt to protect individual product names at all.\n\n6.

Since it is an infringement to falsely claim or imply an endorsement or affiliation, such that the quality and good will associated with the trademark or its owner is attributed to the product being described, such a disclaimer makes it clear that no such claim is being made.

The only factual allegations are allegations 3\\-7 (with allegation 8 merely unnecessarily reincorporating the previous allegations by reference).\n\nFurthermore, a bare denial of an itemized allegation of fact is sufficient, without further explanation.\n\n> Does the government limit its defenses to the jurisdictional issue,\n> and to the failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\n> by not following the rule requires defendants state in short and plain\n> terms its defenses to each claim asserted against?\n\nThe requirement of the rule is to set forth affirmative defenses in the section entitled defenses, but denials of fact sufficient to defeat the elements of the claim for relief sought also suffice.\n\nIf further affirmative defenses are discovered in the course of the litigation, the answer can be amended and leave to do so is granted liberally.\n\nIn this case, the government is basically saying, \"So what? There is no common law right of access, and even if there was one, you as a third\\-party unconnected to the events doesn't have standing to exercise it.\"\n\n> How might J.W. have done a better job in writing the complaint in a\n> way that would require a more specific answer?\n\nJudicial Watch could have pursued a cause of action that is recognized under the law.\n\nThere is no legally established common law right of access for a third\\-party as asserted. Judicial Watch really doesn't care if it gets a detailed response in an answer or not. It is trying to establish new law that is not present in prior precedents.\n\nAlso, in modern civil litigation, the main means of getting factual information is though disclosures and discovery required later in the litigation process. The notion that the answer to the complaint should be a significant source of substantive disclosure of facts was largely abandoned in connection with the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the 1930s.\n\nThe denial of jurisdiction is primarily on the basis of lack of standing (since lack of standing is one form of lack of subject matter jurisdiction). It has not alleged that is has members who suffered an injury to a legally protected right, or that the entity itself suffered an injury to a legally protected right.\n\nIt is likely that the complaint will be dismissed summarily in early motion practice, probably for lack of standing.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The original complaint relies on a \"common law right of access\" which, as noted in the answer, is not a well-established legal principle for third-party access to records.

Option A (alleging personal injury) would not address the fundamental issue of the legal basis for the records request and might be seen as a disingenuous attempt to manufacture standing.\n\n3.

Option D (seeking immediate discovery) is premature at this stage of the proceedings and unlikely to be granted before addressing the jurisdictional issues.\n\n5. Option C (refiling under FOIA) provides a statutorily recognized pathway for requesting government records, which would force the U.S. Capitol Police to respond more substantively. FOIA requests have established procedures and legal precedents, making it harder for the government to simply deny jurisdiction without explanation.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts (pleading requirements, jurisdictional issues, standing, and alternative legal strategies) and apply them to a real-world scenario.

In case this is important I live in England to this is a case of UK law\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A number of commercial cartoonists operate in the US, so you might be sued in US courts (with judgment enforced by your courts), regardless of where you live. Basically, you have to comply with *everbody's* copyright law, when you operate a web page, unless there's an issue with a strange law in a country that has no legal reach into the UK (no treaty governing enforcement of foreign judgments).\n\nIf you knowingly and willfully allow others to post protected material, you can be sued and found liable for major damages. If you unwittingly allow others to post protected material, you can be sued and found liable for lesser damages, unless you've protected yourself by following DMCA safe harbor rules. The gist of those rules is that you have to make it easy for rights\\-holders to contact you and request removal of infringing material. If you do this in the right way (expeditiously; following a certain protocol for notice and counter\\-notice), you will not be liable. There are particular requirements on the takedown notice and so on: pushing the matter off onto the uploader will not work. Rather, *you* must respond to takedown requets. (From a practical POV, putting contributor's email addresses out there in the open is also going to seriously restrict the number of contributors you will get).\n\nYour website presumably operates under someone else's domain, hardware and so on, and that business might be sued as well, for letting you let someone infringe copyright. Undoubtedly they will have included some statement about copyright infringement in their terms of service with you, and they can sue you if you don't do that. It is extremely unlikely that you could hide from a person whose copyright you have infringed (the service provider will comply with requests for information, assuming privacy laws are followed in doing so), so assume that a cease and desist letter can and will be delivered to you, even if *you* don't provide any contact information.\n\nThere is no equivalent safe\\-harbour law in the UK. This may put some burden on the rights\\-holder, that they may have to give you \"actual knowledge\" of infringement (it would not be hard for a rights holder to provide evidence of their rights). \n\nA TOS clause whereby users must vow that they have a right to upload the material does not remove your liability. You could include an indemnification clause requiring an infringer to cover your costs created by his actions, but then you would have to locate and sue the infringer to actually cover those costs. Since the work is being used for profit, you would also be liable for those lost revenues, even if you had paid out a share to the uploader.\n\nSince there is no definitive database where one can determine who holds the rights to a work, it can be difficult to protect oneself against infringers who upload to your website. The risk can be reduced by making it easy for rights\\-holders to notify you of infringements, and by responding rapidly to such notices. However, it is not automatically safe to take down any alleged infringing materials, because that may infringe on the contractual rights of your contributors, especially since the user provides you something of value in exchange for something that they value (money, in particular). If you just take down somebody's cartoon, you may be liable for lost revenues and even copyright violation. If the uploader had in fact infringed somebody else's copyright, they could not sue you for taking down \"their\" cartoon: but you don't know if they actually have the rights. To prevent yourself from getting sued by contributors, your TOS would need to include language reserving the right to take down a contribution (this is where you would need to hire an attorney to craft the TOS).\n\nDMCA not only protects a service provider against liability for infringement, it also protects them against customers who want to sue for taking down their material. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Notice_from_copyright_owner) gives an overview of this aspect of DMCA law, and redundantly building such provisions into your TOS is not legally harmful.

One part, section 105(1\\), states \n\n> A power of attorney must be signed and dated by the principal, \n>  and the signature must be either acknowledged before a notary\n>  public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments, or\n>  attested by two or more competent witnesses who are neither home care providers for the principal nor care\n>  providers at an adult family home or long\\-term care facility in which\n>  the principal resides, and who are unrelated to the principal or agent by blood, marriage, or state registered domestic partnership, by subscribing their names to the power of attorney, while in the presence of the principal and at the \n>  principal's direction or request.\n\nthen 105(3\\) states\n\n> A signature on a power of attorney is presumed to be genuine if the\n>  principal acknowledges the signature before a notary public or other\n>  individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments.\n\nThat leaves open the possibility that there could be a dispute over the legitimacy of your signature if you use two witnesses. A related reason to prefer a notarized version is that it is \"acknowledged\" under Sec. 119 (1\\):\n\n> For purposes of this section and section 120 of this act,\n>  \"acknowledged\" means purportedly verified before a notary public or\n>  other individual authorized to take acknowledgments.\n\nThe reason why an \"acknowledged\" POA is a good thing is that there is also (new) law that gives such a POA special (good) status. Sect 119 continues:\n\n> (2\\)A person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of\n>  attorney without actual knowledge that the signature is not genuine\n>  may rely upon the presumption under section 105 of this act that the\n>  signature is genuine.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) A person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of\n>  attorney without actual knowledge that the power of attorney is void,\n>  invalid, or terminated, that the purported agent's authority is void,\n>  invalid, or terminated, or that the agent is exceeding or improperly\n>  exercising the agent's authority may rely upon the power of attorney\n>  as if the power of attorney were genuine, valid and still in effect,\n>  the agent's authority were genuine, valid and still in effect, and the\n>  agent had not exceeded and had properly exercised the authority.\n\nA prudent person would not hand over your stuff to a stranger or someone claiming to have power of attorney, unless they were sure that the person with a POA form actually had a legitimate POA form. They would be liable for damages if they gave away your stuff to an unauthorized person. An acknowledged POA is better than a POA with two neighbors as witnesses, because the acknowledged POA further establishes that the signature is valid.\n\nSection 120 also requires acceptance of an acknowledged POA within 7 days (whereas with neighbor signatures, further investigation may be called for, meaning delays).\n\nThe existing statute is [here](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=11.94&full=true), which is the law at the moment. There is no mention of a notary requirement, and no witness signature requirement (that changes). Section 40(1\\) says that \"Any person acting without negligence and in good faith in reasonable reliance on a power of attorney shall not incur any liability\" \u2013 now, is it negligence to accept a signature (of a principle) without investigating its validity? I really don't know. If you follow the new rules and get it notarized, that is covered. RCW 11\\.94\\.010 addresses the \"what type\" question, that is, whether the POA remains valid if you are incapacitated, or becomes effective once you are incapacitated.

This approach is the most legally robust and advantageous for several reasons:\n\n1.

It allows people accepting the document to rely on its authenticity without fear of liability, as long as they act in good faith.\n\n4. Section 120 requires acceptance of an acknowledged POA within 7 days, which can prevent delays in its use.\n\nOption A, while legally permissible, doesn't provide the same level of presumed authenticity and protection as a notarized document.

This is also true in most other kinds of lawsuits.\n\n> if I cannot beat this challenge, can I remove myself as beneficiary\n> and have the Probate court declare that all 5 blood\\-related\n> grandchildren will get equal shares?\n\nRemoving yourself as a beneficiary is called filing a \"disclaimer\" in legalese. It means to refuse to accept a gift or inheritance. But you can't do that if you have already received any personal benefit from the estate and there are other statutory restrictions. For tax purposes, the deadline to do is nine months after the date of death, but the state law deadline could be different.\n\nWhat would happen if you do so depends upon the language of the will. Usually, gifts to a group of people are made \"per stirpes\" (also called \"by representation\") which means that if a child predeceases or makes a timely disclaimer that their children share in the share that their parent would have received only. It is possible that it says something different, but that would be by far the most common provision.\n\n> Under the original Probate interpretation, when the real\\-estate sold,\n> I invested the proceeds in the stock market and there have been\n> losses.

The case involves intricate legal issues such as reopening a closed probate, interpretation of will language, and potential fiduciary duties, which are beyond the expertise of a non-lawyer.\n\n2.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. CC-BY-SA has a \"sharealike\" clause that requires derivatives to be under the same license, which is more restrictive than MIT with attribution.\n2.

One set punishes sexual assaults involving sexual penetration that has greater penalties. The other set punishes sexual assaults involving sexual contact without sexual penetration that has smaller penalties but otherwise the same elements of the offense.\n\nUsually, almost every offense which is a crime when it involves sexual penetration is also a crime when it involves sexual contact but not sexual penetration, with the fairly frequent exception of statutory rape offenses that cover an adolescent victim who is below the age of consent but post\\-pubescent (with the statute itself setting specific age thresholds that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction).\n\nOften, even when statutory rape of an adolescent (i.e. sex with consent by an adolescent under the age of consent) itself is a relatively minor crime, often a misdemeanor, and is rarely prosecuted to the full extent of the law, child prostitution or attempted child prostitution with the same victim is often a very serious offense, and child pornography offenses often also carry serious penalties when the \"child\" is under the age of eighteen, even when the sexual act filmed or photographed itself is of people who are above the age of consent and are legally having consensual sex.\n\nIn many states, sex with someone in a position of authority over the victim is a crime without regard to consent, much like a statutory rape offense, but without regard to age. In some states there would be a parallel sexual contact offense, and in some states there would not be one.\n\nThe name of the offenses varies considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes they are different degrees of the same offense, sometimes they are offenses with different names, and the names used varies quite a bit.\n\nAlso, even when an arguable sexual contact offense is not a sex offense, it would almost always be some form of non\\-sexual criminal assault offense.\n\nFor example, [Colorado](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2018-title-18.pdf) has sexual assault related crimes called **sexual assault** at Colo.

An unaggravated sexual contact without consent offense may be punishable by up to six to twelve months in jail or a long period of probation. The offenses are too varied by jurisdiction and crime details to summarize easily. Aggravated rape is a death penalty offense in U.S. military justice although the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the imposition of the death penalty (at least in cases where the victim is not a child) is unconstitutional. Some states declare in their statutes that the aggravated rape of a child is a death penalty offense although the constitutionality of those statutes has not been tested in court and no one has been executed for such an offense since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s in the U.S.\n\nMost sex offenses in the U.S. of all types, including both sexual contact offenses, sexual penetration offenses, and even offenses involving no contact at all, such being a peeping tom, also require to convicted defendant to register as a sex offender, either for a long period of time or for life, which is a quite severe and separate punishment in addition to the incarceration and/or fine and court costs and surcharges involved.\n\nIn the case of child sex offenses and some repeat rape offenders, even after a term of incarceration is fully served, the state may seek to have the offender detained indefinitely civilly to protect the public until it is determined that the offender is no longer a threat, which rarely happens in practice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A high school teacher is accused of repeatedly dry-humping a 16-year-old student without consent during after-school tutoring sessions.

The correct answer is B because the teacher's position of authority is the most critical factor in this case, for several reasons:\n\n1. Many states have specific laws criminalizing sexual contact between a person in a position of authority (like a teacher) and someone under their supervision (like a student), regardless of the age of consent or whether penetration occurred.\n\n2. The documentation states: \"In many states, sex with someone in a position of authority over the victim is a crime without regard to consent, much like a statutory rape offense, but without regard to age.\"\n\n3. While the lack of penetration (A) is relevant and would likely result in a lesser charge than rape (e.g., \"unlawful sexual contact\" instead of \"sexual assault\" in Colorado), the position of authority could elevate the severity of the offense.\n\n4. The age of consent (C) is less critical here because the position of authority makes it illegal regardless of the student's age in many jurisdictions.\n\n5.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As stated in the top answer, there is legally no fraud in the first place. Fraud requires an intention to financially benefit to the detriment of another person, which is not the case here as Alice agreed that Bob would receive the proceeds of the check.\n\n2. While there may be a different statutory crime for interfering with a check, it isn't fraud. The verbal permission from Alice and the agreed-upon outcome (Bob receiving the entire balance) negate the fraudulent intent.\n\n3. The proposed fix is unnecessary from a legal standpoint, as it doesn't change the underlying facts of the situation or Bob's initial actions.\n\n4. Options A and B are incorrect because they assume that the forgery itself was illegal, which the top answer disputes in this specific context.\n\n5. Option D is incorrect because while it might seem logical that acknowledging the forgery increases risk, the lack of fraudulent intent in the original action means the fix neither increases nor decreases legal risk significantly.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts, including the legal definition of fraud, the importance of intent in criminal liability, and the practical implications of attempting to correct a potentially problematic situation.

In the latter case the burden of proving a *lack of intent* is on the accused, while in the former case I think it's not. Nevertheless, the two provisions are similar due to \"sexual intent\" being used. How is this proven and disproven?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sexual intent is proven (or disproven) like any other form of intent. A confession is not necessary, although that is one available method. It may be inferred with proof from circumstantial evidence.\n\nAny combination of direct and circumstantial evidence is allowed. There isn't a formula for it. The prosecution or defendant, as the case may be, simply has to convince the trier of fact that there was or was not sexual intent. Any otherwise admissible evidence that could rationally show that sexual intent is more or less likely can be presented.\n\nIf it happens in a gynecological appointment, or because the defendant slipped on a banana peel after the defendant's glasses were splattered with mud so he couldn't see what he was doing, this is going to be exceedingly hard to prove in the absence of a pattern and practice in multiple cases that couldn't be a coincidence, or with something like bragging to a friend in private.\n\nIf this happens at a festival celebration, or after a dinner date, or intent is corroborated by perverted photographs on the defendant's phone, or is accompanied by sexual language, any other intent is going to be highly implausible and circumstantial evidence will strongly point to a sexual intent.\n\nOne way to disprove sexual intent is for the defendant to testify that there was some other intent. There is risk in that approach. You can't simultaneously testify that sexual contact never happened and that sexual contact did happen but without sexual intent, for example. Testifying that there was sexual contact without intent basically admits some other element of the crime. But it also forces the prosecution to prove that the defendant is lying, which depending upon the evidence, may be easy, or may be hard.\n\nIn real life, most of the cases that get prosecuted are easy cases. But, there will always be cases that are closer and circumstances that one wouldn't easily foresee in advance, and that is why we have courts and trials.\n\nUltimately, the prosecution presents evidence and the finder of fact has to decide if it proved that element of its case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A high school teacher is accused of sexual harassment by a student.

The teacher's immediate apology and self-reporting of the incident to the principal suggest a lack of sexual intent and demonstrate transparency. This aligns with the explanation in the documentation that intent can be inferred from circumstantial evidence, and in this case, the teacher's actions provide strong circumstantial evidence against sexual intent.\n\nOption A would make it easier for the prosecution to establish a pattern of behavior, potentially demonstrating sexual intent.\n\nOption B, while seemingly ambiguous, could actually provide multiple witnesses to corroborate either the accuser's or the accused's version of events, making it less challenging than option C.\n\nOption D presents clear evidence of inappropriate behavior that would strongly suggest sexual intent, making it the easiest scenario for the prosecution.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of legal concepts, understanding of evidence evaluation, and application to a real-world scenario.

For a stop and search, they must provide their name and police station, state what they expect to find, explain the reason for the search, cite their legal authority, and inform you of your right to a record of the search.\n\nIn this scenario, the officer has only stated a vague suspicion of \"suspicious behavior\" without meeting any of the specific criteria for either an arrest or a stop and search. Therefore, you are legally allowed to continue about your business as if the police were not there.\n\nOption A is incorrect because complying with the order to stop would be voluntarily submitting to an unlawful detention. Option C, while potentially de-escalating the situation, requires giving up your legal rights unnecessarily. Option D is incorrect because the police do not need a warrant for street encounters, and this demand would not address the legality of the current situation.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about rights and appropriate responses in police encounters."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23648/removal-of-an-attorney-general", "docs_id": 23648, "title": "Removal of an Attorney General", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The President nominates the Attorney General, and is responsible for seeing that the Attorney General faithfully upholds his duty to execute the laws of the land.

The documentation clearly states that the Attorney General \"serves at the President's pleasure and discretion,\" indicating that the President has the authority to dismiss the Attorney General at will.\n\n2.

What is the extent of these laws? Under what circumstances can they be applied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Okay, I think that I have found the answer to my own question.\n\n**TLDR**: Parliament technically has the power to summon / fine / imprison anyone, but the applicability of these laws is in doubt as some have not been exercised for 100\u2019s of years. It is unclear that any fines or imprisonment would actually have been brought against the man.\n\nIt turns out that The House of Commons and The House of Lords technically have the power to summon, imprison, and fine anyone. ([See point 252 on page 62 here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/79390/consultation.pdf))\n\n[An older BBC article goes over these alleged powers in greater detail](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17912253). The last time that an non member was summoned was in 1957:\n\n> *\u201dThe editor of the Sunday Express, John Junor, was brought by the Serjeant at Arms to the bar and admonished by the Speaker for publishing an article that cast doubt on the integrity of MPs over their constituency petrol allowances.\u201d*\n\nHowever, the powers of fining and imprisonment have not been exercised for 100\u2019s of years and their legitimacy today is debatable. Specifically, the European Convention of Human Rights would seem to undermine such arbitrary powers of imprisonment.\n\nThe article alleges that the last recorded cases of fines or imprisonment are as follows:\n\n> *\u201dThere is a former cell in the lower floors of the clock tower. But in practice it is only the police within the parliamentary estate who have the right to arrest anyone. The last time a non\\-MP was imprisoned was in 1880 when a man called Charles Grissell was detained.\u201d*\n> \n> \n> *\u201dThe last time MPs fined someone was in 6 February 1666 when a man called Thomas White was forced to pay the House \u00a31,000 for preventing an MP attending parliament.\u201d*\n\nSo I\u2019m summary, it is murky territory and highly unlikely that the business man in question would have faced serious fines or imprisonment for failing to comply. [This parliamentary article](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmliaisn/697/697we36.htm) nicely summarises how farcical the whole affair could have become: \n\n> *\u201dIn modern circumstances, as a televised proceeding, it would risk being a pantomime. Consider: the miscreant is brought to the Bar, accompanied by the Serjeant with the Mace, and is admonished by the Speaker in front of the House. Even assuming that the miscreant is prepared to come (and a refusal would be a further embarrassment) the proceedings are not controllable, and the House would risk looking like a lynch mob. The Speaker stands and delivers a rebuke, at a range of some thirty yards. Then what? The individual at the Bar, in prime TV time, may decide to have a go at the House and the treatment he or she has received. If the individual really does have a case, or perhaps produces some surprise piece of evidence which makes it clear that the House has got it wrong, the result could be a reputational disaster.\u201d*\n\nMonologue finished.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A technology company executive is visiting the UK when they receive a summons from Parliament to provide sensitive business documents.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. While Parliament technically has powers to summon, imprison, and fine individuals, these powers haven't been fully exercised in centuries.\n2. The documentation states that the legitimacy of fining and imprisonment powers is debatable, especially considering the European Convention of Human Rights.\n3. The last recorded case of imprisoning a non-MP was in 1880, and the last fine was imposed in 1666, indicating these powers are extremely rarely used.\n4. The parliamentary article describes how attempting to exercise these powers could become a \"pantomime\" and a \"reputational disaster\" for Parliament.\n5. Public admonishment (like in the 1957 case with the Sunday Express editor) is the most recent example of Parliament exercising its summoning power.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the clock tower cell is no longer used, and only police have the right to arrest on parliamentary grounds. Option B is unlikely as the fining power hasn't been used since 1666 and would face legal challenges. Option D is an extreme escalation not supported by the information provided. The most likely outcome is a public confrontation without legally enforceable consequences, highlighting the tension between Parliament's theoretical powers and their practical limitations in the modern era."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11289/should-i-get-a-lawyer-after-my-accident", "docs_id": 11289, "title": "Should I get a lawyer after my accident?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Last Tuesday I got in an accident with a lady who is insured with GEICO.

The most strategic course of action is B) Contact their insurance company to request legal representation under their liability coverage.\n\nThis is the best option because:\n\n1. The student's insurance policy likely includes liability coverage, which typically provides legal representation if the policyholder is sued.\n2.

It's a more protective stance than attempting to negotiate directly with the other party's lawyer (option C), which could be risky without proper legal knowledge.\n5. Filing a complaint with the state insurance commission (option D) doesn't directly address the immediate legal threat and may not be warranted at this stage.\n\nOption A is premature and potentially costly, as no lawsuit has been filed yet.

The U.S. Department of State guidance explicitly states that permission to possess firearms must be obtained from the local state jurisdiction, and the DOS cannot intervene in the application process or if a permit is denied.\n\n3. The German example, while not directly applicable to New York, reinforces the principle that diplomatic personnel must follow local procedures for obtaining firearms permits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it disregards the requirement to respect local laws. Option B is wrong because the DOS explicitly states it will not intervene if permits are denied.

Which of the following best describes the legal position and most appropriate course of action for the tenant?\n\nA) The tenant should immediately vacate by August 14th to avoid potential fines, as verbal corrections to written contracts always supersede the original text.\n\nB) The tenant can safely ignore the landlord's claim and stay until August 25th without any legal repercussions, as signed contracts are absolute and immutable.\n\nC) The tenant should negotiate a compromise date with the landlord, as courts always prefer mutual agreements over strict contract interpretation.\n\nD) The tenant has a strong legal position to stay until August 25th, but should document all communications and prepare for potential legal action by the landlord.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This situation requires analysis of contract law principles and their application. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The signed written contract is extremely strong evidence of the agreement between parties. As stated in the documentation, \"A signed written contract that supports one parties position is extremely strong evidence!\"\n\n2. The general legal position is that \"the written contract accurately documents the agreement unless someone can prove that it doesn't.\" The landlord's claim of a typo, especially when communicated so close to the disputed date, is unlikely to constitute \"overwhelming evidence\" needed to trump the written agreement.\n\n3.

Option A is incorrect because verbal corrections do not automatically supersede written contracts, especially when disputed.\n\n5.

The question would be, is it a violation of your civil rights to prevent you from taking your baby home; is it legal for the federal government to investigate people who refuse to take a covid test? You can take the question along with pertinent evidence to a civil rights attorney.\n\nTo pick a [non\\-random hospital's web page](https://www.texashealth.org/Health-and-Wellness/Coronavirus/Common-Questions-During-Pregnancy-and-Birth), they note that \"Any person having surgery or a procedure, including birth, at a Texas Health hospital will be tested for COVID\\-19 to provide appropriate care for the patient, and for the protection of visitors and the care team\", and \"you will need to be tested at admission to help safeguard you and the care team\". In answer to the question whether you can decline testing, they say \"Testing is recommended to promote the health of you and your baby. Patients who have COVID\\-19 can have a weakened immune system and may have inflammatory symptoms that can compromise healing. We encourage you to speak with your provider about the best decision for you\", which doesn't explicitly say \"No you may not\", nor \"Yes, you may\". However, they cannot literally force you to take the test: at most, they can refuse to treat you.\n\nIn answer to the question \"Will I be separated from my baby if I test positive for COVID\\-19?\", they say \"Texas Health will follow guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of OB/GYN and the Centers for Disease Control for how to keep you and your baby safe during your hospital stay. Ultimately, any decisions about care for you and your baby will be between you and your provider, based on what is best for you both\". This is also not crystal clear.\n\nThere are three primary legal issues, putting a worst spin on their policy. They say up front that you will be tested prior to admission: the question is whether you can decline to take the test but force them to admit you.

What legal approach would be most appropriate to address this situation?\n\nA) Consult a medical malpractice attorney to sue the hospital for refusing treatment\nB) Contact a civil rights attorney to challenge the legality of the testing requirement and potential separation\nC) Seek immediate help from a family law specialist to prevent child protective services involvement\nD) File a complaint with the state medical board for unethical medical practices\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex issues of civil rights, medical ethics, and patient autonomy. The most appropriate legal approach is to consult a civil rights attorney for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation explicitly states that this is \"an issue of civil rights\" rather than purely a medical matter.\n\n2. The key legal questions revolve around whether it's a violation of civil rights to prevent parents from taking their baby home and whether it's legal for the federal government to investigate people who refuse a COVID test.\n\n3. While the hospital can recommend testing, they cannot forcibly test patients or separate them from their newborns without proper legal authority. This potential overreach of authority is a civil rights issue.\n\n4. The threat of being placed on a \"federal investigation list\" for refusing a medical test raises significant civil liberties concerns.\n\n5.

(The same contradiction also appears to exist for African Americans, who didn't have full voting rights until 1915\\.)\n\nWas it really intentional that women could be president from the beginning, but it took over 100 years for them to get the right to vote? Is there any reason why the Constitution was written this way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Prior to the 14th and 15th amendments, the US Federal Constitution and the Federal laws passed under it neither **allowed** nor **denied** anyone the right to vote. The decisions on who would and would not be allowed to vote, including for members of Congress and for President, was wholly in the hands of the sates, and were regulated by the various state constitutions and laws. A few states permitted women to vote, and at least one permitted free blacks to vote, at least for a period of its history. The Federal government had nothing to say on the matter.\n\nIn at lesat one case the US Supreme Court refused to consider such a question. That was the case of [*Luther v. Borden*, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1 (1849\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_v._Borden) which grew out of the [Dorr Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorr_Rebellion)\n\nThe state of Rhode Island, had retained its pre\\-revolutionary charter (dating from 1663\\) as its constitution, and required the ownership of a significant amount of landed property as a qualification to vote. The Wikipedia article on the rebellion (linked above) states:\n\n> By 1829, 60% of the state's free white men were ineligible to vote (women and most non\\-white men were prohibited from voting).\n\nIn 1841 a group led by Thomas Wilson Dorr held a convention to draft a new state Constitution, (known as the \"People's Constitution\"), and held ratifying votes on the draft. They declared that it had been approved by a majority of those qualified under the old laws as well as a majority of those voting and qualified under the new rules, and that it was therefore the valid constitution of the state. The old (charter) government said this was invalid and illegal. Attempts to establish the new government by force failed. However, a revised state constitution that greatly expanded voting rights was passed and took effect in 1843\\.\n\n*Luther v. Borden* was a case of trespass against members of the militia acting under the charter government, brought by a supporter of Dorr. The plaintiffs brought extensive evidence (over 150 pages) intended to establish that the Dorr or \"People's\" constitution had been validly ratified by a majority of voters, and that the old constitution had improperly restricted voting rights. The case went to the US Supreme Court, where Chief Justice Taney wrote in [the majority opinion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/48/1/):\n\n> The plaintiff contends that the charter government was displaced, and ceased to have any lawful power, after the organization, in May, 1842, of the government which he supported, and although that government never was able to exercise any authority in the State nor to command obedience to its laws or to its officers, yet he insists that it was the lawful and established government upon the ground that it was ratified by a large majority of the male people of the State of the age of twenty\\-one and upwards, and also by a majority of those who were entitled to vote for general officers under the then existing laws of the State.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The point, then, raised here has been already decided by the courts of Rhode Island. The question relates altogether to the constitution and laws of that State, and the well settled rule in this court is that the courts of the United States adopt and follow the decisions of the State courts in questions which concern merely the constitution and laws of the State.\n> \n> \n> Besides, if the Circuit Court had entered upon this inquiry, by what rule could it have determined the qualification of voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution unless there was some previous law of the State to guide it? It is the province of a court to expound the law, not to make it. And certainly **it is no part of the judicial functions of any court of the United States to prescribe the qualification of voters in a State, giving the right to those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State, or taking it away from those to whom it is given**; nor has it the right to determine what political privileges the citizens of a State are entitled to, unless there is an established constitution or law to govern its decision. {*emphasis added*}\n\nThus, until the passage and ratification of the 14th and 15th amendments, which forbid states to deny the vote based on race, national origin, and a few other grounds, the Federal Constitution had nothing to say on the point. States were required to grant the right to vote to women by the 19th amendment in 1920, and the 26th (1971\\) prohibited denial on the ground of age to anyone 18 or older. The 24th (1964\\) prohibited denial for failure to pay a poll tax or any other tax. The 14th amendment has been held to guarantee the equal weight of votes, in what was at first known as the \"one man, one vote\" rule (later \"one person, one vote\") and has been used to overturn individual and group denials of voting rights. But there **were** no federal voting rights in the years before 1865\\.\n\nI am not aware of any writings by any of the \"founding fathers\" (say the members of the Constitutional Convention) that seriously discuss the possibility of a female President. But they did consider and endorse the possibility of a person being elected president who might not be qualified to vote in some of the states. They declined to impose, or permit Congress to impose, a property, or other variable, qualification on the president, even though many of the original states had property qualifications for voters.

The original Constitution established federal criteria for presidential eligibility (age, citizenship, and residency) but did not address voting rights.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The old claim from 2008 is likely barred by the statute of limitations, despite the adjuster's verbal assurances. Verbal statements by adjusters typically don't override written policy terms or state laws.\n\n2. The homeowner can file a new claim for the recent storm damage, as it's a separate incident. However, the insurance company has the right to limit the payout to only the damage caused by the new storm, not pre-existing damage or deterioration from the unrepaired 2008 damage.\n\n3. The insurance company is generally only obligated to return the property to its pre-loss condition, not fund upgrades or improvements.\n\n4. The homeowner's failure to repair the roof after the 2008 hurricane doesn't necessarily preclude new claims, but it may affect the assessment of the new damage.\n\nOption A is incorrect because old and new claims can't be combined, especially given the time lapse.

The parties may depart from the *literal* language of the contract as long as their departure does not defeat the purpose or intent of that contract. Unless prescribed differently, the principle of \"*strict construction*\" would equally constrain the conduct of *all* the parties to the contract.\n\n[*Contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) disfavors *only* the party who drafted a contract. The doctrine is applicable where the language of a clause is simultaneously consistent with reasonable interpretations which would lead to opposite outcomes.\n\nThe rationale behind *contra proferentem* is that the party who drafted the contract is presumed to outweigh the counterparty in terms of bargaining power. Thus, the doctrine seeks to somehow compensate that disparity in bargaining power whereas there is no element of compensation in the principle of \"*\\[no] strict construction*\".\n\nNote that the excerpt you posted in regard to *contra proferentem* is contradictory. By definition, *contra proferentem* entails a disadvantage to the party who drafted the provision at issue.

The \"no strict construction\" clause indicates that the language should be interpreted to express the mutual intent of the parties, rather than applying strict literal interpretation. This allows for consideration of context when resolving ambiguities.\n\nThe second clause appears to be an attempt to negate the contra proferentem doctrine, which would normally interpret ambiguities against the drafter. However, this clause contradicts the standard application of contra proferentem.\n\nGiven these conflicting clauses, the most appropriate approach is to focus on the mutual intent of the parties (as specified in the \"no strict construction\" clause) and use context to resolve ambiguities. This aligns with the higher-level principle of contract interpretation that seeks to understand and enforce the parties' intentions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the \"no strict construction\" clause. Option B would be the result of applying contra proferentem, but the contract explicitly attempts to avoid this (albeit with contradictory language).

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Using and sharing content derived from a copyrighted game without owning the copyright is, on its face, a potential copyright infringement.\n2.

The correct answer, B, represents the most practical and legally sound approach given the circumstances. \n\nWhile the individual's frustration is understandable, the visa center's closure due to the pandemic is likely legal and in compliance with government directives. The center isn't maliciously holding the passport; rather, it's caught in an unprecedented situation.\n\nOption A is impractical and unlikely to succeed, as courts are likely to prioritize public health measures over individual inconveniences during a pandemic. Option C misinterprets the lockdown guidelines, which allow but don't mandate essential services to operate. The visa center may be unable to function due to staff shortages or other pandemic-related issues. Option D is an overreaction that mischaracterizes the situation as illegal detention of the passport.\n\nContacting one's home embassy for a temporary travel document is the most reasonable solution. It acknowledges the exceptional circumstances, provides a practical workaround for the immediate travel needs, and avoids escalating the situation legally when the visa center is likely acting within its rights during a crisis.

The correct answer is B, and here's why:\n\n1. The evidence from the first visit is likely admissible. As stated in the documentation, \"Leading a criminal to believe that you are a crime-customer (e.g. for purposes of a drug sale) and not a police officer is okay (Lewis v.

My question is purely about the legal status of this clause.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does this non disparagement clause have any legal standing?\n\nEnforcement of that clause has its limitations. The keywords in the clause are *disparage* and *discredit*, each of which warrants a separate analysis.\n\n[Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines *disparagement* \\[of goods] as:\n\n> A statement about a competitor's goods which is untrue or misleading\n> and is made to influence or tends to influence the public not to buy.\n\nThat excerpt from the legal definition is the relevant one insofar as the clause is in terms of suppliers' trademarks and the \"*product\\[s] or service\\[s]*\" they offer.\n\nFrom this legal definition, it follows that the non\\-disparagement portion of the clause is enforceable only if (1\\) the source of the statement is an Amazon's competitor, (2\\) the statement is about goods or services offered by Amazon, and (3\\) those statements are untrue or misleading *and* \\-\\-potentially or actually\\-\\- detrimental to Amazon's interests as competitor.

Other than that, competitors' statements about Amazon but *unrelated to* Amazon's products or services are beyond the scope of item (2\\).\n\nAs for *discrediting*, the clause is tantamount to stipulating to a [gag order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order) regardless of how nefarious Amazon's conduct could be. That overly broad portion of the clause can be stricken as null and void to the extent that it is contrary to public policy.

Use of Amazon's logo: The documentation states that \"Amazon's trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not Amazon's, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion among customers.\" Using Amazon's logo in marketing materials could potentially cause customer confusion about the relationship between the small business and Amazon, likely violating trademark law.\n\n2. Criticism of Amazon: The non-disparagement clause in Amazon's terms attempts to prohibit any manner that \"disparages or discredits Amazon.\" However, as explained in the documentation, such broad clauses have limitations in enforcement. The legal definition of disparagement relates specifically to untrue or misleading statements about a competitor's goods or services. Criticism of Amazon's business practices, if truthful and not directly related to their products or services, may be protected speech.\n\n3. Competitor status: The explanation notes that the disparagement portion is only enforceable if the source is a competitor. A small business selling on Amazon may not necessarily be considered a direct competitor.\n\n4. Public policy considerations: The documentation mentions that overly broad non-disparagement clauses can be \"stricken as null and void to the extent that it is contrary to public policy.\" This suggests that truthful criticism serving the public interest might be protected.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is C. The use of Amazon's logo likely violates trademark law, as it could cause customer confusion. The criticism, however, may be protected speech depending on its nature, accuracy, and whether it serves a public interest.

They are much more difficult to research than statutes. In the notation after the statute, sometimes, in some states, it will list the session laws in order from the first enactment through all of its legislative changes to its current form. And then you can backtrack.\n\nThat said if you're not using a professional search site, there is nearly no way to just find them through a Google or Findlaw search.

Trace the procedural history of the bill during its passage.\n\nThen, at the law library, you can read the various discussions on the floor relating to intent, as well as listen to the hearings on audio for more recent enactments (past 50 years or so). This is especially useful if it was a contested bill or if it was brought about by some sort of social or political climate at the time.

You could sue, but you would almost certainly lose. Generally speaking, towns have the right to make arbitrary or pointless zoning restrictions at their whim. This general rule is subject only to some very narrow exceptions:\n\n1. They can't totally ban any particular kind of first amendment activity, although they can regulate time, place and manner (e.g. they can't completely ban topless establishments or churches or political gathering places, although they can say where these establishments can be located).\n2. The regulations can't discriminate on their face on the basis of race or national origin, even though they can have a discriminatory effect that isn't the principal purpose of the regulations.\n3. The town's regulations can't leave property with no economically viable use whatsoever without paying compensation to the owner.\n4. The town must be able to articulate some basis for the zoning restriction, but pretty much any explanation whatsoever will do (which is to say that this kind of law is subject to the rational basis test).\n5. There are meaningful limitations arising under federal law regarding the extent to which manufactured housing can be treated differently than conventionally build housing under the regulations. In practice, it is easy to adopt neutral regulations that make manufactured housing (i.e. trailer parks) uneconomic.\n6. There are federal regulations that prohibit zoning laws from banning satellite dishes.\n7. Zoning laws can't be changed retroactively. In other words, once something is built that conforms to current zoning laws, it is \"grandfathered\" notwithstanding future changes in the zoning laws, until the building at the site is destroyed or substantially renovated, except in the case of some very extreme and urgent health and safety threats.\n\nSubstantive state regulation of zoning laws is pretty much non\\-existent, although state law may set forth a particular process that must be followed or require the regulations to fit a general template applicable in the state. Usually, however, states don't limit the authority of states to regulate land use at all. Where there is state regulation, this usually prevents regulation of something specific (e.g. political advertisements, a \"right to farm\" provision, prohibiting bans on xeriscaping, etc.).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about zoning laws and restrictions, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A property owner in a small town wants to build a large addition to their home on a multi-acre lot, but discovers that any addition over 500 square feet requires planning board approval. The owner believes this rule is arbitrary and wants to challenge it.

While all options might seem plausible to a property owner frustrated by zoning laws, option D is the most likely (albeit still difficult) path to success.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the restriction doesn't target First Amendment activities specifically, and size restrictions on buildings don't generally implicate free speech concerns.\n\nOption B, while seemingly logical, is irrelevant from a legal standpoint. Towns have broad authority to regulate land use, even when the regulations might seem unnecessary or overly intrusive to property owners.\n\nOption C is unlikely to succeed because requiring planning board approval for large additions doesn't prevent all economically viable use of the property. The owner can still use the existing structure or build smaller additions without approval.\n\nOption D is the best strategy because, as stated in the documentation, towns must be able to articulate some basis for zoning restrictions, even if the bar is very low (rational basis test). If the town truly cannot provide any rationale for the 500 square foot threshold, this could potentially be grounds for overturning the restriction.

This question is about combining content from multiple different hosts in general.)\n\nIt seems that commonly *believed* solution is to require Cookie Consent on the host page. **Why?** The cookie is not set by the host document server. Its value cannot ever be seen by the server providing the host document for the `<iframe>` element even if the server administrator wanted to monitor their users.\n\nTo me, the obvious solution to the problem is that if *the embedded document* wants to save non\\-necessary cookies, *it* should provide the cookie consent before storing such cookies.\n\n**Are there any prior decisions in some jurisdiction that specify that *host document* should request the cookie consent instead?** And if so, how the host document is supposed to transfer information about this consent to embedded content hosting server? It doesn't sound reasonable to me that if your document is embbedded in a `<iframe>` element, you don't ever need the consent to set non\\-necessary cookies.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **data controller** is responsible for GDPR compliance. For embedded content, case law such as the Fashion ID case indicates a **joint controllership** where both the controller of the embedding page and the controller of the embedded content are controllers. However, one can only be controller for processing activities where one has influence on the means and purposes of processing. So the controller of the embedding page is a controller with respect to the act of embedding (with purposes like *showing a video*), but they wouldn't be a controller for subsequent processing by that embedded content (with purposes like *tracking people across the web*).\n\nFor determining who is a controller, it is not too helpful to look at which servers sent which HTTP headers. Instead, look at which processing activities occur, for what purposes that processing is carried out, and who had input to determining these purposes. Those (natural or legal) persons are data controllers and are therefore responsible for compliance.\n\nWhat does this mean for the example of embedding a Youtube video, Tweet, or Like button?\n\nThe **controller of the embedding page** needs a legal basis for sharing visitor's personal data with the embed provider. Such a sharing is inevitable due to the embedding, regardless of whether cookies are involved. Typically, the legal basis used here would be consent: in place of the embed, a placeholder is shown that lets visitors opt in to loading the content. In some cases, a legitimate interest argument might also work.\n\nWhether the embedded content ends up using cookies is outside of the embedding page's control. Thus, I would think the **controller of the embedded content** would be the sole controller with respect to these cookies. Of course, no consent is required for the use of cookies when this use is strictly necessary to provide the service requested by the user, e.g. to add a video to a logged\\-in user's Youtube history.\n\nThe **joint controllers** can divide up compliance obligations among themselves. For example, the provider of the embed content could likely require embedders to collect necessary consents prior to embedding (Twitter has similar terms). However, this would be risky for the controller because controllers shall be able to demonstrate that valid consent was actually given.\n\nSo in **conclusion**, I largely agree with your analysis that the provider of the embedded content should consider cookie consent. With two caveats: the controllers might have an agreement that moves this responsibility to the embedder, and the embedding data controller might need consent to embed the content in the first place.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A popular news website wants to embed social media content from various platforms to enhance user engagement.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the principle of joint controllership established in cases like Fashion ID, while addressing the practical implementation of GDPR compliance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes blanket responsibility for all third-party cookies, which goes beyond the website's role as a joint controller. The website is primarily responsible for the act of embedding, not subsequent processing by embedded content.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it ignores the website's responsibility as a joint controller for the initial sharing of visitor data with embed providers, which requires a legal basis (typically consent).\n\nOption C is correct because it recognizes the website's responsibility as a joint controller for the act of embedding.

Can a casino make sure they never have to pay that out by having the machines \"malfunction\" to display a larger\\-than\\-maximum amount in those rare cases, and then avoid having to pay out anything close to the maximum, while still retaining all the player losses? \n\nExample stories where the answer seems to be \"yes\" can be found with [Katrina Bookman](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/15/news/jackpot-steak-dinner-katrina-bookman-lawsuit/index.html) or [Pauline McKee](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-iowa-casino-error-20150424-story.html).

Then the casinos pointed to signs \u201cMalfunction voids all pays and plays,\u201d and claimed that since the machines were malfunctioning, the casino didn't have to pay more than a couple dollars. The Iowa Supreme Court agreed with the casino in McKee's case and the New York State Gaming Commission agreed with the casino in Bookman's.\n\nIn [the words of Bookman's lawyer](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens-casino-told-woman-43m-prize-slot-machine-malfunction-article-1.2854392), \"the casino used the same broken machine to take money from players, and that everyone who used the machine should at least get their money back...Doesn\u2019t that mean a place can claim a machine is broken every time somebody wins?\" That is the question here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the case of [McKee v. Isle of Capri Casinos](http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/Supreme_Court/Supreme_Court_Opinions/Recent_Opinions/20150424/14-0802.pdf), we can tell because that case has been legally decided. As the court says, there was a contract and \"the patron was not entitled to the bonus under those rules\", and plaintiff \"failed to prove the necessary elements of either promissory or equitable estoppel\". They did not \"represent to her that a bonus would be available if she played the \ngame\", and did not \"promise to pay the $41 million after the notice was displayed\".\n\nThe (very complex) rules of the game are easily available on the machine, and there is a prominent disclaimer that \"MALFUNCTION VOIDS ALL PAYS AND PLAYS\". Under the rules, the winning configuration stated that she was entitled to $1\\.85\\. The problem was that it also announced \"Bonus Award \\- $41797550\\.16\". This was due to an inexplicable software error which in communicating with the central computer awarded a \"legacy bonus\", which is no part of the game in question. The maximum legacy bonus is $99999\\.99; the manufacturer knows of the possibility of this kind of error and has implemented a fix that is thought to eliminate the problem.\n\nThe first point then is that the casino didn't just claim there was a malfunction, they proved that there was one. Second, the terms of the contract hold: she was entitled to $1\\.85, and the extraneous message was not part of the contract. That is, she did not actually win the large payout, the malfunction was in saying that she received a bonus.

The correct answer is C because it aligns with the court's reasoning in the McKee v. Isle of Capri Casinos case. The court emphasized the importance of the game's rules and the actual entitlement under those rules.\n\nIf the patron can prove that their winning combination matches the paytable for the maximum advertised jackpot, this would demonstrate that they actually won according to the game's rules, rather than it being a malfunction.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. In the EU, like the US, trademark rights can arise from use, not just registration. The local company, despite using the trademark without authorization, has established some level of use and recognition in its local market.\n\n2. The original trademark has expired, and the previous owner has no intent to use it. This means the trademark is generally available for re-registration.\n\n3.

I think, the main question is whether I am considered a service provider for the services provided by a smart contract: I spin it once and then the smart contract runs without my intervention (it is even not possible for me to stop my smart contract running, but I can for example change the amount of the monetary fee for its usage) on third\\-party servers.\n\nThere is a thing (securing a public file) that I cannot restrict with logic of a smart contact. So I am seeking a legal (\"if you violate, I can sue\") way to disallow these actions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Terms of service are contracts, where you grant a person a right in exchange for them doing something. If they have agreed but violate the terms, you may have legal recourse to sue them; or you can \"undo\" their action, e.g. you can delete porn that they uploaded. There are certain limitations on your recourse, for example you cannot fine a user $100 for posting a snarky comment, and this comes from contract law (no penalty clauses).\n\nRegardless of the copyright status of any code you have running on your machine, you can set legal limits on how a program on your web page can be uses, for example you can stipulate \"cannot be used for commercial purposes\". The legal challenge would be for the provider to prove that they were actually harmed by the user's breach of contract: usually, the violator is just banned, which doesn't take a lawsuit. An indemnification clause is useful because it can require the user to take responsibility for legal damages that the user causes to you (for example, if they post defamatory content, they can be forced to cover your losses arising from the defamation lawsuit). You might have a hard time suing a person for making a snarky comment online, although the damage could be that it causes your snark\\-free forum reputation and attendant customer base to evaporate.\n\nIf your program transfers money from a user account to a specified target account and the TOS requires the user to have money in the account but the software doesn't check the account, then \"writing a rubber e\\-check\" would be a violation of the TOS and would cause damage, so you could sue. (For the sake of keeping this maximally related to the question you ask, I ignore the probability that online financial transactions are highly likely to be subject to other specific laws).\n\nThe comments suggests a complication, that there are two TOS's involved. There can be a front\\-end server that has a TOS, and that server can \"silently\" call on a separate server with its other TOS. If your TOS and use of the third party server is consistent with the third party TOS, there is no problem. If you are using the third party server illegally, you bear the liability and your customers do not (unless you are clear about the nature of the third party TOS and that you disclaim responsibility for lawsuits arising from the customer's illegal use of the service). It is unlikely that the situation will arise, since the customer has no agreement with the third party that they breached.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that Terms of Service (ToS) are contracts that can be used to set legal limits on how a program can be used, even if the underlying code is open-source.\n\n2. While the developer cannot restrict the usage of the open-source code itself, they can potentially apply ToS to a specific running instance of the smart contract, similar to how website owners can restrict usage of their sites even if the underlying software is open-source.\n\n3. The ToS approach allows the developer to potentially take legal action against users who violate the agreed-upon terms, such as bypassing the intended user interface.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because modifying the code to include restrictions would conflict with open-source licensing principles and may not be legally enforceable.\n\n5. Option B, while potentially useful as a technical measure, doesn't provide a legal basis for restricting usage of the deployed smart contract itself.\n\n6.

Which of the following actions would be most appropriate for the judge to take in this scenario?\n\nA) Immediately rule against the plaintiff based on the information from the academic paper\nB) Disregard the academic paper entirely and proceed solely based on the evidence presented in court\nC) Consider the academic paper in deciding whether to grant the early discovery motion, but not in the final judgment of the case\nD) Recuse themselves from the case due to exposure to potentially biasing information\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of the distinction between how judges can use external information in procedural decisions versus substantive judgments. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that it's appropriate for a judge to use \"non-evidentiary knowledge\" (like information from an academic paper) to make decisions on process, such as whether to grant an early discovery motion.\n\n2. However, it would not be proper for the judge to use such knowledge to inform a judgment on the substance of the case.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because it suggests using the academic paper to make an immediate ruling on the case, which would be improper use of non-evidentiary information.\n\n4. Option B is too extreme, as judges are allowed to consider external information for procedural decisions.\n\n5. Option D is unnecessary, as judges are expected to be able to differentiate between using information for procedural decisions versus substantive judgments.\n\n6. The question integrates multiple concepts from the documentation, including the distinction between process and judgment, the allowance for judges to consume media, and the expectation of judicial impartiality.\n\n7. It presents a real-world scenario that requires critical thinking about the appropriate use of information by judges, rather than simple memorization of rules."}, "98": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13624/is-it-possible-to-get-extradicted-to-a-country-you-never-have-been-to", "docs_id": 13624, "title": "Is it possible to get extradicted to a country you never have been to?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to wrap my head around the [MegaUpload / Kim Dotcom case](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/5149/8901) for quite a while now. On twitter he [claims](https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/582068295366410240):\n\n> I never lived there\n> \n> \n> I never traveled there\n> \n> \n> I had no company there\n> \n> \n> But all I worked for now belongs to the U.S.\n\nNow I came across a news item on the German portal [Spiegel Online](http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/anhoerung-in-neuseeland-dotcom-wehrt-sich-gegen-auslieferung-a-1109396.html) that says Kim Dotcom is about to be handed over to the U.S. authorities by a N.Z. court.\n\nNow I am wondering: He never had any company in the U.S., also he claims to never having been or lived there. Is it even possible to be prosecuted unter U.S. law? It sounds a bit weird to me. Also, is it possible to get extradicted to a country you never have been to?\n\nPersonally, to me the scary part is: Do I need to make sure I do not break any laws in *any* country of the world in the future, not only in the country I live? Or is this a difficult question to answer because the accusations against him are related to internet business?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n----\n\nKim Dotcom is alleged to have committed a crime against US law. The US requested his arrest by NZ authorities with whom they have an extradition treaty. He has now had his extradition hearing and the NZ court is satisfied that, under NZ law, he should be extradited to face those charges.\n\nYou do not have to be a citizen of a country to offend its laws. You do not have to be located within its borders.\n\nFor example, if you rob a US bank over the internet you are liable to prosecution in the US no matter where you are in the world.

The platform is hosted on servers in Country B, and the developer has never visited or conducted business in Country C. However, Country C claims the platform facilitates copyright infringement and seeks to prosecute the developer. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The developer is immune from prosecution as they have never been to Country C or conducted business there directly\nB) Country C can only prosecute if the developer's home country (Country A) agrees to extradition\nC) The developer may be subject to prosecution in Country C if extradition treaties exist, regardless of physical presence\nD) Country C can only seize assets related to the platform but cannot prosecute the individual developer\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of international jurisdiction in cybercrimes and the concept of extradition. The correct answer is C because, as explained in the documentation, a person can be prosecuted under a country's laws even if they have never been physically present there or directly conducted business in that country. The Kim Dotcom case illustrates this principle, where he faced potential extradition to the US despite claiming never to have lived or had a company there.\n\nOption A is incorrect because physical presence or direct business conduct in a country is not a prerequisite for prosecution, especially for internet-related crimes. Option B is partially true but overly restrictive; while extradition typically requires agreement between countries, it's not solely dependent on the home country's decision. Option D underestimates the reach of international law enforcement, as countries can pursue both asset seizure and personal prosecution.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the given information, application to a hypothetical scenario, and understanding of the real-world implications of international cyber law, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22858/can-california-counties-make-their-own-traffic-laws", "docs_id": 22858, "title": "Can California counties make their own traffic laws?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The state lays out traffic laws pretty clearly, but our county has some specific traffic needs (winter/snow issues). We're looking at having flasing green on recovery vehicles on route to their jobs. \n\nCan a county make a regulation like that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [State law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&division=12.&title=&part=&chapter=2.&article=7.) regulates the use of flashing and colored lights. Veh. Code 25250 says that \"Flashing lights are prohibited on vehicles except as otherwise permitted\", so if the state does not permit it, the county can't say anything about it. The list of permissions includes \"making a turn\", as a warning with parked on the side of the road, to warn of funeral procession, and nothing like what you describe.\n\nThe state does cover tow trucks in 25253:\n\n> (a) Tow trucks used to tow disabled vehicles shall be equipped with\n>  flashing amber warning lamps. This subdivision does not apply to a\n>  tractor\\-trailer combination.\n> \n> \n> (b) Tow trucks may display flashing amber warning lamps while\n>  providing service to a disabled vehicle.

Second, they can't be always flashing (it is allowed only when \"actually towing\"). Because state law forbids flashing lights except as specified, the described use is not specified, so it is forbidden.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A county government is considering implementing a regulation allowing recovery vehicles to use flashing green lights while en route to their jobs, citing specific local winter and snow-related traffic needs. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this proposed regulation?\n\nA) The county can implement this regulation as it addresses a specific local need not covered by state law\nB) The county must first seek approval from the state legislature before implementing this regulation\nC) The county cannot implement this regulation as it directly conflicts with state law governing vehicle lighting\nD) The county can implement this regulation, but only for vehicles operating on county-maintained roads\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the provided legal information to a specific scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. State law (Vehicle Code 25250) explicitly prohibits flashing lights on vehicles except as otherwise permitted. The documentation states, \"Flashing lights are prohibited on vehicles except as otherwise permitted\".\n\n2. The state law provides a specific list of permitted uses for flashing lights, which does not include the proposed use by recovery vehicles en route to jobs.\n\n3. For tow trucks specifically, state law (Vehicle Code 25253) only permits flashing amber warning lamps, not green, and only under specific circumstances such as when actually towing a vehicle or when an unusual traffic hazard exists.\n\n4. The documentation clearly states that \"Because state law forbids flashing lights except as specified, the described use is not specified, so it is forbidden.\"\n\n5. Counties do not have the authority to override state traffic laws in this manner.\n\nOption A is incorrect because local needs do not supersede state law in this case. Option B is misleading because seeking approval wouldn't change the fact that it conflicts with existing state law. Option D is incorrect because the county's jurisdiction over its roads doesn't grant it the power to contravene state vehicle codes.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the hierarchical nature of state and local laws regarding traffic regulations."}}
