It'll include things like offering my services, or performing designated tasks. From my interpretation above, I'm only allowed to use their IP for \"considering whether to enter into a contractual business relationship\", which doesn't seem to fit the end goal of my services at all. If I sign this, I still don't have access to their IP to offer my services.\n\nThe \"including but not limited to a potential investment transaction\" doesn't seem to apply to me, because I'm not an investor.

This NDA is designed for the preliminary phase where the recipient (potential contractor) is considering whether to enter into a business relationship with the company. It's not meant to cover the actual work performed by the contractor. If the contractor decides to work for the company, a separate contract for services would be created, which would include its own non-disclosure provisions. This new contract would supersede or replace the initial NDA.

The \"normal\" type of proof is the Bill of Sale. But most of the time, the Bill of Sale references a Purchase Agreement which most debt buyers don't want to show (because it usually contains numerous disclaimers that may hurt its case).\n\nBut if the Bill of Sale references a Purchase Agreement, then it is not complete without it, right? Is it true that if the defendant asks, the debt buyer has to produce the Purchase Agreement as a matter of law, because of this fact, or else lose the probative value of the Bill of Sale?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A document does not have to include every document that it incorporates by reference to be used in court. The lack of a complete set of documents goes to the weight of the evidence, and not to admissibility of the evidence or its ability to establish a *prima facie* case of liability.\n\nBut, a party to a lawsuit has means that a very straightforward and routinely used to obtain these documents and to use them in their own case, though mandatory disclosures of documents, through \"discovery\", or through subpoenas of documents. If the party sued has a copy of the document incorporated by reference, that can also be used.\n\nIndeed, a document incorporated by reference in a document that forms the basis for a lawsuit can usually be submitted in a \"motion to dismiss\" a claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, even though the usual rule is that only materials provided in the original legal complaint can be considered in this \"so what?\" motion which asks, \"if everything alleged in the complaint is true, is there still no basis to hold me liable?\"\n\nFor what it is worth, the Purchase and Sale agreement would normally create the debt and the Bill of Sale would merely evidence performance of the contract, in most cases. But that doesn't detract from the general nature of the question.\n\nIndeed, except for a handful of cases where the physical document is the evidence of the debt (like a \"live\" negotiable promissory note), the claim can be proven with sworn testimony in the absence of any documents at all, sometimes with evidence that there was a signed writing establishing the existence of the obligation even if it is no longer physically available.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a debt collection lawsuit, a debt buyer presents a Bill of Sale as evidence of debt ownership, but this document references a Purchase Agreement that is not provided.

According to the documentation, a document (in this case, the Bill of Sale) does not need to include every document it references to be used in court. The absence of the Purchase Agreement does not make the Bill of Sale inadmissible, but it may affect the weight of the evidence.

Espionage consists of the access, generally on behalf of a state (or belligerent party), to information that is held by another and considered as confidential or strategic, in the military, security, or economic field. Identities of personnel is very much confidential and strategic information, so passing that information to the government seems to qualify as espionage. Whether or not this equates to being \"involved in hostilities\" is unclear.\n\nThe case could certainly be made that an informant, especially one who does not go out of their way to gather intelligence or receive compensation is a civilian.

While civilians should generally not be targeted, informants who provide strategic information (like identities of personnel) could potentially be viewed as engaging in espionage or being \"involved in hostilities.\" However, this is not universally agreed upon, especially if the informant doesn't actively seek out information or receive payment.

Both basic copyright law, found in Title 17 of the United States Code, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (which amended Title 17 of the United States Code in part, and also added 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 4001 related to movie licensing) are federal statutes that do not have parallel state law counterparts.\n\nCopyright cases are in the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts when they arise in the United States. *See* 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a) (\"\\[t]he district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any Act of Congress relating to ... copyrights .... Such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in ... copyright cases.\").\n\n### This isn't a DMCA case\n\nThis strategy doesn't really utilize Section 230 of the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) (DMCA), however, which protects online hosts of sites from liability for user generated content, if the host honors DMCA takedown notices (subject to an exception for human trafficking content). DMCA takedown notices aren't strictly speaking applicable in this fact pattern.\n\nWhen Bob is the website's author, his content isn't user generated content from which he is protected from liability by Section 230\\. His Internet Service Provider is protected from liability for his content, but Bob isn't protected from liability for his content, because he isn't a third\\-party user of his own website.\n\n### The Basic Copyright Law Analysis\n\nOnce you understand that nuance that this isn't a DMCA question, the question collapses into a simple copyright infringement issue.\n\nThe bottom line in this copyright analysis is that if you take a snipper of material from a copyrighted source and link to the source copyrighted material, are you not likely to face copyright liability.\n\n**Links Are Basically Liability Risk Free**\n\nThe link itself, pretty much categorically, and without lots of additional relevant facts (basically some sort of conspiracy behind the scenes that can't be discerned from looking at the work itself), [will never give rise to copyright infringement liability](https://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/linking-copyrighted-materials).\n\n**Snippets Are Copyright Infringements That Fair Use Usually Excuses**\n\nSo, the remaining issue is whether a snippet of a copyrighted work flagged for educational purposes, creates risk of copyright infringement liability.\n\nThere is always some risk any time you publish a copy, no matter how small, of copyrighted material without the permission of the copyright owner.\n\nThe snippet is undeniably a publication of a copy of copyrighted work (by virtue of the premise of the question). This is a prima facie case of copyright infringement and your inclusion of a link to the source makes it fairly likely that your publication of this copy will be discovered by the copyright owner. So, this is a copyright infringement that gives rise to copyright liability unless this liability for copyright infringement can be overcome or excused by [the affirmative defense to copyright liability of fair use](https://ogc.harvard.edu/pages/copyright-and-fair-use).\n\nThe risk that the snippet will not be considered fair use, and therefore will be found to be a copyright infringement giving rise to copyright liability is relatively higher if the snippet is a photograph or a sound recording than it is if it is merely quoted words from the source.\n\nBut, usually, a reasonably small snippet of a copyrighted work published for educational purposes will come within the fair use defense, even though that really needs to be evaluated on a case by case basis.\n\n### Practical Context And Analysis\n\nThe fact that this mode of expression, with a snipped and a link on a blog for educational purposes is pervasive on the Internet, as a practical matter, means that generally speaking, this will be considered fair use.\n\nUsually, this strategy will prevent someone who uses it from facing litigation for copyright infringement, even though, in theory, the determination is highly fact and context specific.\n\nIt isn't a guarantee of no liability, but it is low risk.\n\nMost marginal cases where someone arguably slightly exceeds fair use are resolved with a cease and desist letter (with which Bob should comply even if he thinks his use is fair use), rather than litigation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Bob runs a blog where he shares how-to tutorials.

See [*Housen v. Nikolaisen*, 2002 SCC 33](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1972/index.do):\n\n> On a pure question of law, the basic rule with respect to the review of a trial judge\u2019s findings is that an appellate court is free to replace the opinion of the trial judge with its own. Thus the standard of review on a question of law is that of correctness ...\n> \n> \n> There are at least two underlying reasons for employing a correctness standard to matters of law. First, the principle of universality requires appellate courts to ensure that the same legal rules are applied in similar situations. ...\n\nIt is not open to the lower court to come to a conclusion that is different from that which the appellate court declares to be the correct one on a question of law. Even if lower court's interpretation would be one \"open to a reasonable person,\" it will be overturned if it does not match that of the appellate court.\n\n### Questions of law are reviewed on a lower standard (*reasonableness*) in judicial reviews of administrative decisions\n\nThe alternative standard, *reasonableness*, is applicable in the judicial review many administrative tribunals and agencies, even on questions of law. That is unless the statutory scheme invites more strict review by courts or if it is a constitutional question or a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole or relate to jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies, in which case, the administrative decision\\-maker's interpretation of law *will* still be reviewed on a *correctness* standard. See [*Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov*, 2019 SCC 65](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18078/index.do).\n\nBut even in this regime of judicial review, a decision will not be upheld simply because it was *open to a reasonable person* to come to the decision. The review looks like this:\n\n> A reviewing court must develop an understanding of the decision maker\u2019s reasoning process in order to determine whether the decision as a whole is reasonable. To make this determination, the reviewing court asks **whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision**\n\nThis is significantly more robust that merely inquiring whether the outcome was open to a reasonable person.\n\n> a court conducting a reasonableness review properly considers both the outcome of the decision and the reasoning process that led to that outcome was recently reaffirmed in *Delta Air Lines Inc. v.

This means the appellate court is free to replace the opinion of the lower court with its own. It's not enough for the lower court's interpretation to be reasonable or well-justified; it must be correct according to the appellate court's determination.

The poll has a 100% coverage (every american is interviewed and every american responds). The poll asks the intervieweds \"is a red squirrel an endangered species?\". Everybody responds \"no\". I hope that, by this expedient, I have fixed the *original* public meaning of the statute.\n\nThe 2nd of January 2020 (20 years later), another poll is conducted. Same question, 100% coverage, everybody now responds \"yes\". The public meaning has changed (right?).\n\nIn fact, there are now very few red squirrels: in the past 20 years, the meat of the red squirrel was found to be very tasty, or the fur very fashion, and so on. In particular, there are 2 red squirrels in all the USA, one male and one female, so we are still in time to save the species.\n\n1.

In the 2nd of January 2020 poll (20 years later), after the question \"Is a red squirrel an endangered species?\" (which everybody answer with a \"yes\"), there is the question \"is the death penalty cruel and unusual?\" to which everybody responds \"yes\".\n\nd. The 3rd of January 2020 I kill a red squirrel. Will I be subject to the death penalty?\n\nWith an originalist perspective, you should answer 2d with a \"yes\". It doesn't matter that the public meaning has changed, you need a formal amendment to the Constitution. Then, why you answered \"yes\" to question 1? Why it did matter in question 1 that the public meaning has changed?\n\nSorry if I make confusion.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What is an \"endangered species\"?\n--------------------------------\n\nNormally, this would be defined in the law. In fact, the *actual* [Endangered Species Act](https://www.fws.gov/endangered/laws-policies/section-4.html) does exactly that:\n\n> DEFINITIONS\n> \n> \n> SEC. 4\\. (a) GENERAL.\n> \n> \n> (1\\) The Secretary shall by regulation promulgated in accordance with subsection (b) determine whether any species is an endangered species or a threatened species because of ...\n\nSo, it's very clear for the purposes of this Act what an \"endangered species\" is. Red squirrels are an endangered species and you are going to jail if at the time you killed one the secretary of the Environment Department had determined they were and had promulgated that decision as required by the act.\n\nHowever, that just begs the question ...\n----------------------------------------\n\nLet's assume the Act did not define \"endangered species\". It doesn't have to. So what happens?\n\nWhen you go to trial, the judge will determine what \"endangered species\" means and whether red squirrels fit within the definition.\n\nIf you are not the first person tried under the act, then there will be a precedent that the judge will either be required to follow (if it's from a court higher in the hierarchy) or is likely to follow (if it's at the same level or lower in the hierarchy or in a parallel hierarchy).\n\nIf you are the first person, then they will probably start with a dictionary. Merriam Webster is a solid US based dictionary and it [says](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endangered%20species):\n\n> a species threatened with extinction\n\nThe lawyers for both sides will introduce evidence as to what that means and if it does or doesn't include red squirrels. The polls will be inadmissible because opinions aren't allowed as evidence unless they come from an expert. So your trial is likely to see a bunch of zoologists, ecologists, climatologists, etc. giving their opinion on what endangered species are and if red squirrels are one.\n\nIt is possible that on a case decided at a given time, red squirrels are no endangered under the accepted definition and that another time, they are endangered.

They would likely start with dictionary definitions to establish a general meaning. Then, since this is a technical/scientific term, they would rely on expert testimony from relevant fields like zoology and ecology to determine if red squirrels meet that definition based on their current population status. Public opinion polls would not be admissible as evidence. The judge would not simply defer to current public opinion, nor would they look only at lawmakers' personal views.

Some of the facts you are presenting are entirely wrong.\n\nPatents have inventors, copyrights have authors. Inventorship has strict rules.\n\nInventorship cannot be denied without consequence in almost any jurisdiction, but you'll need to get local legal advice. In the US, \"A patent is invalid unless it lists the first and true inventor or inventors of the claimed invention.\" (See Stark v. Advanced Magnetics, 119 F.3d 1551, 1553, 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1997\\); 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(f) (\u201cA person shall be entitled to a\npatent unless . . . he did not himself invent the subject matter sought to be patented).

It's very common to have you sign an agreement as a condition of your employment that you grant full assignment to your company for any patentable material created under their employ. If you did not, it is possible that the company would need to give you consideration for the right to assignment, e.g., they would have to pay you something to own the patent. If you are no longer there, that \"something\" can be substantial, because the patent is invalid without it, and they have little leverage over you.\n\nBring all written records, emails, etc. to a licensed attorney who specializes in patent litigation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee believes they were not properly credited as an inventor on a patent filed by their former employer.

[I have found a policy document online that does not appear to mention such a requirement](https://assets.wearemarmalade.co.uk/shared/assets/files/privatecar/Classic-PolicyWording.pdf).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In any sane jurisdiction, the clause would hold.\n\nBy and large, the legal fiction is that one has read and agreed to execute the entirety of the contracts they signed. If it was otherwise, no contract of substantial length would ever be enforceable upon individuals; yet such contracts are routinely offered and enforced (look at the terms\\&conditions of any internet website that sells stuff).\n\nIt is absolutely normal that a phone sale would gloss other minor details of the contract, and implicitly refer to the written text for the finer points. If the specific point had been raised in the phone call, and the salesperson erroneously told you X when in fact the contract read Y, you might have a case, but even then it is not necessarily a strong one (you signed the contract *after* having called; you might have changed your mind when reading the actual text, and you paying the insurance monthly bill is evidence that you agreed with the contract as\\-formed).\n\nThere are some exceptions to that general principle:\n\n1. **General conditions of validity of a contract.** For instance, in [france](/questions/tagged/france \"show questions tagged 'france'\"), a contract must have a [\"definite and legitimate content\"](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000032040911).

In most jurisdictions, clauses in a written contract are considered valid and enforceable, even if they weren't explicitly mentioned during a phone conversation. The legal principle assumes that individuals have read and agreed to the entire contract they've signed. While there are some exceptions (such as clauses that violate consumer protection laws), a residency requirement for drivers is likely to be considered a reasonable and enforceable clause.

[Tulsi Gabbard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi_Gabbard) is a Hawaii Army National Guard major. She is also a serving member of the House of Representatives. \n\nOn the face of it, it seems to be a violation of the separation of powers for any person to retain an officer commission while also being a legislator. She may, after all, (at least in theory) have to take orders from the commander\\-in\\-chief, who is in a different branch of the government.\n\nI do not think that her situation is unique. I am sure there have been many other legislators who were either in reserve or on active duty.\n\nWas there a SCOTUS case which provided guidance on why this is allowed? Or does this arrangement rely on a good faith belief that (a) a President would not interfere with the legislature by issuing orders which may interfere with an enlisted legislator's Congressional duties or that (b) such a legislator would not use her position to influence the armed services?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, this issue doesn't come up for people on active duty. [10 U.S. Code \u00a7 973](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/973) forbids active\\-duty military officers from holding or exercising the functions of an elective federal office; [DoDD 1344\\.10](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/134410p.pdf) extends that to all active\\-duty personnel. Both the law and the directive also apply to reservists or retirees on long\\-term active duty (more than 270 days).\n\nSecond, for status reasons, this is much less likely to come up with enlisted personnel. The sort of people who serve in Congress are generally also the sort of people who'd be officers. Many of the relevant restrictions apply to people holding *office* in the executive branch, and enlisted personnel do not hold office (only commissioned and warrant officers do).\n\nThird, an interesting quirk that makes this even more significant: Retired military personnel do not technically leave the military. They're no longer in active service, but they are still military personnel, bound by the UCMJ, and subject to both voluntary and involuntary recall. In fact, people retired from active\\-duty components are bound by the UCMJ at all times, whereas non\\-retired reservists are only bound by it when called up. If this is an issue for reservists because they might be called up, it's also an issue for retirees.\n\n---\n\nNow that we've handled preliminaries, the central issue comes from the Incompatibility Clause in Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution:\n\n> \\[N]o person holding any office under the United States, shall be a member of either House \\[of Congress] during his continuance in office.\n\nThe question is whether reservists count as holding an \"office under the United States.\" If it does, you have to resign from the reserves before entering Congress. However, *Congress* decides whether or not someone is qualified to be a member, and Congress has generally refused to explicitly decide if reservists are allowed (implicitly meaning that yes, they are).\n\n[6 Cannon's Precedents \u00a7\u00a7 60\\-\\-62](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6/pdf/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6-11.pdf) covers the situation as of World War I: the House Judiciary Committee recommended that members of Congress who had accepted National Guard commissions be considered to have forfeit their seats in Congress, but the full House didn't act on the recommendation. After the war, the House decided to pay members who had been on military service the difference between their congressional pay and military pay. In the second debate, the House considered the difference between temporary and permanent office. It was pointed out that in past wars, members had served as officers in short\\-term volunteer units and then returned to their seats at the end of their service. It was also pointed out that an \"office\" is an inherently permanent thing: a temporary commission for the duration of a war might not necessarily be an office.\n\n[2 Deschler's Precedents \u00a7 14](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2/pdf/GPO-HPREC-DESCHLERS-V2-1-4-6.pdf) discusses how things played out in World War II and beyond. Here, the US involvement was much longer, and there was more consideration given to the problems with holding both offices. The *executive* branch was the one that complained; they decided that serving in Congress was more important than serving overseas, and that military personnel who were also in Congress would be told to pick one (either go back to Congress and serve there, or resign from Congress and be in the military). In 1965, the Defense Department issued an order (currently found in [DoDD 1200\\.7](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodd/120007p.pdf)) which provides for the involuntary transfer of people in key positions (including all members of Congress) from the Ready Reserve to the Standby Reserve. Congress did not like that, and they (finally) struck back in the 2016 NDAA: they amended [10 U.S. Code \u00a7 10149](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/10149) to ban transfers to the Standby Reserve based on service in Congress. This certainly seems to promote the idea that Congress thinks reserve service is allowable, but when Barry Goldwater tried to get a resolution to that effect in 1963, Congress didn't act on it.\n\nSo in summary: Congress (which enforces the Incompatibility Clause) hasn't explicitly said simultaneous reserve service is allowable, but has essentially let it happen. The executive branch has tried to discourage it, but Congress has opposed that (personally, my guess is that members of Congress want the political benefit of saying \"I'm currently in the military,\" while the military would prefer not to have them).\n\n---\n\nI've discussed how Congress handles it, and Congress does have the final authority to judge the qualifications of its members. There was one Supreme Court case (cited in Deschler's Precedents) where a group tried to get the two positions ruled incompatible, but it was dismissed on standing grounds (the group could not establish that *they* were particularly harmed by the alleged violation). A lower court had held that the offices were incompatible, but that ruling was vacated by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, there was another opinion issued in 2006 where the courts couldn't duck the question. Sen. Lindsey Graham was also an Air Force lawyer (he's since retired), and while a Senator he was tapped to be a military judge on the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals. An airman was convicted at court martial and appealed to a panel that included Graham, then appealed again to the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. There's no question that a criminal defendant has standing to challenge whether his judge can legally be a judge, and Congress does *not* have the final say over whether someone's qualified to be a military judge. In *US v. Lane*, the CAAF held that Graham's office in the Senate was incompatible with service as a military judge. However, the CAAF cannot tell Congress \"you can't be an active reservist and a sitting member of Congress.\" Even the Supreme Court is limited in its ability to interfere with Congress's decisions on the qualifications of its members: the Court did hold that Congress can't add qualifications, but this is a question of \"does this provision apply to this person,\" which Congress has final authority over.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Representative Jane Smith is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and also serves as a Captain in the Army Reserve. The President, as Commander-in-Chief, orders all Army Reserve officers to report for a 6-month active duty deployment. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) Rep. Smith must immediately resign from Congress to comply with the President's order, as the Incompatibility Clause of the Constitution forbids her from holding both positions.\n\nB) Rep. Smith can ignore the President's order without legal consequences, as her position in Congress takes precedence over her military service.\n\nC) Rep. Smith is in a legally ambiguous position, as Congress has not explicitly ruled on the compatibility of reserve service and Congressional membership, but has generally allowed it in practice.\n\nD) Rep. Smith must comply with the President's order, and her seat in Congress will automatically be vacated for the duration of her active duty service.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legal status of serving simultaneously in Congress and as a military reservist remains ambiguous. While the Incompatibility Clause of the Constitution prohibits holding an \"office under the United States\" while serving in Congress, Congress itself has never explicitly ruled on whether reserve service constitutes such an office. In practice, Congress has allowed members to serve in the reserves, even opposing executive branch efforts to restrict such service. However, this arrangement relies more on precedent and Congressional acquiescence than on clear legal ruling.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the Incompatibility Clause exists, its application to reservists is not definitively settled.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it overstates the protection afforded to members of Congress regarding military service obligations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there is no automatic vacancy provision for members of Congress called to active duty, and historically, Congress has found ways to accommodate such service without forcing resignations.\n\nThe situation described presents a complex constitutional question involving separation of powers, legislative privilege, and military authority, reflecting the nuanced and sometimes unresolved nature of these intersecting areas of law."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38324/has-the-scope-of-share-alike-narrowed-between-cc-3-0-and-4-0", "docs_id": 38324, "title": "Has the scope of Share Alike narrowed between CC 3.0 and 4.0?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **What's the issue?**  \n\nThe wording of CC BY\\-SA licenses changed significantly between versions 3\\.0 and 4\\.0, but I don't believe Creative Commons (CC) intended to narrow the scope of share alike (I explain why later).

If these intangibles are owned by, say, Aplle (Ireland) then Apple (USA) will have to pay them to use them \\- whatever amount those two companies agree on will reduce Apple (USA)'s profit and raise Apple (Ireland)'s profit \\- the tax rates in each of these countries is [not the same](https://taxfoundation.org/corporate-income-tax-rates-around-world-2016/).\n\nNow, tax law says that such transfers have to be at fair market value. So, what is the fair market value of all the IP needed to build an iPhone? Or the value of the names \"Apple\" and \"iPhone\"? You don't know, I don't know, Apple doesn't know and the tax authorities don't know. Whatever figure they pick is defensible as \"fair market value\" because there isn't actually a market \\- fair or otherwise.\n\nResteraunts *can* do this too \\- McDonald's (Australia) pays a licence fee to use the name \"McDonalds\" but this is the only intangible McDonalds have \\- there is no patent on how to make a hamburger \\- so the scope for them to take advantge of this is less than for tech companies.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why tech companies are often able to pay less in taxes compared to traditional businesses?\n\nA) Tech companies operate exclusively in low-tax jurisdictions\nB) Tech companies have special government exemptions from taxation\nC) Tech companies can more easily shift profits through intangible assets\nD) Tech companies don't use physical infrastructure and thus aren't taxed\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Tech companies are often able to pay less in taxes due to their ability to shift profits through intangible assets like intellectual property, patents, and brand value. Unlike traditional businesses, a significant portion of tech companies' value lies in these intangibles, which can be owned by subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions. This allows them to transfer profits through licensing fees or royalties, reducing taxable income in higher-tax countries.\n\nOption A is incorrect because tech companies don't operate exclusively in low-tax jurisdictions, they just strategically place certain assets there.\nOption B is false as tech companies don't have special blanket exemptions from taxation.\nOption D oversimplifies the issue - while tech companies may use less physical infrastructure, this isn't the primary reason for their tax advantages.\n\nThe correct answer, C, highlights the key mechanism of profit shifting through intangible assets, which is much more difficult for traditional businesses like restaurants to replicate on the same scale."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/65427/is-it-legal-to-use-term-from-science-fiction-book-for-commercial-purposes", "docs_id": 65427, "title": "Is it legal to use term from science fiction book for commercial purposes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to use the word \"[Mentat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizations_of_the_Dune_universe#Mentats)\" in promo materials and documentation for commercial product, because it's perfectly describes what I want to say.\n\nSo may I use this fictional word as any other English word, or it's also subject of copyright?\n\nE.g. I often see the usage of 'Jedi' word in the life, but I am also not sure if it's ok to use it for commercial purposes?\n\nI mean without referring to any images/authors/any context, supposing everybody already knows what is it or will guess if not.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is probably a word that can be used, but not definitively.\n\nMany words of general applicability coined by authors enter into the general lexicon.\n\nThe process is similar, but not precisely identical, to the dilution of a trademarked term to become a generic descriptive term for anything in the category of items so trademarked. Early examples of originally trademarked words that entered the general lexicon are \"elevator\" and \"escalator\".\n\nFor example, the word \"grok\" coined by Robert Heinlein, is now part of the general lexicon, as is the word \"quark\" coined by James Joyce (although its current meaning has shifted). The word \"robot\" from K. \u010capek's play R.U.R. \u2018Rossum's Universal Robots\u2019 (1920\\), would be another example of a word coined in fiction that has entered general use.\n\nThe scene a faire doctrine also authorized public domain use of tropes and terms that have achieved wide use in a genre. As a rule of thumb, if three different authors have used a term to mean the same thing, or an author who is no longer in copyright has done so, it can be used freely.\n\nFor example, regardless of who originally used it, the term \"mecha\" would not be protected by the doctrine due to its used by multiple authors and commentators in a particular science fiction sub\\-genre.\n\n\"Mentat\" is a close case, because it is overwhelmingly used in a specific series of books written by Frank Herbert and his son with licensing from his estate, and because the series has produced so many published properties, not only in books, but in TV and movies, it has been close to maximally protected from an IP perspective by the Herbert Estate, his publishers, and his audio\\-visual licensees.\n\nThere is at least a colorable argument that use of the term in a fictional setting would be a derivative work, intended to evoke and be derived from the extended series of creative properties.\n\nThe best counterargument that the term has entered the general lexicon, or in any case is not a protected derivative work, would comes from use of the term in a non\\-fiction sense which is not negligible, even though it isn't terribly common.\n\n[Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentat_(disambiguation)) two (probably unlicensed) commercial uses, one as a trademark and the other as an IT company name, in addition to two minor fictional uses, one with a similar meaning and one with a somewhat shifted meaning.\n\nFurther, to the extent that the non\\-fiction use was great enough to show that it entered the general lexicon, at that point, fictional use would no longer be a derivative work because the work could be derived from many sources in which the Herbert estate does not have copyrights.\n\nA Google N\\-gram search could be used to evaluate that argument empirically. The use of the word in the early 19th century (before Herbert was born) is particularly promising, although the senses in which it was used pre\\-Herbert would have to be evaluated, and the context in which it was used post\\-Dune would also have to be evaluated (if all the uses are in his licensed books, it hurts the cause).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqjFE.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/bqjFE.png)\n\nA quick scan suggests that in the early 19th century that it was often used as a Latin or French word used untranslated for foreign flavor in English language works, so there is an argument that it is really a loan word not specific to Herbert. Much of the modern use is in fair use commentary expressly referencing Herbert's works and in obvious misspellings of the word \"mental\".\n\nParticularly encouraging in the N\\-gram search are the uses of the word in independent science fiction novels including \"The Search for Snout\" (2014\\) by Bruce Coville, \"Dorsai!\" (2013\\) by Gordon R. Dickson, \"Eye of the Storm\" (2009\\) by John Ringo, and \"The Ghost Brigades\" (2007\\) by John Scalzi. Also, particularly notable is the use of the word in an independent non\\-Dune novel in \"Clockwork Lives\" (2015\\) by Kevin J. Anderson and Neil Peart, since Kevin J. Anderson was a co\\-author of some of the Dune novels and would have contractual obligations to the Herbert Estate as well as copyright obligations; signifying a concession of non\\-ownership of the term by the estate. This use in five independent fictional cases in the same genre in works published long enough ago for the statute of limitations for infringement to have lapsed (with late filed suits used to muddy the waters). This strongly advances the scene a faire doctrine validation of the word.\n\nThe term is also used in a scientific journal article in 2008 in the Indian Journal of Experimental Biology, but in a related but not identical sense of the word.\n\nAnother litmus test regarding whether a word is part of the general lexicon is whether it appears in more complete dictionaries, such as the OED, or Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary, or in a notable published thesaurus, None of the dictionaries and no thesaurus that I have in hard copy have that word, but this could be because mine are dated. An updated dictionary and thesaurus search would be probative evidence of this question. A thesaurus search for \"genius\" or \"prodigy\" that came up with \"mentat\" listed would be a good thing to look for.\n\nA third issue for general lexicon v. derivative work analysis would be whether the word can be derived by obvious use of affixes and suffixes and retroflex letters from words that are in dictionaries. For example, a word plus \\-ology (for the study of), or \\-itis (for medical conditions) would not generally be beyond the scope of legally permissible public domain use. This again is a close call in the case of \"mentat\".\n\nSingle words are also harder (but not impossible) to protect as derivative works, if not trademarked as well, than extended passages either verbatim or paraphrased or translated, which would weaken the derivative work claim, although it wouldn't be entirely without merit just because it was a single word.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scenarios would provide the strongest legal argument for using the term \"Mentat\" in commercial marketing materials without infringing on potential copyright claims?\n\nA) The term appears in multiple independent science fiction novels by different authors, published years apart.\nB) The term was used in Latin texts from the early 19th century.\nC) The term appears in a scientific journal article with a slightly different meaning.\nD) The term is used as a company name by an IT firm.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nOption A provides the strongest argument for using \"Mentat\" commercially without copyright infringement. The appearance of the term in multiple independent science fiction novels by different authors, published years apart, strongly supports the scene a faire doctrine. This doctrine allows for free use of tropes and terms that have achieved wide use in a genre. The question mentions that if three different authors have used a term to mean the same thing, it can generally be used freely.\n\nOption B, while interesting, refers to a different usage of the term in a different language and context, which doesn't directly support its use in a science fiction or computing context.\n\nOption C shows some broader use of the term, but a single scientific article with a slightly different meaning doesn't provide as strong an argument as multiple uses in the same genre.\n\nOption D demonstrates some commercial use, but a single instance of a company name doesn't provide as robust a defense as multiple independent uses in published works within the same genre."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73881/why-do-solicitor-advice-procedure-regulations-require-collection-of-landlord-det", "docs_id": 73881, "title": "Why do solicitor advice procedure regulations require collection of landlord details at client intake when solicitors advise on tenancy issues?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been informed by a law firm that they are required by national regulations of the solicitors' authority to collect a landlord's name and address (not the address of the property in question, but the landlord's own operating address) before they can book in an advice session on a landlord\\-tenant issue, because it is required by regulations. I asked them what this is used for, and why it's required by the regulations (ie, what is the rationale and principle of the said regulation), and they couldn't tell me.\n\nI was hoping someone here could shed some light on this question instead. I am quite interested in the princple and rationale behind the requirement (and, why can advice not be dispensed simply on a hypothetical basis?), however, more significant is where it gets sent, what its collection's purpose is, and what it's used for.\n\nEdit: It would also be great if you could supply a citation of the specific regulation that imposes this requirement.\n\nNote: a bit new here, but don't really know necessarily what the most suitable tags to be used are, so if any others have suggestions for more applicable and relevant ones, please don't hesitate to suggest!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The purpose is to avoid the possibility that the solicitor will inadvertently end up providing advice to more than one side of the same dispute or transaction, putting the solicitor in a conflict of interest situation.\n\nIn the simplest case, the solicitor might already represent the landlord that the tenant is seeking to discuss legal rights vis\\-a\\-vis.\n\nEven if the advice is merely hypothetical, this is not O.K. A solicitor has a very high duty of loyalty to the solicitor's clients. Providing aid of any kind to someone adverse to the solicitor's clients that benefits that person, even if another solicitor would probably say the same thing, is a serious breach of that duty and is forbidden and sanctionable. It could get the solicitor kicked out of the profession in a worst case scenario. The duty of loyalty includes a duty to take reasonable care not to inadvertently or negligently act disloyally.\n\nThere is also a risk of a more subtle sort of conflict that has to be evaluated since many disputes and transactions are not just two sided.\n\nFor example, perhaps a solicitor a big commercial tenant client on the brink of a settlement with a particular landlord after lengthy and extensive negotiations (perhaps in a business lease renewal deal), and another prospective tenant client might, for example, have an interest in leasing the same property as your existing client at a higher rate. Representing both tenants/prospective tenants could creating a conflict between your two tenant clients. Screening clients based upon their landlord relationships helps solicitors to identify these conflicts and to prevent them from arising.\n\nMore generally, the best practice is for a solicitor to make sufficient inquiry prior to providing any legal advice to a prospective new client, to avoid having clients that have a conflict of interest with each other. This regulation (to the extent that it is really as specific as suggested) is simply a codification of this general rule in a specific, commonly recurring situation.\n\nIn large law firms, every single legal professional in the firm typically spends the first half hour or so of every day reviewing lists of new prospective clients and parties related to them in order to screen for potential conflicts of interest. (I used to have to do that when I worked in a large, international law firm for a while.) There would typically be one or more paralegals or administrators in the firm who do nothing but manage that conflicts of interest screening process.\n\nObviously, however, this requirement is a lot less burdensome if you are solo practicing solicitor who almost entirely represents individual human being and family tenants with isolated residential leases, and works in a large city where few clients have any connections to each other.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A solicitor is approached by a potential client for advice on a landlord-tenant issue.

This allows the solicitor to check if they already represent the landlord or any related parties in the same or similar disputes. It helps maintain the solicitor's duty of loyalty to existing clients and prevents them from inadvertently providing advice to opposing parties in a dispute. This practice is part of a broader conflict of interest screening process that legal professionals undertake to ensure they don't breach their ethical obligations or compromise their ability to represent clients effectively."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30859/gdpr-user-invitation-functionality-within-learning-and-development-platform", "docs_id": 30859, "title": "GDPR - User invitation functionality within learning and development platform", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are similar answers to queries around this but I just wanted to introduce this scenario to get some advice.\n\nCompany A provides pharmaceutical products to Company B\nCompany B is a pharmacy\n\nCompany A has created a learning platform which Company B will use to track training modules.\n\nThere is invitation functionality on the site where a supervisor of company B can invite their employees to sign up the learning platform.\n\nSo the supervisor is entering their employee's name and email (could be company email or personal) but this is all personal data. \n\nSo based on previous answers to similar questions.

Company B wants its employees to know how to use those products.\n\nIn that case Company B has a legitimate interest to add its employees to the learning platform.

But I don't know if that is the case.\n\nAlso note that in many EU countries, consent would not even be possible because there is a imbalanced relationship between an employer and an employee, see for example the [ICO website](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/when-is-consent-appropriate/) or [this page](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/how-my-personal-data-protected/can-my-employer-require-me-give-my-consent-use-my-personal-data_en) from the European Commission:\n\n> The employer\\-employee situation is generally considered as an imbalanced relationship in which the employer wields more power than the employee. Since consent has to be freely given, and in light of the imbalanced relationship, your employer in most cases can\u2019t rely on your consent to use your data.\n\n---\n\nBut besides that, the GDPR also requires data minimisation.

But there might also be reasons a pseudonym could not be used, for example if at the end of the course a certificate is received which lists the employee's name. \n\nHowever, it might be unlawful if a personal email address is used instead of a company email address.

Secret Service will continue to protect former Presidents and Vice Presidents for life, along with their spouses and children up to a certain age.\n\nWith all that in mind, it would not so much be that the Secret Service would prevent arrest of an individual under their protection so much as the Secret Service would be the arresting authority. As they are law enforcement agents under the Federal Government, they can legally arrest people and then hand them to the proper law enforcement agency to effect the arrest. This would mostly happen with candidates for office OR former presidents OR family at any point in time as the scenario described is a bit harder to make a legitimate arrest.\n\nIn fact, the Secret Service does have arrest authority with one of the highest conviction rates of any Law Enforcement Agency in the Country. It's just most crimes they arrest have nothing to do with threats to those under their protection. The Secret Service is also charged with investigation of counterfeiting of US currency and they are very good at it. This was actually their original sole function in the U.S. government and they still exist under the Treasury Department to this day. At this point, if you're wondering how they got the job of protecting important people in the executive branch from that, well, it's simple. At the time of his assasination, the legislation to create the USSS was on Licoln's desk. At the time of their creation, the only other Federal Police services were the U.S. Park Police, the Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Marshals. The first two had specific jurisdictions and the Marshals were undermanned so the USSS was tasked with investigating all sorts of financial crimes and quickly became the most successful U.S. Law Enforcement Service. They were also the first U.S. Intelligence and Counterintelligence agency (though they no longer are part of the Intelligence Community) until the FBI took on those duties.

The United States Secret Service was initially created to investigate counterfeiting of U.S. currency and was part of the Treasury Department. They became highly effective in law enforcement and were tasked with investigating various financial crimes. At the time of President McKinley's assassination in 1901, the USSS was already the most successful U.S. law enforcement service. Due to their expertise and the lack of other suitable federal agencies (the U.S. Park Police and Postal Inspection Service had limited jurisdictions, and the U.S. Marshals were undermanned), Congress authorized the USSS to take on full-time presidential protection.

In those jurisdictions, even if you have the copyright holder's permission, you must still respect the moral rights.\n\nLet's make some things explicit by considering a particular artwork. Say, this one:\n\n[![Leonardo's Mona Lisa](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEuEL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEuEL.png)\n\nThis particular piece is not subject to copyright because a) it was created before there was such a concept, and b) da Vinci died in 1519, so if there had been a copyright law, copyright in this work would have long expired. So, you can make as many copies of this as you like.\n\nNow, let's consider what the situation would be if Leonardo's alchemical pursuits had been more successful and instead of dying in 1519, he died last Tuesday.\n\nIf you want to make a copy of this image, you must have Leonardo's heir(s) permission or be operating under an exemption under copyright law in your jurisdiction.\n\nWhen you train your AI, you will need to make a copy of the image.

Given just this, you may, but are not required to.\n\nThe [Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (23\\)(1\\)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c34#BK22) says:\n\n> In a conveyance made on or after the 1st day of July, 1886, there\n>  shall, in the cases in this section mentioned, be deemed to be\n>  included, and there shall in those cases be implied, covenants to the\n>  effect in this section stated, by the person or by each person who\n>  conveys, as far as regards the subject\\-matter or share thereof\n>  expressed to be conveyed by him, with the person, if one, to whom the\n>  conveyance is made, or with the persons jointly, if more than one, to\n>  whom the conveyance is made as joint tenants, or with each of the\n>  persons, if more than one, to whom the conveyance is made as tenants\n>  in common:\n>  In a conveyance for valuable consideration, other than a mortgage, the\n>  following covenants by the person who conveys, and is expressed to\n>  convey as beneficial owner, namely, covenants for...ii. quiet\n>  enjoyment...according to the forms of covenants for such purposes set\n>  forth in Schedule B to the Short Forms of Conveyances Act, being\n>  chapter 472 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1980, and therein\n>  numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5, subject to that Act.\n\nIn other words, if the lease doesn't say anything about quiet enjoyment, there is an implied covenant whereby \"the landlord, by letting the premises confers on the tenant the right of possession during the term and impliedly promises not to interfere with the tenant\u2019s exercise and use of that right to possession during the term\". The implied covenant pertains to interference by the landlord, not to interference by other tenants (see [this analysis](https://renx.ca/the-tenants-right-to-quiet-enjoyment-how-far-does-it-go/)). Again, you would have a right to evict a noisy tenant, but not an obligation.\n\nHowever, the [Canadian Human Rights Act(6\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/page-1.html#h-3) states that:\n\n> It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of commercial\n>  premises or residential accommodation (a) to deny occupancy of such\n>  premises or accommodation to any individual, or (b) to differentiate\n>  adversely in relation to any individual, on a prohibited ground of\n>  discrimination.\n\nwhere 3(1\\) states:\n\n> For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination\n>  are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex,\n>  sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status,\n>  family status, genetic characteristics, disability and conviction for\n>  an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which\n>  a record suspension has been ordered.\n\nThe [Canadian Supremacy Clause](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-58) (52(1\\) of the Constitution Act, 1982\\) says that:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law\n>  that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to\n>  the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.\n\nand furthermore:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada includes (a) the Canada Act 1982, including\n>  this Act\n\nThe Constitution act (15\\)(1\\) [also states](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html):\n\n> Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right\n>  to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without\n>  discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on\n>  race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental\n>  or physical disability.\n\nSo under the Canadian Constitution, the national anti\\-discrimination requirement is superior to the provincial RTA. Since no provincial law actually requires eviction of a tenant with a noisy guest, there is no conflict.\n\nOntario also has an [anti\\-discrimination law](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90h19#BK3) (The Human Rights Code):\n\n> 1. Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination because of\n>  race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship,\n>  creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,\n>  age, marital status, family status or disability.\n> 2. (1\\) Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to the occupancy of accommodation, without discrimination because of race,\n>  ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed,\n>  sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age,\n>  marital status, family status, disability or the receipt of public\n>  assistance.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Every person who occupies accommodation has a right to freedom\n>  from harassment by the landlord or agent of the landlord *or by an\n>  occupant of the same building* because of race, ancestry, place of\n>  origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sexual orientation,\n>  gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family\n>  status, disability or the receipt of public assistance.\n\nRight must therefore refrain from hassling Left.\n\nA problem could arise if there is a lease clause whereby you guarantee tenants a noise\\-free environment and promise to remove noisy neighbors. In that case, Right could sue you, and you would have to defend yourself by reference to the fact that Canadian and provincial law prohibits you from pursuing eviction in this case.\n\nAn alternative would be to ask Left to not have the noisy individual over. But that would not be a wise choice. The anti\\-discrimination laws are not stated as protections against tenants who have the protected characteristics, indeed all tenants have some sex, religion, race etc. You can't start eviction proceedings because the tenant is white, black, Catholic, or atheist, and you likewise can't evict a person for having a guest who is white, black, Catholic, or atheist. You also can't \"have a talk\" with a tenant \u2013 creating a \"poisoned environment\" \u2013 because they or their guest are white, black, Catholic, or atheist. Having a mental disability is included in this set.\n\nAll that said, this is clearly a case that needs to be looked at by an Ontario landlord lawyer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord in Ontario has two tenants, Tenant A and Tenant B, living in adjacent rooms.

It acknowledges the landlord's awareness of the situation without discriminating against the guest with Tourette's syndrome.

Currently, the United States treats online platforms as private property and so the users are granted no rights of freedom of speech on those platforms. Does the Netherlands provide any additional rights over the United States?\n\nI know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights. If so, are these rights extended only to citizens of the Netherlands, or are these rights universal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Freedom of speech in the constitution\n-------------------------------------\n\nI think this is a very broad question, but I'll attempt an answer. To my knowledge, there is no specific Dutch law that considers freedom of speech *on the internet*. Instead, there is one article in the Dutch constitution that considers freedom of speech and a prohibition on censorship. That's [article 7 of the Dutch constitution](https://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/id/via0istdaus2/artikel_7_vrijheid_van_meningsuiting) (link in Dutch).\n\nIt consists of 4 sections. The first deals with freedom of speech in print, the second deals with radio and television, the third deals with (translated by me) *revealing thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned* and the fourth states that the aforementioned sections don't apply to commercial advertisements.\n\nSince you are asking about freedom of speech online, the third section applies. The section states that no permission is needed to *reveal those thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned* but it adds two conditions:\n\n1. In Dutch: *\"behoudens ieders verantwoordelijkheid volgens de wet\"*. This means that the freedom is subject to one's responsibilities under the law. In other words, other laws may curtail one's freedom under this section. This phrase is also included in the first two sections.\n2. The second condition which is specific to this section is that the law may restrict access to *performances* (*vertoningen* in Dutch; not sure if it translates well) to people under the age of 16 to protect good moral (*goede zeden* in Dutch; again not sure if it translates well).\n\nRestrictions under the law\n--------------------------\n\nSo the above about constitutional freedom of speech doesn't tell you a lot, it's very general. To answer your question you'd need to know what specific exceptions there are. These exceptions don't need to be specific to statements made online, if it's not allowed in public then the same rule would apply online.\n\nTo give these exceptions I'll summarize the information on [this page from the Dutch Amnesty International site on freedom of speech in the Netherlands](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland).\n\nHate speech and calling for criminal acts\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Amnesty article starts with some information on articles of criminal law:\n\n* [Article 137](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel137d/) forbids hate against or discrimination of people based on race, religion, gender, sexual preference, or mental handicap.\n\nAccording to [the Amnesty article](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland) this covers holocaust denial (considered unlawful discrimination) but not homophobia (when it expresses fear of or aversion to someone's sexual orientation).\n\n* [Article 131](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel131) and [article 132](http://www.wetboek-online.nl/wet/Wetboek%20van%20Strafrecht/132.html): calling for a criminal act or violent action against public order.\n\nSome interesting jurisprudence regarding your question and articles 131 and 132 is this case: [ECLI:NL:PHR:2019:1232](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:PHR:2019:1232). It's a Dutch Supreme Court case that considers calls for 'participation in the armed jihad' in the context of the war in Syria. The calls were made in Facebook posts (containing photos of dead victims, photos of ISIS flags, and statements in Dutch supporting jihad). The linked ruling confirms that these posts were in violation of articles 131 and 132 and that the posts were not protected under religious freedom nor as freedom of speech.\n\n* Libel [article 261](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel261) and slander [article 262](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel262) are also limitations on freedom of speech, even online.\n\nPreventing publication of military secrets\n------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the [Amnesty article](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland) censorship (as in ruling some statement against the law before publication) is not something Dutch courts may normally do. It names one exception: when military secrets may be revealed. Then a court may prevent publication, unless the military secrets are such gross violations of human rights that publication would be warranted.\n\nRights on a platform\n--------------------\n\n> I know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights.\n\nI'm not sure what you're referring to here but I don't think it refers to freedom speech. In any case, after some googling I found a case that is about this: [someone filed summary proceedings](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2020:4966) in the Netherlands because they disagreed with Facebook removing pages on its platform that didn't conform with Facebook's policy on Covid\\-19\\. As far as I can see from skimming the court ruling, the ruling holds that freedom of speech does not extend to companies like Facebook having to host your posts. I think it's basically a long ruling that boils down to [the well\\-know XKCD on free speech](https://xkcd.com/1357/).\n\nOn the other hand, the ruling also points to the service agreement between Facebook and the user. Part of those terms and conditions are entered as facts in the proceedings. Since it's a civil case, I assume users might derive some rights from that if the agreement touches on that.\n\nAnother thing that sounds familiar (based on that quote from your question) is [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality). Like in the US, that's mostly about network providers having different rules for different content, which isn't allowed in most cases under net neutrality.

Fair housing, which is a federal concept, pertains to issues such as using prohibited personal facts to determine whether to accept an offer. (Hazardous materials disclosures are also mandated at the federal level, but are are included in state requirements which can get pretty broad). \n\nIf you are buying in Washington state, [RCW 64\\.06\\.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.06.020) says what and how you must disclose. The list of disclosures is very detailed, covering title and covenants, water, sewer, structure, systems and fixtures, environment, and mobile home related. The only one of the 86 questions about smoke is whether smoke alarms are present. Thus smell of smoke is not a legally material fact that must be disclosed, in this state. The California disclosures, even longer, are [here](http://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/re6.pdf), and there is likewise no \"smells bad\" disclosure.\n\nIt is unlikely that any state in the US mandates such a disclosure, since it is somewhere between a subjective evaluation and a self\\-evident fact. Some people are very sensitive to certain smells while others do not care. The burden is on the buyer to pursue matters of personal concern (in writing!), such as whether any dog has been present in the house in the past 5 years (some people care). You have to look carefully at the response. \"Don't know\" is usually a safe bet, unless you actually have factual knowledge.\n\nFrom what I can determine, Massachussetts is on the opposite end of the spectrum from California. There are some requirements imposed on real estate agents, and there is the federal lead paint disclosure, but otherwise it appears that nothing is mandated by law. [This form](http://startpoint.com/DocLibrary/SellerDisclosure.pdf) seems to be used by the real estate association, and there is a question about \"history of smoke/fire damage to structure\". The reasonable interpretation of that is \"has the house caught fire and suffered damage\", so \"no\" from a cigar\\-smoker would not be fraudulent. If the intent of the question were to reveal if someone has smoked frequently in the house, that would he the question they'd ask. You can check whether you have this form and see what it says, but \"smoke damage\" would not normally be interpreted as meaning \"smells a bit funny\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the seller's legal obligation to disclose a smoke smell in a house prior to sale?\n\nA) The seller must disclose any noticeable smoke odor as part of mandatory state disclosures.\nB) The seller is only required to disclose if there has been actual fire or smoke damage to the structure.\nC) The seller must disclose the presence of smoke odors if specifically asked by the buyer.\nD) There is no legal obligation for the seller to disclose smoke odors in Massachusetts.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, Massachusetts has minimal disclosure requirements for home sellers. The state does not mandate disclosure of smoke odors or regular smoking in the house. While there may be a question about \"history of smoke/fire damage to structure\" on some real estate forms, this typically refers to actual damage from fires, not lingering odors from smoking.

Could stock markets or the authorized distributors of their data bring about any consequences legally to someone who republishes the data without permission?\n\n*Assuming financial market quotes can't be copyrighted,* can the distributors of the information (exchanges or their authorized distributors) use a contract (terms of service) to prevent someone from redistributing the data that they don't own (the copyright to) in the first place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe that it varies by country. The law provides protection for databases and data sets, where sufficient creativity/choice/curatorship has gone into its creation. It's separate from but similar to copyright law. So far it exists in several countries including the EU but I'm hazy whether it exists in the US (from memory it doesn't) and the exact criteria. \n\nIn any case such a website may not meet the criterion for copyright \\- although the original data creator (the stock exchange whose data is being used/reused) may have. \n\nI don't know about IP law \\- is the fact of a current price (or dataset of such facts at different times) protectable as IP instead? Are facts generally? Can I declare facts such as my street address, or a number, as IP? Clearly commercial effort goes into it, and clearly it can be protected by contract but copyright/IP law is less clear to me. The question of copyright protection for a commercially valuable *number* **has** been [tried in court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy), however, as has the question of [a commercially valuable number which is constructed into a number that is notable for noncommercial reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime).\n\n(As a possibly similar thought\\-question that might shed light on it \\- suppose a website is hosted using stock settings of some \"off the shelf\" website software, can they sue for copyright/look and feel over the appearance of their site? Probably not since they didn't put creative/novel/original effort into it. But the original software creator probably could.)\n\nHope this partial answer helps.\n\n**Updated to answer follow\\-up comment**\n\nFirst off, you can't force a person to do something based on a contract with someone else. Only the websites contract with the end user (terms of use etc) can do that. So the supplier's contract with the stock price website cannot in any way force an end user to do or not do anything. It can however require the vendor to set specific terms and enforce them. It can require the vendor to sue an abuser of the website terms (or allow the supplier to do so in their place and at their risk) if the supplier says to do so. Or it can allow for anything else agreed between the data supplier and the stocks website.\n\nThe flip side is that this would be a contract case for damages. Unless there are statutory damages (which don't exist in most countries and exist but might not apply in the US), the supplier would have to prove the harm and loss forseeably and directly suffered and would only be compensated for that alone. A lot of breach of contract cases just aren't worth taking to court for that reason \\- because you could prove the contract was breached but not that you lost anything, much less that your loss was a direct result and foreseeable by the end user.\n\n(In the EU, you'd also have to be able to show that the terms were not unreasonable as the law protects consumers from gross disparity if ability to set contract terms, and fixed terms deemed unfair, but that probably wouldn't be an issue here).\n\nThe latter part of the followup is essentially discussing nondisclosure agreements. You don't have to own the data for that \\- there is legal consideration by each party and that's enough (each has given something to the other: \"I will show you some information if you agree to these conditions\"). But that's contractual too, and the same applies, if the user shared the data anyway or disclosed it, your damages would quite likely be limited to the loss you could prove, whatever the contract says.\n\nLast the law on databases/data sets isn't something I know huge amounts about. Where such a law existed, a supplier would probably argue that sufficient original effort went into the collation and organisation of the data and the user would probably counterargue that this was mere storage of data and no original work was involved, or that any damage (if any) was negligible and would have to be proven. As databases have their own law and not pure copyright law, they might be right or wrong, depending on the jurisdiction and wording of the law.\n\nWikipedia articles of relevance to databases/datasets:\n\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_generis_database_right> (global information)\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_Directive> (EU specific and more detail what's covered)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A financial data company collects and organizes real-time stock market quotes from various exchanges and makes this data available through their website.

However, in a breach of contract case, the company would typically need to prove actual damages resulting from the breach, which can be challenging. Database rights laws exist in some jurisdictions like the EU, but their application to stock data is not straightforward and varies by country.

Java compiles to bytecode that requires a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for execution, and this JVM is provided by Oracle, necessitating a license agreement. C and C++, on the other hand, compile directly to machine code that can be executed by the computer's processor without an intermediary virtual machine. The license for executing C and C++ code is typically covered by the operating system's license or the computer's general usage terms. Option A is incorrect because C and C++ are not necessarily open-source, and their lack of a specific installation license is not related to their ownership status. Option C is false because C and C++ do have standard libraries, but these are usually part of the operating system. Option D is partially true but oversimplifies the situation and doesn't accurately represent the key difference in how Java code is executed compared to C and C++."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45897/if-someone-orders-a-pizza-in-the-us-and-doesnt-pay-for-it-could-they-be-arrest", "docs_id": 45897, "title": "If someone orders a pizza in the US and doesn&#39;t pay for it, could they be arrested?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If you were to order a pizza in the US and didn't pay for it afterwards, could you be arrested?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n\nSee [Florida Man's Version of Dine and Dash Involving A Pizza Delivery](https://ktk985.radio.com/blogs/985-ktk-morning-show/florida-mans-version-dine-and-dash-involving-pizza-delivery)\n\nJames Chandler was arrested after allegedly ordering a pizza and cinnamon sticks and partially eating them without paying.

Rather, the entire discourse poetically describes a youth, presumably under the legal adult age of 18 (given restrictions on smoking cigarettes and owning adult literature in the second verse), who faces restrictions upon his or her rights by his legal guardians, in this case a mother, father, and teacher.\n\nWhereas the dictionary definition of the verb form of \"Party\" is defined by Oxford Dictionary as \"Enjoying oneself at a party or other lively gathering, typically with drinking and music.\" As established, the subject of the proposed treaty on this right is legally barred from drinking, though a party may exist without alcohol and thus would not prevent the subject from engaging in an act of partying.\n\nA party or lively gathering would meat the definition of \"Freedom of Peaceful Assembly\" under the First Amendment Rights of the United States Constitution as well as \"Freedom of Association\" under the same amendment. Said party may additionally be for any purpose so long as it is peaceful.\n\nThe state may impose reasonable restrictions on the party, such as noise ordinances, age based restrictions on minors including \"Adult Contents\", cigarettes and alchohol, as discussed. While typcial, they're absence does not prevent the assembly from rising to the level of \"party\" as previous defined.\n\nBeastie Boys contends that the restrictions place upon the subject of their discourse on the Right to Party is unreasonably restricted by the confiscation of several items, enforced school requirements, and dress code as defined by the legal guardian in their right as authority of the youth's rights. Beastie Boys offers little evidence that these restrictions are unreasonable or prevent the subject from \"partying\" as defined above. Beastie Boys do propose that the authority known as the father can not restrict the use of cigarettes by the youth as the father \"smokes two packs a day\". While Beastie Boys is correct that this meets the definition of hypocritical, the father is assumed to be of legal age to purchase cigarettes and is legal allowed to restrict access to them based on reasonable age restrictions and possible heath risks the father wishes to prevent in the youth that he may or may not be suffering from. As there are no formal requirements for a peaceful assembly to rise to the level of party, it can be presumed that these restrictions would not affect the party as defined. It should also be noted that in the Beastie Boys discourse, that the authority figure referred to as mother did not restrict the youths ability to listen to the content of the discourse, nor were any restrictions described tailored in such a fashion as to restrict the discourse specifically.\n\nWhile there is no amendment defining the right to party in the United States Constitution, the 9th Amendment does clearly state that citizens rights are not enumerated in the constitution and other rights not discussed in the constitution may exists and be claimed by the individual.\n\nFrom an originalist standpoint, it is widely accept that a good number of The Framers of the Constitution quite frequently met the accepted definition of the phrase \"Drunk off their Ass\" and thus, would not reasonably be against what can be defined as a \"party\". Additionally, many were participants in an event that was known as the \"Tea Party\", which was agreed by many to be quite the lively gathering at its time and was still viewed as quite the \"radical\" affair of the day, many wearing costumes such as those who attended in clothing traditional of Native Americans. They were also most likely not drunk during the course of this party. Thus, the intent of the framers was never to restrict or deniegn such a right\n\nThus, a reasonable court in the United States would hold that the Right to Party does exist for all U.S. citizens and is inalienable.\n\nBeastie Boys also argues that it is acceptable to fight for one's right to party. This does not conflict with the First Amendment Right to petition government for grievances so long as it is again a peaceable affair. Given the poetic nature of the discourse, we can presume that \"Fight\" would mean to defend or struggle in a non\\-violent manor for such a right. This is backed up through originalism as the restrictions placed on many citizens of Boston for their actions during the Tea Party were subsequently fought against for many years, culminating in the Constitution.\n\nThus, it can be assumed that the United States does recognize the right of the people to party and the right of the people to fight for the aforementioned right.
