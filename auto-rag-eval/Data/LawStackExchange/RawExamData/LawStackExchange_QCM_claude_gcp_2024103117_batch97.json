My quandary is as follows:\n\nGenerally a business is under no obligation to accept pennies as a form of payment.\n\nDepartment of the Treasury states that:\n\n> no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an\n> organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods\n> and/or services.\n\nHowever, it is unclear how this concept applies to a situation where a tenant is using pennies to pay for his rent and the landlord is refusing to accept pennies as a form of payment.\n\nThe lease between the landlord and tenant does not stipulate that the tenant must pay using a specific form of money. However, it does allow the landlord to evict if the tenant does not pay the rent within 60 days after it is due.\n\nIf the tenant offers to pay rent in pennies \\& the landlord refuses to accept payment, does that mean that the tenant is in violation of the lease agreement which states that the tenant can be evicted if \"he does not pay rent within 60 days after it is due\"? In other words, while I understand the landlord has a right to reject the rent, the tenant may have fulfilled his obligation as it relates to the terms of the lease as soon as he offered to pay rent?\n\nAdditionally, the tenant could argue that if he pays after the due date it is like a debt which can be paid off in any form. Since rent is due at the beginning of each month, if the tenant pays his rent several days after the rent is due, the payment is now considered payment for a debt which would require the landlord to accept it in any form?\n\nSection 31 U.S.C. 5103, states:\n\n> United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and\n> circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are\n> legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues.

As you have correctly quoted, there is no limit to the number of US coins that are valid for payments, unlike in many other jurisdictions where there is such a limit.\n\nAccept the coins, make the tenant wait while you count them one by one and then give them a receipt.

The lease agreement does not specify the form of payment required. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landlord can legally refuse to accept the coins and immediately evict the tenant for non-payment of rent.\n\nB) The landlord must accept the coins as payment, as they are legal tender for all debts according to U.S. law.\n\nC) The landlord can refuse the coins, but cannot evict the tenant if they have offered to pay within the timeframe specified in the lease.\n\nD) The landlord can only refuse the coins if they modify the lease agreement to specify acceptable forms of payment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the landlord has the right to refuse accepting coins as payment, they cannot evict the tenant for non-payment if the tenant has offered to pay within the specified timeframe in the lease. The tenant has technically fulfilled their obligation by offering payment, even if the form is inconvenient. The landlord's refusal to accept the payment doesn't automatically put the tenant in violation of the lease. Option A is incorrect because immediate eviction would not be legal in this situation. Option B is incorrect because while coins are legal tender, private businesses are not obligated to accept them. Option D is incorrect because while modifying the lease for future transactions might be advisable, it doesn't solve the current situation or give the landlord the right to refuse payment that has already been offered."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60946/are-apps-delivered-by-a-door-to-door-salesman-in-any-way-according-to-ftc-rul", "docs_id": 60946, "title": "Are apps &quot;delivered by a door-to-door salesman&quot; in any way, according to FTC rules?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a person buys an app on the Google Play store, is the person \"buying from a door\\-to\\-door salesman\" or not?\n\nThat is, the FTC has a mandatory 3\\-day \"[Cooling\\-off Period for Sales Made at Home or Other Locations](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/cooling-period-sales-made-home-or-other).\"\n\nI'm asking because the buyer does not visit any physical location, but no salesman comes to the buyer's house.

This includes transactions made through mobile app stores like Google Play or Apple's App Store. The rule is primarily designed for door-to-door sales and sales made at locations other than the seller's regular place of business.

Therefore, option B is correct, as it accurately states that the rule does not apply to this scenario.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it wrongly assumes the Cooling-Off Rule applies to online purchases. Option C is incorrect because the price threshold is not relevant in this case, and the rule doesn't apply regardless of the cost. Option D is incorrect because although the consumer may be at home when making the purchase, the transaction is still considered an online sale, which is exempt from the rule."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21990/inheritance-or-gift", "docs_id": 21990, "title": "Inheritance or gift", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I got some stock from my family last year.\nDo I call this as an inheritance from my family? Or a gift from my family?\n\nAnother way to ask this is:\nDoes inheritance always happen posthumously?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\n**Inheritance** usually refers only to a post\\-humous transfer, but that usage isn't absolute. There are circumstances when people will use the word in an extremely broad sense that also includes large transfers received during the donor's life in lieu of a true **inheritance** received at death, and it isn't completely incorrect to do so.\n\nFor example, if the stock made up 90% or 100% ownership in a family business, often this might be called an **inheritance** even if it was received while the donors were alive.\n\nStill, if you received the stock while the donors were alive, the preferred term would be to call it a **gift** (even though a **gift** can include gifts made during life and gifts made upon death).\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nIf you receive something because someone died and their will says that you should receive it, the proper legal term for this is a **devise**. You are a **devisee**. A **devise** and **bequest** and **legacy** are close synonyms. Historically, a gift by will of personal property at death was called a **bequest** or a **legacy**, and a gift by will of real property at death was called a **devise**, but the terms are now often used more or less interchangably.\n\nThe original primary meaning of the word **legacy** has become a secondary and technical one in contemporary usage. Now, the term **legacy** is primarily used to refer to the reputation that someone (usually, but not always, someone who has died or at least ceased to participate in a particular field in which they are distinguished) has left behind and is associate with.\n\nIf you receive something because someone died and they didn't have a will, the proper legal term for this is an **inheritance** and you are an **heir.** (In civil law jurisdictions not derived from the laws of England where English is spoken, such as Louisiana, there is also the term a **testamentary inheritance** which means a **devise** or **bequest** in the narrow technical senses of those words.)\n\nHowever, many people (even in legal circumstances) use the term **inheritance** to refer to anything received as a consequence of someone's death even if it was pursuant to something other than **intestate succession** (which is the passing of property at death other than pursuant to a will or a beneficiary designation or joint ownership). And, the term **heir** is likewise sometimes used more generally to refer to anyone receiving an **inheritance** in the broader sense of the word.\n\nThe term **heir** also refers to someone who would be entitled to receive an **intestate succession** at the time if someone died, even in the absence of any actual inheritance or death. This narrow sense of the word is also called an **heir at law**. And the term **heir** is also used in a slightly different sense to refer to someone who would receive the property or feudal title of someone if they died, even if this is not pursuant to **intestate succession**. If one wants to distinguish this sense of this paragraph from other senses of the word **heir**, one can say **heir apparent**.\n\n(There are also non\\-literal senses of the words **inheritance** and **heir** that refer to people who are recipients of intellectual contributions made by someone or some movement. Similarly, there is a technical sense of the word in genetics which means to receive a trait genetically from a parent. More generally, sometimes the semantic focus when one uses the word **inheritance** is on the fact that something is received by someone in a younger generation from an older generation, rather than on the timing of the transfer.)\n\nIf you receive property from a trust or a beneficiary designation you are a **transferee** also called a **beneficiary** and the technical terms for this are **non\\-probate transfer** or **distribution**.\n\nThe term **gift** usually refers to a transfer of property during life, but the strict technical meaning of the word **gift** includes both gifts made during life and gifts given as a consequence of a death. The strict technical term for a gift given during life when the context doesn't make the fact that the donor is alive at the time of the gift is a **lifetime gift** or an **inter vivos gift**.\n\nWhile it is contrary to the technical meaning of the term **inheritance** and also to the broader literal meaning of the term **inheritance**, people sometimes the term **inheritance** very loosely to refer to a large **lifetime gift** made in lieu of an **inheritance** or **devise** or **bequest** at death. But, this usage is not appropriate in technical discussions.\n\nIf you received the stock during the life of the donor, it would be more clear and a better usage to say that it was a **gift**, rather than an **inheritance**, even though it would not be unheard of (and not absolutely incorrect) to call a large gift made during life in lieu of a transfer at death an **inheritance** and even though a **gift**, in theory, could be made after death. In this extremely broad, but literal, sense, **inheritance** refers to a substantial, usually one time, intergenerational transfer of wealth.\n\nAlso, when one talks about **inherited wealth** one is usually talking about all wealth received from lifetime gifts and gifts made upon death by any means, combined, rather than in the narrow sense of wealth received upon someone's death. Similarly, the word **inheritance** can be used in the sense of all of a person's **inherited wealth** rather than with respect to a particular transfer of property, and in this sense **inheritance** refers to all wealth received from lifetime gifts and gifts made upon death by any means, combined, rather than in the narrow sense of wealth received upon someone's death. Indeed, sometimes **inheritance** is used even more broadly still to refer to everything a person owns (i.e. all of their wealth) without regard to its source, although this usage is usually limited to poetic or religious uses of the word.\n\n(While I don't cite to sources here, I have been an estate planning attorney for twenty years and just yesterday taught a course to attorneys and accountants that spent the first 40 minutes or so defining these terms.)\n\nThe [origin of the word inherit](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/inherit) is as follows:\n\n> Middle English enherite \u2018receive as a right\u2019, from Old French\n> enheriter, from late Latin inhereditare \u2018appoint as heir\u2019, from Latin\n> in\\- \u2018in\u2019 \\+ heres, hered\\- \u2018heir\u2019.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the origin and evolving usage of the term \"inheritance\"?\n\nA) The term \"inheritance\" exclusively refers to property received after someone's death, with no exceptions.\n\nB) \"Inheritance\" originally meant \"to receive as a right\" and has retained this exact meaning without any evolution in usage.\n\nC) The word \"inherit\" comes from Old French and Latin roots meaning \"to appoint as heir,\" but its modern usage has expanded to sometimes include large lifetime gifts in lieu of posthumous transfers.\n\nD) \"Inheritance\" and \"gift\" are interchangeable terms in all legal and colloquial contexts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately captures both the etymological origin of the word \"inherit\" and its evolving usage. The term originates from Old French \"enheriter\" and Latin \"inhereditare,\" meaning \"to appoint as heir.\" While the primary meaning of inheritance still refers to posthumous transfers, the usage has expanded in some contexts to include substantial lifetime gifts that serve a similar function as traditional inheritances. \n\nOption A is too restrictive, as the passage indicates that there are some exceptions to the posthumous requirement in modern usage. Option B is incorrect because it ignores the evolution in the term's usage over time. Option D is clearly wrong, as the passage distinguishes between inheritances and gifts in most contexts, even though there can be some overlap in very broad usages."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45078/what-is-assignee-of-record", "docs_id": 45078, "title": "What is &quot;assignee of record&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I see \"Assignee of Record\" in some forms associated with small\\-claims in California, i.e. [https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc130\\.pdf](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/sc130.pdf).

Some or all food often attracts a lower tax rate to decrease the economic burden on the poorer demographic. \n\nFrance has four VAT tax [rates](http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/sites/taxation/files/resources/documents/taxation/vat/how_vat_works/rates/vat_rates_en.pdf): \n\n1. super\\-reduced rate: 2,2%\n2. reduced rate: 5,5% or 10%\n3. standard rate: 20%\n\nWhile **foodstuffs** can attract all tax rates, **restaurant and catering services** only attract the **reduced rate** at either 5,5% or 10%. But the 5,5% rate only applies to school cantines. All other restaurant services attract the 10% rate, with the exception of alcoholic beverages, which are liable to 20%.\n\nConsequently, the additional 15% are not a tax, but a 'service fee' for additional services rendered, such as plates, tables, glasses etc.\n\nIf it is true that there was no display in the pub that mentioned this service fee, this might have violated provision **L113\\-3** of French Consumer Code (**Code de consommation**), which states:\n\n> Article L113\\-3\n>  Tout vendeur de produit ou tout prestataire de services doit, par voie de marquage, d'\u00e9tiquetage, d'affichage ou par tout autre proc\u00e9d\u00e9 appropri\u00e9, informer le consommateur sur les prix et les conditions particuli\u00e8res de la vente et de l'ex\u00e9cution des services, selon des modalit\u00e9s fix\u00e9es par arr\u00eat\u00e9s du ministre charg\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie, apr\u00e8s consultation du Conseil national de la consommation.\n\nFrom this follows that the restaurant as service provider must inform the consumer about the price.\n\nA violation in contravention of said law allows for the imposition of an **administrative fine** of up to **15000,\\- \u20ac**:\n\n> Tout manquement \u00e0 l'article L. 113\\-3 et aux arr\u00eat\u00e9s pris pour son application et \u00e0 l'article L. 113\\-3\\-1 est passible d'une amende administrative dont le montant ne peut exc\u00e9der 3 000 \u20ac pour une personne physique et 15 000 \u20ac pour une personne morale. L'amende est prononc\u00e9e dans les conditions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article L. 141\\-1\\-2\\.\n\nHowever, this does not answer whether a customer might be able to reclaim the money where the display of the price was not made in accordance of said law.\n\nFurthermore, the question remains whether the service fee was incorporated into the service contract as a standard term.

It's likely a service fee for on-site consumption. However, according to Article L113-3 of the French Consumer Code, businesses must inform consumers about prices and special conditions of sale. Failing to display this fee likely violates this law, which can result in administrative fines up to \u20ac15,000 for businesses.

A statute of limitations statutorily encodes what is a reasonable delay (if SCOTUS thinks that 5 years is too long a time, they can so rule and Congress will have to change the law). The practical rationale for limiting the delay on trying a person is that after 30 years, memory of the details surrounding an event are likely to be very unreliable, so that witnesses on both sides are of limited value. In addition, the limit motivates law enforcement to investigate the problem in a timely manner.\n\nThe federal law, [in the general (noncapital) case](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3282), is that the limit for all crimes is 5 years, There are various longer limitations, including none for capital offenses. [Criminal contempt](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3285) has a shorter limit of one year, and otherwise 5 years is the shortest period for criminal prosecution at the federal level. The reason why perjury has a 5 year limit is that it is not one of the specific more serious offenses and it is not criminal contempt. [The limit in 1948](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/80th-congress/session-2/c80s2ch645.pdf) was 3 years, and was [increased to 5 years](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-68/pdf/STATUTE-68-Pg1142.pdf) in 1954\\.

Is the act that Bob washes his hands valid consideration on his side?\n\nIf the answer to the above is *Yes*, is there any line dividing *contract* and mere *permission* to use things subject to certain conditions?\n\nAnswers for any jurisdictions are welcome, though mostly interested in [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) ones.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consideration\n-------------\n\nConsideration is essential on both sides of every simple common law contract (civil law is different). It is the *quid pro quo* or \"something for something\" that is the essence of a contract \\- it's what turns an unenforcable agreement into a contract.\n\nA formal contract supported by a deed does not need consideration.\n\nThe rules of consideration are that it:\n\n1. must move from the promisee, but need not move to the promissor. For example, you promising me to wash someone else's car is good consideration.\n2. may be 'executed' (something for something now) or 'executory' (something for something in the future) but it cannot be 'past' (something that has already occurred before the contract came into existence \\- noting that that exact moment might be somewhat nebulous).\n3. need not be adequate. If I agree to sell you my home for $1 this is clearly not adequate (in most circumstances) but the $1 is good consideration.\n4. must be sufficient. This is not the same as adequate. Insufficient consideration falls under the following headings \n\n\t* performance of a duty imposed by law\n\t* performance of a duty already imposed by another contract\n\t* moral obligations\n\t* uncertain or indefinite promises.\n5. Possible to perform \\- both legally and practically.\n\nWhat is promised does not need to have intrinsic value and can be a promise to do something or to refrain from doing something.\n\nCondition\n---------\n\n\"Condition\" has several meanings in contract law.\n\n**Condition of a Contract**\n\nA condition in a contract is an essential term the breach of which entitles the innocent party to either:\n\n1. affirm the contract and sue for damages, or\n2. treat itself as no longer under an obligation to perform the contract \\- but rights which had accrued up until that time continue.\n\nA term that is not a condition is a warranty. Breach of a warranty allows suing for damages but does not allow the innocent party to escape their obligations.\n\nWhether a term is a condition or a warranty depends on how essential it is \\- if it was so essential that the innocent party would not have entered the contract without it, it's a condition. The egregiousness of the breach can affect this as well \\- a term requiring payment on the 1st of each month is likely to be a warranty if payments are consistently made on the 3rd but a condition if they are constantly 2 months late.\n\n**Condition Precedent**\n\nA condition precedent is one which must be satisfied before a contract becomes binding.\n\n1. A condition precedent to the formation or existence of a contract. There are no enforcable rights on either party until the condition is fulfilled. Usually, this condition depends on a third\\-party. For example, an offer to buy real estate \"subject to finance\" is not a contract if the finance is not forthcoming.\n2. A condition which is precedent (a pre\\-requisite) to the obligation of a party to perform its part of the contract. For example, a requirement that delivery must be before 9\\.00 am on Wednesday or there is no binding contract. This can alternatively be thought of as the parties providing within the contract a mechanism for its discharge.\n\n**Condition Subsequent**\n\nIs a condition terminating the contract (either automatically or on the election of one of the parties) when it occurs. For example, a contract for the supply of iron ore while the price is above $X/ton \\- if the price drops lower the contract ends.\n\n**Other uses**\n\nOutside of contract law, the word \"condition\" is used a lot; most usually in its common English construction of \"If \\[condition] then \\[consequence]\". For example, \"if I put the basketball through the hoop, my team gets 2 (or 3 or 1\\) points\" \\- that's a condition of getting the points but it's not a contractual obligation.\n\nBob and Alice\n-------------\n\n**Bob washing his hands**\n\n1. It moves from Bob \\- that is, Bob has to do something. It doesn't move to Alice (apart from her not having to sensorily experience Bob's greasy fat\\-smeared hands anymore).\n2. It is executory \\- Bob may have washed his hands in the past (we can hope) but this particular contract requires him to wash them in the future.\n3. It doesn't have to be adequate although in the context of this contract it probably is anyway.\n4. It is sufficient \\- Bob is under no legal or moral obligation to wash his hands.\n5. It's possible to perform \\- it is neither illegal nor physically impossible for Bob to wash his hands.\n\n**Alice lending the pen**\n\n1. It moves from Alice and it this case, to Bob.\n2. It is executory \\- Alice will lend the pen in the future.\n3. It doesn't have to be adequate although in the context of this contract it probably is anyway.\n4. It is sufficient \\- Alice is under no legal or moral obligation to lend Bob her pen.\n5. It's possible to perform \\- it is neither illegal nor physically impossible for Alice to lend the pen.\n\nBob washing his hands is *also* a condition of the contract \\- if Bob does not wash his hands, Alice can either affirm the contract and sue for (admittedly small) damages or terminate the contract and keep whatever benefits she has accrued (none).\n\nAnd, it's a condition subsequent, until Bob washes his hands, Alice has no obligations under the contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario with Alice and Bob on the plane, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal aspects of their interaction?\n\nA) The agreement between Alice and Bob lacks consideration and therefore cannot be considered a valid contract under common law.\n\nB) Bob washing his hands serves as both valid consideration and a condition precedent to the formation of the contract.\n\nC) Alice lending her pen is insufficient consideration because she is under a moral obligation to help her fellow passenger.\n\nD) Bob washing his hands serves as valid consideration and a condition subsequent, while Alice has no obligations under the contract until Bob fulfills this condition.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the agreement does have valid consideration on both sides.

Falwell*, 485 U.S. 46 (1988\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/485/46). At the time, Campari Liqueur was running an ad campaign in which people talked about their first time drinking Campari, but in a context setting up extended double\\-entendres about losing their virginity. Playing off that format, Hustler ran a [fake interview with Jerry Falwell](https://frontpageconfidential.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Falwell-Ad-e1511466570818.jpg) about his \"first time,\" which can really only be understood if reprinted in full:\n\n> **Falwell:** My first time was in an outhouse outside Lynchburg, Virginia.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Wasn\u2019t it a little cramped?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Not after I kicked the goat out.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** I see. You must tell me all about it.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** I never really expected to make it with Mom, but then after she showed all the other guys in town such a good time, I figured, \"What the hell!\"\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** But your Mom? Isn\u2019t that a little odd?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** I don\u2019t think so. Looks don\u2019t mean that much to me in a woman.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Go on.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Well, we were drunk off our God\\-fearing asses on Campari, ginger ale and soda\u2014that\u2019s called a Fire and Brimstone\u2014at the time. And Mom looked better than a Baptist whore with a $100 donation.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Campari in the crapper with Mom. How interesting. Well, how was it?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** The Campari was great but Mom passed out before I could come.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** Did you ever try it again?\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Sure. Lots of times. But not in the outhouse. Between Mom and the shit, the flies were too much to bear.\n> \n> \n> **Interviewer:** We meant the Campari.\n> \n> \n> **Falwell:** Oh, yeah, I always get sloshed before I go to the pulpit. You don\u2019t think I could lay down all that bullshit sober do you?\n> \n> \n> **Campari, like all liquor, was made to mix you up. It's a light, 48\\-proof, refreshing spirit, just mild enough to make you drink too much before you know you're schnockered. For your first time, mix it with orange juice. Or maybe some white wine. Then you won't remember anything the next morning. Campari. The mixable that smarts.**\n\nPredictably, Falwell sued, claiming defamation and extreme emotional distress. A jury awarded Falwell $150,000, and Hustler appealed. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that Falwell could not recover for defamation because the ad \"was not reasonably believable,\" and that he could not recover for emotional distress because the First Amendment does permit such claims when \"the conduct in question is the publication of a caricature such as the ad parody involved here\":\n\n> Despite their sometimes caustic nature, from the early cartoon portraying George Washington as an ass down to the present day, graphic depictions and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and political debate. ... From the viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse would have been considerably poorer without them. ... There is no doubt that the caricature of respondent and his mother published in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the political cartoons described above, and a rather poor relation at that. If it were possible by laying down a principled standard to separate the one from the other, public discourse would probably suffer little or no harm. But we doubt that there is any such standard, and we are quite sure that the pejorative description \"outrageous\" does not supply one.\n\nSince then, the principles from *Hustler* have evolved and distilled into a test that generally requires the plaintiff to prove that reasoanble readers would view the material in question as actually telling the truth about the defendant. For your hypothetical, then, the question would become whether people reading the website believed that about it.\n\nThis is a trickier question than it might sound like.

Based on the legal precedent set by Hustler Magazine v. Falwell and subsequent cases, parody is protected under the First Amendment if it is clearly labeled as such and a reasonable reader would not believe it to be stating true facts. In this scenario, the website is explicitly stated to be a parody and incorporates fictional elements from TV shows, making it unlikely that a reasonable person would believe the content to be true. Therefore, the case would likely be dismissed as the website's content is protected speech under the First Amendment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using real names in parody is allowed, and referencing TV shows for comedic effect falls under fair use.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, as established in Hustler Magazine v.

For sales tax, depending on the type of business you are and your expected taxable sales, you may be required to report your taxable sales quarterly, biannually, or annually. **Tax is due when the report is due** much like income tax, but these cannot be delayed like income tax filings.\n\nIf you fail to make a report, the State will estimate your taxes and send you a bill. This bill will include late fees and charges. There is no incentive for business owners to delay these filings and payments. In fact, not filing and not paying **may result in your sales and use tax certificate being revoked**, effectively putting you out of business.\n\nA business is also not required to set aside any certain amount from a single transaction and pay that to the State. They don't have to take $5 of your $100 transaction and put it in a \"sales tax\" envelope to send to the State. At the end of the period they have to calculate, $X in taxable sales \\* Y% tax rate \\= Total Tax bill, and pay that amount. They could pay it all from the last sale, or set aside a separate account, or a sub\\-account, etc.\n\nSo businesses don't have to pay immediately, they pay on a set schedule. The funds that they collect will most likely be deposited into a general account and the taxes paid out of that account at a later date. Yes, this may include revenue from the following month, *but who cares*? The point is that the tax is paid on time and in the amount required.\n\nBut to the question at hand... No, you cannot file a form or inform the business that you will pay tax directly. The business **is required by law** to collect those taxes at the time of the sale (unless you have a reseller certificate and they make those kinds of sales). They are not allowed to say \"sure, take the X% off the price and pay the state, we trust you\". They have to report taxable sales and pay the tax on those sales.

It can make anything legal and it can make anything illegal. It generally addresses fairly high\\-leval legal principles, but there's no reason that it couldn't be amended to include a 9,000\\-page law specifically addressing every conceivable aspect of the regulation of nuclear energy.\n\nAs it stands now and as it always has, the Constitution permits the federal government to write laws only with respect to [certain topics](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#section8). The states, meanwhile, retain authority to write laws on virtually any other topic.\n\nThere are a variety of legal and historical reasons why prohibition took the form of a constitutional amendment while drug laws are handled legislatively, but one important consideration is the scope of Congress's power to regulate \"interstate commerce.\"\n\nAt the time of prohibition, it was not clear that Congress could regulate commercial activity that took place entirely within a single state. So if you grew all the ingredients for your whiskey in Kentucky, and you distilled those ingredients in Kentucky, and then you sold your whiskey in Kentucky exclusively to residents of Kentucky, it seemed that your conduct was outside the reach of Congress, and that any attempt to regulate it would be vulnerable to a constitutional challenge. The solution, therefore, was to amend the constitution and give that authority to Congress.\n\nAbout a decade after prohibition ended, though, the Supreme Court decided that the power to regulate interstate commerce includes not just transactions that cross state lines, but also any conduct that \u201cexerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce\u201d [*Wickard v. Filburn*, 317 U.S. 111, 125 (1942\\)](https://casetext.com/case/wickard-v-filburn). This broadens the Commerce Clause authority to cover virtually any economic activity. So even if you buy marijuana seeds from your next door neighbor, plant them in your own back yard, grow them for strictly personal use in your own home, and never sell anything to anyone, the courts will hold that your conduct affects the interstate market for marijuana, and is therefore subject to federal regulation.\n\nThis standard substantially lowers the bar for Congress to act without a constitutional amendment, which is a big part of the reason there hasn't been an amendment to address narcotic use.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why Prohibition required a Constitutional Amendment, while federal drug laws did not?\n\nA) The Constitution only allows for the regulation of alcohol through amendments, while drug regulation falls under normal legislative powers.\n\nB) Prohibition affected interstate commerce more significantly than drug laws, necessitating a higher level of legal authority.\n\nC) At the time of Prohibition, Congress's power to regulate intrastate commerce was more limited, whereas later Supreme Court decisions expanded this authority for drug laws.\n\nD) Constitutional Amendments were easier to pass in the early 20th century, making it the preferred method for Prohibition, unlike modern drug laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. At the time of Prohibition, Congress's authority to regulate commerce that occurred entirely within a single state was unclear. This meant that a Constitutional Amendment was necessary to ensure federal authority over alcohol production and sales, even if they occurred solely within state borders. However, subsequent Supreme Court decisions, particularly Wickard v. Filburn in 1942, significantly expanded the interpretation of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce. This broader interpretation allowed Congress to pass federal drug laws without needing a Constitutional Amendment, as even purely intrastate activities could be considered to have a substantial effect on interstate commerce.

This could be a possibility since there is really a *lot* of such references in WOW.\n\nIt could be also covered by 'fair use' but very unlikely.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking pop\\-culture references, like literary references, are neither trademark infringement nor copyright infringement.\n\nTrademarks\n----------\n\nOften a referenced item is in fact not a trademark. Most character names, for example, are not protectable as trademarks, because they are not used to identify the product or service, nor to advertise the product or service for sale. Similarly many pop\\-culture references which are associated with various groups, events, or products are not being used to identify or promote those things, and so are not protectable as trademarks.\n\nEven when a reference is (or includes) a trademarked phrase, it is unlikely to be trademark infringement. As long as the user of the trademarked term or phrase is not using it so as to identify the product or service where it is used, is not using it to advertise or promote that product or service, is not using it in such a way as to cause confusion by reasonable people on what the source of the product or service is, and is not using it so as to falsely state or imply that the product ore service is endorsed, sponsore, or approved by the owner of the trademark, then the use is not in fringement.\n\nOne may use a trademark to identify a related product or service, to indicate compatibility, or to make comparative claims, and that is ***nominative use*** (using the mark as the name of the thing marked). Nominative use is specifically not infringement.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nNames, taglines, titles, mottos, and other short phrases are not protected by copyright at all.

The only answer point towards infringement. Would you agree?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is certainly a solid argument that it would be an infringing derivative work. \n\nBut, ultimately, it isn't a question that can be answered in the abstract. A jury would have to look at the alleged source and at the new work and compare them in light of the legal standards provided by the judge with input from counsel for both sides.\n\nIn most cases, it would be a mixed question of law and fact that could easily come out either way with any given jury on any given day, and is well within the gray area. Some works might be more transformative than others for a variety of reasons like color, size, the style of the original work, etc.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that the inquiry in a fair use defense is heavily dependent upon the purpose of the new work and the way that it is used, the nature of the work itself is only a small part of the inquiry. \n\nAn ASCII transformation in the context of an editorial cartoon might very well pass muster, while a similar ASCII transformation hung in an art gallery for sale in isolation with no real \"message\" might not.\n\nASCII transformations by students in a graphic design program in an art college might pass muster while a professional artist distributing them in mass produced fashion through a vendor selling them in Times Square to tourists might not.\n\nUltimately, while the law rarely comes out and says so in so many words, copyright infringement is about commercially appropriating the economic value associated with the original work for primarily commercial reasons, and the context informs the extent to whether that is happening or not. If it is not happening, a fair use defense is stronger, if it is happening, a fair use defense is weaker.\n\nThe law, in general especially in common law jurisdictions like the U.S. and England, is incredibly context and fact specific, and copyright law questions of derivative work and fair use are circumstances where this is particularly true.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An artist creates ASCII art versions of famous photographs and sells them as prints online.

As the documentation suggests, it's a complex issue that often falls into a \"gray area\" of copyright law. The determination of whether such works constitute fair use or copyright infringement would likely involve considering:\n\n1. The degree of transformation from the original work\n2. The purpose and character of the use (commercial vs. educational, for example)\n3. The nature of the copyrighted work\n4. The effect on the potential market for the original work\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because transformativeness alone doesn't guarantee fair use. Answer B is too absolute, as not all derivative works are automatically infringement. Answer D is incorrect because ASCII art is not exempt from copyright considerations simply for being a different medium.\n\nA jury would likely need to evaluate each case individually, considering these factors and the specific context of the use.

Assume the context is a system and method utility patent application (USPTO) and that a provisional patent application has been filed.\n\nI can imagine a list of items an attorney would need. \n\n* Is there a name for such a list? (so that it could be Googled)\n* What items would be on the list?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Many attorneys would have an \"intake form\" that they would like you to complete in advance, and every lawyer will want your name and contact information at a first meeting. But, other attorneys would prefer to meet with you first, without getting details about the work to be done, as many patent applicants are very reluctant to put information in writing that is shared with others and many patent applicants don't know what is relevant. \n\nThere is no special terminology for the things that you should prepare for prior to meeting with an attorney. And, anyone who completed a provisional patent application is not so half\\-baked in their idea that it is premature to meet with a patent lawyer. Having done a provisional patent application is more than enough due diligence and preparation for such a meeting. \n\nThe marginal cases where preparation by clients is often lacking are those cases where the concept of the invention isn't fully fleshed out yet and the inventor is trying to work with a patent lawyer to figure out what part of \"idea space\" isn't already protected by patents.\n\nThere are basically three kinds of information that are relevant:\n\n1. When was the invention invented, made public, or shared with anyone? Is there anyone else who could be considered a co\\-inventor? For example, if you have an employment agreement discussing intellectual property, you should bring it.\n2. You would need your full provisional patent application, which will explain most of the necessary information but may need to be clarified for a final application. If visual aids are helpful to explaining your invention or you have prototypes small enough to bring with you, you should bring them, even if they are beyond the scope of the provisional patent application's contents.\n3. You ideally should do some due diligence regarding \"prior art\" to provide some assurance that the idea you propose hasn't already been patented or discovered, but not every patent applicant has the ability to do such a prior art search. At a minimum, you should be able to say in good faith that you've never seen a similar invention and explain why you think personally that your invention is novel. Generally, you should not order a professional patent search before you have discussed it with your patent attorney. But, if you are able to do so and have reviewed existing patents, reviewed literature you are able to access, and have done some Google searches for similar ideas, that would be more than reasonable preparation. But, don't delay meeting with a patent lawyer because you haven't done those things. A patent lawyer needs lead time to prepare the application by the deadline for doing so (ideally, several months, and at a minimum, several weeks to a couple of months).\n\nIn addition, you should be prepared to discuss why your invention is not obvious to someone skilled in the relevant field and what utility your patent has to a user of the invention. Similarly, you should be ready to discuss the larger context of the field in which you have an invention, such as how others usually deal with the issue that your invention addresses in the status quo and what other notable new inventions there are in that field. \"Buzz words\" related to your kind of invention are also very helpful for doing searches of prior art.\n\nFinally, you should be prepared to demonstrate that you have the capacity to pay for the patent lawyer's work. Patent lawyers almost never do pro bono (i.e. charitable) patent work for individual inventors (sometimes they might, for example, for a university clinic aimed at inventing things for use in the Third World), and are loathe to do work on a contingent or on credit basis, although sometimes they would be willing to work on credit if you could provide security for the debt beyond the patent itself (e.g. putting the equity in your home up as collateral).\n\nA patent lawyer would almost always charge more than $10,000 to do the work beyond an initial consultation (which wouldn't be free but might cost $100\\-$1000\\), and often a patent could cost $100,000 for each patent for legal work, if it was at all complex. \n\nPatent lawyer have among the highest hourly rates of all kinds of attorneys. So, the more clearly thought out you are, the better organized your paperwork is, and the more efficiently you can communicate your invention, the less you will pay for meeting with the patent lawyer while \"the meter is running.\"\n\nEven in the unlikely case that the patent lawyer will do the work on credit, the patent lawyer will at a minimum insist that you provide the filing fees up front. If you are truly broke, you need a business partner to finance the patenting process for you. You can look at the relevant fee schedules at the patent and trademark office website. The patent lawyer would also expect any out of pocket costs for things like a professional prior art search, having quality drawings prepared, courier fees, and mailing costs to be paid in advance, even if doing some of the legal work on credit.

One is that it violates some specific (statutory) law, the other is that it violates some common\\-law principle especially pertaining to contracts. We can quickly dispose of the possibility that you have violated a statutory law: there is nowhere in the US where you are compelled by law to do anything about foreign language classes (take, avoid, pass, whatever). \n\nYour university has the right to establish and enforce whatever requirements it deems proper for awarding degrees and credits, and has the legal power to act broadly in providing an education. Let's say that they have stated a requirement that everybody must take 2 quarters of some foreign language, then if you don't do that, they are entitled to withhold the degree from you. Whereas, if you had satisfied all of the requirements for the degree, then they could not arbitrarily withhold the degree \\-\\- it is now a thing that you have a property right to.\n\nJust as the university has the right to impose requirements (with appropriate advance notice), they also have the right to suspend requirements, generally or according to circumstances (as long as it is not arbitrary). A typical actual example is \"that class hasn't been taught for 3 years\". In this case, the requirement was not suspended, but an agent of the university acting within the scope of their appointment judged that the requirement had already been satisfied in your case. The university administration might not actually approve of the professor's choice and might change their rules or sanction the professor (at *my* university this was common practice, albeit never officially sanctioned), but it is the sort of thing that is within the scope of the professor's job (to judge that you have satisfied the \"bottom\\-line\" requirements of the course).

Could the vandal either be prosecuted or sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are some problems with this kind of vandalism, one of them clearly that the internet is international and vandalism can be performed from everywhere on servers everywhere in the world. And so it may be (both technically and legally) difficult to get hold of the vandal. Therefore, most wikis primarily focus on blocking offending accounts or their IPs and hope that this helps at least for a while. Only if it doesn't and the vandalism continues for extended time periods, legal measures are considered.\n\nLegally speaking though, vandalism is prohibited by many jurisdictions and of course by the terms of use of the wiki operators.\n\nFor instance, the [Swiss criminal code](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/54/757_781_799/en) Art 147 explicitly puts \"abusing of data processing equipment\" under penalty and hence gives website operators a legal backup for setting up rules for the use of their services.\n\n> Computer fraud\n> Art. 147\n\n> 1 Any person who with a view to his own or another's unlawful gain, by the incorrect, incomplete or unauthorised use of data, or in a similar way, influences the electronic or similar processing or transmission of data and as a result causes the transfer of financial assets, thus occasioning loss to another, or immediately thereafter conceals such a transfer shall be liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding five years or to a monetary penalty.\n\n> 2 If the offender acts for commercial gain, he shall be liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding ten years or to a monetary penalty of not less than 90 daily penalty units.\n\nTechnically, the law even requires prosecution *ex officio*, even though without a hint from the operator, the police won't start an investigation. I'm sure the US has a similar law. The problem is, as with all internet crimes, it's practical application, particularly because often website operator and offender are not living in the same country.\n\n**Edit**\nAfter reading the exact text again (it was unavailable yesterday) Art 147 is mostly about fraud performed by computers (classical \"hacking\") but it shouldn't be difficult to argue that fighting and reverting vandalism requires significant (technical and personal) effort and hence the operator looses money. Additionally, there's Art 144bis which matches even better for the scenario here:\n\n> Damage to data\n> Art. 144bis\n\n> 1. Any person who without authority alters, deletes or renders unusable data that is stored or transmitted electronically or in some other similar way shall be liable on complaint to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty.\n\n> If the offender has caused major damage, a custodial sentence of from one to five years may be imposed.

It states that anyone who \"without authority alters, deletes or renders unusable data that is stored or transmitted electronically\" can be liable to a custodial sentence of up to three years or a monetary penalty. This applies even if the vandal doesn't use hacked accounts and doesn't profit from the action. The law allows for prosecution ex officio (by the state) in cases of major damage.

I know it sounds harsh, but you said New England; that's where I live and I know the trespass laws are *not* in your favor ... especially when it comes to kids. Take Connecticut as an example: This is their law on trespass and kids (not just attractive nuisance!):\n\n> A possessor of land owes each person who enters his land a certain\n> duty of care based on the person's status. The legal significance is\n> that a possessor of land has the duty to an invitee to inspect the\n> premises for hidden defects and to repair or erect safeguards, if\n> necessary, to make the premises reasonably safe.

But he is\n> liable if he knows of a condition, realizes it involves unreasonable\n> risk, has reason to believe the licensee will not discover it, and he\n> permits the licensee to enter or remain without warning or making the\n> condition reasonably safe.\n\nGenerally, an owner owes trespassers no duty of care because he has no reason to expect them to be on his property. Therefore, he does not have to warn or protect them from potentially harmful conditions on the property.\nHowever, *an exception applies if a property owner knows, or has reason to anticipate, that children will trespass on his land. In this case, a special duty arises and the owner must take steps to **protect children** from any of the property's dangerous conditions.* The post you just made indicates even you think that the rock walls, or other \"normal garden features\" could be dangerous; and they can be!\n\nThe law requires that ***you*** take reasonable steps to eliminate the condition or by otherwise keeping children away from it.\n\n### DUTY OWED TO TRESPASSER\n\nIn Connecticut, the following rules apply to a possessor of land with respect to a trespasser.\n\n1. He may not intentionally harm the trespasser or lay a trap for him.\n2. The trespasser is entitled to due care after his presence is actually known.\n3. There is no duty owed regarding the condition of the premises.\n4. The possessor of land has no duty to trespassers if he is engaged in a dangerous activity until the person's presence is know.\n5. The possessor of land has no duty to warn trespassers of dangerous hidden conditions (Conn. Law of Torts, \u00a7 47\\).\n\n### Duty Owed to Trespassing Children\n\nConnecticut's appellate courts have adopted the Restatement (Second) of Torts rule regarding the duty of a property owner to trespassing children (Duggan v. Esposito, 178 Conn. 156 (1979\\), Neal v. Shiels, Inc., 166 Conn. 3 (1974\\), Greene v. DiFazio, 148 Conn. 419 (1961\\), Wolfe v. Rehbein, 123 Conn. 110 (1937\\), Yeske v. Avon Old Farms School, Inc., 1 Conn. App. 195 (1984\\)).\n\n> Under this rule, if an owner knows or has reason to know that children\n> will be on his property, he has the duty to protect them from injury\n> by either fixing the harmful condition or ensuring that the children\n> will not have access to that part of the property.\n> \n> \n> The rule states that a possessor of land is liable for harm to\n> trespassing children caused by an artificial condition on the land if\n> (1\\) the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely\n> to trespass in that place, (2\\) the condition is one the possessor\n> knows or has reason to know and should realize will involve an\n> unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to children, (3\\) the\n> children because of their youth do not discover the condition or\n> realize the risk, (4\\) the utility of maintaining the condition and the\n> burden of eliminating the danger are slight compared with the risk to\n> children involved, and (5\\) the possessor fails to exercise reasonable\n> care to eliminate the danger or otherwise protect children\n> (Restatement (Second), 2 Torts 339\\).\n\nPut in the letter that you are disclaiming any liability for injury to them that may occur on your property, and make them aware of all the ways they could be injured \u2013 so they've been informed. You don't have a duty to remove rock walls because unsupervised kids jump off them. They are not invitees, they are trespassers. So make it known you do not want them on the land and for any further breach you will call the police. Because otherwise you could be responsible.\n\nUsing CT again as an example, you could include the legal statute about trespass in your notice:\n\n### Trespass Crimes and Infractions\n\n> A person commits first degree criminal trespass when (1\\) he enters or\n> remains in a building or any other premises after the owner or an\n> authorized person personally communicates an order to leave or not\n> enter and (2\\) he knows that he is not licensed or privileged to be\n> there.

The owner wants to protect themselves from potential lawsuits if a child gets injured. Which of the following actions would be the most effective legal strategy to address this situation?\n\nA) Verbally warn the children about potential dangers on the property\nB) Install \"No Trespassing\" signs around the property\nC) Send a certified cease and desist letter to the parents, citing relevant trespass laws\nD) Remove all potentially dangerous features from the property\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While verbally warning the children is a good start, it may not provide sufficient legal protection for the property owner. There's no documentation of the warning, and it doesn't address the parents directly.\n\nB) Installing \"No Trespassing\" signs can help, but it may not be enough to fully protect the owner from liability, especially in cases involving children who may not understand or heed such warnings.\n\nC) This is the most effective legal strategy. Sending a certified cease and desist letter to the parents provides documented evidence that the property owner has explicitly warned about trespassing. Including relevant trespass laws in the letter emphasizes the seriousness of the situation and informs the parents of potential legal consequences. This approach also addresses the parents directly, who are responsible for their children's actions.\n\nD) Removing all potentially dangerous features from the property is an extreme and impractical solution. It's not reasonable to expect a property owner to remove standard landscaping features like retaining walls or granite stones. Additionally, this doesn't address the core issue of trespassing.\n\nThe correct answer (C) provides the strongest legal protection by creating a paper trail, directly addressing the parents, and citing relevant laws."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9424/company-assets-and-minority-share-holders", "docs_id": 9424, "title": "Company assets and minority share holders", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The majority share holder of this company allowed assets (land) to be auctioned off for non payment of municipal taxes through a deliberate scheme to escape paying profits to the minority share holders.

The company was formed in 1988 in Quebec.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you describe is forbidden by corporate law in every jurisdiction with which I'm familiar. I don't know the law in Quebec, but in principle:\n\n1. An entity in control of a corporation can't use that control to unjustly enrich himself at the expense of other shareholders. (If he does so through deceit then he is committing the common law tort of fraud, and quite likely a criminal offense.)\n2. A trustee or fiduciary that uses his control of assets to enrich himself at the expense of those to whom he owes a duty (e.g., minority shareholders) is guilty of various statutory offenses, among which may be \"Breach of Fiduciary Duty\" and \"Fraudulent transfer.\"\n3. Sales of corporate assets in general must be done through an \"arms\\-length\" mechanism. If they are being auctioned off, and the auction isn't open, so that an insider is able to purchase them below \"fair market value,\" then, once again, a fraud has been committed. The grading and remedies vary by jurisdiction.\n\nOf course, *whether it's worth pursuing a remedy through legal action* depends (as always) on:\n\n* the amount at stake,\n* the cost of pursuing the remedy,\n* statutory allowances for punitive damages,\n* the likelihood and cost of collecting on any judgement won.\n\nOnly a lawyer familiar with the jurisdiction, the complaint, and the corporation's governing documents could help you answer that question.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a Quebec corporation, the majority shareholder orchestrated a scheme to auction off company land for non-payment of taxes, only to have a friend purchase it and later sell it back to him personally. This action left minority shareholders with worthless shares. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The majority shareholder's actions are legal as long as the auction was publicly announced.\nB) Minority shareholders have no recourse as they own less than 50% of the company.\nC) This scenario likely constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty and possibly fraud under Quebec corporate law.\nD) The majority shareholder's actions are legal if the company's bylaws allow for asset sales without minority shareholder approval.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The scenario described likely constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty and possibly fraud under Quebec corporate law. The majority shareholder's actions appear to violate several principles of corporate governance:\n\n1. Using control of a corporation to unjustly enrich oneself at the expense of other shareholders.\n2. Breaching fiduciary duty by using control of assets to enrich oneself at the expense of minority shareholders.\n3. Conducting a sale of corporate assets that was not at \"arms-length\" and potentially below fair market value.\n\nThese actions are generally forbidden in most jurisdictions, including Quebec. The use of deception in this scheme could also constitute fraud. While the specific laws in Quebec would need to be consulted, the principles of protecting minority shareholders and maintaining fiduciary responsibility are fundamental to corporate law in most developed legal systems.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect as they misrepresent the legal obligations of majority shareholders and the rights of minority shareholders in corporate governance."}}
