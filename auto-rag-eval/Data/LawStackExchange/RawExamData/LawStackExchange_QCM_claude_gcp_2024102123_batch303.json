The charter of a corporation is to make money for shareholders, I don't think most charters require the company to follow the law of a specific federal government.\n\nAnd, they are not aiding or abetting anything. They are just exercising shareholder rights.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n==\n\nAny conduct that demands someone does something unlawfully is unlawful. [Taxes are laws and regulations.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/chapter-I) [Not paying the taxes is unlawful](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/tax_evasion), especially under [26 USC 7201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7201). So the shareholders are not only demanding the company to break laws, they **aid and abett** such behavior, making them **also** liable together with the company as there is [18 USC 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2):\n\n> (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\n> \n> \n> (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly performed by him or another would be an offense against the United States, is punishable as a principal.\n\nIt could **also** be inciting to violate laws. It is **not** a shareholder's right to ask for someone to break the law.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A group of shareholders in a publicly traded company are proposing a resolution to compel the company to engage in aggressive tax avoidance strategies that likely cross the line into illegal tax evasion. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The shareholders are within their rights to propose such a resolution, as maximizing profits for shareholders is the primary duty of a corporation.\n\nB) The company's board of directors is obligated to implement the shareholders' proposal if it receives a majority vote, regardless of its legality.\n\nC) The shareholders proposing this resolution could potentially be held criminally liable for aiding and abetting tax evasion.\n\nD) As long as the shareholders don't directly participate in the tax evasion activities, they cannot be held legally responsible for merely suggesting the strategy.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, shareholders who attempt to compel a company to engage in illegal activities, such as tax evasion, can be held liable for aiding and abetting such behavior. This is based on 18 USC 2, which states that whoever aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of an offense against the United States is punishable as a principal. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while maximizing profits is important, it does not justify breaking the law. Answer B is wrong because the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to act lawfully and in the best interests of the company, which includes complying with tax laws. Answer D is incorrect because merely suggesting or proposing illegal activities can still be considered as aiding and abetting or inciting to violate laws, even if the shareholders don't directly participate in the illegal acts."

I am interested as you can't represent someone in court without being a fully qualified solicitor/barrister (as far as I know), yet for \"power of attorney\" you can represent someone in their place but I don't know the limits to this. Is it different for someone in the process of training for a law qualification perhaps?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no such thing as 'half a lawyer'; either you have the relevant qualification (such as being a trained barrister/solicitor\\-advocate to represent somebody in court) or you are not, in which case you have the same rights as any member of the public. [Paralegals](http://www.legalchoices.org.uk/types-of-lawyers/other-lawyers/paralegals) are in the second category: they can read documents and suggest a course of action (well, so can anyone on this website), but cannot act as your legal representative, nor charge for legal advice.\n\n'Attorney' in *Power of Attorney* comes from the same root as 'legal attorney', but does not have the same meaning. If you hold Power of Attorney for your ailing mother, you can and in some cases must act on her behalf; for example, if the plumber fixes her washing machine, it is you who pays him.

According to the information provided, individuals without full legal qualifications have the same rights as any member of the public when it comes to legal representation. The documentation clearly states that \"There is no such thing as 'half a lawyer'; either you have the relevant qualification... or you are not, in which case you have the same rights as any member of the public.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because paralegals, even those in training, cannot represent someone in court.

The document states that whether someone with Power of Attorney can represent the person in court is \"too complex and fact-dependent to give an opinion on.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect because the information provided does not suggest that individuals in the process of obtaining legal qualifications have any additional legal powers compared to the general public.

What are the points of view on this currently dominant among US judges, prosecutors and attorneys?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Like most common law jurisdictions there are 3 sources of US law: legislative, judicial and administrative (except Louisiana, it has a Civil Law system).\n\nI *think* you are focusing on legislative or statute law but I will briefly cover the others first.\n\nJudicial Law\n------------\n\nJudicial or judge made law occurs when a court makes a judgement on a case about what the law means. In a common law jurisdiction such decisions are [binding](http://definitions.uslegal.com/b/binding-precedent/) on lower courts in the same jurisdictional hierarchy and [persuasive](http://definitions.uslegal.com/p/persuasive-precedent/) on the same level and higher courts and foreign courts. In the US foreign courts normally means courts in other US states that lack a binding precedent on the matter but courts can look to decisions in other common law countries like Canada, Australia, the UK etc.\n\nBecause courts interpret the \"common law\" their judgments usually reflect (in some way) community expectations. However, judicial systems are, by their nature, slow to change and while they track community expectations they do so with a time lag, say 20\\-30 years: the lag in time between when the judges making decisions now had their views on society fixed during their college years.\n\nJudicial law, in theory, stretches back to Anglo\\-Norman law with decisions building on (and occasionally knocking over) what has come before. In practice, this chain has usually been severed at some point (usually more than once) by the intervention of the legislature to correct what they saw as a \"failure\" in the common law. Subsequent common law builds on that statute like barnacles on a ship's hull (but without the negative connotation ... maybe).\n\nBy your terminology, such laws are almost always descriptive.\n\nAdministrative Law\n------------------\n\nIs the law created by the administrative arm of government using the powers explicitly granted by the relevant constitution, delegated by the legislature or derived from common law powers. For example, if a statute authorizes the levying of taxes on the value of real estate, it is usually left to the administrative branch to determine how to collect and use the data needed to arrive at a given property's value.\n\nBy your terminology, such laws can go either way. Establishing the land tax system example would be prescriptive, modifying it to match changing social circumstances would be descriptive.\n\nLegislative Law\n---------------\n\nLegislative or statute law is the laws passed by the legislature by whatever name that is known. They can only make laws within the bounds permitted by their constitutions but within those limits they are free to do whatever they choose.\n\nMany of the laws they pass are simply to enable the other parts of government to get on with their jobs \\- like giving them the money to pay the army or the judges or whatever. I guess these would be descriptive \\- of course, passing a law to say you can't pay the army would be very, very prescriptive.\n\nAside from that, while legislatures *can* pass a law about anything they generally only intervene when there is some \"mischief\" in society that the current laws are not addressing or are addressing in an unjust way. This happens all the time because society does not stand still: we didn't need laws about cell phone use in cars until there were cell phones being implicated in accidents. Similarly, we didn't need laws about Pokemon Go until a week last Thursday (more or less). To that extent their laws are prescriptive.",

The passage states that legislatures generally intervene when there is some \"mischief\" in society that current laws are not addressing or are addressing in an unjust way. It provides examples such as laws about cell phone use in cars and Pokemon Go, which were created in response to new technologies and their impact on society. This indicates that legislative law typically responds to emerging societal issues or \"mischiefs\" that current laws fail to address adequately.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that legislative law always precedes societal change. Instead, it often reacts to changes that have already occurred.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while some laws may codify existing norms, the passage clearly states that legislatures can pass laws about anything within constitutional limits and often do so to address new issues.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage indicates that legislative law does indeed respond to societal changes and is not solely focused on governmental operations."

Just something plausible.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At common law, which may no longer be the law in England, your name is what you and others use to refer to yourself.\n\nSo, even if person A was Christened \"John Jacob Smith\" at birth, while person B was Christened \"James Bond\" at birth, if person A lived his life as described using the name \"James Bond\", then \"James Bond\" would legally be one of Person A's names at common law.\n\nBut, even under that version of the law, doing something strictly as a consequence of impersonating someone else would usually be unlawful.\n\n> He lives his life, marries his girlfriend, lives with her, has sexual\n>  relations with her. But she doesn't know she's with Person A *instead\n>  of the man she originally met, Person B.*\n\nThere is a concept of impersonating a spouse for sex that can constitute rape but I don't think that it applies in this case, because the relationship development for the most part with person A. Particularly importantly, the girlfriend is having sex with the person she married, even if she previously dated someone whom she has confused with her current spouse. Now, if person B returned and tried to have sex with the girlfriend by pretending to be person B's imposter, that might very well be rape.\n\nThis said, it is very hard to imagine the girlfriend really couldn't tell the difference between person A and person B, because generally speaking, intimate friends of even identical twins can tell them apart. So, this premise is wildly improbable.\n\n> Person A is also practicing law in place of Person B. *The licence is\n>  in Person A's name, but Person B took the bar exam.*\n\nIt sounds like Person A is practicing law without a license. This is definitely unlawful, although I don't know if it is actually a crime under English law as opposed, for example, to merely constituting a civil offense or contempt of court, or some form of civil fraud.",

The marriage itself may be valid under common law naming principles, but practicing law without a proper license is indeed unlawful.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Person B's consent doesn't negate all potential legal issues, especially regarding the unauthorized practice of law.\n\nOption D is the most accurate.

For a simple cash transfer, especially of a relatively small amount like $45,000, it's generally unnecessary and not cost-effective. The $3,000 fee for the roll-over represents a significant portion of the initial investment, and there are no capital gains to defer on cash. In this case, the entrepreneur should consider simpler and less expensive methods of capitalizing their new corporation, such as a direct cash contribution or a shareholder loan. It's always advisable to consult with a qualified accountant or tax lawyer for specific situations, but for most small business incorporations involving only cash, a section 85 roll-over would be an unnecessary complication and expense."

It will, therefore, probably have a copyright of its own.\n\nUnless it's a copy of an intermediate arrangement that is itself under copyright but let's not go there.\n\nSo, probably, it has copyright, and for you to use it, you have to do so with permission \\- the licence is that permission.\n\nThe [CC\\-BY\\-4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) licence\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis licence allows you to share and adapt the work, providing you give attribution.\n\n> Am I allowed to perform this arrangement in public?\n\nYes, that's an adaptation.\n\n> Would I be required to give attribution to the person who arranged the sheet music before performing the arrangement?\n\nYou must give attribution. Before, at the same time immediately after are all good:\n\n> You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.\n\nYou could do this by making an announcement, including the information in a programme, on a website about the performance, or any other reasonable way of getting the message out there.\n\n> Moreover, am I allowed to record the music in the arrangement and post it online (say on YouTube)?\n\nYes, that is an adaptation (film) of the adaptation (musical performance) of the original (sheet music).\n\n> What kind of attribution would I be required to give in this case?\n\nSee above.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A musician wants to perform and record a modern arrangement of a Bach composition from 1726, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 license. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the use and attribution of this arrangement?\n\nA) The musician can perform the arrangement in public without any attribution, as the original Bach composition is in the public domain.\n\nB) The musician must provide attribution before the performance, but does not need to give attribution when posting a recording online.\n\nC) The musician can perform the arrangement and post a recording online, but must provide attribution in both cases in any reasonable manner, such as an announcement, program notes, or video description.\n\nD) The musician cannot perform or record the arrangement without explicit permission from Bach's estate, regardless of the Creative Commons license.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The modern arrangement of Bach's composition is likely protected by copyright, even though the original work is in the public domain. The Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 license allows for both public performance (adaptation) and recording (further adaptation), but requires attribution in both cases. This attribution can be given in any reasonable manner, such as an announcement before the performance, in program notes, or in the description of an online video. The license specifically states that appropriate credit must be given, a link to the license provided, and any changes indicated. Therefore, option C is the correct and most comprehensive answer, addressing both the performance and recording scenarios while accurately describing the attribution requirements."

What would be the most likely legal outcome of this attempt?\n\nA) The patent would be granted, making Linux Wine illegal and forcing its removal from all distributions.\n\nB) The patent would be denied due to lack of novelty, but Microsoft could still pursue copyright claims against Wine.\n\nC) The patent would be granted, but only for future modifications to the Win32 API, not affecting existing implementations like Wine.\n\nD) The patent would be denied due to lack of novelty, and existing implementations like Wine would remain unaffected.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because patent law requires novelty - an invention must be new and non-obvious to be patentable. The Win32 API has been public knowledge for many years, making it part of the prior art. As such, attempting to patent it now would fail due to lack of novelty. Existing implementations like Wine, which are based on this long-standing public knowledge, would remain unaffected by such an attempt. Options A and C are incorrect because they assume the patent would be granted, which is highly unlikely given the lack of novelty. Option B is incorrect because while copyright could potentially be an issue, it's separate from patent law and not relevant to the specific scenario described in the question."

On January 10th, he took a one-week freelance job paid via 1099. John applied for unemployment benefits on January 29th. The unemployment agency determined his eligibility date as January 29th. Which of the following statements is correct regarding John's obligation to report his freelance income when filing for unemployment?\n\nA) John must report the freelance income because it was earned during his severance period.\nB) John does not need to report the freelance income because it was earned before his unemployment eligibility date.\nC) John must report the freelance income because all 1099 income must be reported regardless of when it was earned.\nD) John should report the freelance income only if it exceeds a certain threshold set by the unemployment agency.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, if the 1099 income was earned before the date the unemployment agency determined John was eligible to claim unemployment (in this case, January 29th), then it does not have to be reported to the unemployment agency. Since John's freelance work was completed on January 17th, which is before his eligibility date of January 29th, he is not obligated to report this income when filing for unemployment benefits. Options A and C are incorrect because they wrongly assume all income during severance or all 1099 income must be reported.

The term does not include distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, or tobacco, as those terms are defined or used in subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986\\.\n\nIn particular this definition excludes \"distilled spirits\" for which [subtitle E](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/5002) provides the following definition:\n\n> (8\\)\n> The terms \u201cdistilled spirits\u201d, \u201calcoholic spirits\u201d, and \u201cspirits\u201d mean that substance known as ethyl alcohol, ethanol, or spirits of wine in any form (including all dilutions and mixtures thereof from whatever source or by whatever process produced).\n\nThe definition of \"distilled spirits\" is expansive and includes all mixtures from any source or process.\n\nAdditionally, LSD is listed in schedule I of the [Controlled Substances Act](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/812.htm).\n\n---\n\nThen,\n\n1.

The mixture is indeed a \"distilled spirit\" according to the Internal Revenue Code definition, which includes \"all dilutions and mixtures thereof from whatever source or by whatever process produced.\" However, this tax classification does not exempt it from also being a controlled substance. The Controlled Substances Act specifically includes \"any material, compound, mixture, or preparation\" containing any quantity of LSD. The presence of alcohol doesn't negate the controlled substance status of LSD. Therefore, the mixture is both a distilled spirit for tax purposes and a controlled substance under federal drug laws."

Are their owners being and their assets in their home country safe?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That a company (C) has a website that can be accessed from a given county does not mean that the company operates in that country. If C is located in country A, markets and advertises to country A, offers products designed to appeal in country A, has its site only in the primary language of country A, uses servers located in country A, and has all its assets and physical offices in country A, it is not operating in country X, even if a few people from X do business with C over its web site.\n\nCountry X may have laws which claim to apply to C or its web site. It will find it hard to enforce those laws, particularly if owners and officers of X do not travel to X. It will find it hard to extradite anyone for violations of the laws of X unless those actions are also crimes under the laws of A.\n\nIf X is a major, powerful country such as the US, the UK, or the EU it may be able to get A to enforce its court orders, or to use its influence over the banking system to impose penalties on C. If X is North Korea, or even Brazil, it is probably out of luck.\n\nThus the management of C needs worry primarily about the laws of A, and to a lesser extent the laws of major countries that make some effort to enforce their laws outside their own borders, such as the GDPR, or certain US laws. It probably has little reason to worry about the laws of other countries. If A is itself a major country that can easily resist any pressue from X, C has even less reason to worry.\n\nIf C does significant business in countries D and E, and particularly if it opens physical offices in D or keeps assets in E, it will have much more reason to worry about the laws of D and E. If it does advertising in the D \\& E markets, this also gives C more reason to be concerned with their laws.\n\nThere is always some risk of X finding a way to enforce its laws, but the risk is small.",

However, the licensee's breach of contract (here, the unauthorized distribution of credentials) does not void the company's rights on its product with respect to everyone else. At the very least, the company would have a viable claim of *unjust enrichment* wherever a non\\-party to that initial contract obtains the product without making the corresponding payment *to the company*.\n\nFurthermore, proving that the non\\-party knew or should have known the terms of service would establish the non\\-party's [mens rea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea), and/or his breach of \\[an independent] contract. This independent contract is formed when the new user installed and/or accessed the product using the rogue credentials.

        "answer": "Question: As the executor of an estate for a deceased sole proprietor of a bar/restaurant in Wisconsin, what is the correct procedure to legally sell the establishment's alcohol inventory to generate cash for the estate?\n\nA) Immediately sell the alcohol inventory to any interested buyer without any paperwork, as the executor has full authority over the estate's assets.\n\nB) Transfer the liquor license to yourself using Form AT-108, then complete Form AT-900 and a stock transfer form before selling the inventory to another licensed establishment.\n\nC) Destroy all alcohol inventory as it cannot be legally sold once the original license holder is deceased.\n\nD) Obtain a temporary liquor license in your name and conduct a public auction to sell the alcohol to the highest bidders.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct procedure involves multiple steps as outlined in the Wisconsin regulations. First, the executor must transfer the liquor license to themselves as the personal representative using Form AT-108. This transfer is allowed at no charge during the license year upon the death of the licensee. Then, Form AT-900 should be completed to update the license information. Finally, a stock transfer form (inventory list) must be completed before selling the entire sealed liquor stock to another licensed retailer. This process ensures legal compliance and allows the executor to liquidate the alcohol inventory to generate cash for the estate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because selling alcohol requires proper licensing and documentation. Option C is unnecessarily wasteful and not required by law. Option D is incorrect as it doesn't follow the proper procedures for transferring and selling liquor inventory in this situation."

The other shows the modified contract and says there's nothing wrong.\n\nHow to determine who's right?\n\nWe have to assume that these are not super big corporations with advanced tools and lawyers.

According to the documentation, the party who signed the modified contract faces an uphill battle in court. This is because there is a legal presumption that a signature on a contract indicates that the signer has read and agreed to the terms before signing. However, this presumption can potentially be overcome if there is evidence of fraudulent concealment or active misrepresentation by the party who made the modification.

He shot them, and they died.\n\nThe prosecutor argued that by removing trucks from the premise he is \"baiting\" burglars.\n\n1. Is it illegal to remove trucks from premises?\n2. Now that the burglars are in his house, what should he have done?\n\nI still do not understand the verdict. I mean, do you lose your right to defend yourself if you make it look like your house is uninhabited? Are you obligated to signal to would\\-be burglars that you will shoot them?\n\nIn the case of Bryan Smith case, has the prosecutor established that the removal of his truck is done solely for baiting burglars?\n\nOne controversy in the case is that after he shot a burglar, he finish the job.\n\nI do not know how much of this got into a jury. However, I would have done the same if I were him. Soldiers in wars double tap because enemies they think are death (not just injured in legs), may actually still be alive and kill. There are cases of people stop beating up robbers thinking he won, only to have the robbers' friend stab him in the back.\n\nFor all Bryan Smith knows, those teenagers could be assassins sent by gangs to kill him. The boy and the girl may bring life grenade they can activate for suicide bombing. It may not be. But how does he knows?\n\nThe probability is small. May be 1%, or 2%. Still, why should a home owner risk his life for life of two worthless burglars? The safest thing to do is to just kill the burglars.\n\nWhy take unnecessary risks when your life is in danger by some people that's obviously up to no good?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If I remember the case correctly, he didn't make his home look uninhabited (that is nobody is living there) but as if the inhabitants had left (gone shopping etc.) to make it look attractive to burglars. \n\nHe then waited inside, armed with a gun, with the intent of shooting any burglars that might arrive. He shot the first burglar in the legs, and then proceeded to kill the unarmed and now defenseless burglar, who was lying injured on the ground and was in no position anymore to hurt him. He then did the same with a second burglar, shooting her in the legs, then shooting her multiple times, and when he found she was still alive, he shot her point blank in the face while she was lying on the ground. \n\nYou are asking the wrong questions. You are asking \"is it illegal to remove a truck\". It's not. What is illegal is to intentionally create a situation where you shoot people and try to claim \"self defence\". It can very well be argued that by luring burglars into your home with the intent to kill them, they are not actually illegal in that home, because you *wanted* them to be there. You can do many things that are each completely innocent but add up to a crime. \n\nActually, for everyone interested, I posted a question maybe last week or the week before whether you can be convicted for both first degree murder and second degree murder for killing a person, and it was exactly this case that inspired the question. \n\nWhat should he have done? If he hadn't lured the burglars in, I believe the case would have still been a double murder, since he killed both unarmed teenagers when they were absolutely no threat. It might not have been first degree murder since it would not have been premeditated. But he intentionally lured them in, making it premeditated (first degree) murder. \n\nIf he had only injured them, the fact that he lured them in could very likely have made this an assault. \n\nYou asked: \"Now that the burglars are in his house, what should he have done? \" Well, he got himself into a dangerous situation. Remember, he was convicted for premeditated murder. So just before he shot the girl in the head, he should have instead put the gun away and called police and an ambulance. It would have been one murder instead of two. Just before he shot the boy, he should have put the gun away and called police and an ambulance. It would have been just attempted murder. When he heard the first person entering, he should have called the police and waited. When the burglar came in sight, he should not have shot and injured him. \n\nIt's a similar question to \"if I try a bank robbery and there is an armed guard, what should I do\". The only legal thing to do is to drop your weapon and wait to be arrested. \n\nIf an armed burglar had appeared instead of two unarmed teens, well, he would have put himself into a dangerous situation. Just as the burglar would have no right to shoot even if a home owner points a weapon at him, he had no right to shoot, no right to self defense, since he had intentionally created the situation. Tough shit. That's what you may get if you plan a murder. \n\nResponding to some comments: @J.Chang Are you being serious? You are not allowed to make your house inviting to burglars, while waiting inside with the intent of killing them. Self defense only applies when a reasonable person would believe they are in danger. Reasonable persons don't think that a burglar comes in with the intent of blowing themselves up and taking the home owner with them. And no, you don't get to \"assume the worst\". Not when the worst is something no *reasonable* person would expect. \n\nThanks to Dale for pointing out that even for soldiers in a war situation, where different rules apply, deliberately killing a helpless enemy combatant is murder.",

This action went beyond self-defense, as the intruders no longer posed an immediate threat once they were injured and lying on the ground. The prosecutor argued that this demonstrated premeditation and intent to kill, rather than a legitimate act of self-defense.\n\nOption A, while suspicious, is not inherently illegal and alone would not warrant a murder conviction. Option B actually could have been potentially justified as self-defense if Smith had stopped after initially injuring the intruders. Option C, while potentially unwise, is not illegal in itself. The key factor that elevated the charges to first-degree murder was the deliberate killing of defenseless individuals who no longer posed a threat, as described in option D."

While publishing false information intentionally is unethical, it's not sufficient on its own to constitute fraud in a legal sense. Even if a consumer incurred losses due to the false information, they would face significant challenges in proving fraud. The key issue here is the element of \"reasonable reliance.\" On a controversial topic like climate change, where small news outlets are not considered definitive sources, it would be difficult for a consumer to prove they had a reasonable basis to rely on that information. Additionally, the consumer would need to prove they incurred losses as a direct result of the false information, which adds another layer of complexity to the case. Therefore, while options B and C touch on some aspects of fraud, they oversimplify the issue and ignore the crucial element of reasonable reliance, making D the most comprehensive and accurate answer."

For example, 35 USC \u00a7101 is the section that outlines subject\\-matter\\-eligibility for patents.\n\nBetween the Title level and Section level, the U.S. Code uses chapters, subchapters, parts, and subparts, not necessarily in that order, and not consistently from title to title.

The court has discretion to admit such evidence under section 114(1)(d) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 if it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice. The court must consider various factors, including the probative value of the statement, its importance to the case, and the reliability of the evidence. While a confession alone may not be sufficient for prosecution, it can be considered as evidence if the court deems it appropriate. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they do not accurately reflect the legal provisions for admitting such evidence in England and Wales."

But that need not be in a state where the person was ever physically present.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal proceedings against John?\n\nA) John can only be tried in New York, as that's where he was physically located when committing these acts.\nB) John can be tried in Georgia for election interference, but the tax fraud case must be prosecuted in New York.\nC) John can be tried in Georgia for both election interference and tax fraud, as both crimes are considered to have been committed in Georgia.\nD) John can only be tried in federal court, as his actions involve interstate activities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, a person can commit a crime in a state without being physically present there. In this case, John's attempt to influence the Georgia election official over the phone is considered a crime committed in Georgia, even though John was in New York. Similarly, submitting a false tax return to Georgia authorities is considered a crime committed in Georgia when the falsified document is received there. Therefore, Georgia has jurisdiction to prosecute John for both the election interference and tax fraud, as both crimes are deemed to have been committed within Georgia's borders, despite John's physical absence from the state.\n\nOption A is incorrect because physical presence is not required to commit a crime in a state. Option B is partially correct about the election interference but wrong about the tax fraud. Option D is incorrect because these crimes fall under state jurisdiction and don't necessarily require federal court involvement."

Historically, legal professionals avoided using internal punctuation in documents to prevent the possibility of unscrupulous individuals altering the meaning of a document after it had been signed. The absence of punctuation was a safeguard against fraud, as any added punctuation would be easily noticeable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because aesthetic considerations were not the primary reason for avoiding punctuation. In fact, the lack of punctuation often made documents less readable.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the avoidance of punctuation was not due to grammatical rules, but rather a deliberate convention in legal writing.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the goal was not to make documents intentionally ambiguous.

Both had green lights, and the cyclist was in a bike lane that became dashed approaching the intersection. The car began turning when the cyclist was visible but some distance behind. The car stopped mid-turn to allow pedestrians to cross. The cyclist, distracted by a billboard, failed to notice the stopped car in time and collided with it. According to Pennsylvania Vehicle Code and the information provided, who is most likely to be held liable for the collision?\n\nA) The cyclist, because they were distracted and failed to stop in time\nB) The car driver, because they interfered with the cyclist's right of way\nC) Both parties equally, as they both contributed to the accident\nD) Neither party, as it was an unavoidable accident\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, in almost all cases of a collision between a turning car and a straight-traveling cyclist, the car will be held responsible. The basis for this is that a turn should not be commenced unless it can be completed safely. If the car has to stop during the turn, it suggests the turn shouldn't have been initiated in the first place. The law specifically states that no turn by a motor vehicle shall interfere with a pedalcycle proceeding straight. Even though the cyclist was distracted, the primary responsibility lies with the car driver for initiating an unsafe turn that interfered with the cyclist's path.

In other words, if immigration authorities won't arrest and prosecute/deport illegal immigrants in a state, the state will take its own actions.\n\nWould this be legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. Arizona tried passing a law that, among other things: criminalized failure to comply with federal alien registration requirements, criminalized working without being authorized to work in the United States, and authorized state officers to arrest aliens without a warrant if they had probable cause that the alien had committed a crime that made them deportable. All three provisions were struck down in [*Arizona v. United States*.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/11-182)\n\nThe federal government has \"occupied the field\" on most immigration issues. That means they've regulated it so extensively that there is *zero* room for states to act independently. One of Arizona's laws that was struck down exactly duplicated a federal criminal statute, but even that went too far by allowing the state to apply its own enforcement priorities and prosecute cases the federal government would not. If a state made it a crime to be unlawfully present (which is not a federal crime), that intrudes even further on the federal immigration scheme.\n\nThis doesn't mean a state can't alert the federal government to people who are unlawfully present. It doesn't necessarily mean state officers can't arrest for federal immigration *crimes*: a [previous Ninth Circuit decision](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/59148fa9add7b04934569472) held that Arizona officers could arrest for federal immigration crimes on the same basis that they could arrest for state crimes, and the Supreme Court in *Arizona v. US* explicitly didn't address the question. However, if state officers make an arrest for a federal crime, the federal government still gets to decide whether or not to prosecute. What you're asking about would remove that federal control, so it is preempted by federal law.",

In both cases, John would be required to return the computer.\n\nIf it was a loan, Sarah retains ownership and can demand its return. If it was intended as payment, John's failure to complete the agreed-upon work means he is not entitled to keep the compensation (the computer). The additional money and time John invested do not change the fundamental nature of the arrangement or create an ownership right. While it may seem unfair, legally, John must return the computer without compensation for his upgrades or time invested.\n\nOption A is incorrect because John's investment doesn't override Sarah's ownership or the conditional nature of the arrangement. Option B is incorrect because Sarah is not obligated to reimburse John for upgrades she didn't authorize.

If it is a commercial website, even more information needs to be provided like tax number, competent court and so on.\n\nMy question is, what are the exact circumstances for this law to apply?\n\nI'm pretty sure it applies to people residing in Germany, even if the server hosting the website is not in Germany. But what about a foreigner or a German citizen not residing in Germany, but the hosting server is in Germany? Does the law apply then? Or if the website officially belongs to a foreign company?\n\nThus, the variables in which I would like the application of said law to be examined are:\n\n* Citizenship (German or not)\n* Permanent residency (in Germany or not)\n* Location of the server (in Germany or not)\n* The possible implications of a foreign company\n\nIt might also make a difference, if the foreign country is in the EU. Maybe the values should better read (Germany / EU / Rest of the World).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Disclaimer: Links are in German. My German is quite rough. Quoted translations provided by Google Translate.*\n\nTurns out the question \"Do I need an *Impressum*?\" is complicated. I'll start with examining the case for companies, then work down to the average private citizen.\n\nImpressum requirement\n=====================\n\nThe requirement for an online *Impressum* comes from the [Telemediengesetz (TMG) \u00a7\u00a05](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__5.html):\n\n> 1\\) Service providers are obliged to keep the following information readily available, readily accessible and constantly available for commercial, usually paid telemedia:\n> \n> \n> 1. the name and address under which they are established \\[...]\n\nApplicability based on country of origin\n========================================\n\nThe applicability of the TMG is described in \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0[2a](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__2a.html), [3](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__3.html). Thankfully, there is a [2013 court case](http://www.stroemer.de/index.php/entscheidungen/wettbewerbsrecht/1455-olg-hamm-urt-v-17-12-13-i-4-u-100-13-kreuzfahrtangebote) focused on these sections, involving an Egyptian company marketing cruises and not having a proper *Impressum* on their website. Also thankful is that law firm [mth Tieben \\& Partner summarized](http://www.mth-partner.de/wettbewerbsrecht-anwalt/internetrecht-zur-frage-ob-auslaendische-diensteanbieter-ein-webseitenimpressum-nach-deutschen-vorschriften-vorweisen-muessen/) this decision, because as it turns out, I cannot read judicial German.\n\nSummarizing their summary, \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02a, 3 sets the standard that the required information is based on a country of origin principle (*Herkunftslandprinzip*), where if that country of origin is Germany, \u00a7 5 applies. However, this principle is rooted in EU directives, and as such is not applicable to non\\-EU countries. For these, the law falls back on the older principle of market location (*Marktortprinzip*). If the non\\-EU company advertises in Germany and thus participates in the German market, then it must have a valid *Impressum*.\n\nI'll note that, the TMG considers Germany to be the \"country of origin\" if the company is either registered in or has significant operations in Germany (see the given sections for specifics). This is not the same \"country of origin\" as is found in copyright law.\n\nApplicability to private website hosts\n======================================\n\nAs it turns out, an *Impressum* is not required for private non\\-commercial websites. However, as pointed out by this [Anwalt article](https://www.anwalt.de/rechtstipps/impressumspflicht-auch-fuer-private-webseiten-und-blogs_105215.html), the wording of the TMG makes it such that omitting an *Impressum* may often be illegal. In particular, [the definitions section](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/tmg/__2.html) of the TMG provides very broad definitions of \"Service provider\" (*Diensteanbieter*): \n\n> Service provider shall mean any natural or legal person who provides his own or third\\-party telemedia for use or provides access to use; in the case of audiovisual media services on demand, service providers shall mean any natural or legal person who effectively controls the selection and design of the content offered,\n\nand \"commercial communication\" (*kommerzielle Kommunikation*):\n\n> Commercial communication means any form of communication which serves the direct or indirect promotion of the sale of goods, services or the appearance of an undertaking, other organization or a natural person engaged in trade, trades or crafts or a liberal professions; \\[...]\n\nConclusion\n==========\n\nIn terms of variables like the one you suggest, the proper \"variable\" for companies is the country of origin. For private web hosts, I would argue that residency is the closest analogue to country of origin as defined in TMG \u00a7\u00a7\u00a02a, 3\\. Location of server doesn't matter, and I don't think citizenship does either.\n\nWith that in mind, the values would be: \n\n* Germany: Required\n* EU: Not required\n* Rest of world: Required if advertised/directed in/towards Germany.\n\nwith the caveat that truly private non\\-commercial websites never require an *Impressum*.",

The blog includes affiliate links, which can be considered \"commercial communication\" under the broad definition in the TMG.\n2. The citizenship and server location are less relevant than the nature of the content and its commerciality.\n3. While the blog owner resides in France (EU), the presence of commercial elements means it may still fall under German law if it can be accessed by German users.\n4. The primary target audience being non-German doesn't exempt the blog from German law if it's accessible in Germany.\n\nThe inclusion of affiliate links makes this blog commercial in nature, even if it's not the primary purpose. According to the information provided, even private websites with any commercial elements may require an Impressum. Therefore, despite the owner's EU residence, the commercial aspect necessitates an Impressum under German law."

The installer should have known better.\n\nA minority of U.S. states, including California, consider new construction that blocks the view of existing structures a form of \"nuisance\" that can be abated if it unreasonably interferes with the enjoyment of the existing property. But, that protects existing structures, rather than new ones.\n\nIn Japan, there are building code requirements designed to insure that key portions of every home get natural sunlight daily. Again, this only applies to the construction of new buildings.\n\nI know of no law that gives someone who newly installs a solar panel a right to remove or trim a neighbor's tree simply by virtue of doing so. And, without knowing whose law is involved it would be impossible to determine with any reliability. \n\nThe property with the solar panel could seek to buy the right to an unobstructed view from the property with the tree, in what would probably be called a \"view easement\", but that would only happen if the terms were such that both consented and it was written up in a legal document to that effect.",

The homeowner cannot unilaterally create or impose an easement on their neighbor's property.\n\nC) is correct. Based on the information provided, pre-existing trees are protected, and the installation of new solar panels does not grant the homeowner any special rights to alter or remove their neighbor's trees.

Jamie then goes back to Arizona, US, will Jamie be prosecuted, and if so, in which country, under which law, and what is the maximum punishment? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume the act was not a rape, and Jessica is older than 16\\. Since the act in question did not take place in the US, no US / Arizona laws were broken, so there will be no trial in the US. \n\nThe [US\\-Australian extradition treaty](http://www.mcnabbassociates.com/Australia%20International%20Extradition%20Treaty%20with%20the%20United%20States.pdf) specifies a set of acts for which a person can be extradited: these include murder, assault, bigamy and so on, but not illegal recording. US law requires 1\\-party consent for recording (Jamie consents to the recording), so under US law the recording is not a felony (not a crime at all). Article II(2\\) specifies that other acts allow extradition if the act is a felony in the US which it is not. Simple spite (not extortion) is not a felony / extradition offense. Therefore, the basic requirements for extradition are not satisfied, and Jamie will not be extradited. (In addition, under Article V, a US citizen can be extradited from the US only at the discretion of the executive branch if \u201cit considers that it is proper to do so\u201d.)\n\nIt is not clear whether the act is a federal crime in Australia. It is a crime to film sexual acts without consent in some states of Australia, e.g. [\u00a7 91K of the Crimes Act 1900](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s91k.html), NSW. That law has an intent requirement that the filming being \"for the purpose of obtaining, or enabling another person to obtain, sexual arousal or sexual gratification\", which we might assume to be true in this case (but not if the plan was simply to embarass Jessica). The laws pertaining to consent and recording vary from state to state, and such a recording does not appear to be against national law. The [Australian Extradition Act 1985 \u00a75](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ea1988149/s5.html) defines an \u201cextradition offence\u201d as \n\n> \u201can offence against a law of Australia, or a law in force in the part\n>  of Australia, for which the maximum penalty is death or imprisonment,\n>  or other deprivation of liberty, for a period of not less than 12\n>  months\u201d\n\nIn accordance with the US\\-Australia treaty Art II(2\\), the offense must be made extraditable under the extradition laws of Australia \u2013 it thus matters which state the act took place in (though the fact that it is not against US law is dispositive).",

The act took place in Australia, so US/Arizona laws were not broken and there will be no trial in the US.\n2. The US-Australian extradition treaty doesn't cover this specific offense, and it's not considered a felony under US law (which requires 1-party consent for recording).\n3. The act may be a crime in some Australian states, but it's not clear if it's a federal crime in Australia.\n4. The Australian Extradition Act requires the offense to be punishable by at least 12 months imprisonment to be an extraditable offense.\n5. Even if it were an extraditable offense under Australian law, the fact that it's not against US law is decisive in preventing extradition.\n\nTherefore, due to these jurisdictional and treaty issues, Jamie is unlikely to face legal consequences in either country unless she voluntarily returns to Australia."

He did so both on the federally managed grounds and on the ME easement.\n\nMy questions regard the legal limitations and boundaries *of a LEO's* jurisdiction and how *criminal conduct* color the rules for jurisdiction. When the LEO violently assaulted the citizen *on the easement* is he out of his jurisdiction? Suppose for the sake of argument, the LEO has jurisdiction limited to the property with the easement in question. Under the general question of where or not jurisdiction ends in an easement a few specific questions come to mind:\n\n1. If a LEO acts entirely on the easement, due to events that happened entirely on the easement, does that have *any* impact on the legal authority of the LEO?\n2. Is there any immediate or long term legal consequence for an officer committing crimes or doing so egregiously (with or without qualified immunity) *while out of his jurisdiction* as opposed to doing so in his jurisdiction?\n\n* For instance, could a civilian defend himself against violent assaults from an officer while *out of the LEO's jurisdiction* that he could not legally defend himself from while the LEO were fully in his jurisdiction?\n* Are other officers bound by law to arrest or stop other officers committing crimes outside of the jurisdiction when they are normally allowed discretion to allow fellow officers to flout the law?\n* Does an officer loose the qualified immunity defense or other legal defense when doing illegal things out of his jurisdiction?\n\nAre there any important nuances to jurisdiction and law enforcement by LEOs that a first amendment auditor should be aware of?\n\n\\*\\*\\* VIDEO CONTEXT\nThe video show a first amendment auditor and legal activist taking video of a federal facility, U.S. customs and border patrol. Before he can enter the facility or say a word to anyone he is threatened by his soon\\-to\\-be asailaint, a federal LEO. I know this is illegal for the LEO to do, and so does the first amendment auditor. This is a matter of clearly established law. At this point it is likely only a civil matter because the officer has given prior restraint to limit the auditor's *clearly established* legal rights.\n\nThe auditor says \"Don't touch me!\", then the belligerent LEO repeatedly shoves, slaps, and threatens with frightening words. While the assaults/batteries happen the auditor is trying to explain the law and give notice of the DHS memo that verifies the auditor's right to record and then he threatens legal action with phrases like 'You're going to get fired/loose qualified immunity/etc for this!'\n\nI'm taking it for granted that the cop knowingly broke the law even before the easement. Certainly, he *should* have known. It seems like a civil matter at this point, *before the easement*, because cops are given special privileges while on duty that allow them to commit certain crimes without obstruction from civilians. \\*I'm not merely saying cops are legally allowed to do things that civilians cannot legally do. \\* I'm also suggesting that cops effectively can break the laws even they are under, as there are often laws against resisting an *unlawful* arrest even if this is a privilege to temporarily break the law it is nonetheless permission to break the law in often egregious ways at least while acting under the color of law. As other officers witnessing the crimes of fellow LEOs often have discretion, this is effectively a license to commit crime at least for a while. I'm not debating the merits of this, but merely stating what I believe to be relevant facts leading up the question of whether or not civilians can ever restrain criminally acting violent LEOs in any lawful way in the context of easement law.\n\nThe LEO went beyond what is his *normal* lawful jurisdiction for protecting against criminals not just by committing crimes himself, but by going into the easement of the property and into the public street. He pushed the auditor into the public street or highway \\- I can't tell which. He then threw the auditors equipment into the street. The auditor claimed this easement was not his lawful jurisdiction. So now I'm interested to know if any LEO is ever restricted in jurisdiction by an easement *in any way* and if federal LEOs like this one, who are normally restricted to enforcing laws on a property, are restricted *in any way* by easement laws. As a concrete example related to the video content, could this LEO observe a person peacefully walking along the easement and then shove him into traffic while having the full protection of laws that prohibit obstruction of *unlawful* officer action or could the auditor or civilian observers *legally* have defended the auditor in this simplified example by responding in kind by for instance restraining the belligerent LEO? For the sake of understanding the law, let's consider just the example of an auditor that was on the easement of the property the LEO has jurisdiction on but not ever beyond that.\n\nDISCLAIMERS:\n\n* I'm *not* asking about the violent assault *while within his jurisdiction* except to contrast to the assault within his jurisdiction.\n* I'm *not* asking what is *prudent* for either an average citizen or a seasoned first amendment auditor and legal activist to do in this situation. These are rather questions of de jure law.\n* I'm *not* asking about the jurisdiction for a citizen to effect a legal citizens arrest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> When the LEO violently assaulted the citizen on the easement is he out of his jurisdiction?\n\nNo. Federal law enforcement officers' jurisdiction generally\\* includes the entire US. Federal and state jurisdiction are said to be [concurrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_jurisdiction) with one another. If the federal law enforcement officer has a lawful basis to effect an arrest, the arrest can be effected on a state\u2020 highway easement.\n\n> Is there any immediate or long term consequence for an officer committing crimes or doing so egregiously (with or without qualified immunity) out of his jurisdiction as opposed to doing so in his jurisdiction?\n\nIf the officer were outside his jurisdiction (which isn't the case here) then the officer is generally treated as any other private individual. In this case, \"outside his jurisdiction\" means \"in another country,\" which brings up all sorts of additional complications that aren't really in scope here, largely because the laws and legal systems of other countries are different from those in the US.\n\n> Are there any nuances to jurisdiction and law enforcement by LEOs that a first amendment auditor should be aware of?\n\nThere are plenty, but perhaps the most prominent one, if the internet is any guide, is that an officer is not required to articulate the basis for reasonable suspicion or probable cause at the time of a Terry stop or an arrest. The time for this is much later, after a judge is involved. Arguing with an officer on this score is just going to make things worse. Instead, one should *cooperate* while stating one's objections clearly and calmly, especially making it clear that cooperation does not imply consent.\n\n---\n\n\\* Some categories of officers do have more limited jurisdiction: thanks to cpast for the example of park rangers, whose jurisdiction is essentially restricted to national parks. The officers in this case are CBP field officers. There is a wide misconception that CBP officers' jurisdiction is limited to within 100 miles of the border, but that 100\\-mile limit only applies to their power to board and search vessels and vehicles without a warrant in order to prevent illegal entry into the US. Their power to make warrantless arrests \"for any offence against the United States\" committed in their presence is not geographically restricted.\n\n\u2020 The [original video](https://youtu.be/JqTBFfcTEBs) was filmed in South Portland, Maine, and the roadway is a municipal street, [Gannett Drive](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y5Kb46im7T1i17Fi8), to be precise. The point remains, however, that it is a public right\\-of\\-way, and federal officers are not \"out of their jurisdiction\" simply because they've left a federal facility and entered a public place.",

Their authority is concurrent with state and local law enforcement, and is not limited to federal property. The common misconception about CBP's 100-mile border zone only applies to certain warrantless searches, not to their overall jurisdiction or ability to make arrests. Even when on a municipal street or other public right-of-way, federal officers retain their full law enforcement authority.

Some provinces have exceptions to the RTA if the landlord and the \"tenant\" share common areas like the kitchen and bathroom, but I see no such exceptions in Nova Scotia. \n\nSpecifically, Section 3, Application of Act, states:\n\n> (1\\) Notwithstanding any agreement, declaration, waiver or statement to the contrary, this Act applies when the relation of landlord and tenant exists between a person and an individual in respect of residential premises.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) For the purposes of subsection (1\\), the relation of landlord and tenant is deemed to exist in respect of residential premises between an individual and a person when an individual\n> \n> \n> \n> > (a) possesses or occupies residential premises and has paid or agreed to pay rent to the person;\n> > \n> > \n> > (b) makes an agreement with the person by which the individual is granted the right to possess or occupy residential premises in consideration of the payment of or promise to pay rent;\n> > \n> > \n> > (c) has possessed or occupied residential premises and has paid or agreed to pay rent to the person. R.S., c. 401, s. 3\\.\n\nAnd section 2(j) states:\n\n> (j) tenant\u201d means\n> \n> \n> \n> > (i) an individual who has paid or agreed to pay rent tooccupy residential premises,\n> > \n> > \n> > (ii) an individual who is permitted to occupy residentialpremises under an assignment or sublet to which the landlord hasconsented under Section 9B, and\n> > \n> > \n> > (iii) an heir, assign or personal representative of an individ\\-ual referred to in subclause (i) or (ii);\n\nI want to verify that I'm understanding the Act correctly, and that the RTA does apply to both parties (the original leasee and his landlord, and the leasee and his tenant).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Here's what the Dalhousie University Legal Aid Service says (PDF, p. 25\u201329\\):](https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/law/DLAS/TenantRightsGuides/Tenant%20Rights%20Guide%202019.pdf)\n\n> A sublet is a type of rental agreement between a tenant and a subtenant. This means that the tenant of a rental unit finds someone else to rent their unit from them for a period of time. Therefore, in a sublet the original tenant becomes a master tenant and the new tenant becomes a subtenant. ...\n> \n> \n> Subletting your unit is very risky. In a way, it is the worst of both worlds, because you have both the obligations of a landlord and of a tenant.\n> ...\n> \n> \n> In a sublet the landlord still has obligations to you, and the landlord can also claim against you as well as the person you have sublet to. If there is a dispute between a subtenant and master tenant it has to be re\\- solved through Residential Tenancies. Similarly, if you are a subtenant, you can file a Residential Tenancies claim against either the landlord or the master tenant.\n\nAlso, note that Section 2(d) of the Residential Tenancies Act specifically applies to situations where only part of a unit is rented (bolding mine):\n\n> \u201cresidential premises\u201d includes any house, dwelling, apartment, flat, tenement, manufactured home, land\\-lease community, manufactured home space or other place that is occupied or may be occupied by an individual as a residence **or that part of any such place that is or may be occupied by an individual as a residence**...\n\n(I have omitted the list of exceptions which follow, but they do not seem to apply to a \"rented room\" situation.)\n\nTaken together, it appears that a full landlord\\-tenant relationship would exist in the situation you describe. The only caveat is that it appears that the landlord and subtenant can, in principle, file suit against each other in case of dispute (as well as against the \"master tenant\".)",

The original tenant (Alex) becomes a \"master tenant\" and has obligations similar to a landlord towards the subtenant (Beth).\n2. The subtenant (Beth) has rights under the Residential Tenancies Act and can file claims against both the master tenant (Alex) and the original landlord.\n3. The Act applies even when only part of a unit (like a single room) is rented.\n4. Unlike some other provinces, Nova Scotia does not have exceptions to the Act for situations where tenants share common areas.\n\nTherefore, Beth has a tenant-landlord relationship with both Alex and Alex's landlord, and can file claims against either of them under the Residential Tenancies Act, making option C the correct answer."

The CCPA applies to all residents of California dealing with businesses that meet certain criteria, regardless of any contractual agreements. Attempting to exclude the law through a contract provision would be void and could potentially be considered misleading and deceptive conduct. The law explicitly states that businesses cannot make consumers waive these rights, and any such contract provision is unenforceable. Additionally, this strategy faces practical difficulties such as people moving to California after agreeing to the EULA, the possibility of users lying about their location, and the fact that the law applies to Californians regardless of their current location. Furthermore, even if successful in excluding Californians, the company would likely still face similar obligations under other privacy laws like the GDPR for European users."

The bank (or whoever owned the loan) had already sent notices and tried other options. They had to do quite a bit of detective work to find the owner. The owner had also gotten plenty of notices in the mail and probably a visit from someone trying to collect, so they were already on the lookout. Simply by the law of averages, a couple of mistakes have to happen.\n\nMy question is\n\n1. What happens when a car that is legally owned by someone is \"repossessed\"? Is the repo man charged with theft?\n2. What happens to personal items in the car? For example, a laptop in a book\\-bag.\n3. How does the rightful owner go about getting the car back? Do they file a police report?\n4. Are there special statutes that protect repo men from honest mistakes?\n\nThere were several popular \"repo shows\" in the early 2000s. Most of them were staged, but I believe some showed real repos, at least at first. I believe most of the shows filmed in Florida or California. I don't doubt sometimes repo men played a bit fast and loose with the rules. Repo was generally the final option after notices and visits from collectors had failed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is it a crime for a repo man to accidentally repo the wrong car?\n\nNot unless the car was retained after the accidental repossession was discovered, and then, only by the person retaining it (as the repo man may have turned over the car to the creditor whose loan on a similar car is in default).\n\nGenerally speaking, taking property of another with an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property of it is a crime only if one knows that the property is the property of another.\n\nFor example, if two people leave black umbrellas in an entry room and someone accidentally leaves with the wrong one, the taking of the wrong umbrella is not a crime.\n\nWhether the repo man's assertion that he accidentally took the wrong car is credible is a question of fact to be determined at trial, if the prosecution doubts him. If he was supposed to repossess a 1936 Ford and he repossessed a 2021 Tesla, the repo man is probably going to lose and be convicted of theft. If he was supposed to repossess a white 2021 Tesla and he repossessed a different white 2021 Tesla in the same neighborhood with a license plate from the same state as the one he was supposed to repossess, he has a very good chance of prevailing.\n\nHowever, once someone learns that they have taken the wrong property, they have a duty to return the property promptly to the owner upon request, and probably, to notify the owner (if the owner can be determined) and the authorities who were informed that a different vehicle was taken, promptly. Otherwise, the originally good faith mistake becomes theft.\n\nIf the repo man's explanation is convincing, he is not likely to be charged with theft, even though no special law applies. What makes the repo man special is that he did have permission from the secured car loan creditor to repossess it due to the secured car loan debtor's default by the Uniform Commercial Code. If he had taken the right car without a breach of the peace, the Uniform Commercial Code would have absolved him of liability and given him legal permission to do so.\n\nIf the repo had been of the right car, the creditor would have had a duty to promptly return the personal possession in the car in which it did not have a lien to the rightful owner. This conclusion doesn't change when the repo man accidentally takes the wrong car.\n\nWhile the repo man's mistake was not knowing or intentional, it was probably negligent to repossess the car without carefully confirming the VIN number and license plate to make sure that he was repossessing the correct car. As a result, the car own probably has a claim against both the repo man (whose negligence caused the wrongful repossession) and the creditor (for whom he was acting as an agent to repossess the car) for any damages caused to the owner of the wrongfully repossessed car, including damages to the vehicle and damages from loss of use of the car and possibly damages for emotional distress caused by thinking that his car had been stolen or by missing a non\\-economic opportunity that he could have had if the car had not been wrongfully taken (e.g. if this caused the car owner to miss the funeral of the car owner's father).\n\nThe creditor and the repo man probably have insurance policies in place that cover legal defense of such claims and also economic settlements or money judgments entered on that kind of claim.",

Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The repo man cannot be charged with theft as long as he claims it was an accident, regardless of his actions after realizing the mistake.\n\nB) The repo man is automatically protected from any legal consequences due to special statutes for repo men.\n\nC) The repo man may be charged with theft if he fails to promptly return the car and notify Jane after realizing the mistake.\n\nD) Jane has no legal recourse against the creditor, only against the repo man individually.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the initial accidental repossession may not be considered theft if it was truly unintentional, the repo man's actions after realizing the mistake are crucial. If he fails to promptly return the car and notify the rightful owner (Jane) once he becomes aware of the error, his initially innocent mistake could then be considered theft.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the repo man's claim of accident alone does not protect him, especially if he retains the car after discovering the mistake.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because there are no special statutes that automatically protect repo men from honest mistakes. They are still liable for negligence and must act responsibly once an error is discovered.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because Jane likely has a claim against both the repo man (for negligence) and the creditor (as the repo man's principal) for any damages resulting from the wrongful repossession."

For example, they have asked us to pay to their account officer, and we don't really know if that is ok.\n\nI'm under the impression that most agreements made in writing are legally enforcable, including text messages and emails. But what kind of actions can be taken against those who violate these? Also, what language can be used to ensure that a deposit will actually be refunded? Suppose a supposed landlord asked for a security deposit and then ran with it, would we be able to take them to court and take legal actions to get the money back? Would it be worth it, since I'm assuming such legal action isn't always cheap or free? Does this mean that we should never make a payment regarding housing before meeting the person in real life? My roommate and I have had issues with several landlords who have pressured us to make a security deposit in order to secure an apartment before we have had the chance to meet them in person, and we aren't sure if we should be as worried as we are.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A college student is asked to pay a security deposit for an apartment before visiting the property or meeting the landlord in person. The landlord has provided a leasing contract stating the deposit is refundable. Which of the following is the MOST advisable course of action for the student?\n\nA) Pay the deposit immediately to secure the apartment, as the contract makes it legally binding.\nB) Refuse to pay any deposit until after visiting the property and meeting the landlord in person.\nC) Pay the deposit but only after verifying the landlord's identity and property ownership through official records.\nD) Negotiate with the landlord to pay half the deposit now and half after visiting the property.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because even with a contract, paying before verifying the property and landlord's legitimacy carries high risk of fraud.\nB) is correct as it's the safest approach to avoid potential scams. Meeting in person and viewing the property are crucial steps in verifying the legitimacy of the offer.\nC) is a safer option than A, but still carries risk as official records may not be up-to-date or could be falsified.\nD) is a compromise but still involves paying money before verifying the property and landlord in person, which is risky.\n\nThe safest approach is to refuse any payment until the property has been viewed and the landlord met in person, even if it means potentially losing the opportunity. This protects against common rental scams where fraudsters pressure for quick payments."

In those cases, they seem more likely to, for example, accept to remove the source for a defamation claim, despite everything in the written or recorded statement being true, when compared to wealthier people.\n\nAnd if the situation was reversed, there is a decent chance that they might not even sue. I'm not sure how true it is, but it seems common amongst the people around me that having more money tends to give you a better chance in court, because your lawyer tends to have more experience, a better team around them from being in a bigger law firm, etc.\n\nWith those factors in mind, it appears to me that money is an obstacle that prevents some people from benefitting from the law as much as other people, going against the article above as it creates an unequal benefit of the law, based on the money you make.\n\nBut, clearly I haven't seen many people in Canada, or any country that I am aware of with an equal protection clause, that legal fees are unconstitutional, and thus should be removed, which leads me to believe that they are probably constitutional.\n\nSo, why aren't legal fees being a barrier of entry unconstitutional? How does it not go against the equal protection clause?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> How does it not go against the equal protection clause?\n\nPeople had argued poverty is an analogous ground but it is not recognized. You may find the arguments outlined in *[William Head Institution v. Canada (Commissioner of Corrections)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/1999/1999canlii7643/1999canlii7643.html#document)* useful to respond to your question, but you certainly do not have to agree with those arguments.\n\nThe main arguments there include\n\n1. The Charter is not a document designed to protect economic rights and freedoms, in so far that \"the worth and dignity of the human person\" is not threatened.\n2. Poor people form a disparate and heterogenous group without a central *personal* characteristic. The Charter protects \"discrete and insular minorities\".\n3. Poverty is not immutable and changing it does not come with unacceptable personal cost; in fact, most people would be happy to become not poor.\n\nIt is also necessary to understand section 15 or the constitution is not designed to *create* a \"perfect\" society. They must be read in conjunction of social and political \"progress\" or understandings of the society and interpreted so that it is \"practical\" and \"pragmatic\" under such understandings.\n\nDirecting government policies in minute details are not the role of the constitution or the judiciary. Taking to the extreme, the equal protection requirement could require the government to assess all its policies at an individual level to ensure literally everyone does not benefit more than any other person under any law. But most people do not believe that should be done and it will paralyze essentially all governing activities.\n\nAs another answer has showed, court fees can be unconstitutional for other reasons. But in general, court fees serve an important purpose to fund the judicial system and encourage non\\-judicial resolutions of disputes so reasonably compensated judges can have a reasonable caseload; in some sense, the courts are self\\-serving (but also serve the interests of the society in general so everyone is not suing everyone for every small things).\n\n> With those factors in mind, it appears to me that money is an obstacle that prevents some people from benefitting from the law as much as other people, going against the article above as it creates an unequal benefit of the law, based on the money you make.\n\nThe above is by no means a justification of barriers of access in the justice system. But it is mostly a political problem that the judiciary should (and does) steer clear of other than for exceptional situations.",

These arguments were outlined in the case of William Head Institution v. Canada. \n\nOption D, however, is incorrect. The text does not state that all financial barriers to accessing justice are permissible. In fact, it mentions that court fees can be unconstitutional in certain circumstances, and that barriers to access in the justice system are largely seen as a political problem rather than a constitutional one. The answer also notes that courts do sometimes intervene in \"exceptional situations.\"\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to distinguish between the actual arguments presented in the text and an overgeneralized statement that goes beyond what was explicitly stated."

One refers to the study of linguistic structure as it pertains to legal interpretation (i.e. testifying as to what a law says), and the other, the sense you have in mind, pertains to testifying as an expert about legally relevant facts at a trial. In the US, the relevant rule is [FRE 702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702). There is no need for a special certificate, and most forensic phoneticians do not have certificates. The presiding judge will make a determination whether you are qualified as an expert. In practice, this comes down to showing that you do actually have relevant specialized knowledge, so you would submit a resume indicating the degrees, publications and practical experience you have in the area. Since judges aren't particularly tuned into details of the field, they tend to allow testimony from people who pass the basic sniff test for expertise. The bulk of the \"work\" in being a forensic phonetician is the scientific quality of their testimony, e.g. are you able to show that voiceprint evidence is so unreliable that it should not be trusted (assuming it is even allowed). It is my understanding that most FP experts are professionally in law enforcement, e.g. work for FBI labs; but, regular phoneticians might be contacted by an attorney.\n\n\"Certificates\" are available from various companies, and might impress someone; one would be better off in an academic program from an established university (Cardiff for example).

According to the information provided, there is no specific certificate required to serve as a forensic linguist in a U.S. court. Instead, the qualification of an expert witness is determined by the presiding judge based on Federal Rules of Evidence 702. This rule allows experts to testify based on their knowledge, skills, experience, training, or education. The judge will assess the individual's qualifications, which typically include relevant degrees, publications, and practical experience in the field.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because no specific certificate is required. While certificates exist, they are not mandatory for qualification as an expert witness.\n\nAnswer B is false because forensic linguists do not need to be employed by law enforcement agencies. While many experts work for such agencies, academics and independent experts can also qualify.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because having academic credentials alone does not automatically qualify someone as an expert witness. The judge still needs to evaluate the individual's qualifications and determine their expertise in the specific area relevant to the case."

If so, how would the statement of cause and demand for relief differ for each tort?\n\nOr if they would not be used in the same pleading, can you provide minimal examples that would discriminate between the most applicable tort?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: FYI, I'm not an attorney, this isn't legal advice, and you should seek an attorney in your jurisdiction if you have a real legal concern or potential case. \n\n**Detinue**\n\n[Detinue](https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/detinue/) seeks recovery of a piece of property that has been wrongfully held or retained (distinguished from replevin which seeks recovery of property that has been wrongfully taken). Under detinue, the defendant received the property legally and the plaintiff never had to have the property in the first place (so, say you have something that I am supposed to receive, but I've never had it and you won't give it to me). \n\n**Conversion**\n\nConversion occurs when one purposely interferes with another's personal property. The plaintiff must show that he owns or has the right to have the item at the time it's interfered with, that the defendant's interference with it was intentional, that the interference deprived the plaintiff of possession or use of the item, and that the interference caused damages to the plaintiff. \n\nSay I swipe a document off of your desk and walk out with it. Within 30 seconds, it would be unlikely you could claim conversion. Why? Because there had not yet been any damages to you. Now, if I had that document for three hours and you were supposed to file it in court for a deadline or something, and you could show I intentionally took it (aka did not mistakenly believe it was mine), you may then have a claim. \n\nAlso, conversion can happen if you receive an item from somebody who was not authorized to give it away from you. \n\n**Trespass to Chattels**\n\nThis is an intentional and wrongful interference with another's possession of property. The difference between this and conversion is about the degree of interference. Trespass to chattels can be found where one merely challenges another's right of possession. However, if the offending party exercises \"dominion and control\" over the item, it's likely conversion. \n\nTo return to the document example, if I had it for those 30 seconds, you may not be able to claim conversion, as I stated, but you *may* be able to claim trespass to chattels in that situation. \n\nAnother example, for clarity's sake: someone steals your car and you recover it within 20 minutes. Probably trespass to chattels. Someone steals your car and sells it to another person. Probably conversion. \n\n**Single Cause of Action?**\n\nDetinue is almost in complete disuse, so you in fact may not need to worry about it. Most jurisdictions have statutes for the recovery of personal property which have largely superseded detinue. Detinue is an action to recover personal property belonging to the plaintiff. Trover is an action for the recovery of damages for the wrongful conversion of personal property. Mixed in with all this is replevin, which is an action where a party seeks the return of an item that was taken wrongfully pending the final determination by the court of its true owner (maintaining the status quo until it's figured out who should be entitled to keep it).",

Which of the following combinations of legal actions would be most appropriate and effective for the museum to pursue in this situation?\n\nA) Detinue and conversion\nB) Trespass to chattels and replevin\nC) Conversion and replevin\nD) Detinue and trespass to chattels\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \n\nOption C (Conversion and replevin) is the most appropriate and effective combination of legal actions for the museum in this scenario.\n\nConversion is applicable because the collector is intentionally interfering with the museum's property rights by refusing to return the painting. The museum owned the painting at the time of interference, the collector's action is intentional, it deprives the museum of possession, and it likely causes damages (loss of a valuable asset).\n\nReplevin is also appropriate as it's an action seeking the return of an item wrongfully taken or retained, pending the court's final determination of ownership. This allows the museum to potentially regain possession of the painting while the case is ongoing.\n\nDetinue (option A and D) is largely obsolete and has been superseded by statutory remedies in most jurisdictions, making it less effective.\n\nTrespass to chattels (option B and D) is less suitable here because the interference is more severe than a mere challenge to possession \u2013 the collector is exercising full control over the painting, which aligns more with conversion.\n\nThis combination (C) provides the strongest legal strategy for the museum to both recover damages and potentially regain possession of the painting quickly."

Microsoft claims unauthorized use due to geographical license limitations. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The Asian company can continue using the software without any legal concerns as long as they uninstall it after completing the project.\n\nB) Microsoft's claim of unauthorized use is invalid because software licenses cannot be geographically limited.\n\nC) The companies should consult an IP lawyer to review the specific license agreements and their enforceability in different jurisdictions before taking any action.\n\nD) The European company can simply transfer the licenses to the Asian company without any legal implications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The situation involves complex legal issues regarding software licensing across international borders. The companies should consult an IP lawyer for several reasons:\n\n1. License agreements can vary, and the enforceability may differ across jurisdictions.\n2. The specific terms of the Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Premium license need to be examined to determine if geographical limitations apply.\n3. The nature of the arrangement between the European and Asian companies (temporary use vs. rental) may affect the legal interpretation.\n4. Professional legal advice can help the companies understand their rights and potential risks before engaging further with Microsoft.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply uninstalling the software may not resolve potential license violations that have already occurred.\n\nOption B is incorrect because software licenses can indeed include geographical limitations, as evidenced by Microsoft's claim in this case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because transferring licenses without proper authorization could potentially violate the terms of the agreement with Microsoft.\n\nConsulting an IP lawyer is the most prudent course of action to navigate this complex legal situation."

Both are retail sales. A retail sale is a sale for use rather than a wholesale sale for resale. Wholesale sales are exempt from sales tax and so are easy to distinguish. Online sales are still retail sales. It is a distinction without a difference.\n\nSales and Use Tax Law \u00a7 6007(a)(1\\) and common law case law would suffice. There is also case law under the UCC, and the relevant federal statutes. But, I doubt that the argument of the vendor would be that it didn't make a retail sale (at least once their lawyers got involved). More importantly, there is nothing that says that online sales aren't retail sales.\n\nBob should contact the online sales department to seek a remedy since he was advised by the company to contact that department. But the part of the company handling his complaint doesn't change his rights.\n\nWarranty rights don't depend upon the intent of the parties. If a warranty arises and it good isn't as warranted, there is a legal right to a remedy.\n\nIf a store doesn't honor one's legal warranty rights, then you sue the store for damages, typically, in a court of limited jurisdiction, or if there is an arbitration clause, in a consumer arbitration forum (some of which are not actively doing business due to controversies in recent years, leaving a judicial forum open).",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Bob's rights under California law?\n\nA) Bob has no recourse because the purchase was made online, not in-store.\n\nB) Bob must first attempt to resolve the issue through Corp's online sales department before pursuing legal action.\n\nC) Bob can immediately sue Corp for damages in a court of limited jurisdiction, regardless of whether he contacts the online sales department.\n\nD) Bob's rights under the Song-Beverly Act are void because he didn't receive a written warranty at the time of purchase.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, Bob's rights under California's consumer protection laws (including the Song-Beverly Act) are not affected by whether the sale is considered online or in-store. Both are retail sales. The act does not require consumers to take any affirmative steps to secure relief other than allowing the manufacturer a reasonable opportunity to repair the item. Bob has already attempted to return the item, which Corp refused. Therefore, Bob can pursue legal action, typically by suing for damages in a court of limited jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the distinction between online and in-store sales is irrelevant to Bob's consumer rights in this case. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while Corp advised Bob to contact their online sales department, this is not a legal requirement and does not affect Bob's right to pursue legal action.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because implied warranties exist regardless of whether a written warranty was provided, and the Song-Beverly Act protects consumers against fundamental defects through implied warranties."

While many fantasy races have roots in folklore and mythology (and thus are not copyrightable in their generic form), the specific interpretations, descriptions, and portrayals of these races within a particular work can be protected by copyright. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it overstates the scope of copyright protection.

However, surprisingly I can find no research paper or even informed opinion discussing what are the norms.\n\n**Are there international agreements or conventions which address detention without charge? Specifically, after how long must either charges be filed or the imprisoned released?**\n\nIn the absence of such conventions, what are common detention without charge limits, and does it vary by state, geographic region, or political framework?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The time between arrest and being presented to a judge depends on the country you are in:\n\n[japan](/questions/tagged/japan \"show questions tagged 'japan'\")\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can be in jail for **23 days** before you even see a judge and are charged, and **that clock resets whenever they officially start to investigate you for a different possible charge**. You are not charged, you are just accused of this related and greater crime. This tactic even has a special name: [Hitojichi shih\u014d](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitojichi_shih%C5%8D). Someone they want to investigate for murder can be first imprisoned to *investigate the deposit of the corpse*, then for the actual *murder*, for a total of 46 days maximum \\- and if the DA isn't creative to get some other lesser included charges in. Against some Yakuza, some DAs allegedly managed to chain up much more.\n\nHowever, those 23 days (per investigation) are all the pre\\-trial investigative confinement that the state gets before a trial \\- the moment the formal charge is entered, the trial has to begin soon after... However, the state also often has the arrestee's confession at that point \\- partially because a creative DA might manage to keep you nigh permanently and in part because you don't have the right to have your attorney at your side during questioning in Japan. This is partially the reason why Japanese courts have such a crazy high conviction rate: more than 99% of the cases brought by DAs are convictions, in most cases using the confession obtained in the pre\\-charge detention as a piece of key evidence.\n\n[england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you are a suspect of **terrorism**, you can be kept for **up to 14 days** before you need to be either charged or released, [as Rick explains much better](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/84027/10334). **Generally, 24 hours or 96 hours for serious crimes**, starting at the arrest hours, apply.\n\n[european\\-union](/questions/tagged/european-union \"show questions tagged 'european-union'\")\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe EU has the [European Convention on Human Rights (Art. 5 III)](https://www.echr.coe.int/documents/convention_eng.pdf):\n\n> Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the\n> provisions of paragraph 1 (c) of this Article shall be brought\n> promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to\n> exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a\n> reasonable time or to release pending trial. Release may be\n> conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial.\n\nHowever, what is Promptly is dependant on what the countries implementing say it is. As an example, let's take a (closer) look at Germany.\n\n### [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\nWhile you can be in *investigative confinement* (Untersuchungshaft / U\\-Haft) for months or up to a year typically, you need to be already officially charged and a judge has to affirm you are in U\\-Haft. This decision that you need to be in confinement needs to be repeated regularily in case of long investigative confinements. This Investigative Confinement, \"Untersuchungshaft\", is defined in [STPO \u00a7112](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stpo/__112.html) (\\~process regulations for criminal trials), and *usually* is limited to about 6 months before the suspect is to be released or be at trial, but in extremely difficult cases it can be extended by special motion in the layer of Oberlandesgericht, which is about the highest state court. Still, while an extension to 9 or 12 months is possible, there can be cases where this may be extended even further, even if that might not be entirely correct on *other* grounds \\- there had been appeals to the European court for human rights about such.\n\nOn the other hand, once a trial starts and the court sees a flight risk or that you might pose a potential danger, you stay in (or are taken into) Untersuchungshaft for the duration of the trial. That is different from pre\\-trial Untersuchungshaft, in that you can't appeal on that your trial didn't start yet. In either case of Untersuchungshaft, any and all confinement is counted as time served, like the case of [Fritz Teufel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Teufel). In his case, his trial was seriously delayed and he was in Untersuchungshaft for 5 years **before** they convicted him to 5 years. In the end, he had already served all the due time due to the investigatory confinement, so he was released almost on the spot \\- just a little bit of paperwork and he was out..\n\nNow, that is all *court\\-ordered* confinement. How far can we get **without** the court? What does Germany count as *prompt*?\n\nSo, unless you have been put into investigative confinement by court order, **you have to be released at the end of the day after you were arrested**. End of the day is defined as midnight by the general rules. So if you were arrested Monday, 1st of January at 00:01, you are to be released on Tuesday, 2nd of January, 24:00\\. So, the absolute maximum confinement outside of the daylight\\-saving change day is 47 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds until you need to have been seen by a judge, but because it is nigh impossible to get to see a judge between 16:00 and 24:00, the typical confinement till you are formally charged and possibly transferred to Untersuchungshaft is usually less. On a mere technicality, there is **one** day a year where you might be confined twice from 2 AM to 3 AM, but that is also always a Sunday.",

If damage wasn't present at the beginning but is now present, that indicates (but doesn't prove) that you broke it.\n\nThe protocol should be factually correct, and ideally include photos of any relevant aspects (e.g. dirt, scratches). If there are disagreements, both standpoints should be noted. By signing you confirm that the protocol is correct, so you shouldn't sign if you think the protocol is too vague or misleading. It is not legally required to make or sign such a protocol, but when done correctly it protects both parties: it lets the landlord charge you as necessary to fix your damage, but also protects you from charges relating to things that were not listed as damaged in the protocol\n\nIn this case, it seems that no protocol was made at the start of the lease. This makes it difficult to prove \u2013 for either party \u2013 what you actually damaged. If you can't settle this between yourselves, the landlord would have to sue you. They have six months to file a lawsuit, so they can keep the deposit until these things are settled. But they should really provide an itemized bill of the actual costs. If there are no remaining disputes, courts sometimes require the deposit to be returned more quickly, e.g. within two or thee months.\n\nJust as the landlord can sue you, you can use the legal system to get your deposit back. The first step towards court collection proceedings would be to write a dunning letter in which you request repayment within some reasonable deadline (e.g. two weeks), and in which you note that the joint walkthrough of the flat did not show any damage that wasn't already there upon moving in. This should be sent via certified mail, not email. The landlord would then have to dispute the debt, otherwise you can go to a lawyer to help you request a court order.\n\nWhile the legal route might not be prohibitively expensive, it probably isn't worth the effort. Instead, make sure that the landlord has your current address so that you can communicate via mail instead of email (important so that you can react if they do try to sue you). Insist on an itemized bill. Offer to settle for some amount between what you really owe and what they claim \u2013 probably still cheaper than involving lawyers.\n\nThe Schufa is the German credit rating agency. Businesses and landlords notify Schufa when you don't pay your bills. To rent a flat in Germany, you are effectively required to have a clean Schufa report. In this case, the landlord doesnt' (yet) have grounds to report anything to Schufa because there is no undisputed debt. You can access the reports on your Schufa profile four times per year without cost via a GDPR data subject access request (*DSGVO\\-Anfrage*). You can dispute incorrect entries.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant is moving out of a rental property in Germany. The landlord claims there is damage to the property and wants the tenant to sign a document noting these damages. The tenant disputes these claims. What is the most appropriate course of action for the tenant in this situation?\n\nA) Sign the document to avoid potential legal issues, then dispute the claims later\nB) Refuse to sign the document and immediately file a lawsuit against the landlord\nC) Refuse to sign if the document is inaccurate, but offer to sign a corrected version that fairly represents the state of the property\nD) Ignore the landlord's requests and move out without any further communication\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct course of action is to refuse to sign if the document (\u00dcbergabeprotokoll) is inaccurate, but offer to sign a corrected version that fairly represents the state of the property. This approach aligns with the advice given in the documentation. It states that the protocol should be factually correct and that if there are disagreements, both standpoints should be noted. By refusing to sign an inaccurate document but showing willingness to sign a fair one, the tenant protects their interests while also demonstrating good faith. This approach also allows for the creation of a clear record, which can be beneficial if disputes arise later. Options A and D could potentially harm the tenant's position, while B (immediately filing a lawsuit) would be an unnecessary escalation at this stage."

Although we call ourselves as such, we are not legally married nor recognised as a couple.\n* We're living around 500 kilometres/311 miles away from each other, but we always call each other on Skype every week\\-end.\n* She's suffering heavy physical disability, which means she's sitting in a wheelchair and can't move much. Travelling requires a special car, as well as caregivers (or her parents) to provide cares when needed.\n* In France, apart from yourself, only a family member (or your legal partner) can fill a complaint about physical or verbal harassment. If you're a friend or an acquaintance, you can't do anything.\n* In France, if you're witnessing someone being in a dangerous situation (e.g. someone's getting mugged in an alley for example), you need to do what you can to help without putting yourself in danger (such as calling for help, or fighting if you believe you can save them). Otherwise, [you will be considered an accomplice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_to_rescue#France).\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nIn\\-depth story: \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e's father is an alcohol and drug addict. More than once, he pretended that he would get cured, when he actually didn't follow the instructions. \n\nWhen he's sober, he's quite calm (almost a decent man). But most of the time, he's drunk or drugged up (or both simultaneously). When he is, he would harass my fianc\u00e9e and his wife. It's mostly verbal harassment (calling them by names, insulting them, telling them how useless their effort is), although sometime he would physically harass my fianc\u00e9e too (although not sexually, but only her because she's stuck in a wheelchair). Once in a while (approximately once per month), she would call me on Skype, crying, morally broken, desperate. Sometime, I could hear him during our call session too. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e's mother called the police once, but all they did was keep him a few hours before releasing him because he wasn't much of a trouble. Then he kept doing what he's been doing all this time again. They didn't even bother meeting with my fianc\u00e9e, despite being one of the 2 victims. \n\nNow, my fianc\u00e9e has been thinking about filling a complaint more than once. However, because of her heavy physical disability, she can't go to the police station herself. Her mother isn't motivated enough to do so (I don't know why, maybe she ain't got the time; plus the father would stop them), and since they're living in the middle of nowhere, nobody can help them. \n\nWhen I told my law teacher about it, he told me I had to help her. Although I'm her fianc\u00e9, I can't fill a complaint for her either, because we're not legally recognised as a couple. Either she or her mother has to go to the police station, but: \n\n* She can't travel by herself.\n* Her mother can't leave her alone at home like that either.\n\nRight now, I'm a witness of what's happening, but so far there's nothing I was able to do to help them except looking for information (which isn't helpful). \n\nAm I an accomplice if I don't actually try to help? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are 500km away and you neither intend to do her harm, nor are you personally doing her harm. You are not an accomplice by any means. You may, appropriately, feel a moral obligation to do as much as you can to help, but not doing everything that you wish you could does not make you an accomplice.",

In this scenario, the fianc\u00e9 is not legally considered an accomplice and has no legal obligation to act. The duty to rescue in French law typically applies to situations where a person is physically present and witnessing an immediate danger. Being 500km away and not legally recognized as the victim's partner, the fianc\u00e9 is not bound by legal obligations to intervene. While he may feel a moral obligation to help, he is not legally required to do so under these circumstances. Options A, B, and D incorrectly suggest legal obligations that do not apply in this situation given the distance and lack of legal recognition of the relationship."

Yet, every once in a while, I hear people talk about something relating to how the police treated them, and the answer is, for the most part, consult your lawyer. This advice is commonly given when the police stop you and want you to give testimony (No, I'll have my lawyer submit my testimony) or if the police want to do anything strange (No, you cannot use my backyard as a stakeout. You can talk to my lawyer)\n\nI assume part of the reason that this advice is given so frequently is that the people giving the advice are lawyers and they feel that they are more important than they are and because they have a financial stake in getting people to talk to lawyers often.\n\nSo my basic questions are:\n\n* Should I find a lawyer to have on call?\n* Should I really consult a lawyer before voluntarily talking to the police?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It would not be a bad idea to think about what you would do if for example the police arrest you for some crime (it doesn't matter whether you did it), or if you are interrogated by government attorneys or police. If you are arrested, you will be given the opportunity to call an attorney. You do not give testimony when police ask you questions, you give testimony in court. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7o9xYp7eE) is a widely\\-known video explaining why you should never talk to the police, and you should watch that video (he recently wrote a book on the topic, *You Have the Right to Remain Innocent*). Then go into any interactions with the police apprised of the risks.\n\nSuppose you witness a robbery and the perps escape in a car: the police ask if you saw them, and where they went. You should not lie, because that is a crime. It would be good to help the police in this situation: is there any risk to you? Do they think maybe that you are involved in the crime? I think the relevant distinction is between being asked information questions, and being interrogated. If you are being interrogated, lawyer up. Even if you are free to go, they may still be interrogating you, and you may not know that when you are not being detained, you have to explicitly invoke your right to silence if they casually imply that you've committed a crime (this is the adoptive admissions thing, not widely known by non\\-law people). \n\nThe reason why many people advocate lawyering up is that the risks arising from not getting competent advice are high.

Like if a name is copyrighted and may get us in trouble or if it's fine to use?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Names cannot be copyrighted at all, in any country.\n\nThey can, however, be protected as trademarks.\n\nThe general idea is that if one uses a name to identify a product or service, or a creator of products or services, others cannot use the same or a similar name to identify their products or services in such a way that a reasonable person might be confused into thinking that the two came from the same source, or one was endorsed or approved by the other.\n\nTrademarks are limited in scope to a particular country, A name that is protected in Canada, say, will not be protected in the US unless steps have been taken to protect it there.\n\nIn some countries a trademark must be officially registered to get any protection, In others, such as the United States, merely using the mark can give a degree of protection, although registration give more protection.\n\nEach country maintains a trademark registry which can be searched for existing marks. There are search firms that will do such searches for a client, and also search for marks in use but not registered, for a fee.\n\nTrademark protection is generally restricted by the type of product or service involved. An anti\\-virus program, say, called \"Guard dog\" would probably not interfere with a fantasy game called \"Guardog\". A private security service of the same name would pretty surely not interfere.\n\nThe range of protection depends on how widely known the product is, but \"software related\" is a very wide area, and except for famous marks, a mark protected in connection with one area of software will not be protected in a very different area of software.\n\nNames that a purely invented, such as Kodak, are more strongly protected than descriptive marks such as \"Best Pizza\"\n\nParticularly famous names such as \"Microsoft\" get additional protection even outside their usual areas, so \"Microsoft Pizza\" might be a problem.\n\nLogos and other graphic marks can also be protected as trademarks, but that is not what the question asked about.\n\nThe styling of a trademark, such as a particular font, choice of colors, and so on, can also be protected. This is called \"trade dress\".\n\nA disclaimer making it clear that a somewhat similar name is not related, and the is no affiliation can help avoid avoid an infringement suit. For example:\n\n> Pear brand kites are in no way associated with, sponsored or approved by the makers of Pear smartphones.\n\nOn this site we cannot give specific legal advise, so we cannot evaluate whether a specific proposed trademark would or would not infringe an existing mark.\n\nIt might be well to consult an attorney with trademark experiences before finally choosing a name and doing marketing under it.",

Names cannot be copyrighted, but they can be protected as trademarks. The team should check trademark registries in relevant countries to see if \"Watchdogs\" or similar names are already trademarked for software or related products. Consulting a trademark attorney would be advisable to assess potential risks and ensure compliance with trademark laws.\n\nOption A is incorrect because names cannot be copyrighted.\n\nOption B is misleading because even if spelled differently, similar names can still potentially infringe on existing trademarks if they could cause confusion in the marketplace.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while a disclaimer can help, it does not guarantee protection against trademark infringement claims.

Developer will still own their old stuff, but Customer will have the right to use the old stuff, depending on the license terms. If the license is as in [your link](https://github.com/lawpatch/au-ip_license/blob/249478cd511a2ad08929d6aff10f95458601d0fc/au-license_ip_expansive.md), then it is forever (but this is a stub, so I assume that the license will be more specific and possibly restrictive). You retain all your rights to old stuff, customer will not pay royalties for the old stuff, and they can transfer or extend the license, or part of the license, to others.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is reviewing a contract from a potential client. The contract includes clauses about intellectual property rights. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the implications of these clauses?\n\nA) The client will own all intellectual property created by the developer, including work done before the contract.\nB) The developer retains ownership of all intellectual property, but grants the client a limited license to use it.\nC) The client will own new intellectual property created under the contract, while the developer retains ownership of pre-existing IP but grants the client an expansive license to use it.\nD) The developer transfers all intellectual property rights to the client, including background IP, with no retained rights.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the contract distinguishes between \"New IP\" and \"Background IP\". The client only gains ownership of the New IP.\nOption B is incorrect because while the developer does retain ownership of Background IP, they transfer ownership of New IP to the client, not just a license.\nOption C is correct. The contract states that the developer transfers ownership of New IP to the client, while retaining ownership of Background IP. However, the developer grants an expansive license to the client for the Background IP.\nOption D is incorrect because the developer explicitly retains ownership of Background IP, even though they grant an expansive license for its use."

This format is basically people forming a group and develop a game without any payment until a demo or the game itself is released. Usually this groups are not legally established as companies until the release of the game or if they get funds.\n\nIs there any type of document that could be used to protect someone's work in this type of scenarios? For example, a document that is signed by everyone on the group that explicitly describes what the distribution of work, which could be used if it is needed later on as a proof in any legal scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is there any type of document that could be used to protect someone's\n>  work in this type of scenarios?\n\n### Yes.\n\n It's called a contract. You don't have to have a business to have a contract between people. This particular type of contact is commonly referred to as a partnership agreement.\n\nYou can contract for just about anything you want, as long as it's not illegal. Draw one up and have everyone sign.\n\nBetter yet, if you have something to lose \\- like money, IP, etc. \\- get a lawyer to draw up the contract so you don't find yourself losing out from your own mistakes if you have to litigate the contract.\n\nSee [What is a contract and what is required for them to be valid?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6263/what-is-a-contract-and-what-is-required-for-them-to-be-valid)",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A group of indie game developers is planning to work together on a revenue-sharing basis without forming a legal company. Which of the following documents would be most appropriate and legally binding to protect each member's work and contributions?\n\nA) A verbal agreement among all team members\nB) A partnership agreement contract signed by all members\nC) A memorandum of understanding (MOU)\nD) A letter of intent (LOI)\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA partnership agreement contract signed by all members is the most appropriate and legally binding document in this scenario. The documentation explicitly states that a contract, specifically referred to as a partnership agreement, can be used to protect individuals' work in such situations. It doesn't require an established business entity and can outline the distribution of work, revenue sharing, and other important details. This type of contract is legally enforceable and can serve as proof in legal scenarios if needed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because verbal agreements, while sometimes considered contracts, are difficult to prove and enforce legally.\n\nOption C, a memorandum of understanding, is typically non-binding and used more for outlining general principles of an agreement rather than specific, enforceable terms.\n\nOption D, a letter of intent, is usually used to express preliminary commitment to a deal but is not as comprehensive or binding as a full contract.\n\nThe partnership agreement (Option B) provides the most protection and clarity for all parties involved in the indie game development project."
