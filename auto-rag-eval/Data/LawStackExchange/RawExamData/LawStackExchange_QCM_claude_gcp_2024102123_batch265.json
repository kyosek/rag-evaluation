The penalty that may be imposed upon breach of the new section 5A restraining order is identical to that which can be imposed under section 5\\. (*Emphasis added*)\n\nIn Item 2 of the first source (darlingtons.com) it says:\n\n> If a person disobeys the terms of an Order of Court which carries a penal notice, he will have breached the Injunction. As to whether such a breach constitutes contempt, will be considered on a case\\-by case approach according to the particular facts of the given case. The seriousness of the breach, and the question as to whether such action undermined or \u2018laughed in the face of the Court Order\u2019 so as to be contemptuous, will be determined by the Court.\n\nIn item three of this same source it says:\n\n> If the Court considers that the breach was intended to impede or prejudice the administration of justice, the Court has power to commit a person to prison, and/or impose a fine.\n\nIn short it appears that the court is expected to use judgement on a case\\-by\\-case basis. Violation of a restraining order because the person subject to the order had to provide emergency medical or fire or rescue services, or otherwise provide needed assistance in an emergency, with no improper motive, would, I should think, not lead to any penalty for contempt.\n\nUS practice also expects a court to exercise judgement when sentencing for contempt.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a person violates a restraining order to provide emergency medical assistance to the protected individual, which of the following is most likely to be the legal outcome?\n\nA) The person will automatically be found guilty of contempt of court and face the maximum penalty.\n\nB) The court will dismiss the violation entirely without any consideration of the circumstances.\n\nC) The court will evaluate the specific circumstances of the case, likely considering the violation as having a \"reasonable excuse.\"\n\nD) The person will be required to pay a fine but will not face any potential jail time.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, courts are expected to use judgment on a case-by-case basis when considering violations of restraining orders or injunctions. The sources indicate that a \"reasonable excuse\" can be considered when evaluating a breach, and that courts will look at the seriousness of the breach and whether it was intended to impede justice.\n\nA is incorrect because the sources clearly state that automatic guilt and maximum penalties are not the norm. Courts consider the specific circumstances of each case.\n\nB is incorrect because while the court may be lenient in cases of emergency assistance, they still evaluate the circumstances rather than dismissing the violation outright.\n\nD is incorrect because it presents a specific outcome without considering the court's discretion. The sources indicate that courts have the power to impose fines, imprisonment, or both, depending on the circumstances.\n\nIn a case where emergency medical assistance was provided, it's likely the court would consider this a \"reasonable excuse\" and evaluate the circumstances carefully before making a judgment."

Return to Sender.\" and handed it back to the postal service to be returned.\n\nIf you were asked to sign for the letter, ideally you would check that it is not addressed to you (or anyone else now at your residence) and refuse to sign, but it is easy to overlook that at the moment a letter is presented to you. And sometimes certified mail is delivered without obtaining the signature of any resident.\n\nIf, however, the envelope had your name on it, you were entitled to open it, and are not bound by any confidentiality statements in the cover letter, assuming that you had no previous relationship with the sender. You may well choose to respect them, but you cannot be legally bound unless you accepted such an obligation at some point, usually in a contract of some sort. If you did have a confidential relationship with the sender, then its terms would normally control, whatever they might be.\n\nYou could prepare an envelope addressed to the sender, enclose the document, and mail it back to the sender. You could optionally add a short cover letter explaining how you received the document. If the envelope was addressed to some other person, this would, I think, be the best thing to do. If the document was addressed to you, this is totally optional, you could legally just discard the document and forget about it, and you can probably legally read it and do whatever you like about the contents. But as the answer by gnasher729 points out, returning it would be the nice thing. As the comment by Makyen points out, you may wish to retain evidence of what was received.\n\nOne sided confidentially statements on letters or faxes are not legally effective in the absence of some prior or current relationship or agreement to be bound in confidence.",

While John is not legally bound by the confidentiality notice (as he has no prior relationship with the sender), returning the document is the most responsible course of action. It respects the intended confidentiality, alerts the sender to their mistake, and avoids any potential legal complications. Option A is incorrect because although John could legally read the document, it's not the most appropriate action. Option B is unnecessary and may prevent the sender from correcting their error. Option D is incorrect because John is not legally bound by the confidentiality notice in this situation."

Improper Use of Flags or Military Emblems, Insignia or Uniforms of the Adversary](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_nz_rule62):\n\n> According to custom, it is permissible for a belligerent warship to use false colours and to disguise her outward appearance in other ways in order to deceive an enemy, provided that prior to going into action the warship shows her true colours. Aircraft are not, however, enentitled to use false markings.\n\nFrom [false flag Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag#cite_ref-9)\n\n> In land warfare, such operations are generally deemed acceptable under certain circumstances, such as to deceive enemies, provided the deception is not perfidious and that all such deceptions are discarded before opening fire upon the enemy. Similarly, in naval warfare such a deception is considered permissible, provided the false flag is lowered and the true flag raised before engaging in battle.\n\nWhat happened:\n==============\n\nSokka a member of the water nation defended against an attack by the fire nation. During such defense, Sokka was in a hot air balloon that had the fire nation insignia. Sokka did not change to water nation flag or anything before counter\\-attacking.\n\nQuestion:\n=========\n\nDid Sokka commit the war crime of false flag, assuming our laws applied? Or did Sokka commit some other war crime for such actions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n\nAssuming both the Fire Nation and Water Tribes are signatories to the Geneva conventions, the rules only apply to uniformed members of the signatory member nations. Such as the water tribes have uniformed members, Sokka is not (at least not at this time, as its shown that Southern Water Tribe warriors use black and white face paint when in battle and Sokka does don this paint prior to going into key battles. Additionally, the Mechanist is more likely the \"pilot\" of the balloon and has no uniform that ties him to any Nation's military. Additionally, neither is acting under apparent orders from a higher ranking member of a foreign military. All involved look to be refugees and travelers trying to keep away from the military and would be subject to the Fire Nation Criminal Justice System\n\n(In the Fire Nation Criminal Justice System, the people are represented by two separate but equal entities: The military, who capture enemies of the Fire Lord, and the Crematorium who prosecutes them.

Sokka's actions were permissible because he was not a uniformed member of any military and was acting as a civilian. The rules regarding false flags and military deception typically apply to uniformed members of signatory nations to international conventions like the Geneva Conventions. Sokka, at this point in the story, was not acting as an official representative of the Water Tribe military, nor was he in uniform. He and his companions were essentially civilians or refugees trying to defend themselves. Additionally, they were not acting under orders from any military authority. In this context, their use of a Fire Nation balloon would not constitute a war crime under international law as we understand it. The other options are incorrect because they either mischaracterize Sokka's actions as definite war crimes (A and C) or overgeneralize about the permissibility of false flags in warfare (D)."

There are two basic tests: Does the person have a disability, and do they have a disability\\-related need for a service animal? (It *is* allowed to request documentation of the claimed need for an animal, but not e.g. to inquire about the underlying reasons, thus a doctor could just write a note saying \"Smith needs his ferret\". Also, it is only allowed to ask for documentation if the provider does not already know, or cannot readily tell that the conditions exist). Assuming \"yes\" to both questions, the housing provider must \"modify or provide an exception to a 'no pets' rule or policy\". This is mildly confusing because HUD also declares that a service animal is not a pet, so what they must mean is that any policy excluding animals, including but not limited to pets, must be overridden. The \"exception\" holds\n\n> in all areas of the premises where persons are normally allowed to go,\n>  unless doing so would impose an undue financial and administrative\n>  burden or would fundamentally alter the nature of the housing\n>  provider's services.\n\nDenial of the exception is also allowed if:\n\n> 1:*the specific assistance animal* in question poses a direct threat\n>  to the health or safety of others that cannot be reduced or eliminated\n>  by another reasonable accommodation\n> \n> \n> 2:*the specific assistance animal* in question would cause substantial\n>  physical damage to the property of others that cannot be reduced or\n>  eliminated by another reasonable accommodation\n\nThere also cannot be any deposit required for a service animal.\n\nIt is noted that the Department of Justice has separate definitions, so pertaining to the ADA (DOJ's bailiwick), only a dog (or by a separate provision, trained miniature horses) can be a service animal, and this excludes emotional support animals.

One tenant, who has a documented disability, requests to keep an emotional support cat in their private bedroom, despite the landlord's no-pets policy. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the landlord's obligations under the Fair Housing Act?\n\nA) The landlord must allow the cat only if it's a trained service animal, not an emotional support animal.\nB) The landlord can deny the request if other tenants object to having a cat in the shared living space.\nC) The landlord must allow the cat in the tenant's private bedroom and all common areas, unless it poses a direct threat to health or safety that cannot be mitigated.\nD) The landlord can require an additional pet deposit to cover potential damages caused by the cat.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the HUD guidelines based on the Fair Housing Act, landlords must make reasonable accommodations for assistance animals, including emotional support animals, even in no-pets properties. The animal must be allowed in all areas where the tenant is normally permitted, unless it poses a direct threat to health or safety or would cause substantial property damage that cannot be mitigated through reasonable accommodations. The landlord cannot charge an additional deposit for the assistance animal. While other tenants' preferences are not grounds for denial, the landlord could potentially restrict the cat to the tenant's private bedroom if allowing it in common areas would fundamentally alter the nature of the housing services or impose an undue burden."

When returning an item, the customer is responsible for ensuring that the company actually receives the return. The typical way to do this is by using tracking and insurance on the shipment.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know plenty of friends who have allowed their kids to leave their bikes in the front yard. I'm wondering what would happen if a random child were to steal a bike left out and get hurt playing with it. Would the parents be liable due to the [attractive nuisance doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractive_nuisance_doctrine)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: According to Cornell's LII page on [\"Attractive Nuisance Doctrine\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/attractive_nuisance_doctrine) the doctrine or concept is:\n\n> A doctrine in tort law under which a landowner may be liable for injuries to children who trespass on land if the injury results from a hazardous object or condition on the land that is likely to attract children who are unable to appreciate the risk posed by the object or condition.\n\nThe injury or danger must be reasonably foreseeable to the property owner, but not apparent to a child likely to be attracted to the dangerous object or condition. The object or condition must be such as to attract children likely to be put in danger. An uncovered swimming pool or a disused refrigerator are classic examples of an attractive nuisance\n\nA bicycle would not usually constitute an object of danger to a trespassing child that the child was unable to understand or foresee. A child able to climb on and operate the bicycle is probably aware enough to foresee the ordinary dangers of riding a bicycle. But much would depend on the exact facts of the case. If there was some circumstance that made use of a bicycle more risky than usual, that might alter the decision.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nAccording to [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractive_nuisance_doctrine)\n\n> The attractive nuisance doctrine emerged from case law in England, starting with *Lynch v. Nurdin* in 1841\\. In that case, an opinion by Lord Chief Justice Thomas Denman held that the owner of a cart left unattended on the street could be held liable for injuries to a child who climbed onto the cart and fell. The doctrine was first applied in the United States in [*Sioux City \\& Pacific Railroad Co. v. Stout* 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 657 (1873\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City_%26_Pacific_Railroad_Co._v._Stout), an 1873 case from Nebraska in which a railroad company was held liable for injuries to a child who climbed onto an unsecured railway turntable. The term \"attractive nuisance\" was first used in 1875 in *Keffe v. Milwaukee \\& St. Paul Railway Co.*, a Minnesota case. The doctrine has since been adopted in some other common law jurisdictions, such as Canada, but not universally.\n\nConditions\n----------\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article listed above, quoting the *Restatement of Torts (second)* \u00a7339, an attractive nuisance is an **artificial** hazard which meets all of the following conditions. Natural hazards, such as lakes, do not fit the rule:\n\n> * The place where the condition exists is one on which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and\n> * The condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily harm to such children,\n> * The children, because of their youth, do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in inter\\-meddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it,\n> * The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and\n> * The possessor fails to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children.\n\nSome US jurisdictions, such as Maryland, do not follow this rule.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner has an old, rusty playground set in their unfenced backyard. The set includes a broken swing and a slide with sharp edges. A 6-year-old child from the neighborhood enters the yard without permission, uses the playground equipment, and gets severely injured. Under the attractive nuisance doctrine, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The homeowner is not liable because the child was trespassing.\nB) The homeowner is automatically liable due to the presence of playground equipment.\nC) The homeowner may be liable if all conditions of the attractive nuisance doctrine are met.\nD) The homeowner is only liable if they were present when the injury occurred.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The attractive nuisance doctrine may hold the homeowner liable if all required conditions are met. These conditions include:\n1. The homeowner knows or should know children are likely to trespass.\n2. The condition (playground) poses an unreasonable risk of harm to children.\n3. Children, due to their age, don't understand the risk.\n4. The burden of eliminating the danger is slight compared to the risk.\n5. The homeowner failed to exercise reasonable care to eliminate the danger.\n\nA is incorrect because trespassing alone doesn't exempt the homeowner from liability under this doctrine. B is too absolute; mere presence of equipment doesn't automatically create liability. D is incorrect because the homeowner's presence at the time of injury is not a factor in the doctrine."

All of the articles are extremely vague and don't explain exactly when it becomes illegal. Is there any direct source or any laws with numbers? Is it one transaction over $10,000 that's illegal, or anything adding up to $10,000 or just whoever the police feel like arresting that's selling a lot.

Did you commit a crime if you sell bitcoin to someone and the money is stolen, or the gift cards are stolen? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> When does it become illegal to exchange bitcoin for cash?\n\nWhen the transaction purposefully skips the controls in place regarding anti\\-money laundering.\n\nGenerally speaking, the issue is not the mere involvement of cryptocurrency in a transaction, but the crimes a wrongdoer seeks to camouflage or conceal by means of cryptocurrencies. Such crimes typically involve money laundering, identity theft, stolen card numbers, and the like. As quoted in [one of the links](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/how-a-canadian-was-charged-with-money-laundering-in-sale-of-bitcoins/article16831445/) you provide, \"*\\[t]he use of bitcoins in the transactions is a new technological flourish to this very old crime*\".\n\n> Is there any direct source or any laws with numbers?\n\nApropos of your first link, mentioning that \"*a Florida judge threw out money transmitting charges against a bitcoiner*\" (see also [here](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article91682102.html)), I will point out that the court's dismissal of charges against that defendant has been reversed early this year. See [*State v. Espinoza*, 264 So.3d 1055 (2019\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inflco20190130174).\n\nAlthough the judges' narratives of a case are questionable and/or sloppy and to be taken with a grain of salt, the appellate decision cites language from Florida legislation as applicable to virtual currencies (and, impliedly, cryptocurrencies). You will notice that the focus in the *Espinoza* decision is the interpretation of Florida Statutes in its sections 560\\.125(1\\) and (5\\)(a) (regarding unauthorized vendors), and [560\\.103](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=&URL=0500-0599/0560/Sections/0560.103.html)(21\\), (29\\) (defining *monetary value* as \"*a medium of exchange, whether or not redeemable in currency*\").\n\nAs usual, each legislation may present subtle and/or fundamental variations. For instance, the court in *Espinoza at 1065* identified that federal law is inapplicable there in that 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 1010\\.100(ff)(5\\)(i)(A) contemplates that \"*the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency **to another location or person** by any means*\" (emphasis added), and Espinoza's transaction(s) did not involve a third party. By contrast, the Florida statute does not allude to third parties in that transmission of monetary value, hence preventing the statutory sanctions from being *preemptively* foreclosed in the matter of Espinoza.\n\n> What about when someone buys with stolen money or money from illegal proceeds. Did you commit a crime if you sell bitcoin to someone and the money is stolen, or the gift cards are stolen?\n\nThat also depends on the jurisdiction and the facts of the case. In *Espinoza*, he was allegedly informed that the cash he received (or was about to receive) in exchange for bitcoins \"*derived from engaging in illegal activity and that \\[the buyer] was planning to use the bitcoins to engage in further illegal activity*\", *Espinoza at 1058*. The court highlighted the State's argument that \"*dismiss\\[ing] a charge of money laundering is improper because money laundering requires **intent***\" (emphasis added), which is sanctioned by section 896/101(3\\)(c).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under Florida law, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered illegal money transmission involving cryptocurrencies?\n\nA) A person occasionally sells small amounts of Bitcoin to friends for cash, without any knowledge of the cash's source.\n\nB) A registered money services business conducts large Bitcoin transactions with proper documentation and compliance measures.\n\nC) An individual regularly exchanges large amounts of Bitcoin for cash, aware that the cash comes from illegal activities, without proper licensing or registration.\n\nD) A person mines Bitcoin and occasionally sells it on a regulated exchange for personal profit.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct answer because it aligns most closely with the legal issues discussed in the State v. Espinoza case. The scenario involves regular, large transactions without proper licensing, and knowledge that the cash comes from illegal activities. This situation would likely violate Florida Statutes sections 560.125(1) and (5)(a) regarding unauthorized vendors, and potentially implicate money laundering laws.\n\nOption A involves small, occasional transactions without knowledge of illegal activity, which is less likely to trigger legal issues.\n\nOption B describes a properly registered and compliant business, which would be operating legally.\n\nOption D involves personal Bitcoin mining and selling on a regulated exchange, which is generally considered a legal activity.\n\nThe key factors in determining illegality are the scale of operations, lack of proper licensing, and knowledge of or intent to facilitate illegal activities, as highlighted in the Espinoza case and related Florida statutes."

However, there seems to be a contradiction between 'without prior notification' and 'on a day significant to that group'.

As per the information provided, religious rites have no specific significance in English law, and the broadcast could potentially be considered a nuisance. However, the local council, specifically an Environmental Health Officer, would need to balance the rights of the religious organization with those of other residents.

The decision would take into account factors such as the frequency of the broadcast, its duration, volume, and impact on the community.

I can imagine two situations in which costs and benefits are such that the tenant might have good reason to reject your offer: \n\n1\\) Suppose the MRC (the tenant) had already made improvements to the property. It expected to recoup the cost of those improvements over the life of the lease. If it simply walks away from the lease, it will lose some of the money it invested in those improvements. \n\n2\\) Hughes, the landlord, *does not* own all of the rights to his property. Because of the lease, the MRC owns the right to use the property for the term of the lease. This right is valuable \u2014 that is why the MRC is willing to pay for it. Depending on how valuable that right is, the MRC might balk at simply giving this valuable property away for free. \n\nAssuming the lease prevents the MRC from subletting the property, then MRC and Hughes are stuck having to deal with each other. Bargaining in these situations is notoriously difficult. The only threat each side has is that it will insist on carrying out the terms of the lease. In many situations, as the OP suggests, such threats will not be credible. \n\n**Note:** Answer \\# 2 illustrates the old saying that property is like a bundle of sticks, with each stick representing control over some aspect of the property. In most cases, no one person owns all of the sticks in the bundle. Instead, rights to control various aspects are held by different people. For example, my neighbors may \"own\" the right to drive across \"my\" property to get to their garage through an easement. The city may \"own\" the right to decide what sort of building I can put on the property through zoning. My neighbors may *effectively* \"own\" the right to my view, since they can let their trees block it (although this right may be limited by ordinances about blocking views, etc.). And so on.",

Option A is correct because tenants often make improvements to leased property and expect to benefit from those over the lease term. Option B is correct as it recognizes that a lease gives the tenant valuable property rights. Option C is correct as it acknowledges the constraints of the lease terms that force direct negotiation. All these factors combined (D) explain why the Railway Company might have been reluctant to simply end the lease without compensation, making D the most comprehensive and correct answer."

Of course, most employment contracts are \"at will\" so a breach of contract often isn't necessary to terminate employment.\n\n> Does my employer's updating the handbook constitute a unilateral\n>  change of contract?\n\nIt depends upon what is changed in the update to the handbook. \n\nTypically an employment contract would have a term that says something to the effect of \"employee shall devote his full time effort to perform the duties he is directed to perform by employer in a satisfactory manner.\"\n\nIf the employee handbook says, \"part of every employee's duties includes cleaning up his work area at the close of business each day, locking his file cabinets and shutting down his computer\", this would typically simply be a definition of the duties of the employee which the employer reserved the right to change in the original employment contract, and not a unilateral change of contract.\n\nOn the other hand, if the employee handbook says, \"vacation days may not be taken during December\" when the employee's contract simply said that \"you have ten vacation days per year\", that might constitute a unilateral change of contract which might not be enforceable for an employee with a fixed term of employment who was not an employee at will, without additional consideration.\n\n> Locale is UK but (I assume) contract law is pretty universal so\n>  answers specific to any region are welcome.\n\nI have answered based upon general contract and employment law, but the UK frequently sets mandatory standards for different kinds of contracts and modifies common law rules related to contracts (much more so than the U.S.), so it wouldn't be very surprising if this were modified by a statute of which I am not aware.\n\nWe have UK lawyers who contribute to Law.SE and they can chime in if there are particular statutes in the UK that apply to this question.",

Her employment contract states that she must adhere to the rules set out in the company handbook. The handbook is updated annually. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of the handbook in relation to Sarah's employment contract?\n\nA) Any violation of the handbook rules automatically constitutes a breach of contract, regardless of the nature of the rule.\n\nB) The company can unilaterally change any terms of Sarah's employment by updating the handbook, including salary and benefits.\n\nC) The handbook is not legally binding and Sarah cannot be held accountable for violating its rules.\n\nD) The handbook may be considered an extension of the contract, but the legal implications of updates depend on the nature of the changes made.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The handbook can be considered an extension of the employment contract when the contract explicitly requires adherence to it. However, not all changes to the handbook necessarily constitute a unilateral change to the contract. \n\nChanges that merely clarify or define existing duties outlined in the contract (such as specifying work procedures) are typically enforceable. However, significant changes that alter fundamental terms of employment (like modifying agreed-upon benefits) may be considered unilateral contract changes and might not be enforceable without additional consideration, especially for employees with fixed-term contracts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all handbook violations may rise to the level of a contract breach. Option B is too broad, as the company cannot unilaterally change fundamental terms like salary through handbook updates. Option C is incorrect because the handbook can have legal implications when incorporated into the contract by reference."

In legal drafting, when listing multiple prohibited rights after a \"not,\" using \"and\" can potentially create ambiguity. The \"not\" is intended to apply to all listed items, but \"and\" in a negative context could be misinterpreted as only prohibiting the combination of actions, not each action individually. \n\nUsing \"or\" instead of \"and\" in this context is clearer and more standard in legal writing. It ensures that each listed right is individually prohibited. For example, \"They shall not confer the right to attend any meeting of members or to exercise one vote for every share held\" is less ambiguous than using \"and.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the \"not\" is intended to apply to both rights. Option B is incorrect because while the \"not\" does apply to both, the use of \"and\" is not ideal and can create ambiguity. Option D, while potentially clear, is not the most efficient or standard way to express the prohibition in legal drafting."

Just because the facts turn out that a particular offence would not or could not be completed, that does not preclude a conviction for an attempt. See *United States of America v. Dynar*, [\\[1997] 2 SCR 462](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1526/index.do):\n\n> > For example, A may take possession of property believing it to have been stolen when it has not been; B may smuggle a substance for reward believing it to be a narcotic when it is sugar.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> There is no legally relevant difference between the pickpocket who reaches into the empty pocket and the man who takes his own umbrella from a stand believing it to be some other person\u2019s umbrella.

I find that a reasonable, properly instructed jury could find Mr. Sandhu guilty of attempted trafficking in controlled substances.\n\nActual trafficking\n------------------\n\nIf in the course of events, the accused made, and intended to make, an *offer* to sell a controlled substance, that on its own would be the offence of trafficking. *R. v. Mamchur*, [\\[1978] 4 WWR 481](https://canlii.ca/t/g7hr1) (Sask. C.A.); *R. v. Murdock* (2003\\), [176 CCC (3d) 232](https://canlii.ca/t/6mdj) (Ont. C.A.); *R. v.

There is no need to prove both the intent to make the offer to sell and the intent to carry out the offer: ... See also, e.g., *R. v. Sherman* (1977\\), [36 C.C.C.

Attempted trafficking: Even though the substance was not actually cocaine, the person believed they were selling a controlled substance. As per the case law cited (e.g., United States of America v. Dynar), an attempt to commit a crime can still be prosecuted even if the crime could not have been completed due to facts unknown to the accused.\n\n2. Potential fraud charges: If it can be proven that the accused knew they were selling baking soda as cocaine, this would constitute fraud under Section 380 of the Criminal Code, as they used deceit to defraud others of money or property.\n\n3. Not just fraud: Answer A is incorrect because the attempted trafficking charge would still apply due to the accused's belief and intent.\n\n4. Not full trafficking: Answer B is incorrect because the substance was not actually a controlled substance, so a full trafficking charge wouldn't apply.\n\n5. Not no charges: Answer D is incorrect because criminal liability still exists for the attempt and potential fraud, even without actual narcotics involved.\n\nThis question tests understanding of criminal intent (mens rea), attempted crimes, and the interaction between drug laws and fraud in Canadian criminal law."

One of the defining characteristics of modern business is selling digital products online, but obviously there are problems with legal protection on that front as it is newer legal territory. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not looking to hire a lawyer or get some kind of formal legal advice, but rather to find the right direction and a proper precedent for people facing this situation. Specifically, what is the best license agreement that allows any random person off the street to be legally protected when licensing purely digital content over the internet? \n\nWhat I mean is, say a business owner or sole proprietor wants to license a digital file, like a picture or audio file so that the buyer can use it to make and sell their own games, videos, commercials and freelance work, educational purposes, presentations, or really anything else that uses multimedia. But, the creator of the original digital product obviously doesn't want a buyer to simply start selling or distributing the individual files themselves or as a collection of files, they original creator or organization wants to retain their rights while preventing the buyers from selling specifically the files or modified versions of the files while allowing the buyers the utility to make commercial end\\-products with it. What kind of terms of use, in a simple text document, can be provided to ensure this with a product download? And does such a text document actually create any binding agreement in the first place? \n\nI would hope someone who has studied this or has experience with this matter could point me in the right direction so that I can convey it to designers and students alike. \nYou can use microsoft word, but you can't sell microsoft word or any of its components or reverse engineer it. What kind of agreement is the equivalent of that but for digital media files? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The problem is stating exactly what you want to license versus forbid. You indicate that you want to prohibit resale of unchanged copies of the work, so you could include a license condition that forbids the sale of the unmodified work, but allows the sale of a derivative work. That would mean that the person can't just re\\-sell copies of the original image file, but that can package it with other works and sell a derivative work, or change the formal from GIF to JPG, or add a border around the file, and sell the derivative work. But that doesn't seem to be strong enough.\n\nIt's not clear what distinction you are drawing between forbidding the sale of \"the files or modified versions of the files\", but allowing \"the utility to make commercial end\\-products with it\". In order to \"use\" the material, you are copying it and transforming it in some way. You might be able to craft language in a specific license to use a high\\-resolution digital representation of a unicorn, which allows a certain free use of copies with a certain level of degradation, such as 5% of the original resolution and limited to 8 bit color. There is no general license that covers all such cases, because we don't know what cases are in versus out. The rights\\-holder needs to figure out what they want protected, and then hire a competent attorney to draft the license.",

The rights-holder needs to clearly define what they want protected and what uses they want to allow.

There has also been a verdict in a German court according to which embedding Google Fonts (loaded from Google servers) requires such consent, because the IP address is shared with Google. So website operators can either ask for consent or serve the fonts from their own server instead.\n\nBut, what if my entire site is hosted at Google? Obviously Google receives the visitors' IP addresses starting with the very first HTTP request and I get no chance to ask them for permission BEFORE that happens. There are plenty of hosting options inside the EU. Let us assume that my site is static and could be hosted on any one of them, so I can make no argument for choosing Google specifically.\n\n* Am I even allowed to use Google for hosting my site?\n* Does it make a difference whether I inform the visitor (after the processing of their IP has already happened)?\n* IF it is OK, can I then use Google Fonts without consent, because Google has already seen the visitor's IP anyway?\n\nSide note: These seem like really weird questions to ask, but after following some GDPR debates about Google Fonts and even basic things like HTTPd access logs, nothing seems quite certain anymore.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When you use other services, the question is whether that service acts as an independent data controller, or as a data processor who only uses the data on your behalf. When engaging a data processor they must be legally bound to only use the data on your behalf, for example with a contract / data processing agreement (DPA). See Art 28 GDPR.\n\nData processor status is attractive because processors are seen as an extension of the controller. In contrast, when sharing data with other controllers you would need a separate legal basis to authorize this sharing.\n\nGoogle offers tons of different services, so this question needs to be considered on a case by case basis. For Google Cloud services or Google Workplace, Google generally acts as a data processor. For other services, Google acts as a controller. Notably, Google Fonts does not offer a DPA so that you cannot claim they're acting as a processor in that context, regardless of what other Google services you use.\n\nAn equally important problem when using Google services is the data transfer problem. Google is controlled from the US, but the US do not offer an adequate level of data protection (see the Schrems II judgement). Comparatively few Google services allow you to select where the servers are located, as to prevent transfers of personal data to countries where privacy cannot be guaranteed. For example, this is why Google Analytics (GA) is problematic. Google acts as a data processor for basic GA features but makes no promises about the location of servers. Thus, using GA implies a (probably) illegal transfer of personal data to the US.",

Google can act as a data processor for its cloud services, which requires a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) as per Article 28 of GDPR. Additionally, selecting EU-based servers helps mitigate the data transfer problem highlighted in the Schrems II judgment, which raised concerns about transferring personal data to the US. \n\nOption A is incorrect because using Google Cloud Platform doesn't automatically make a website non-compliant; it depends on how it's implemented. \n\nOption B is insufficient, as merely informing visitors doesn't address the legal requirements for data processing and transfer under GDPR. \n\nOption D is incorrect because GDPR applies to businesses of all sizes that process EU residents' personal data, not just large companies."

[This article](https://tlblog.org/multistate-defamation-cross-border-torts-and-choice-of-law/) touches on such considerations in transnational defamation.\n\nWhether or not some specific content rises to the level of defamation depends on the actual facts (was there plagiarism, which is not a legally\\-defined category unlike copyright infringement), and the choice of law.",

The fact that the parties are in different countries does not bar a lawsuit, but it does raise questions about which jurisdiction's laws should apply and where the case should be tried. The EU does not have a uniform rule for such cases, and the choice of law can significantly impact the outcome. The location of the publishing platform (in this case, the US) adds another layer of complexity but does not necessarily determine where the case must be tried. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they oversimplify the situation or make absolute statements that are not supported by the given information."

Writing software that breaks a law or a TOS is not itself always illegal. Buying and selling personal and financial information is not always illegal, depending on the location of the server and the jurisdiction over the owners of the site. The TOS of a site can be simply boilerplate that the site owner can invoke at their discretion; and since a TOS is a contract, it cannot contract for anything that is illegal.\n\nGood examples are the sometimes convoluted legal histories and attempted or successful takedowns of such sites as [The Pirate Bay \\- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay) and [Silk Road (marketplace) \\- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)).

As explained in the documentation, several factors come into play:\n\n1. Copyright infringement issues related to stolen or cracked accounts and software.\n2. Laws regarding personal information and theft, which can vary by jurisdiction.\n3. National and international jurisdictional concerns, as the location of the server and the website owners can affect which laws apply.\n4. Prosecutorial discretion, which involves assessing the likelihood of a successful investigation and prosecution.\n\nThe website's claim of neutrality and its Terms of Service do not automatically protect it (ruling out option B), nor does it make the site immediately liable for all user actions (ruling out option A). While individual users may face legal consequences, the website itself is not necessarily immune from legal action (ruling out option D).\n\nThe complexity of such cases is exemplified by the legal histories of sites like The Pirate Bay and Silk Road, which have faced various legal challenges and takedown attempts.

The student receives a weekly allowance from their father but has never had a paying job or filed taxes. In this scenario, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the student's eligibility for indigent defense services?\n\nA) The student should report their weekly allowance as income on the application.\nB) The student qualifies as indigent because they have no formal employment or tax records.\nC) The student's personal income is irrelevant; the parents' income determines eligibility.\nD) The student should be automatically eligible for indigent defense services due to their age and student status.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In this case, the student's personal income (weekly allowance) is not considered relevant for determining eligibility for indigent defense services. Instead, because the student is a dependent of their father, it is the parents' income that needs to be reported and will be used to determine eligibility. The fact that the father can afford to send the student to university and provide an allowance suggests that the family income may be too high to qualify for indigent defense services. The student's lack of personal income, employment history, or tax records does not automatically qualify them for these services. The allowance is not considered income in this context, and the student's age and status as a university student do not guarantee eligibility for indigent defense services."

When my girlfriend dropped my cat off she said there were two medium to large sized dogs that were barking very loudly and freely roaming the small building.\n\nShe did not feel very comfortable leaving the cat at the groomer but since we'd paid up front so ultimately decided to follow through. When I arrived to pick him up I had a similar experience, the dogs were running around freely and barking constantly.\n\nThe dogs belonged to the owner. They were making so much noise and acting so wild that she decided to let them out. She let them outside with no leash and within a minute they attacked a smaller dog that was being walked on the sidewalk. Her dog picked the smaller dog up, shook it, and threw it.\n\nWhen she came back in, we confronted her about the situation. We came here so that our cat could be groomed in a less stressful environment and there were two untrained dogs wildly running around and barking. Dogs that clearly demonstrated on another dog what they would do to my cat if they had the chance.

Do I need to go state\\-by\\-state to find a state\\-specific database, or is there a better way? I'm finding this not to be straightforward at all \\- very unlike searching federal law and legislation. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is inherently and intrinsically harder to search the laws of 50 states and compare them than it is to review a single body of federal law.\n\nAlso, case law and statute law, are researched quite differently, even though they can cover the same topics. Word searches work well for some kinds of case law issues, but poorly for statutes and regulations. Some issues, however, are hard to research with word searches, even if they involve case law.\n\nWestlaw codes the important legal holdings of every published case in categories based upon their \"key\" system which has a subject\\-matter based digest of all case law. If you find one case with a key code that is on point, you can search all 50 states for that.\n\nThe \"Restatements of Law\" (e.g. Restatement of Contracts, Restatement of Torts) purports to be a summary of the majority common law rules in the named subject area, although it often reflects the lead author and supporting drafting committee's view on the \"better rule\" rather than the majority rule. These are very influential and often cited by courts in states where there is no case law on point. Some have been updated several times to reflect changes in the common law over time in different subject areas (e.g. the original Restatement of Contracts favored form over substances in a way that the later version do not). The American Bar Association signs off on these before they are published.\n\nThe National Conference of State Legislatures promulgates \"Uniform\" and \"Model\" acts that states may adopt with or without amendment and tracks which states have adopted them and with what modifications.\n\nMost areas of law are the subject of legal treatises that make comprehensive 50 state summaries of relevant case law, one or two of which are typically the \"leading treaties\" and widely used and relied upon.\n\nMany law review articles will do summaries of as many states' laws as possible on a given issue.\n\nMany lobbying and special interest groups and also nolo.com prepare 50 state summaries. A good, reasonably up to date and accurate source on many topics is Wikipedia.\n\nUltimately, all secondary sources rely on somebody digging through state statutes in every state, analyzing them and coding them accurately, usually with citations to the source material. In fast changing areas of law this can be tricky, since laws of the same subject could be codified in different kinds of places (e.g. one might put something in a criminal code, while another might put it in a public health code or a regulation rather than a statute).\n\nEvery legal search engine (there are about half a dozen main ones, one or two of which are free) allows for 50 state searches in some form of primary legal materials like statutes and published appellate cases.",

Bulgaria has been a signatory state in each of its state forms. The point made below is analogously applicable here: Just because the Soviet Union kept Bulgaria under autocratic rules, the cessation of the USSR would not mean the independent state of Bulgaria would be deprived of the copyright subject work of art; it is questionable what will remain with the state, and what could be reclaimed be individuals creating those materials, but it is clear that the copyright protection will not cease.\n\nFrom the perspective of an author of copyright work of art:\n\nIf you can substantiate that you acted outside of your agency under autocratic rule while creating the original, especially, if you were persecuted and/or, in fact, trafficked, in general, I would say you could make a strong claim that you should be allowed at least to use your own work or if such facts are known to a potential claimant (e.g. the Member State of Bulgaria), you probably wouldn't have to worry much as they would likely not attempt to enforce any unjust law as they may end up on the European Court of Justice.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright status and legal implications of this potential project?\n\nA) The book is in the public domain because it was published under a communist regime, and therefore can be freely translated and published without permission.\n\nB) The copyright likely belongs to the current Bulgarian state, but the translator can claim fair use and publish the translation without permission.\n\nC) The book is still under copyright protection, and permission must be obtained from the current copyright holder before translating and publishing.\n\nD) The original author can claim full rights to the work if they can prove they were persecuted under the communist regime, allowing them to authorize the translation freely.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, copyright protection exists for works published in Bulgaria during the communist era, as Bulgaria has been a signatory to the Berne Convention throughout its various state forms. The cessation of communist rule does not nullify these copyrights. While the ownership of the copyright may be disputed (potentially between the state and individual creators), the copyright itself still exists and must be respected. Therefore, permission would need to be obtained from the current copyright holder before translating and publishing the book.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the book is not in the public domain simply due to being published under a communist regime. Answer B is incorrect because fair use typically doesn't cover full translations and publications of entire books. Answer D, while touching on a relevant point about potential claims by persecuted authors, overstates the ease and universality of such claims and doesn't represent the most likely legal scenario for most books from this era."

If your business has goods or services sold in more than one category using the same mark, you can protect it in every category that applies.\n\nWith respect to each category, if a good or service in a category sold with a mark just like yours would harm your sales of goods and services that you currently provide, then it makes sense to seek a mark in that category. If your product line expands, you can also add categories later if someone else using the same mark or a confusingly similar one hasn't moved into that market in the meantime.\n\nIn the case of a medical manufacturing company, the cost of obtaining a trademark in an additional category after the first category (several thousand dollars or less), relative to the economic importance of the company's trademarks and the economic scale of your operations (which should be in the multiple millions of dollars), is so small that cost should be a non\\-issue. So, you should apply for a trademark in every category that you could plausibly and truthfully be said to do business in.\n\nIf you can't afford a few thousand dollars to perfect a trademark in a few additional categories, you should think twice about whether investing in trademark registration at all makes any sense, because enforcing a trademark in the face of potential infringement is far more expensive (tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars for each infringer who doesn't go away with a mere cease and desist letter and thousands of dollars a year monitoring the market for infringement) and if you fail to enforce your trademark in the face of clear evidence of infringement, you risk your trademark losing its validity entirely.",

The documentation advises applying for trademarks in multiple categories when a business operates across different areas. For MedTech Innovations, which produces both medical devices (010) and related services like design and production (044), it's crucial to protect their brand in both categories. \n\nOption A is insufficient as it only covers devices, leaving their services unprotected. Option B similarly leaves their physical products vulnerable. Option D, while seemingly cost-effective, risks leaving part of their current business unprotected and potentially allows competitors to register similar marks in the unprotected category.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that the cost of additional category registration is relatively small compared to the overall value of trademark protection and the scale of operations for such a company. It also stresses the importance of comprehensive protection to avoid future complications and maintain the validity of the trademark."

The broadest is the non\\-legal \"in order to avoid all negative consequences\", in which case probably any and all. From the legal POV, you can distinguish two varieties of compulsion, one being ordinary tort or contractual liability. Theoretically, I could try to sue anybody that uses color distinctions to convey information on a web page. As an out\\-of\\-the\\-blue web surfer (no pun intended) I would probably have no luck. However, I might have a contractual relationship with a website, where I pay big money and they provide me information, only they do it via virtually imperceptable color differences like 123456 vs 123459\\. It is possible (but certainly not a foregone conclusion) that they would be in breach of the agreement. One would have to look at the contract. That then leaves the possibility that there is a federal or state regulation that obligates some/all web pages to comply with certain standards (which could lead to a discrimination suit). The short answer is, there aren't any across\\-the\\-board requirements. There are very many specific requirements.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, the two relevant pieces of law are the [Americans with Disabilities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990) and the [Rehabilitation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973). Whether or not you have to do something to comply with these acts depends on what you are doing. One reason would be in connection with employment: as an employer, I have some legal obligation to comply. Regarding 42 USC 12111, an employer is\n\n> a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has 15 or more\n>  employees for each working day in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in\n>  the current or preceding calendar year, and any agent of such person,\n>  except that, for two years following the effective date of this\n>  subchapter, an employer means a person engaged in an industry\n>  affecting commerce who has 25 or more employees for each working day\n>  in each of 20 or more calendar weeks in the current or preceding year,\n>  and any agent of such person\n\nand then it mentions exclusions, such as an Indian tribe, or the US, or a corporation owned entirely by the US government, etc. As an employer, I would have to make reasonable accommodations for a qualified individual (these are terms defined in the statute). The latter *may* include \"making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities\". If the web page (which the employee has to use on the job) employs the color scheme \"light greenish yellow vs. light yellowish green\" for conveying important information, and if that could be trivially re\\-coded to black and white by changing two constants, then that would be a reasonable accommodation (probably), where if it required massive and expensive reprogramming, that would not be reasonable. Even then, it would depend on the disability in question. There is a federal agency, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has jurisdiction over that and can decide what is a disability for their purposes. As far as I know, color blindness is not a protected disability, and the [EEOC Q\\&A on vision impairment](http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/qa_vision.cfm) and ADA does not suggest that this is a protected disability. That page has extensive examples that you can work through to get a feel for who might be covered, and what accommodations are reasonable.\n\nPursuant to [section 508](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973) of the (amended) Rehabilitation Act, the Federal government has to provide access to information for disabled persons that is comparable to that available to others. An obvious example of that would be web pages that could be listened to rather than only being read. This doesn't per se apply to private web pages, as long as you are not receiving federal funds. Also, this is not an absolute requirement, so if it would impose an undue burden on the agency to comply, then they can be in less than full compliance. Even so, assuming that color\\-blindness is not yet a legal disability, the widespread color abuses on web pages are not legally covered.",

I was a passenger and had consumed 2 mixed drinks before being driven home\n. Both of the arresting officers had body cameras and there's no way I could be considered a danger and I have no criminal record at all. One officer asked me to step out after my friend had also been asked the same and after talking with the officer, I was arrested and imprisoned over night and released on a PR bond. All of this appears extremely harsh and not proper but I've been told this sort of conviction is difficult to contest. Is there any point fighting this or spending lots of money on a lawyer (Cheapest one here is around $1,500\\)? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm guessing when you say 'public intoxication' you mean this:\n\n> \u00a7 49\\.02\\. PUBLIC INTOXICATION.\n> (a) A person commits an offense if the person appears in a public place while intoxicated to the degree that the person may endanger the person or another.\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (c) Except as provided by Subsection (e), an offense under this section is a Class C misdemeanor.\n\nIn Texas, a Class C misdemeanor is like a speeding ticket, or a theft by check of a small amount offense (Yes, speeding tickets in Texas ARE class C misdemeanors).\n\nSo you might want to see if there is a fine and what the city wants in terms of the fine. If you want to pay it, you'll have it on your record.\n\nIf it were me, I'd show up to the arraignment and then ask the prosecutor to agree to deferred adjudication and a few hundred dollar fine. Deferred means you promise to not get another citation for public intoxication for the next several months (whatever you can get the judge to agree with \\- which is typically 3 to 6 months) and then they'll dismiss your case \\- but only after you pay a disposition fee, which is likely a few hundred dollars more than the fine you'd pay, plus court costs.\n\nBut if they balked I'd make them give me a jury trial, and fight it *pro se* (on your own). If you truly only had 2 drinks and the video showed that you were a passenger, and weren't (as the law states) **\"intoxicated to the degree that the person may endanger the person or another\"** then I'd ask for a not guilty verdict from the jury based on that.\n\nIf you really want to be sure to keep it off your record, then hiring an attorney might be best, but I think in that case all he'd do is ask the prosecutor to agree to deferred disposition and then ask the judge to agree to it.",

This involves agreeing to not receive another public intoxication citation for a set period (usually 3-6 months) in exchange for case dismissal after paying a disposition fee. If the prosecutor refuses this option, the next step would be to request a jury trial and defend oneself pro se (without a lawyer). This approach gives the defendant the opportunity to potentially keep the offense off their record without immediately incurring the expense of hiring a lawyer. It also allows them to present their case to a jury if necessary, arguing that they were not \"intoxicated to the degree that the person may endanger the person or another\" as required by the law. Options A and D would result in a conviction on the record, while option B suggests hiring a lawyer regardless of cost, which may not be necessary in this situation."

The requirement to be truthful on tax forms is considered a legitimate government interest in accurate reporting and does not violate the 5th Amendment protection against self-incrimination. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they misrepresent the scope and application of the 5th Amendment or suggest non-existent exemptions."

(Many states do, however, allow a criminal defendant to unilaterally opt for a bench trial.)\n\nLikewise: Under [FRCP 43](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_43), a criminal defendant *cannot* opt out of being present for his entire trial.\n\nThese rules seem opposed to the basic civic principles that surround the presumption of innocence before conviction, and the right of a person to pursue an effective defense. I can think of plenty of reasons why a person may not want to show his face in a public court, much less sit through the entire process. Including reasons that may prejudice the triers of fact: e.g., disfigurement, handicaps that produce irritating tics, etc.\n\nThe notes on these federal rules cite a great deal of jurisprudence and history. Before I attempt my own research, can anyone point to principles or customs that might illuminate or reconcile these FRCP mandates with the basic understanding of American criminal justice I described?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [SCOTUS has at least three times found that it is necessary for a defendant to be present at the beginning of a criminal trial in order to satisfy the Constitutional mandates regarding due process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_in_absentia#United_States).\n\nSo the simple answer is that **a defendant *must* be present during a criminal trial because *without his presence no trial can begin***.\n\nHowever, once a trial has begun [FRCP Rule 43](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_43) itself (section c) allows for the absence of the defendant. Among the provisions: The defendant can waive his *right* to be present simply by voluntary absence. The defendant can also waive his right by disruptive behavior in the court.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The defendant has a constitutional right to be absent from the trial if he believes his appearance may prejudice the jury.\nB) The defendant can choose to be absent from the trial at any time, as long as he informs the judge of his decision.\nC) The defendant must be present at the beginning of the trial, but may be allowed to be absent during later parts of the proceedings.\nD) The defendant has no option to be absent from any part of the trial, as federal rules require the defendant's presence throughout the entire process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, the Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant must be present at the beginning of a criminal trial to satisfy Constitutional due process requirements. However, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (FRCP) Rule 43 allows for the defendant's absence once the trial has begun, either through voluntary waiver or due to disruptive behavior. Therefore, the defendant in this scenario must be present at the start of the trial, but may have the option to be absent during later parts of the proceedings, subject to the court's discretion. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest the defendant has more freedom to choose absence than the rules allow. Option D is incorrect because it overstates the requirement for the defendant's presence throughout the entire trial."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My partner and I, now 22, were adopted together when we were 12\\. The adoption agency believed we were very \"sisterly\" towards each other and encouraged our adoptive parents to accept both of us into their home. What they didn't know however was that we were intimate at the time. We've continued to be girlfriends in secret, but we hope to now marry and spend the rest of our lives together. Idaho law allows for same sex marriage, but we've been told that it is illegal for adopted siblings to marry, no matter blood relation (we are not blood related)\n\nMy question is, does this actually apply to us? And if so, is there anything we can do to annul our adoptive relationship, or perhaps there is a state that will allow it (as a last resort, uprooting now would be ruinous)\n\nThank you for your opinion, none of the answers will be construed as legal advice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One place to look is the incest statute, [18\\-6602](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title18/t18ch66/sect18-6602/), which says:\n\n> Persons being within the degrees of consanguinity within which\n>  marriages are declared by law to be incestuous and void, who\n>  intermarry with each other, or who commit fornication or adultery with\n>  each other, are punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a\n>  term not to exceed life.\n\nThe relevant statute pertaining to consanguinity and marriage [(32\\.205\\)](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title32/T32CH2/SECT32-205/) states:\n\n> Marriages between parents and children, ancestors and descendants of\n>  every degree, **and between brothers and sisters of the half (1/2\\) as\n>  well as the whole blood**, and between uncles and nieces, or aunts and\n>  nephews, are incestuous, and void from the beginning, whether the\n>  relationship is legitimate or illegitimate.\n\nA literal reading of the law with attention to the bold part tells you that the prohibition of marriage between brothers and sisters of full or half blood does not preclude marriage between blood\\-unrelated sibling. It does, however, not grant the same right to aunts and nephews etc. (including those by adoption), which could engender competing claims about legislative intent. It would then be relevant to look at the Washington analog of this statute, [RCW 26\\.04\\.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.04.020), which prohibits marriage:\n\n> (1\\)(b) When the spouses are nearer of kin to each other than second\n>  cousins, whether of the whole or half blood computing by the rules of\n>  the civil law.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) It is unlawful for any person to marry his or her sibling, child,\n>  grandchild, aunt, uncle, niece, or nephew.\n\nHere, the blood\\-relation rule applies to (second) cousins and is absolute for aunts and sibling. It would seem that various legislatures had different intents, in forming these statutes.\n\nIn Oregon, [ORS 106\\.020](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/106.020) prohibits marriage\n\n> When the parties thereto are first cousins or any nearer of kin to\n>  each other, whether of the whole or half blood, whether by blood or\n>  adoption, computing by the rules of the civil law, except that when\n>  the parties are first cousins by adoption only, the marriage is not\n>  prohibited or void\n\nIn this case, the Oregon law explicitly equates blood and adoption, and then could cast doubt on the concept of \"whole or half blood\" as actually referring to blood relationship (although, Oregon is not Idaho, or Washington). \n\nGiven the literal reading of the Idaho statutes (and without there being any clarifying case pertaining to relationship by adoption), it may take a court order to compel the county clerk to obey the law, especially if the clerk is dispensing life choice recommendations. That is especially so if the law is not clearly established.\n\nMontana likewise restricts [(40\\-1\\-401\\)](http://leg.mt.gov/bills/mca/40/1/40-1-401.htm)\n\n> a marriage between an ancestor and a descendant or between a brother\n>  and a sister, whether the relationship is by the half or the whole\n>  blood, or between first cousins\n\nThat statute also says\n\n> Parties to a marriage prohibited under this section who cohabit after\n>  removal of the impediment are lawfully married as of the date of the\n>  removal of the impediment.\n\nHowever, there is no obvious way to get legally unadopted, especially when the parties are adults.\n\nAn additional wrinkle is that in Idaho under [32\\-209](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title32/T32CH2/SECT32-209/), valid marriages entered into elsewhere are valid in that state\n\n> unless they violate the public policy of this state. Marriages that\n>  violate the public policy of this state include, but are not limited\n>  to, **same\\-sex marriages**, and marriages entered into under the laws of\n>  another state or country with the intent to evade the prohibitions of\n>  the marriage laws of this state.\n\nBut it is established law that same\\-sex marriages are legal. The bold section is *clearly* unconstitutional; the question then is whether if you took this to SCOTUS, they would strike down the entire statute (a number of states still have such language on their statute books, e.g. Montana still declares that marriage is between a man and a woman). At any rate, a lawyer is probably mandatory.",

Based on the information provided about Idaho's laws, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Their marriage would definitely be illegal under Idaho law, as it prohibits marriage between adopted siblings.\n\nB) Their marriage would definitely be legal under Idaho law, as the statute only mentions blood relations.\n\nC) The legality of their marriage is unclear under Idaho law and may require a court interpretation.\n\nD) They can easily annul their adoptive relationship to make their marriage legal in Idaho.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of marriage between adopted siblings who are not blood-related is unclear under Idaho law and may require court interpretation. The relevant Idaho statute (32.205) specifically mentions \"brothers and sisters of the half (1/2) as well as the whole blood\" but does not explicitly address adopted siblings who are not blood-related. This ambiguity in the law suggests that a court may need to interpret legislative intent and decide whether the prohibition extends to adopted siblings with no blood relation. The answer is not definitively illegal (A) or legal (B), and there is no easy process to annul an adoptive relationship (D), making C the most accurate answer given the information provided."

Gross earnings:\n> \n> \n> * is calculated from the start of employment, and\n> * include any other\n>  payments made in the employee\u2019s final pay.\n> \n> \n> If the employee has taken\n>  annual holidays in advance or has been paid for annual holidays on a\n>  pay\\-as\\-you\\-go basis, the amount paid is deducted from gross earnings.\n\nThis means there are two ways to formulate this calculation:\n\n1. (gross pay \\- advance leave) \\* 0\\.08\n2. (gross pay \\* 0\\.08\\) \\- advance leave\n\nThese two approaches differ wildly in the outcome \\- the first is in the employee's favour, the second in the employer's favour. On gross earnings of $100k, the difference can be several thousand dollars.\n\nWhen the advice given is a government website specifically intended to give advice in this area, how are differences in interpretation generally handled?\n\nThe second website does contain a disclaimer about not being legal advice, but that seems pretty weak when the entire website is intended to guide employers and employees in their requirements and obligations.\n\nThe examples are from NZ, so an NZ specific answer would be nice, but I'd also like to hear what other countries and jurisdictions do as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In interpreting a statute, New Zealand courts must conform to the [Legislation Act 2019](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0058/latest/DLM7298193.html), which says that\n\n> The meaning of legislation must be ascertained from its text and in the light of its purpose and its context.\n\nThis carries forward a provision from the [Interpretation Act 1924](https://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2019/0058/latest/DLM7298193.html) at 5(j) that interpretation must \"best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act \\[...] according to its true intent, meaning and spirit.\" In discovering what this purpose is, the entire text of the Act is available, including in this case the Holidays Act s. 15(c),\n\n> The purpose of this subpart is to \\[...] require employers to pay employees at the end of their employment for annual holidays not taken or paid out\n\nWhen they do this, the courts must be cautious not to make up their own laws; in the *Northern Milk* case, this was summarized as\n\n> The Courts must try to make the Act work while taking care not themselves to usurp the policy\\-making function, which rightly belongs to Parliament. The Courts can in a sense fill gaps in an Act\n> but only in order to make the Act work as Parliament must have intended.\n\n(This case, *Northland Milk Vendors Association Inc v Northern Milk Ltd \\[1988]* 1 NZLR 537 (CA), is a major authority for how far the courts can go. There, they were dealing with a gap in time between one statutory regime ending and the next one beginning, where Parliament had neglected to say what would happen in between. The Court of Appeal had to decide on the purpose of the Milk Act 1988 by looking at such textual matters as its long title, which said that it was meant \"to provide for the continuing home delivery of milk\", and so the status quo had to be maintained in the interim.)\n\nBut this exercise is focused on the statute itself. It excludes, for example, even such tempting targets as an *amendment* to that statute which was made subsequent to the case at hand, and which might clarify what was intended. (See [Commissioner of Inland Revenue v. Databank Systems Ltd Co (New Zealand) \\[1990] UKPC 37](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1990/1990_37.html).) In some cases, reference might be made to the Parliamentary circumstances when the statute was passed. New Zealand, compared to other similar jurisdictions, is reluctant to bring in other kinds of non\\-statutory material to explain a statute. They also do not generally defer to government agency interpretations unless the matter is very technical, or the primary statute tells them they must.\n\nFor the Holidays Act, recent cases concerning some *different* ambiguities have been resolved without having to look beyond the text itself, and its broad purpose. (For example, *Postal Workers Union v NZ Post* \\[2012] NZCA 481, on whether unrostered overtime is part of \"relevant daily pay\", or *Tourism Holdings Ltd v Labour Inspector* \\[2021] NZSC 157, on holiday pay for somebody with a very irregular work pattern.) I would expect that in your example, government websites would *not* be used by the courts to determine what the law means. They would do their best to \"make the Act work\", starting from its actual text, and informed by its own statement of purpose. But they would not use a guidance note from a government website as evidence for what *Parliament* intended.",

How do I do this without being sued into oblivion? \n\nI am particularly interested in UK law.\n\nAs I understand it, a specific sound recording (of anything) is protected by copyright, but the specific pattern of musical notes that make up a song is *also* protected (and the rights might belong to somebody different). So even if I don't use any copyrighted sound recordings, if I were to play a song that's recognisable, I would still be sued.\n\nWhen looking at a song, I believe there are three possibilities:\n\n1. The song was written so many centuries ago that nobody holds the rights to it any more and the music is in the public domain, e.g. Bach is presumably out of copyright now.\n2. You wrote the song yourself, so *you* own the rights to it.\n3. Somebody else owns the rights to it.\n\nObviously, it's the third case that presents a problem. In theory, you find out who owns the rights, and ask them whether you can use the song. Maybe they say yes, maybe they say no. In reality, it's not like you can just call Sony BMG (or whoever) and chat to them about it. And even if you could, they'll want tens of millions of dollars to license the song, which I obviously don't have.\n\nThis appears to mean that it is actually impossible to ever play any song that people will recognise.\n\nAm I correct in my interpretation of the law? Is there some way around this problem?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most countries have [**compulsory** or **statutory licences**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_license) for exactly these situations. You enter a licence agreement with a collecting society, pay them licencing fees, and give them a record of the music you perform. They in turn then distribute royalties to the rights holders.\n\nThe exact details of which licence you'll need depends on your country, the types of events you will perform at, the frequency of the events, the size of the audience etc. It may be the venue's responsibility to obtain the licence instead of the performer, or both the venue and the performer may need to. I don't have any experience of this, and if I did my experience would be useless to yours in the UK ;).\n\nBut luckily the UK has an [easy to find website](https://www.gov.uk/live-music-licence) which tells you just where you need to go. You will need to get a licence from an organisation called [PRS for Music](http://www.prsformusic.com/users/businessesandliveevents/Pages/default.aspx).",

This organization manages compulsory or statutory licenses, which allow performers to legally play copyrighted music at live events without having to contact individual rights holders. By paying licensing fees to PRS for Music and reporting the songs performed, the musician ensures that royalties are properly distributed to copyright holders.

You are obliged to inform them that they have left some of their possessions behind and you can bill them for any expenses incurred in the disposal of it.\n\nIn terms of reading someone else's mail *that has been opened* you may be liable under [article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/I/chapter/7), since you are possibly accessing your former tenant's personal information without their consent. However, the specifics of the fact that the mail has been abandoned without care does mean that would an interesting legal matter for the courts.\n\nUnless you have a very good reason to read this mail, I would suggest you contact the former tenant informing them that it has been left behind, and if (as is likely) they claim it's just rubbish, then dispose of it and send a bill to them.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A landlord discovers opened letters among items left behind by a former tenant. What is the most legally appropriate action for the landlord to take?\n\nA) Read the letters to determine if they contain important information for the tenant\nB) Dispose of all items immediately without contacting the former tenant\nC) Contact the former tenant about the left items and await their response before taking action\nD) Keep the letters indefinitely in case the tenant returns for them\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most legally appropriate action is to contact the former tenant about the left items and await their response before taking action. This aligns with the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977, which states that possessions left in the property still belong to the tenant. The landlord is obligated to inform the tenant about the left items. \n\nOption A is incorrect and potentially illegal, as reading someone else's opened mail without consent could violate Article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998. \n\nOption B is incorrect because immediate disposal without contacting the tenant first would violate the landlord's obligations under the Torts Act. \n\nOption D is unnecessary and doesn't address the legal requirement to inform the tenant about the left items.\n\nBy choosing option C, the landlord fulfills their legal obligation, avoids potential privacy violations, and can then proceed with appropriate disposal (if authorized by the tenant) and billing for any incurred expenses."

Android that was happening in a district court physically located in San Jose, California, that one of the jurors was familiar with the process and procedure of acquiring patents, and there was some controversy in regards to this fact (he was sharing his experience with the rest of the jurors).\n\nIs a juror having a prior knowledge of law, other than what has been presented to them in the specific court case, allowed to teach others about any such understandings they have held prior to the start of the proceedings? Is it cause for them to be disqualified, or even for the whole panel to be disqualified?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I finally found the actual transcript of the *voir dire* part of the case mentioned in the question.\n\n[http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story\\=2012090614295190](http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=2012090614295190)\n\nAs can be evidenced from the transcript, the judge has specifically instructed the two jurors working as engineers at the local tech companies that they'd have to \"forget\" what they know about both the software engineering and the patent law itself, too, starting their work on the whole case with a completely clean sheet, using a very simple criteria for making decisions:\n\n> One side or the other is going to have the burden of proof on \\-\\- one side has the burden of proof on some issues, the other side has the burden of proof on other issues. When you go into the jury room to deliberate after you've tried your hardest to understand the evidence, if they haven't educated you on it or if they haven't persuaded you, the party with the burden of proof loses. It's that simple. You don't have to \\-\\- you have to make a good faith effort to understand it, but if the party with the burden of proof has failed to do that, the party with the burden of proof loses. That's the standard. You have to \\-\\- you, the jury, decide.\n> \n> \n> Now, what you cannot do is bring to bear something that you've learned in some other case, some other patent case, about how some piece of equipment works or something like that. You can't do that. It has to be based on the record here.\n\nThen, after a short break and a consultation with the lawyers, where Oracle seems to have expressed some concern to having the computer experts be on the panel, which subsequently prompted the judge to declare the following to the two potential jurors who worked at Cisco and HP:\n\n> So this is really going to be directed at both of you, but, you know, you come to the party, so to speak, with some prior training that bears upon the subject matter we're going to be hearing a lot about here. That's okay. That's not disqualifying, but you \\-\\- it's okay to use your common sense when you render a verdict, but you cannot add to the record in court something that you know about the way software programming works that the witnesses didn't actually testify to.

Google case, two potential jurors with extensive software and patent experience were ultimately excused. What was the primary reason for their dismissal, and what does this reveal about the expectations for jurors in complex technical cases?\n\nA) They were dismissed because they worked for competing tech companies, showing that jurors must have no industry connections.\n\nB) They were excused because they couldn't disregard their prior knowledge, demonstrating that jurors are expected to rely solely on evidence presented in court.\n\nC) They were removed due to concerns about bias against either Oracle or Google, indicating that jurors must be completely neutral about the parties involved.\n\nD) They were dismissed because they expressed an inability to understand the technical aspects of the case, revealing that jurors in complex cases must have some relevant expertise.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The judge excused the two jurors with extensive software and patent experience because it would be \"too hard for [them] to sit in this case and sort out what [they] knew already against what is proven or not proven here.\" This decision demonstrates that jurors are expected to base their decisions solely on the evidence presented in court, rather than relying on their prior knowledge or expertise.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a lawyer has a deadbeat client, do they just immediately file a complaint against them and seek judgement, or do they send a demand letter first threatening to sue them?\n\nI am not asking about when they are do debt recovery for someone else professionally. I am asking what lawyers do when one of their own clients owes them money and shows no signs of paying voluntarily.\n\nThe reason why I ask is that I trying to determine to what extent demand letters are just efforts to generate billable hours, or whether they have a legitimate purpose. If lawyers never bother to send demand letters when they collect their own debts, then obviously the letters are just a revenue\\-generation method.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Demand letters are often used to collect debts from one's own clients, most prominently, because filing a lawsuit against a client often triggers a counterclaim for malpractice or an ethical grievance, even if it is not justified on the merits. Demanding payment without suing rarely has these consequences and often isn't even enough to trigger an urge to post an unjustified (or justified) bad review of the lawyer online.\n\nDemand letters are not just efforts to generate billable hours. Lawyers want to generate billable hours for clients who pay them reliably, rather than devoting time to work collecting from a client who has a significant likelihood of not paying.\n\nOne reason to send demand letters is that sometimes, the reason that clients don't pay is not that they are unwilling to pay, or dispute the bill, but that they are currently unable to pay. A demand letter keeps the debt fresh in the client's mind when an ability to pay is restored. Quite a bit of hourly charge legal work is *de facto* contingent fee work because the client almost by definition won't have the ability to pay for it promptly if the outcome is a bad one (often for reasons beyond the lawyer's control).\n\nDemand letters are cheap, can often be drafted by administrative staff for attorney review, and because they are cheap, don't have to have a high success rate to be worth the effort. Even a 5%\\-10% payment rate for unpaid fees that are sought in demand letters makes them worth it.\n\nA second reason to send a demand letter can also trigger a written response acknowledging that the debt is owed and apologizing for not paying, and/or paying a token amount like $25, each of which extends the statute of limitations to collect the entire amount of the debt for unpaid fees.\n\nA third reason to send a demand letter is that it helps the lawyer to keep current on the client's address, if the client moves, while a mail forwarding order is still in place.\n\nA fourth reason to send a demand letter is that it discourages the client from trying to get the lawyer to do additional work on existing or new matters that the client can't afford to pay for (especially in non\\-litigation representations) because it reminds them that they already owe money to the firm.\n\nTypically, a lawyer sues when (1\\) the client is known to be collectible now, (2\\) there is not credible basis for a malpractice lawsuit and there was not a bad outcome, and (3\\) the statute of limitations is approaching or the client has a serious chance of not being collectible later.\n\n**The Business Model Context**\n\nIn a typical small and medium sized practice with a mix of litigation work done on an hourly basis and transactional work involving negotiations that are not flat fee, maybe 10% of unpaid bills are ever the subject of a collection lawsuit brought by the law firm that wasn't paid.\n\nA firm like that often ultimately writes off as much as 20%\\-30% or more of all the fees it bills to its clients on an hourly basis (with substantial variation from year to year), and typically receives maybe a third of all the fees that it is ultimately paid more than 90 days after the due date for the invoiced fees. A pattern of a client not paying for several months and then making a big lump sum payment for reasons that may or may not be related to the representation is fairly common. For reasons like this (and the timing of contingency fee payouts) solo practice and small firm lawyers with non\\-criminal practices typically have incomes that vary wildly from year to year, even though the amount of work actually done each year as measured by billable hours is quite consistent.\n\nLarge law firms are actually quite similar to this business model as well, although they charge higher rates and bill more hours on cases, and the law of averages keeps their monthly fee collections a little more consistent. Many large firms pay all of their expenses from a line of credit so that they don't have to worry about the timing of their collections to pay their monthly expenses, and then settle up with their bank at the end of the year.\n\nCertain kinds of firms (e.g. criminal defense) require all anticipated fees to be in a retainer before work is started. Other kinds of work (e.g. probate administration and flat fee transactional work and contingent fee work) usually is paid promptly and reliably when due.\n\nIn the insurance defense counsel business model, invoices are almost always paid so demand letters aren't needed, but are usually paid very slowly (90\\-180 days from invoice), the hourly rates are below average, and the insurance company routinely nitpicks bills to reduce hourly charges in any given month by 5%\\-10% or so.",

Which of the following statements best describes the typical practice and rationale for using demand letters in this scenario?\n\nA) Demand letters are rarely used as they are primarily a method to generate additional billable hours and have little practical purpose in debt collection.\n\nB) Lawyers typically skip demand letters and immediately file lawsuits against clients who owe them money to ensure quick payment.\n\nC) Demand letters are commonly used as a first step, as they are cost-effective, can extend the statute of limitations, and help avoid potential malpractice counterclaims that often arise from lawsuits.\n\nD) Demand letters are only sent to clients who owe small amounts, while larger debts always warrant immediate legal action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage indicates that demand letters are commonly used by lawyers as a first step in collecting unpaid fees from clients. They are cost-effective, often drafted by administrative staff, and can be successful even with a low response rate. Demand letters can extend the statute of limitations if the client acknowledges the debt in writing or makes a small payment. Additionally, filing a lawsuit against a client often triggers malpractice counterclaims or ethical grievances, which demand letters typically avoid. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that demand letters are not just efforts to generate billable hours and have legitimate purposes. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect as the information provided suggests that immediately filing lawsuits is not the typical approach due to the risk of counterclaims and the potential benefits of demand letters.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that the use of demand letters is based on the size of the debt. Instead, it suggests they are used broadly as an initial step in debt collection."

Since before the Nintendo 64 was released in Sweden/Europe, and after it had occurred, the magazines were full of ads selling imported USA and Japan Nintendo 64 consoles and games.\n\nThen, in one issue in the later half of 1997, they included a small note about how it's now illegal to sell imported Nintendo 64 games in Sweden (but not to import them yourself). After that, all the following issues of the magazine have all mentions of imported Nintendo 64 games removed from all the ads.\n\nHowever, they continued to advertise the sale of imported games for PlayStation, Saturn and all other consoles except for the Nintendo 64\\.\n\nI find this extremely weird. Did they really pass a law in Sweden in late 1997 which specifically disallowed the selling of imported **Nintendo 64** games \\-\\- not just video games in general? If so, that's the oddest/most specific law I ever did hear.\n\nThe magazine in question always seemed to \"barely tolerate\" what they called \"grey importers\", so they never mentioned this again that I can remember/find. I have no idea how I'd find out the details of this today.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I've found Commission Decision [2003/675/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2003:255:0033:0100:EN:PDF) which sheds light on what exactly happened here (more digestable press release [here](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_02_1584)).\n\nBasically, there was a dispute involving Nintendo and its various independent distributors who had exclusive distribution rights in their respective territories, [Bergsala AB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergsala) for Sweden. Note this wasn't simply a matter of Bergsala's rights being violated, but rather a scheme to reduce parallel imports/exports which the Commission found to be anti\\-competitive. For most parties, this was brought to an end in December 1997 (see section 2\\.2\\.11 on pgs. 54\\-55\\).\n\nSo no, there was no change in the law, but the anti\\-competitive scheme stopped in late 1997\\. Weirdly this should have resulted in the possibility for more imports, but since those imports would no longer have artificially higher prices, perhaps the advertisements and/or imports were no longer worth economically worth it. Or perhaps Bergsala pivoted to greater enforcement the exclusive rights it did have, even if this didn't include the ability to block parallel imports according to EU competition law. In any case, trade of Nintendo products in Europe was greatly altered in late 1997\\.\n\n*Please take my summary with a grain of salt, I'm not very well versed in the field of commerce and I've already misunderstood the decision at least once; check the cited decision for proper details.*",

According to the Commission Decision 2003/675/EC, Nintendo and its independent distributors, including Bergsala AB for Sweden, were involved in an anti-competitive scheme to reduce parallel imports/exports. This scheme was brought to an end in December 1997, which aligns with the timing of the magazine's change in advertising practices.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because no specific law banning Nintendo 64 imports was passed. The change was due to business practices, not legislation.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the European Commission did not ban the sale of imported video games. In fact, EU competition law generally allows for parallel imports.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there's no evidence of Bergsala AB suing the magazine.

This clause shifts the responsibility of obtaining necessary permissions to the client and provides the designer with grounds to seek indemnification if legal problems occur due to the client's failure to secure proper rights. \n\nOption A is incorrect because \"at Client's request\" refers to materials requested by the client, not to the act of requesting permissions.\nOption B is incorrect as this clause does not address copyright transfer between the designer and client.\nOption D is incorrect because the clause actually emphasizes the need for the client to obtain permissions, not to use materials without permissions."

I believe what constitutes an American crime is a crime committed on US soil where as the criminal liability falls on US jurisdiction.

Some countries look for \"where the crime has had an effect\", for example if a criminal on the US side of the border shoots a person on the Canadian side, where this distinction might make a difference. Or gambling websites that are run outside the USA but used by people within the USA. \n\nBut there is a large number of crimes outside the USA that the USA will prosecute; other countries have similar not identical rules. Examples are bribery by US companies outside the USA, certain sexual crimes. Usually covered are crimes that a nation just doesn't want its citizens to commit, even outside its own borders, to avoid damage to the countries reputation. \n\nThe Amanda Knox case is clearly Italian business. Well, according to US law, it's not the business of the USA, and according to Italian law, it's Italy's business. No special rules for an ordinary murder case.",

The U.S. does have jurisdiction over certain specific crimes committed by its citizens abroad, such as bribery by U.S. companies or certain sexual crimes. However, this is not universal for all crimes. Most crimes committed abroad, including ordinary cases like murder, fall under the jurisdiction of the country where they occurred. This is why the Amanda Knox case was handled by the Italian legal system, not the U.S., despite Knox being an American citizen. The U.S. law recognizes that it's not automatically their business to prosecute all crimes committed by U.S. citizens abroad. Answer A is too broad, B is too restrictive, and D oversimplifies the complex nature of international criminal jurisdiction."

She got paranoid about me trying to talk to my estranged brother, thinking I was trying to plot with him how to defraud her of everything before she died, and she wrote me out of her will.\n\nSomething tells me my brother didn't fight too hard to stop her from leaving everything to him. True to her word, she left everything to him, the jewelry that was supposed to be mine, all her household goods, family heirlooms and memories. He threw away my mother's entire life because he hated her for how she raised us and how verbally abusive she got at him towards the end of her life.\n\nI've got friends telling me I should try to contest her will. The thing is, she's always been this kind of woman so to suggest she did this due to dementia or declining mental state doesn't fit with how she simply was. As well, I'm an advocate for inheritance rights and if she honestly and legally wrote me out, well... she has the right to do that, no matter how ugly or unfair it seems for me.\n\nI'm wondering that since my mother was in her right mind when she changed her will, and since I'm all the way up in Canada, is it even worth it to try to contest this?

Is such a statement as saying that the head of our Executive Branch is \"not\\-my\\-president\" something that's unlawful for any citizen or member of the military?\n\nAlthough we have freedom of expression in America (and I wholeheartedly support it!), there is already a proposal to make it illegal to burn the flag of the United States. I do believe a kingdom divided against itself will hardly stand! \n\nSo likewise\\-\\-short of encouraging draconian rule\\-\\-I'm wondering how as a country we've considered or dealt with reducing or curbing the division that can arise from such public displays of rebellion against the leader we lawfully elect into office. Perhaps there's a rule about it that would only apply to the military. Or maybe there is something requiring allegiance or respect out of each citizen for the Office of the President.\n\nIf not, I'd like to know if any such bill has ever been introduced to the House of Representatives, and whether there is any online reference where I can find out more about past issues or ongoing discussions regarding this matter.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US developed from an earlier kingdom, and the First Amendment enshrines the main issue that led to our departure from that kingdom. The underlying political premise has been that disagreement is to be dealt with rationally and not through force, such as where opinions contrary to those articulated by the government are squashed (in order to eliminate divisions).\n\nThere have been numerous laws passed in the US to outlaw \"contrary\" speech including \"disrespectful\" speech, and they are constantly being overturned by the Supreme Court. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 and U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 are two recent reaffirmations that such laws are unconstitutional. The only way such a law can work is if the Constitution is amended to in some way re\\-write the First Amendment, like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Desecration_Amendment).\n\nOutlawing indirect insults towards political figures (\"not *my* Speaker of the House\", \"not *my* FBI director\") would require an even more extensive suspension of the First Amendment. It is possible that at some time, a bill was introduced to outlaw saying disparaging things about POTUS, but I would be surprised if it got out of committee, because it would fail challenge in court.\n\nThe most\\-likely retrenchment on our freedom of expression is likely to be a flag\\-burning law, which has relatively wide support in the US. There are a number of interpretive problems associated with the key concept \"physical desecration\". Even more interpretive problems would arise if Congress were given the power (via an anti\\-disparagement amendment) to outlaw \"disparagement of public officials\". Can one simultaneously \"respect the Office of the President\" and \"disrespect the holder of the office\"?\n\nAs for specifically restricting the military, that's a challenging issue. It *is* a court\\-martial offense for a commissioned military officer to use contemptuous words against the President and Congress ([10 USC 888](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/888)), and by directive from the Department of Defense this also applies to enlisted personnel. SCOTUS in Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733 articulated the Military Necessity doctrine, that \"The fundamental necessity for obedience, and the consequent necessity for imposition of discipline, may render permissible within the military that which would be constitutionally impermissible outside it\". So \"not my President\" probably *is* illegal for soldiers. [This article](https://www.freedomforuminstitute.org/first-amendment-center/topics/freedom-of-speech-2/personal-public-expression-overview/military-speech/) reviews various First Amendment issues as they pertain to the military.",

It\u2018s just a thought that randomly came to mind.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The game *Five Nights at Freddy's* and the other elements in the [large media franchise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s) of the same name are surely protected by copyright. In addition the name of the fictional restaurant in the game may well be protected as a trademark, and I would be astounded if \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" was not protected as a trademark. Other names and phrases may well be trademarked also.\n\nIf the suggested actual restaurant was at all closely based on the images and descriptions from the games or the novels, it would be a derivative work. Unless one had permission from the copyright owner, creating such a restaurant would be an act of wilful copyright infringement. The owner could sue, and quite likely win. In the US the owner could get up to $150,000 in statutory damages for *each work* that was infringed, which in this case might well mean several of the games and novels, depending on just what images and descriptions were imitated or used. Or the owner could elect to receive damages and profits, meaning all damage provably done to the owner, plus all profits made by the infringer. In addition to either, the owner might well obtain an injunction against further operations of the restaurant.\n\nBeyond that, if the imitation used any of the trademarked names, slogans, or other protected trademarks, there could be a suit for trademark infringement. There could be no question that the marks were being used in commerce, and were not instances of nominative use. A restaurant is a very different thing from a video game, a novel, or a film, of course. No doubt it falls into a different trademark category. Normally trademark protection extends only to the category for which the mark is protected. But in the case of a \"well\\-known\" or \"famous\" mark, protection under US law is wider. Also, when the infringement might lead reasonable people to falsely belie that the infringing product or service has been endorsed, approved, or sponsored by the trademark owner, it may be a violation even in a significantly different category. This a successful suit for trademark infringement might well be possible also.\n\nOf course, if the new restaurant only vaguely resembled the one in the games and novels, and did not use the phrase \"Five Nights at Freddy's\" or the name \"Freddy Fazbear\u2019s\" or any other distinctive names from the media franchise, That might not be copyright or trademark infringement. But that would not seem to achieve the effect suggested by the question.\n\nIf the creator of the restaurant obtained **permission** from the copyright and trademark owner(s) then there would be no legal issue. But the owners might well not grant such permission, or might charge a high fee for it.\n\nI doubt that the idea is workable.\n\nAs a side note, many years ago I regularly patronized a restaurant named [\"Bilbo's Pizza\"](https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/life/2017/01/27/archives-pizza-joints-we-miss/97081968/) It was decorated with murals obviously based on descriptions for *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. The intended reference was clear. They may have gotten permission from the Tolkien estate; I understand that Tolkien was rather free about granting such permissions. Or they may have just counted on word not coming to the copyright holder. But modern media franchise companies are probably much more watchful and much more quick to enforce IP rights.",

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this venture?\n\nA) As long as they don't use the exact name \"Five Nights at Freddy's,\" they can freely recreate the restaurant's atmosphere and characters without any legal consequences.\n\nB) They can proceed with the restaurant idea without permission, as restaurants fall into a different trademark category than video games.\n\nC) The entrepreneurs must obtain permission from the copyright and trademark owners of FNAF to create such a restaurant, or they risk facing serious legal consequences including copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits.\n\nD) If the restaurant only vaguely resembles the one in the games and doesn't use any names from the franchise, it would be completely safe from any legal action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the FNAF franchise is protected by copyright and likely has various trademarked elements. Creating a restaurant closely based on the game without permission would be considered creating a derivative work, which is copyright infringement. Even if the restaurant falls into a different trademark category, using well-known marks or creating a false impression of endorsement can still lead to trademark infringement. The entrepreneurs would need to obtain permission from the copyright and trademark owners to legally create such a restaurant and avoid potential lawsuits for damages, profits, and injunctions against operation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even without using the exact name, recreating the atmosphere and characters would still likely infringe on copyrights and possibly trademarks. Option B is wrong because while restaurants are in a different category, famous marks can have wider protection, and there's still the issue of copyright infringement. Option D is partially true but oversimplified; while a vague resemblance might avoid some legal issues, it wouldn't achieve the goal of creating a FNAF-themed restaurant and could still potentially face scrutiny depending on how similar it is."

As explained in the documentation, there isn't a strict legal rule for abbreviating case names. Instead, the convention is based on custom and convenience, with the primary goal of avoiding ambiguity. This is particularly important when one party, like Planned Parenthood, is involved in multiple notable cases. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while using the first-named party (often the plaintiff) is common, it's not a universal rule. \n\nOption B is incorrect. While criminal cases are often named after the defendant, this is to avoid confusion due to the large number of cases involving the state or federal government as the prosecutor, not because of a plaintiff/defendant distinction.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no strict legal rule governing case name abbreviations. The practice is based on convention and practicality rather than law.\n\nThe example of Planned Parenthood v.

However, there appears to be no actual law that supports this. For instance, the [Animals Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/22) makes no mention of cats at all. As far as I can tell, the law is incredibly vague on this issue.\n\nWhy, then, is there apparently widespread belief that cats have a right to roam? Is there legal precedent establishing this? If a cat owner were found liable in a county court for their cat having committed damages during their roaming, would there be any legal basis to challenge this decision?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statement that cats cannot commit trespass is technically true, but is also a misreading of ss.4 and 4A of the Animals Act. Those sections replace a common\\-law doctrine called \"cattle trespass\", which was a specific tort (a civil wrong) concerning what happens when my cattle stray onto your land. Both old and new rules apply only to livestock, so not just cows but other kinds of farm animals as well \\- but *not* to dogs or cats. Horses are a special case (s.4A). Since cats are not livestock, they cannot be the subject of cattle trespass and are not covered by section 4\\.\n\nFurther, since they are animals, they cannot commit the tort of trespass at all. Animals themselves are not liable at law. As the *keeper* of cows, it would be *me* who was liable in a case of cattle trespass, not the cow. The point of s.4, and its predecessor in common law, is to make me liable for damage done to your property by my cows, regardless of whether I was negligent in the way I looked after them (it is a \"strict liability\"). The mere fact that they've strayed onto your land and done damage is enough.\n\nBecause cats are not cows, this particular rule does not apply. That does not mean that cats can't be the subject of other torts. In particular, cats could be involved in the tort of nuisance, which covers all sorts of potential scenarios \\- noise, smells, etc. This has typically happened when there are lots and lots of cats. And under the Animals Act, the keeper of *any* animal may be liable for damage that it does, including physical injury or damage to property.\n\nSection 2 of the Act establishes a statutory distinction between whether I am *liable* for the damage, or *strictly liable*. In a scenario where I am strictly liable, you do not have to prove that I was negligent in my management of the animal. Broadly, that applies if the animal belongs to a dangerous species, or is unusually dangerous in itself. (There has been very complex litigation on this point which I am not discussing here.) If my cat is not a real vicious bastard of a cat, but just a regular cat, then I can still be liable for damage that he does: it's just not automatic.\n\nFollowing Rachael Mulheron's *Principles of Tort Law* (CUP, 2nd ed., 2016\\), for an action in negligence there are several key points \\-\n\n> Proving that D, the owner/keeper of an animal, owed C a duty of care, where C was injured by that animal, has been a straightforward task.\n> \n> \n> The court must be satisfied that a reasonable person in the position of D, the keeper of the animal, would foresee a real risk of injury to C arising from D's particular acts or omissions in dealing with the animal. Otherwise, in the absence of that foreseeability, a reasonable D would have done nothing different in response to the risk posed by his animal.\n> \n> \n> To fall below the standard of reasonable care as a keeper of an animal, D must have failed to do that which a reasonable keeper would have done (to supervise/fence/control, etc, the animal), or have done something which a reasonable keeper would not have done.\n> \n> \n> In damage\\-by\\-animals cases, C must prove that, as in the usual negligence action, D's failure to supervise/handle/care for the animals caused C's injury on the balance of probabilities.\n\nAs in other negligence cases, there are various defences; if you hassled my cat and it scratched you, then that's your fault and not mine.\n\nFrom the material quoted above, we can see that for a normal cat in the UK, where the owner is not doing anything unusual by letting it roam freely outdoors (as is typical for UK cats), it is going to be hard to meet the tests. Things may be different if D knows that C is allergic to cats, or that the cat has been eyeing up C's delicious prize goldfish, or has a bone to pick with D's own cat and is likely to attack her, or something. Most of the big cases under the Animals Act have involved animals who are more likely to cause damage, such as dogs, horses and cows; a cat is only legally different because (1\\) unlike for dogs, horses and cows, there are no special rules applying to cats, and (2\\) factually, most cats don't do much harm.\n\nTo that point, even if D is liable in the way described, C may not get very much out of them by way of damages. Defecation in C's garden is not pleasant, but is probably not worth a lot of money either.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A neighborhood dispute has arisen between Mr. Smith and Mrs. Jones regarding Mrs. Jones' cat, Fluffy. Fluffy frequently enters Mr. Smith's garden, causing damage to his prized flowers and defecating in his vegetable patch. Mr. Smith, who is highly allergic to cats, has also suffered several allergy attacks when Fluffy has entered his property. Mrs. Jones argues that cats have a \"right to roam\" and she cannot be held liable for Fluffy's actions. Based on UK law, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Mrs. Jones is strictly liable for all damages caused by Fluffy, as per the Animals Act 1971.\nB) Cats have a legally protected \"right to roam\" in the UK, exempting their owners from any liability.\nC) Mr. Smith has no legal recourse against Mrs. Jones, as cats cannot commit the tort of trespass.\nD) Mrs. Jones may be liable for negligence if it can be proven she failed to take reasonable precautions, given her knowledge of Mr. Smith's allergy and the repeated damage to his property.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While cats are not subject to \"cattle trespass\" rules and cannot commit trespass themselves, their owners can still be held liable for negligence under certain circumstances. In this case, Mrs. Jones may be liable if it can be shown that a reasonable person in her position would foresee a real risk of injury or damage (considering Mr. Smith's known allergy and the repeated property damage), and that she failed to take reasonable precautions to prevent it. The belief in a cat's \"right to roam\" is not legally binding, and there is no specific law granting such a right. Option A is incorrect because strict liability typically applies only to dangerous animals or species, which a normal house cat is not. Option B is a common misconception without legal basis. Option C overlooks the possibility of owner liability through negligence."

If it makes a difference, assume the article is a criticism of the advertisements and the underlying businesses.\n\nAre there any other considerations such as trademarks when reusing images from internet advertisements in this way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fair use is always a fact\\-driven issue, and the details matter. That said, copying a single ad in order to criticism the ad, or comment on it, is very likely to be found to be fair use. If only a section of the ad were shown, to illuminate the point being made, that would make a fair use holding more likely. Or if the entire ad was shown in low resolution's for context, and a detail shown in higher resolution, that would also help.\n\nSuch an ad is largely factual, not creative in the way that a work of fiction or fine art is, which leans toward fair use. Such a reproduction of the ad will not serve as a replacement, nor harm the market for the ad, which leans toward fair use. The use seems to be transformative, which leans significantly toward fair use. If the whole ad is shown that leans somewhat against fair use, but that does not prevent the use being held to be fair use.\n\nAs for trademark protection, that is not likely to be an issue. Trademarks are protected against being used **in trade** (also known as \"in commerce\") without permission. This means using the mark to label, identify, or advertise a product or service of the same general type as the product the mark is properly associated with. Using the mark, or a similar mark, in such a way that people are likely to be confused into thinking that a product or service came from the same source as the mark, or approved, endorsed or sponsored by the mark owner, is usually infringement. Using the mark to discuss the product or service, and in particular using it as the name of the product or service, is ***nominative use***. Nominative use is not infringement. Using an ad that includes trademarks to discuss the associated product is a form of nominative use.",

They have already done hundreds of DDoS attacks and keep doing them several times a week.\n* general harassment of several different people\n* finding the family members of some of these people and harassing them as well\n* death threats (not ones that could be taken seriously but this is not necessarily clear to some of the people that received them)\n\nPolice was contacted in the past but they didn't express much interest in taking any action. This person is located in a relatively faraway country and there's no core member of our community from the same geographical area.\n\nOne thing is clear. This person has no life and they get a kick out of what they're doing so they are not going to stop by themselves any time soon.\nThere's a good few people in our community that are sick of this person and willing to take whatever action is needed for them to stop.\n\nWe know this person's full name, location, primary IP address and more, however, it would be difficult to actually prove their real identity to the authorities. It would be easy to retaliate in a similar manner to what we received but that's not what we want to do. We also don't want to flood police departments with complaints in hope that they will finally do something once they get annoyed enough. But if we can we want to use our numerical advantage and finally put a stop to this madness.\n\nThe offender is located in Turkey. The affected servers and people are located in several European countries and the USA.\n\nWhat's the best course of action to take?\n\nI apologize if this question is not fit for this site but I'll take any pointers I can get to help with this situation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: * You **believe** you know the address.  \n\nI write \"believe\" because this might be yet another level of misdirection or a [systematic error in IP geolocation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/08/10/lawsuit-how-a-quiet-kansas-home-wound-up-with-600-million-ip-addresses-and-a-world-of-trouble/). But assume that your information is true. There is a state where this happens, with law enforcement agencies.\n* Is the conduct **criminal** where the perpetrator lives?  \n\nCountries interpret the freedom of speech in different ways. In many, it is no crime to use a VPN to disguise the own IP, or to use an alias on the web. But in many countries, the activities you describe would amount to stalking, which can be a crime.\n* You mention that the police takes little interest.  \n\nIn many countries, the police prioritize specific, real\\-world incidents (cars being stolen, drugs being sold) over having to resolve an IP and probably getting nowhere. But it is often possible for the victim to file first a criminal complaint, and then a complaint against the prosecution if the case is not charged.\n\nAs long as you do not name countries, I cannot get more specific.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a case of persistent online harassment across international borders, what is the most appropriate initial legal action for the victims to take?\n\nA) Immediately retaliate against the harasser using similar tactics\nB) File a criminal complaint in the country where the harasser is believed to be located\nC) Continuously contact multiple police departments until action is taken\nD) Attempt to prove the harasser's identity to authorities without filing a formal complaint\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect and likely illegal. Retaliating with similar tactics could escalate the situation and potentially make the victims liable for criminal charges themselves.\n\nB) is the correct answer. Filing a criminal complaint in the suspected country of origin is the most appropriate first step. This establishes a legal record and may prompt local authorities to investigate, especially if the behavior constitutes stalking or other crimes in that jurisdiction.\n\nC) is not advisable as it could be seen as harassment of law enforcement and may not lead to productive results.\n\nD) is premature. Attempting to prove the harasser's identity without first filing a formal complaint may not be taken seriously by authorities and could potentially compromise any future legal action.\n\nThe correct approach is to file a formal criminal complaint in the appropriate jurisdiction, which can then lead to a proper investigation by relevant authorities."
