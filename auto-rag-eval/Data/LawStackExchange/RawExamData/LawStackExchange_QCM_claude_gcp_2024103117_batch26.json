I was asked if we had a way to track how many users have declined analytics in case we needed that information for an audit.\n\nWe are, of course, storing a strictly necessary cookie to remember a decline decision on the user's browser (client side only). However, wouldn't collecting server side analytics about a user declining analytics (even if anonymous) be an inherit violation of GDPR.\n\nThe more I think about this the more I'm getting a headache. Would a GDPR audit ever ask for this information or would we shoot ourselves in the foot by collecting this information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you could *count* decline\\-events, but not *track* users who declined tracking. But I also think such information isn't useful for demonstrating compliance. Therefore, you should avoid storing extra data about people who do not give consent.\n\nWhen consent is required for analytics.\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR provides a general framework for processing personal data. The ePrivacy Directive (ePD) overrides this general framework when it comes to cookies and similar technologies related to accessing information on the end user's device. Per ePD, such access is only allowed when it is strictly necessary to provide the service explicitly requested by a user, otherwise consent is required. Thus, analytics cookies require consent and setting an analytics\\-declined cookie is strictly necessary.\n\nBut this consent requirement relates specifically to storage cookies, not to collecting analytics data. Thus, you might have a legitimate interest in collecting data with cookie\\-less analytics, which could involve counting cookie\\-consent decline events. Unfortunately, most analytics systems collect very broad categories of data and cannot be limited to a necessary subset. Even such limited analytics (unless they are truly strictly necessary for operating the site) should support an opt\\-out. I don't think you could legitimately gather analytics about such opt\\-out events.\n\nGDPR audits.\n------------\n\nYour motivation for collecting statistics about consent\\-decline events is to be prepared for a GDPR audit. This is probably not necessary, but it depends.\n\nIt might be useful to distinguish between internal/voluntary audits and data protection audits by the supervisory authority.\n\n* You might voluntarily review your compliance to convince stakeholders that you're compliant, and such voluntary audits might be part of the *appropriate technical and organizational measures* a data controller has implemented in accordance with Art 24, Art 25, and Art 32 GDPR.\n\nYou should collect any statistics you need for this purpose, e.g. to ensure that the opt\\-in rate looks realistic. But since you can set the parameters of this audit, it makes no sense to collect data \u201cjust in case\u201d.\n* Under Art 58(1\\), your supervisory authority can audit your data processing and can compel you to provide any information it requires. This is similar to how a tax authority can compel you to produce business records for auditing purposes.\n\nThis is closely related with your general obligation to be able to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR (Art 5(2\\)). More specifically, the controller is required per Art 7(1\\) to be able to demonstrate that the data subjects have given valid consent, but does not prescribe how to demonstrate this.\n\nHow to demonstrate that valid consent was given.\n------------------------------------------------\n\nFor demonstrating that consent was given, there are no clear best practices. However, this topic is briefly discussed in [EDPB guidelines 05/2020 on consent](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052020-consent-under-regulation-2016679_en). They recommend that you retain records about the following:\n\n* that a data subject in a given case has consented\n* how consent was obtained\n* when consent was obtained\n* information provided to data subject at the time\n* that the controller's workflow meets all relevant criteria for valid consent\n\nSome of these are process\\-level concerns about how you ask for consent. For example, you might record video walkthroughs of your consent management solution to demonstrate how consent can be declined, given, and revoked. You should definitely keep a version history of the text and information that was displayed to users when they were asked for consent. I think you should also be able to explain in your front\\-end code how the result from your consent management solution is used to load relevant features (and that they aren't loaded before consent is given). If a feature or service is made conditional on consent, it might be good to have a short written analysis that consent is still freely given under the requirements of Art 7(4\\).\n\nBut other aspects relate to the individual data subject and the individual consent\\-giving event. Some consent management solutions send a small record about the consent to a backend server where it is stored with a timestamp, so that it can be later traced that and when consent was given. I've also seen consent management tools that show a timeline of events to the user (when consent was requested, and when consent for which purpose was given and revoked). I think such detailed insight into an pseudonymous individual's consent status is a very powerful way to demonstrate compliance.\n\nWhat is not relevant here is information about data subjects who declined consent in the first place. Consent means opt\\-in. The default is that no consent is given. To demonstrate that consent was obtained in a valid manner, information about data subjects who didn't consent isn't necessary or useful.\n\nSo I expect that you would be fine in an audit without collecting such data. In fact, the lack of a clear purpose and necessity for collecting this data could be argued to be without legal basis and violate the GDPR's data minimization principle. And even when recording information about those data subjects who did consent, the EDPB guidelines remind us that this \u201cshould not in itself lead to excessive amounts of additional data processing\u201d.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to GDPR guidelines, which of the following approaches is most appropriate for demonstrating compliance with consent requirements?\n\nA) Collecting and storing data about users who declined analytics consent\nB) Recording video walkthroughs of the consent management solution\nC) Tracking individual users who opted out of analytics\nD) Counting the total number of consent decline events\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \n\nOption A is incorrect because collecting data about users who declined consent is unnecessary and potentially violates GDPR's data minimization principle. \n\nOption B is correct. The EDPB guidelines recommend retaining records about how consent was obtained, and video walkthroughs can demonstrate the consent management process, including how consent can be declined, given, and revoked.\n\nOption C is incorrect as it violates user privacy and goes against the spirit of GDPR by tracking users who specifically opted out.\n\nOption D, while less invasive than A or C, is still not the best approach for demonstrating compliance. Simply counting decline events doesn't provide insight into the consent process itself.\n\nThe correct approach (B) focuses on documenting the consent management process rather than collecting data about individual users or aggregate statistics.

This then involves expert testimony regarding what that standard is.

But from what I read online it seems that a processor is anyone that deals with any personal data, even partial data, as part of a service provided to the controller. So it sounds like *everyone* that deal with personal data as part of their job is a processor, except the end users of the service. But since processors must be bound by a specific contract to deal with the needs of the controller (article 28 says \"processes the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller), then I'm afraid it will soon become a huge mess with a gazillion contracts to sign.\n\nFor example, John Doe has a website with a contact form. The contact form collects data, and the end user should accept the privacy policy written by John Doe. John Doe is the controller. However, John Doe's website is managed by a web agency! Is this web agency a processor? I guess so. So John doe needs to write a contract and have the web agency sign it. If every website owner does this, the web agency will have to read and sign hundreds of contracts. But the web agency hosts the sites on a web hosting provider, which in turn becomes another processor! And they use Gmail, provided by Google, which in turn is yet another processor that will have to sign millions of contracts. And so on, in an potentially endless cycle, just thinking that if you read your work email from your iPhone you might have to send a contract to Apple too. \n\nIt seems a huge mess to me, but I'm not sure I get it right. It looks like everyone is a processor except the end user, but the confusing thing is that the the law seems to say that it's the controller the one who decides the contractual terms, so it's not just a matter of accepting a privacy policy like we have been doing so far. So far, Google has provided a service to you, and you agreed to their privacy policy. Now it seems it's you, if you are a controller or a processor, that have to come up with a contract and Google has to accept it (if they want to). Like it's the other way around compared to the usual privacy policies. Of course this will probably never happen, and Google will probably come up with predefined contracts that both parties can agree on, but at that point what difference would there be between the contract required by GDPR and the usual privacy policies everyone has been using so far?\n\nI hope the question is clear enough. I'm basically very confused about the actual role and duties of processors in real\\-world scenarios.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You premise is correct.

Yes, the GDPR says that a contract between the controller and processor must exist, but [Article 28](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) of the GDPR does not say anything about *how* the controller shall document these instructions. Basically, in cases like the one you describe where John Doe relies on a web agency for having a contact form on the web, there will be a standardized (by the web agency) service agreement between the John Doe (controller) and the web agency (processor). There is nothing stopping the parties from agreeing that this service agreement that John Doe accepted as part of the onboarding procedure is *also* the DPA as required by the GDPR.\n\nPutting something like the following in the service agreement would do it:\n\n> The parties agree that this Service Agreement between You (controller) and Us (processor) set out Your *complete and final instructions* to Us in relation to the processing of Personal Data and that processing outside the scope of these instructions (if any) shall require prior written agreement between You and Us. You also agree that We may engage Sub\\-processors to process Personal Data on Your behalf.

Nonetheless, news media seem to often conflate these two things and I didn't yet find a clear *direct* statement that they are distinct.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: People often use \"passport\" as a [metonym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy) of \"citizenship,\" but that should not lead one to mistake the two. Notably, many US citizens live their entire lives without having a passport.\n\nA fairly brief search didn't turn up an explicit statement from an official government source that passport revocation does not affect US citizenship, but that is quite clearly the case if one reads between the lines of the fairly sizeable statutory and regulatory provisions governing both. Nationality law is codified at [8 USC 1401 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III), with the sections governing loss of nationality beginning at [8 USC 1481](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/chapter-12/subchapter-III/part-III). The regulations concerning nationality generally are found at [8 CFR 301 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/8/chapter-I/subchapter-C), but there are not many regulations concerning loss of nationality.\n\nPassport law is found in an entirely different title of the US Code, and titles are the highest level of division in the code. It is in [22 USC 411 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-4). There are provisions that restrict eligibility for a passport scattered around in there without any section applying specifically to passport revocation. That is found in the related regulations.\n\nPassport regulations are codified at [22 CFR Part 51](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/part-51), with revocation being the subject of [Subpart E, which is 51\\.60 and following](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/22/part-51/subpart-E).\n\nThere may be an explicit statement in the regulations that passport revocation does not affect citizenship. I did not look very thoroughly. But a bit of logical reasoning shows why it must be so:\n\n1. The conditions for loss of US nationality are very well defined. They are also fairly tightly circumscribed by several decisions of the US supreme court in the decades following the second world war.\n2. The conditions for revocation of a passport are much less strict; as an example, a passport may be revoked under 22 CFR 51\\.62 and 51\\.60 if the bearer \"is the subject of an outstanding Federal warrant of arrest for a felony, including a warrant issued under the Federal Fugitive Felon Act (18 U.S.C. 1073\\).\"\n3. US nationality is required to hold a US passport, but US nationals do not need to have a US passport.\n4. Therefore, a US passport may be revoked for a reason that cannot lead to loss of US nationality, and, when that happens, US nationality is retained.\n5. The condition mentioned in point 2 is clearly insufficient for depriving someone of US nationality, not least because the subject of an arrest warrant is only suspected of having committed a crime. Depriving a suspect of their liberty is acceptable to the extent necessary to bring that person to trial, but further deprivations beyond that end would violate the constitution's guarantee of due process.\n\n---\n\nA word on \"nationality\" and \"citizenship\" in US law is in order, lest the use of the two terms seem inconsistent or arbitrary. US nationality is broader than US citizenship. All US citizens are US nationals, so loss of US nationality implies loss of US citizenship. However, there are some people who are US nationals without being US citizens, so it is more precise to speak of \"loss of nationality\" than \"loss of citizenship,\" and indeed that is the term used in US nationality law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between U.S. passport revocation and U.S. citizenship?\n\nA) Revocation of a U.S. passport automatically results in the loss of U.S. citizenship.\nB) U.S. passport revocation and loss of citizenship are governed by the same legal statutes and regulations.\nC) A U.S. passport can be revoked for reasons that would not be sufficient to revoke citizenship.\nD) All U.S. citizens must maintain a valid passport to retain their citizenship status.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because passport revocation does not automatically lead to loss of citizenship.

Will the friend who pushed be charged with manslaughter or homicide, if he were to be charged at all? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [Canadian law](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-51.html), causing the death of human being is homicide. If the homicide is \"culpable\", it is an offense (crime). In the described scenario, it might be culpable homicide if the death was due to \"criminal negligence\". That would be the case if in doing a thing, the person \"shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons\".\n\nWe've now reached the end of what statutory law has to say about the question. Court cases take us [a bit further in understanding criminal negligence](http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/C/CriminalNegligence.aspx). The wisdom of the courts is distilled to ts essence in jury instructions, which say\n\n> The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused's\n>  conduct showed a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonable\n>  person in the circumstances; and that a reasonable person in the same\n>  circumstances would have foreseen that this conduct posed a risk of\n>  bodily harm.\n\n[R. v.

It requires some degree of awareness or advertence to the\n>  threat to the lives or safety of others or alternatively a wilful\n>  blindness to that threat which is culpable in light of the gravity of\n>  the risk assumed.\n\nUltimately, though, the fact\\-finder must evaluate the behavior against a highly subjective standard as to \"what a reasonable man would do\". I cannot imagine a scenario where shoving a person realistically could lead to them falling into traffic and getting killed but there the shoving was ordinary horseplay. Pushing a person in the direction of oncoming traffic is abnormal behavior that shows shocking disregard for the probable harm caused to another. But perhaps there is some innocent scenario where this was really just a tragic outcome.

In Canadian law, this situation could potentially be classified as culpable homicide due to criminal negligence. The key factors are:\n\n1. The death was caused by an action (pushing), which meets the basic definition of homicide.\n2. Whether it's culpable homicide depends on if the action shows \"wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.\"\n3. The court would consider if the conduct showed a \"marked departure from the conduct of a reasonable person\" and if a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk of bodily harm.\n4. The specific circumstances would be evaluated against the subjective standard of what a reasonable person would do.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because murder requires intent to cause death, which is not present in this scenario.

See for example [ch. 35 of Title 12](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/chapter-35).

As far as I know, there is no law against asking for information that can't be given. This does assume, however, that your mother does not have a legal right to the information (which could arise from some form of co\\-signing). Also, would assume that they have a normal privacy policy, and not one where they say \"We will tell your mother if she asks\" (they would have [informed you of that](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/6801), so read the privacy policy).

One might have the opinion that judicial review is just the unelected branch of government overriding decisions of the executive (or their officials). If so, that's rather undemocratic. If you believe that judges are merely applying their preconceived opinions in coming to a ruling, then there is no point studying it in detail (hence lazy).\n\nFalsifiability is a useful property in a theory. If I believe that there is no point studying the rulings because judges are just pulling answers out of the air, then there isn't any evidence you can provide to convince me otherwise. I might be correct in my belief but it isn't one based on evidence.\n\nWhat the author is arguing is that, if you're a student of the law, you need to study rulings in detail and look at the statutes, authorities and precedents quoted.

Option B correctly captures this nuanced view, emphasizing the complex legal reasoning involved in judicial review. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the author acknowledges that normative outlooks do influence judicial review.

Would the execution be delayed until she gave birth?

If it is found that the female is not pregnant, the warden must execute the judgment; if it is found that she is pregnant the warden must suspend the execution of the judgment, and transmit a certified copy of the finding and certificate to the Governor.

The execution would be suspended until the woman is no longer pregnant. Once the pregnancy is over, the sentence could potentially be carried out, unless other legal interventions occur. This approach is consistent with both U.S. federal law and international agreements like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Option A is incorrect as it violates federal law. Option B goes beyond what the law stipulates, as it only mentions pregnancy, not a weaning period. Option D is also incorrect, as the law doesn't automatically commute the sentence to life imprisonment; it only suspends the execution during pregnancy."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38806/estate-planning-spouses-with-survivorship-clause-could-a-named-beneficiary", "docs_id": 38806, "title": "Estate Planning - Spouses with survivorship clause - could a named beneficiary &quot;double up&quot; on simultaneous death scenario?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Lets say there is a married couple and they both have identical wills; with a survivorship clause along the lines of:\n\n* I direct that the reside of my estate shall be paid, transferred and delivered to my spouse (xxx) for his/her own use... provided s/he survives me for a period of (30\\) thirty days.\n* In the event my spouse (xxx) predeceases me or does not survive me for a period of (30\\) thirty days, then: give $10k to the church and split the remainder in equal shares to my children.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* if both spouses have the same children and die at the same time, does the church get $10K or $20K ?\n* if the church gets $20k; how would you change the will so the church get $10K total regardless who dies first and the time between the deaths.\n\nLinks to source would be greatly appreciated.

In this scenario, John (65) would be presumed to have died first, and Jane (63) would be presumed to have survived him. However, since Jane didn't survive for the required 30 days, John's will would take effect as if Jane had predeceased him. This means the church would receive $10,000 from John's estate.

Courts don't often look kindly on actions whose sole purpose is enabling someone else to do something that is prohibited. If you're making a script that helps people do something they're allowed to do, in a way that's better for at least somebody and makes nobody worse off, that's often a different story.\n\nMajor websites will generally indicate whether or not you're allowed to do this. \n\nSome sites are fairly strict about prohibiting scraping (e.g. Craigslist, which [at one point shut down Padmapper](http://blog.padmapper.com/2012/06/22/bye-bye-craigslist/)'s alternative more\\-useful presentation of their content). \n\nOthers, like Wikipedia, much more actively encourage reusing content from their sites as long as you meet [certain conditions such as a link back to the original source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a script that scrapes content from various news websites and reformats it for easier reading on tablets.

While getting permission is the safest approach, it's not always legally required if the script complies with the website's terms.\n\nOption D is incorrect because using login credentials provided by the user doesn't automatically make the script illegal.

This section does not apply to an adult who transfers a dangerous weapon to a person under 18 years of age for use only in target practice under the adult's supervision or in a course of instruction in the traditional and proper use of the dangerous weapon under the adult's supervision.  \n> \n> (b) This section does not apply to a person under 18 years of age who is a member of the armed forces or national guard and who possesses or is armed with a dangerous weapon in the line of duty.

This section applies only to an adult who transfers a firearm to a person under 18 years of age if the person under 18 years of age is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304 and 29\\.593 or to an adult who is in violation of s. 941\\.28\\.\n\n2 things to note:\n\n* (1\\) takes care to include, in the list of dangerous weapons: nunchaku, shuriken and manrikigusari. While the first 2 are more or less familiar to everyone knows anything about Japanese martial arts, the last one had to be looked up by everyone following the case to discover that it's the \"secret weapon of the Ninja\"(even more than the shuriken).\n* (3\\.c) says that the whole of this entire section applies\\[adding the brackets to make following the formal logic easier] **only** if (the person under 18 is in violation of 941\\.28\\[barrel length under 16 inches]) **or** (is not in compliance with ss. 29\\.304\\[Restrictions on hunting and use of firearms by persons under 16 years of age] **and** 29\\.593\\[Requirement for certificate of accomplishment to obtain hunting approval]).\n\nIn programming terms(for those so inclined), 3\\.C could be written as:\n\n```\nIF ((barrelLengthInches < 16) OR (huntingUnder16Applies AND huntingCertificateApplies))\nTHEN statute948.60Applies\nELSE statute948.60DoesNotApply\n\n```\n\nSince the barrel length is over 16'' and Rittenhouse is over 16 and no hunting permit was required for his activities, the whole section of the law did not apply. Assistant District Attorney James Kraus [argued](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/explainer-judge-drop-rittenhouse-gun-charge-81285031) that the exception renders the state\u2019s prohibition on minors possessing dangerous weapons meaningless. In essence, that the legislators drafting that law spent too much time watching cheesy early 90's action movies and thinking of how to save Wisconsinites from the Ninja threat, to draft the law properly, so it should be read according to its intent from the title of the section.\n\nHowever, there is a binding Common Law precedent, dating back from the 16th century called the \"Rule of Lenity\", also called \"Strict Constructionism\" in the US, whereby if the legislature screws up, it's the legislature's problem. In the original case, the law in England forbade \"felonious stealing of **Horses**, Geldings or Mares\". A thief was caught, but argued that since he only stole **one** horse and the law specified horses, the law didn't apply to him. He was let off and the law hastily rectified. Pre\\-revolutionary Common Law precedent is binding in the US and it was re\\-affirmed multiple times, e.g. United States v.

If the copyright holder stops offering the work under BSD terms, that does not lessen the fact that you *already did* receive the work under BSD terms. The copyright holder may choose to stop distributing new copies to other people under the old license, but the old license grant offered to you in the past will persist, unless either\n\n1. the license expires, or\n2. the licencor explicitly revokes your license grant.\n\nThe BSD license (and any OSI\\-approved license) does not have an expiration date, so we do not need to worry about the first possibility.\n\nA license can be revoked only if either\n\n1. the terms of the license explicitly allow the licencor to do so, or\n2. the license was granted in such a way that the licencor received no economic consideration for the license grant.\n\nThe BSD license is silent on revocability, so we must see whether there is economic consideration involved. According to [*Jacobsen v. Katzer*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17776182574171214893), a public open\\-source license grant may have economic consideration, even absent any exchange of money:\n\n> Traditionally, copyright owners sold their copyrighted material in exchange for money. The lack of money changing hands in open source licensing should not be presumed to mean that there is no economic consideration, however. There are substantial benefits, including economic benefits, to the creation and distribution of copyrighted works under public licenses that range far beyond traditional license royalties. For example, program creators may generate market share for their programs by providing certain components free of charge. Similarly, a programmer or company may increase its national or international reputation by incubating open source projects. Improvement to a product can come rapidly and free of charge from an expert not even known to the copyright holder.\n\n(See also [Are licenses irrevocable by default?](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/q/4012/50) on OpenSource.SE.)\n\nThus, there is a strong possibility that there is consideration involved in your case, and the licencor may not be able to revoke the license already granted to you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company has been using an open-source product licensed under the BSD license for several years in their application.

According to the documentation, if a company received a copy of software under a particular license in the past (in this case, the BSD license), that license grant persists even if the copyright holder changes the license for future distributions. The BSD license does not have an expiration date, and it cannot be easily revoked due to the economic consideration involved in open-source licensing, as established in the Jacobsen v. Katzer case.

Could Stripe successfully sue the new company for using such a slogan?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A slogan such as \"The Stripe of Bitcoin\" might well be taken to indicate that the seller of a product or service is trading on the good reputation associates with the mark \"stripe\". If so, that would probably be a form of trademark infringement, assuming thst \"Stripe\" is protected as a trademark, unless the permission of the holder of the trademark \"Stripe\" was obtained.

One can, for example market a soft drink with the tag \"*The cola that's better than Coke*\" without permission from Coca\\-cola (which i doubt anyone would ever get).

It implies a connection or association with the trademarked company Stripe, which could lead to customer confusion, especially since both involve financial services (payment processing and cryptocurrency). This is not a case of nominative use, as it's not simply referring to Stripe for comparison or compatibility. It's also not clearly competitive use, as it doesn't explicitly state it's better than or different from Stripe. Instead, it seems to be trading on Stripe's reputation, which is a form of trademark infringement.

Any content on YT is protected by copyright. Transcribing a movie would be creating a derivative work, which requires permission from the copyright owner. The same goes for transcribing a half of a movie. The minimal individual components of a text, the words and phrases, are not protected by copyright. A sentence, or two, or ten, get you into the realm of fair use analysis. There are 4 core factors and a \"tie\\-breaker\" about transformativeness, where e.g. if you only take a tiny bit that's consistent with fair use, if it's taken for an educational / research purpose that's pro fair use, if it's for a non\\-profit reason that's a vote for fair use, and a transcription is highly transformative.

It was not the currency of an EU member state, and even if it was it would've been permitted for personal use...\n\nbut I feel uncomfortable having inadvertently brushed so close to the boundary between what's permitted and what's outlawed.\n\nWith the flurry of new regulations introduced since the Russian invasion, I suspect that there might be a lot more that I'm not aware of. The concerns of (new) laws that affect us personally without us knowing about them it's a generic one, and I know that \"Ignorance of the Law is No Excuse\".\n\nUsually the concern is about [new emergency regulations which affect large swaths of the population](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/54905/is-ignorance-of-the-law-a-valid-excuse-for-not-following-emergency-laws-with-no), but here I think that the issue is for laws (or interpretation thereof) that affects some [obscure circumstances](https://www.layroots.com/lobster-law-101/). Due to the relatively small population of Russian citizens in the European Union (EU), and due to the extremely small amount of travellers visiting Russia from the EU, I understand that regulations that affects only those in these circumstances are not be advertised as much as for other laws, but this does not answer the question... how to mitigate risks in accidentally breaching recently introduced new regulations? How to be aware of all of them?\n\nI'm interested in answers relevant for any place in the world, but especially EU/EEA and neighboring countries (UK, Switzerland, etc.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that, as a practical matter, you can't be aware of every change in the law that could conceivably affect you. Even lawyers don't have enough time to keep up with every change in the law until after a specific legal issue presents itself. Firms selling legal research products have scores and hundreds of employees working full time every day to keep track of every change in the law, to the exclusion of all other working time in their lives.\n\nYou can read the mainstream media and trade publications in fields in which you are engaged which often address these questions. You can take continuing education courses in your occupation or profession. You can confer with a lawyer before taking action in areas where you aren't familiar with the law. You can proceed with caution when you do something that everyone else you know of who is similarly situated is not doing. You can pay special attention to the news and government provided information during periods of major emergencies.\n\nBut, the rule that ignorance of the law is no excuse is sometimes simply harsh and unfair. Nonetheless, this rule is the law with respect to most kinds of laws in most legal systems.\n\nAs a practical matter, law enforcement authorities and courts will often show leniency towards someone who innocently violates a new law of which they were unaware, at least the first time, sometimes letting them off with a warning or a minimal penalty.

In other words, it governs using personal property as collateral for loans.\n\nUnder the UCC, there are two important steps: attachment and perfection. A security interest is effective against the party granting it when it \"attaches\" usually immediately upon the signing of the security agreement. But, a security interest is not effective in bankruptcy or against third parties until it is \"perfected\".\n\nHow is a security interest perfected?\n\nYou have to look at Sections 301\\-324 of Article 9 of the current version of the Uniform Commercial Code, or, in states that haven't adopted the most recent version of the Uniform Commercial Code, Sections 301 et seq. of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nThe way a security interest is perfected varies by the type of property involved. \n\nSecurity interests in some property can only be perfected by possession (i.e. a pawn transaction) or control. \n\nPerfection of some kinds of property (e.g. automobiles, airplanes, copyrights) are governed by specific laws outside the UCC: security interests in automobiles must be shown on the certificate of title, security interests in airplanes and copyrights are perfected in special national registries.\n\nWhen there is no special rule that applies, security interests are perfected by filing with a state level official, usually the state government's Secretary of State for the state where the debtor resides or is organized if the debtor is an entity.\n\nHistorically, under the 1998 version of the UCC adopted in all U.S. states, in addition to the state filing, it was also necessary to make a filing in the real estate records of the county where the property was located for certain kinds of personal property with a connection to real estate, the most common of which were \"fixtures\" which are items of tangible personal property that are attached to real estate, and for security interests in growing crops which are by their very nature attached to the land upon which they grow. Counties have never shared their filings with the state, so a state level search is not sufficient to determine if fixtures or agricultural property are lien free in states where there a valid filings made under the 1998 version of the law that are still in force.\n\nThe requirements to perfect an agricultural lien or a lien in fixtures in the modern version of Article 9 of the UCC (finalized for adoption by states in 2010\\) are found at Section 310 of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which dispenses with the county level filing requirement of the 1998 Act. \n\nThe [2010 version of Article 9 has currently been adopted by every U.S. state](http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=UCC%20Article%209%20Amendments%20(2010)). There was a strong push for all states to adopt the 2010 amendments with a uniform effective date of July 1, 2013, so as to allow states to adopt the amendments uniformly and have them become operative simultaneously (thereby avoiding unnecessary conflicts and confusion with respect to interstate transactions). Mostly this was successful, but there may have been isolated exceptions.\n\nFor the most part, the grandfathered filings have now expired. But there may be some states, particularly those which were late adopters, where grandfathered filings are still effective.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company in State X wants to perfect a security interest in fixtures attached to a debtor's real property.

If adopted after July 1, 2013, they may need to file in both state and county offices to cover potential grandfathered filings.\n\nD) The company must always file in the county recorder's office for fixtures, regardless of state law, as fixtures are considered part of real property.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it acknowledges the complexities introduced by the transition from the 1998 version of UCC Article 9 to the 2010 amendments. While all states have adopted the 2010 amendments, which generally require only state-level filing for fixtures, the timing of adoption matters. States that adopted the amendments later may still have valid grandfathered filings under the old system, which required county-level filings for fixtures. To ensure complete protection, the company should investigate when State X adopted the amendments and consider the possibility of existing county-level filings if the adoption was after the standard July 1, 2013 date. This approach is the most thorough and accounts for potential variations in state implementation timelines."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44738/do-firefighters-contitute-a-legislative-power", "docs_id": 44738, "title": "Do firefighters contitute a legislative power?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to this article [ref here](https://dcdirtylaundry.com/new-york-fire-commissioners-call-for-new-9-11-investigation/), [ref here](https://www.globalresearch.ca/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-make-history-call-new-911-investigation/5684982), [ref here](https://www.zerohedge.com/health/new-york-area-fire-commissioners-demand-new-911-investigation) and [ref here:](https://www.ae911truth.org/news/540-new-york-area-fire-commissioners-make-history-call-for-new-9-11-investigation) \n\n> ...History has just been made, as the first legislative body in the\n>  country officially announces their support for reopening the 9/11\n>  investigation.

Yesterday, it was [reported](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/) that a big security flaw existed in virtually all Intel processors sold in the last decade. Intel has known about it for several months and has informed the OS vendors so they could publish patches before the vulnerability was made public, as is the custom in these cases. This looks to my non\\-lawyer eyes like blatant insider trading. Is it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The accusation would be the crime of securities fraud (\"insider trading\" is legally meaningless), under [15 USC 78j(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78j). There is a bit more elaboration in [17 CFR 240\\.10b5\\-1](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=se17.4.240_110b5_61&rgn=div8). That law prohibits using \"any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in\" in connection with a securities transaction. Under [15 USC 78ff](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78ff), violation of the law can result in a fine of up to $5 million and 20 years, thus it is a crime. As a crime, the standard of proof required is must higher than it in for a civil forfeiture (which can be as low as \"reasonable suspicion\"). In the US, and pursuant to the Due Process clause, that requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, that is (from [in re Winship](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/397/358/case.html)), \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged\". \n\nThe statute itself does not state the elements that must be proven to secure a conviction, but they can be discerned based on jury instructions (which are circuit\\-specific). The 9th Circuit instruction is [here](http://www3.ce9.uscourts.gov/jury-instructions/node/415). You can see that there are 4 specific allegations that have to be chosen between, and the prosecutor has to have at least alleged one of those prohibited acts (so that the jury can decide if the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did that thing).\n\nThe evidence you have presented could constitute \"reasonable suspicion\", but not \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\". If we had a different standard of proof in criminal trials, where it was sufficient to just suspect based on a small bit of evidence that a person may have done something prohibited, then the conclusion could be different. Or, if you had stronger evidence surrounding the sale, your argument might carry a bit more weight. In other words, criminal prosecution is based on quite a lot of specific and objective evidence about what happened. An example of the kind of evidence and allegations required to get the ball rolling can be seen [here](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/994881/download); for \"insider trading\" specifically, look [here](https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/980156/download) (this case is based on an FBI investigation, where an agent will presumably testify to hearing the defendant state a plan to violate the law).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a potential securities fraud case against a CEO who sold company shares shortly before a major security flaw in the company's products was publicly disclosed, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal standards and requirements for prosecution?\n\nA) The prosecution only needs to establish reasonable suspicion to secure a conviction for securities fraud.\n\nB) The standard of proof for a criminal securities fraud case is lower than that required for a civil forfeiture case.\n\nC) To secure a conviction, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime as outlined in specific jury instructions.\n\nD) The mere act of selling shares before negative information becomes public is sufficient evidence to convict a CEO of securities fraud.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In a criminal securities fraud case, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the crime as outlined in specific jury instructions. This is a higher standard than reasonable suspicion (ruling out A) or the standard for civil forfeiture cases (ruling out B). The mere act of selling shares before negative information becomes public, without additional evidence, is not sufficient for conviction (ruling out D). The documentation emphasizes the need for \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime,\" and mentions that jury instructions outline the specific elements that must be proven. This high standard of proof and the requirement to prove specific elements make option C the most accurate statement regarding the legal standards and requirements for prosecution in such a case."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78777/which-country-should-prosecute-cross-border-criminal-gross-negligence", "docs_id": 78777, "title": "Which country should prosecute cross border criminal (gross) negligence?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is inspired by the second crash of the [Boeing 737 MAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX_groundings).

This can include:\n\n1. The country where the negligent action originated\n2. Countries whose citizens were victims\n3. The country where the crash occurred\n4. Countries with laws extending to crimes affecting their citizens abroad\n\nOption A is incorrect because it limits prosecution to only one country, which is not the case in international incidents. Option B is also too limiting, as other countries beyond the crash site may have valid reasons to prosecute.

They will be mixed with such lists from thousands of other articles with no correlation between hashes and articles, so it will be virtually impossible to recover an article's text, even after recovering the words and phrases with a dictionary or brute\\-force attack.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is legal to publish clear\\-text words and short phrases from an article, because word and short phrases are not protected by copyright. It is therefore legal to publish a transformation of such words and phrases.\n\nYou can consider a given novel to be a sequence of words and short phrases. It is not legal to sequentially publish the words and phrases of a protected novel, for example as a web page with a million sequentially numbered chapters each containing a couple words of original text. It would be legal to alphabetically list all of the words employed in a novel, along with a token count.\n\nIn order to prove copyright infringement, the plaintiff in the lawsuit would have to prove that the allegedly\\-infringing work as a certain degree of similarity to the protected work. Suppose that the fifth word of the original and supposed copy is \"the\" \u2013 that is not sufficient similarity to prove copying. The question of degree of similarity is a very fact\\-intensive inquiry.\n\nIf a novel is in fact copied and run through the blender to produce unrecognizable word slurry, the plaintiff has the burden of proving the necessary degree of similarity between the original and the copy. This involves exposing the reconstruction procedure. Given any sufficiently large database of words (the word\\-count list mentioned above), one can also select words from the database so that the selection procedure maximally matches the original text (then you devise a mapping post hoc that \"reconstructs\" the original text from the slurry). The defense can counter this argument by positing a different algorithm that converts the slurry into Mother Goose rhymes. Whether not the plaintiff's argument that there was copying depends crucially on the uniqueness of the reconstruction.\n\nSo, the summary. First, words and phrases are not protected by copyright law. Second, entire works, which contain words and phrases, cannot be copied at all regardless of any transformations you apply. The law is stated in terms of copying, and not in terms of \"creating a text that has a particular relation to a protected word\". However, the law also has to deal with the known facts, and cannot require time\\-travel as a means of proving that there was copying. Therefore, the law takes \"similarity\" as a substitute for direct knowledge of an action in the past. It is therefore possible that a person can get away with actual copying, if the plaintiff cannot prove that the basis of the secondary text must have been the plaintiff's protected text.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author wants to publish a list of cryptographic hashes derived from words and short phrases of a copyrighted novel.

Copyright law does not protect individual words or short phrases, so publishing these in some form is not inherently illegal.\n\nOption C makes a distinction that isn't necessarily relevant in copyright law. The legality doesn't solely depend on the order of the words and phrases, but on whether the published content can be proven to be a copy of the protected work.\n\nOption D is the most accurate. Publishing hashes of words and short phrases is likely legal, as individual words and short phrases are not protected by copyright. However, if the plaintiff can prove that the hashed content is derived from the copyrighted work and that the original work can be reconstructed from it (even if difficult), there could still be a basis for a copyright infringement claim.

The practice is akin to selling chicken as \"white beef\" at beef prices.\n\nIs is not only is it grossly misleading, it is also potentially dangerous.

Legal recourse would have to be via state law. Such legal action is conceivable, for example it would be \"menu fraud\" to sell chuck steak as \"Kobe beef\", and the practice of selling shark meat disks as scallops is likewise illegal. Fish are problematic since multiple species can be commonly called by a single name (sole, halibut, cod, snapper, sardine, herring). It is possible that in a certain market, \"white tuna\" is standardly understood to be albacore tuna, therefore it would be fraudulent to sell escolar as \"white tuna\". That would be the point that has to be proven in a legal action, that the term has a specific interpretation. Analogously, there are a number of creamed vegetable products sold as \"hummus\" which contain no chickpeas (by original definition, hummus *is* chickpeas and not soybeans). By dint of such variant use over time, it is not deceptive to sell mashed soybeans as \"hummus\". The tuna industry may well hope to limit the use of the term \"tuna\", but there is no regulation defining \"white tuna\".
