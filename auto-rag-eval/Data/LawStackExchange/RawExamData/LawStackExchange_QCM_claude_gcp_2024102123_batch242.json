I will give an opinion on both aspects, but first I have to give you a word of warning:\n\n*This case is not clear in the sense that the law can be immediately apply. For a full answer you need the services of a practicing lawyer who does the necessary research. I have a degree in German Law and I have had some practice in IT law, so I know what I am talking about, but I am currently not practicing it and I have done no research for this case. So please, pretty please, don't base any important decision on my opinion. It is a mere guidance, not more.*\n\n**Criminal Law**\n\nThe German Criminal Code (StGB) specifies two cyber crimes explicitly:\n\n1. Computer Fraud (Computerbetrug, [\u00a7 263a StGB](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/263a.html)), which you violate when you gain some illegal monetary advantage using a computer, for example a hacker using your stolen credit card data to transfer funds to his account.\n2. Computer Sabotage (Computersabotage, [\u00a7 303b StGB](https://dejure.org/gesetze/StGB/303b.html)), which applies when you cause damage with a computer, for example a hacker attacking the power grid.\n\nThe second option clearly does not apply here, but the first one could. That would depend on the answer to a couple of questions, most importantly if a user would gain some monetary advantage at your expense and if that advantage would be illegal.\n\nThe first of these questions (advantage at your expense) already does not have a clear and universal answer. As it is quite common with fraud, this criminal law question has a civil law aspect (more on that on part two of the answer). The two ways how this could create an advantage to an attacker world be...\n\n1. A contract would not be enacted between you and the attacker, but he would take advantage of you believing in the contract's validity. This option would though probably not apply here, judging from the (spoiler alert) civil law part of the question.\n2. A valid contract would be created, but the terms and conditions would not apply and that would cause an illegal financial advantage for the attacker at your cost. Since the base contract would still be in effect and that comes with the obligation to pay, that advantage would have to be in the terms and conditions not applying. You can construct such a case, but that would depend on the terms in question, so there can not be an answer here. There is though a good chance that the terms would still apply (see below), so there will probably be no damage.\n\nThe other aspect is if this advantage would be through *illegal* use of the system, which is an interesting question in your case, since the link is publicly accessible. But, then again you can also fake a POST, so you can argue that it is always possible to make the terms not appear.\n\nAn aspect to be considered though, is that merely *attempting* computer fraud is already an offense. An attacker who thinks he can gain a monetary advantage from such an attack could be still punished, even if it is not even possible to commit the crime due to the circumstances (this by itself is an interesting question in criminal law).\n\nThe bigger danger that I see is that your solution makes it easy for an attacker to make their own site and then use your public link to book on your site (in a man in the middle attack). That would clearly be an offense, but it would be the attacker's not your client's. But since your success depends on the trustworthiness of your site, I would recommend to look for a safer solution (such as POST with https).\n\nTo summarize that part: There is a possibility that accessing the site in the described way is a crime, but I would say it is rather not due to the lack of damage. It is though possible that an attacker still commits a crime by attempting such an attack. You should in any case make your site safer to make it harder to commit MITM attacks. \n\n**Civil Law**\n\nThe civil law side is whether the terms can be accepted in the described way. This is a case for the law of general terms and conditions (Allgemeine Gesch\u00e4ftsbedingungen or AGB). In a few words, for AGB to apply, the have to be notified to the client and he has to accept them. If your site is used how it is supposed to be, both conditions are met.\n\nIn the (invalid) way you have described, the first condition is in question. Since the user knows that using the described URL means accepting the terms, I would consider the second condition to be satisfied. So how can the terms apply if the user has not seen them?\n\nIn case you provide no shortcut to the accepted link and you also prevent that it can be found in another way (e.g. through a search engine), the direct link would be equivalent to someone signing terms and conditions without reading them, although he has had a chance to do so. That would still make the terms apply, because the client would have been given the chance to read them, which is the only thing the seller needs to do. So chances are that your terms would still apply (thus negating the financial advantage necessary for a crime).\n\nHowever, AGB law is a complex subject that is generally handled by specialists. Any opinion of someone who is not such a specialist has to be handled with care. That includes my opinion."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website offers file downloads behind a user agreement window.

The action is likely not a cybercrime under German law because there's probably no illegal monetary advantage gained, which is required for computer fraud. However, from a civil law perspective, the user agreements may still be binding even if the user didn't see them. This is because in terms of general conditions law (AGB), if the user knows that using the direct URL means accepting the terms, it could be considered equivalent to signing without reading, which typically doesn't invalidate the agreement. The website owner should improve security to prevent such bypasses, but they're not necessarily liable for users' actions in this case."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52724/is-this-obvious-gambling-legal", "docs_id": 52724, "title": "Is this obvious gambling legal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [https://www.omaze.com/products/tesla\\-model\\-y\\-kimbal\\-musk](https://www.omaze.com/products/tesla-model-y-kimbal-musk)\n\nIt basically is a lottery.\n\nInstead of buying lottery tickets, you \"donate\" and have a chance to win Tesla.\n\nIs it even legal in US?\n\nIs it okay to organize something like this in US if you market it outside US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nFirst, gambling is not illegal \\- only illegal gambling is illegal.\n\n[Lotteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lottery#United_States) are legal in the United States when operated by or under licence from a state (44\\) or territory (3\\).

Key factors that make it legal are:\n\n1. No purchase is necessary to enter, as evidenced by the \"enter without contributing\" option.\n2. The official rules state \"NO PURCHASE, PAYMENT, OR CONTRIBUTION NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN.\"\n3. Contributing does not improve chances of winning.\n4. It is not classified as gambling because there is no stake required from participants.\n\nWhile lotteries in the US are typically run by states or under state licenses, sweepstakes have different legal requirements.

To prevent the storage of these cookies, AddThis and some other functionality would need to not be included on the site at all if the user hadn't opted in, which could affect functionality.

All the \"EU Cookie Law Compliance\" plugins I've checked out let the admin *configure* the site to comply with the 2002 directive, and most let you choose between implicit consent (which is, and still will be, OK if you or third party services do not use cookies for profiling or to collect personal data), soft consent, or hard consent. The latter is however *mandatory* if you or third party services use cookies to for profiling or to collect personal data.\n\n**However**, if at least one of your cookies are used for profiling (and if you use Google analytics, you are), or if they are used to collect personal data, the exception from explicit consent quoted above does *not* apply and implicit consent (i.e.: \"continued use of the site amounts to implicit consent to the use of cookies\") has *never* been legal for the site.\n\nSo while nothing has changed since 2002, there is a lot of misinformation about cookies floating on the Internet, and a lot of sites have their cookie banners set up wrong.

You can't have the CEO pulling money from the NPO and lining his pockets legally, but then say all of it is for \"charity by law\" and that nobody is getting paid anything for what they're doing. What are the \"real\" laws here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your assumption about charities, \"that legally you cannot use any of the money raised/created for anything but charitable purposes\" is incorrect. For example, a charitable organization can have an office, and can pay rent for that office; it can pay a janitor to clean up, a secretary to do correspondence, and a CEO to run the operation. The basic generalization for a [501(c)(3\\) organization](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-section-501-c-3-organizations) is\n\n> To be tax\\-exempt under section 501(c)(3\\) of the Internal Revenue Code,\n>  an organization must be organized and operated exclusively for [exempt\n>  purposes](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exempt-purposes-internal-revenue-code-section-501c3) set forth in section 501(c)(3\\), and none of its earnings may\n>  inure to any private shareholder or individual.\n\nSpecifically, \n\n> A section 501(c)(3\\) organization must not be organized or operated for\n>  the benefit of private interests, such as the creator or the creator's\n>  family, shareholders of the organization, other designated\n>  individuals, or persons controlled directly or indirectly by such\n>  private interests. No part of the net earnings of a section 501(c)(3\\)\n>  organization may inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or\n>  individual. A private shareholder or individual is a person having a\n>  personal and private interest in the activities of the organization.\n\nAccordingly, the organization cannot be created with the purpose of benefiting John Smith, or the board of directors of the organization, or shareholders. This does not preclude spending money to operate the charity."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to IRS regulations for 501(c)(3) organizations, which of the following statements is true regarding the use of funds and compensation in charitable organizations?\n\nA) Charitable organizations are prohibited from using any funds for salaries or operational expenses, as all money must go directly to charitable purposes.\n\nB) A 501(c)(3) organization can pay reasonable salaries to employees, including the CEO, as long as the organization is not operated for the benefit of private interests.\n\nC) Charitable organizations can freely distribute their earnings to board members and shareholders, as long as some portion of the funds is used for charitable purposes.\n\nD) The CEO of a charitable organization cannot receive any compensation, but other employees can be paid salaries from the organization's funds.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because charitable organizations are allowed to use funds for operational expenses and salaries, not just direct charitable activities.\n\nOption B is correct. The IRS allows 501(c)(3) organizations to pay reasonable compensation to employees, including executives, as long as the organization is not operated primarily for private benefit. This aligns with the IRS statement that such organizations must be \"operated exclusively for exempt purposes\" while also allowing for necessary operational expenses.\n\nOption C is false because 501(c)(3) organizations are explicitly prohibited from allowing their earnings to inure to the benefit of private shareholders or individuals.

The office was [renamed in 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/schedule/5/enacted)\nand [again in 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/part/I/crossheading/the-information-commissioner-and-the-information-tribunal/enacted), and the functions have changed along the way. The current governing legislation is the [Data Protection Act 2018, schedule 12](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/12/schedule/12). There have been many suggestions of changing the structure \\- such as the ICO's [Triennal Review](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/minutes-and-papers/2017/2013730/mb-triennial-review-report-20170206.pdf) of 2015, and the [Leveson Inquiry Report](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270942/0780_iii.pdf) (see sections 4\\.8 and 4\\.9, p1109 of volume 3\\) of 2012 \\- but that has not happened.\n\nSo your sense that the \"corporation sole\" model is a bit unusual is shared by many distinguished minds, and even in 1984 it was probably anomalous, judging by a quick scan of contemporaneous legislation. For example, the \"Cable Authority\" [established in the same year](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/46/schedule/1/enacted) was created as a statutory corporate body, to regulate cable television. Ultimately, the Data Protection Registrar and the Cable Authority could do the same sorts of things, as far as employing people, acquiring property, entering into contracts, and so forth. There were special rules for how the Registrar and the Authority members would be appointed \\- these are *different* rules from one another, but they are both set up by primary legislation. The differences therefore fall to be explained as a matter of policy preference, since they are both legally viable ways to establish a body performing public functions \"at arm's length\" from ministers.\n\nThe main difference is at the leadership level, since as far as doing the job, people employed in the ICO are in the same position regardless of whether they work for a corporation sole or aggregate.\nIf there is one person in charge, then you have a single \"head\" salary to pay, a single selection process to run to find them, and a single point of accountability to government and to Parliament. If there is a board of directors then they all have to get chosen somehow, and responsibility can be more diffuse. But having several people can lead to better decision\\-making, and could make the organization appear less biased by having balanced representation.\n\nIn fact, prior to the Act of 1984, the creation of a Data Protection Authority (rather than a sole registrar) had been proposed many times, most notably by the [Lindop Committee](https://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C9125) which reported on the matter in 1978\\. The idea of a registrar was developed in the Government's 1982 paper, *Data Protection: The Government's Proposals for Legislation* (Cmnd 8539\\), which led up to the Act. That recommended that there be a single independent official who would be accountable for the work, but that he would be assisted by an expert committee. Additionally, a Data Protection Tribunal would take care of the resulting legal disputes. In the actual legislation, the expert committee was not made statutory, because the government felt that it would be too difficult to define what it ought to do in a way that would stand the test of time (see [HL Deb 19 July 1983, vol 443 col 1084](https://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/1983-07-19/debates/b4fd8717-7224-4ca4-8fb5-3a3dae74cfc9/DataProtectionBillHl) for a Lords committee debate on this topic). The \"corporation sole\" legal structure gives maximal flexibility to how the Registrar would organize the office over time, while still doing the legal mechanics to give it independent personality."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in the UK is structured as a corporation sole.

This assumes that the party reasonably believes that they have permission. This happened to the US Postal Service, which is now being sued for 4 billion infringements of an artist's copyright, apparently because somebody didn't correctly distinguish between a picture of the Statue of Liberty and a modern version.\n\n(There is apparently some confusion over Davidson's lawsuit against USPS. USPS distributed stamps reproducing Davidson's sculpture, without his permission, on the mistaken belief that the image was of the actual Statue of Liberty. Sculptural works are protected by copyright, and permission is required to create and distribute a derivative work. For a very similar post stamp infringement case involving a different sculpture, see [Gaylord v. United States](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/collages/2625), 595 F.3d 1364\\). In that case as well, USPS did not get permission from the copyright holder. The photographer received permission from a partner in the firm that constructed the memorial in question, but the firm did not hold copyright in the infringed sculpture. USPS was then referred to the partner for permission to use the underlying work. The USPS's unsuccessful defense was based on fair use, not innocent infringement. Substantial damages were awarded to Gaylord. The outcome of Davidson has not been determined, and again, will not hinge on innocent infringement, but might hinge on fair use, or on a classification of the sculpture as part of an architectural work. It is not clear whether the photographer who took the photo in the Davidson case had permission from Davidson)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a copyright infringement case involving innocent infringement in the US, what is the maximum amount of statutory damages that a court can reduce the penalty to for an infringer who reasonably believed they had permission?\n\nA) $500\nB) $200\nC) $1000\nD) $0\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, in cases of innocent infringement in the US, where the infringer reasonably believed they had permission to use the copyrighted material, the court can reduce statutory damages to a minimum of $200.

The documentation explains that Leonard's Law does not apply to religious schools at all, rather than allowing them to selectively restrict speech. This is due to the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine, which prohibits courts from interfering with matters of religious discipline, law, or custom.

Or is Australia the only country to have implemented this new taxation scheme?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This answer is limited to the United States.\n\nThere are several counterparts to this in U.S. law.\n\nThe AMIT regime is essentially the law that applies to partnerships (especially limited partnership) under Subchapter K of the U.S. tax code and to owners of S corporations. It is also similar to the tax rules that applies to regulated investment companies (RICs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and publicly held partnerships. When all income must be distributed currently under a trust to the present beneficiaries, a trust is a \"simple trust\" under U.S. law and taxed in a similar manner.\n\nThe allocation between income and principle on a means other than non\\-tax trust law allocations resembles that of \"unitrusts\" in which the current income beneficiary gets a certain percentage of the fair market value of the trust each year and the balance goes to a remainder beneficiary, rather than allocating the tax attributes of a trust between income and principle according to trust law principles.\n\n(In contrast, C\\-corporations and \"complex trusts\" under U.S. tax law, are taxed very differently than under the AMIT regime for certain trusts in Australia.)\n\nOn the other hand, the U.S. law lacks \"franking credits\" in its corporate tax law system in almost all cases. Also, under U.S. law, there is not a \"potential for double taxation that may arise for members where there are mismatches between the amount distributed and the taxable income of the AMIT\\[.]\"\n\nOne feature which is novel compared to U.S. law is that:\n\n> If a variance is discovered between the amounts actually attributed to\n> members for an income year, and the amounts that should have been\n> attributed, the variance can be attributed in the income year in which\n> it is discovered by the responsible entity, rather than amending\n> previous years' tax returns and notifying members of those amendments.\n\nThis is only very rarely allowed under U.S. tax law, and the doctrines involved when it is allowed justify this kind of treatment differently in terms of tax law theory."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the U.S. counterparts to Australia's AMIT regime is NOT correct?\n\nA) The U.S. tax treatment of partnerships under Subchapter K is similar to the AMIT regime in many aspects.\n\nB) Regulated Investment Companies (RICs) and Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) in the U.S. have tax rules comparable to the AMIT regime.\n\nC) The U.S. tax system widely allows for variances in attributed amounts to be corrected in the year of discovery rather than amending previous years' returns.\n\nD) Simple trusts in the U.S., where all income must be distributed currently to present beneficiaries, are taxed in a manner similar to the AMIT regime.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Options A, B, and D are correct statements about U.S. counterparts to Australia's AMIT regime. However, option C is incorrect. The ability to correct variances in attributed amounts in the year of discovery, rather than amending previous years' returns, is described as a novel feature of the AMIT regime compared to U.S. law.

Why they don't have copyright problem? Can I also stream musics like that in youtube.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I see that channel offers playlists and \"videos\" of popular music by several artists. The one video I tried had the music with no accompanying video or images. The channel's about page says that then operator does not own the copyrights to the music and cannot grant others permission to play it.\n\nIt is possible that the channel operator has obtained permission from the artists and is thus operating under a valid license. It is possible that the channel is committing copyright infringement, but the various copyright owners have not noticed the channel, or have noticed it but decided not to take action. There is no easy way for an outsider to tell which of these is correct.\n\nIf the operator has not obtained proper permission, then it seems that this would be copyright infringement. If so, any copyright owner could send a takedown notice, use YouTube's own copyright complaint mechanism, or could file a copyright infringement suit. But nothing compels the owner to act if the owner chooses not to, it is entirely the owner's choice.\n\nI do not see that the US ***fair use*** or any other ***exception to copyright*** would be likely to apply here.\n\nIf the owner brought suit and won (and a win seems likely to me, from what I can see), the operator would be liable for damages, which might be sizable, or mild. In the US at least the owner could also obtain a court order (injunction) requiring the operator to stop using the owner's copyrighted music.\n\nIf the owner complained to YouTube, the site could add a \"copyright strike\" against the operator's account. After a few strikes (I think three) YouTube will cancel the account, according to its posted policies.\n\nSimilar outcomes could face anyone else who posted or made available for streaming copyrighted content (such as music) without permission from the copyright owner.

Instead, GDPR applies to a non\\-EU site or service if the data controller *offers* products or services to people in the EU (see Art 3(2\\) GDPR). This depends solely on the behaviour and intent of the data controller / the provider of the website \u2013 compare also the discussion of the \u201ctargeting criterion\u201d in [EDPB guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/riktlinjer/guidelines-32018-territorial-scope-gdpr-article-3-version_en).\n\nWhile your proposed measures might not be entirely ineffective (in that they document an intent to not serve people in the EU), they are both unnecessarily restrictive and overly lax.

For the targeting criterion, it matters whether the data subject is in the EU at the time of the offer, not at all what their residency is. Even if a person who is currently in the EU registers with your service, that doesn't necessarily mean that you are *targeting* people in the EU.\n\nInstead of implementing signup restrictions, a better strategy might be to clarify in the copy on your website that you are only targeting the domestic US market, not the European market with your services.

This approach could unfairly exclude non-EU residents while still potentially allowing EU residents to register.\n\nOption B is the most effective and legally sound approach.

Often times you can just go down to the courthouse and obtain a Temporary Restraining Order ***ex parte*** (without notice to the restrained party) and ***pro se*** (without counsel) on the same day.\n\nYou just need to fill out some forms and swear a statement before the commissioner in my jurisdiction. There are even people at the courthouse who will help guide you through the procedure (mostly volunteers for Domestic Violence prevention). A permanent restraining order can come later.

I live in the United States, in New York. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you must pay U.S. income taxes on your gambling winnings anywhere in the world (see generally multiple resources from the [IRS](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/taxpayers-living-abroad)). But, you may take a credit against the U.S. income tax liability on those winnings for any foreign (e.g. U.K.) taxes you pay on those gambling winnings. \n\nIt does not matter if you bring the money back or not. Repatriation of earnings is a concept that applies to [foreign subsidiaries of U.S. owners](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-does-current-system-international-taxation-work), not individuals.\n\nAll of this is assuming that no U.S.\\-U.K. tax treaty applies. There are two relevant treaties, [one from 1975 and one from 2001](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-kingdom-uk-tax-treaty-documents?_ga=1.99566364.324282460.1475612700), each of which is explained in greater detail than the bare treaty language approved by the U.S. Senate in technical explanations and protocols reached between the respective tax collection agencies. I am not aware of either that applies to gambling winnings but I am not an expert on these treaties and you'd have to read them to be sure.\n\nThere is an exemption for foreign earned income of individuals, but gambling winnings are not earned income unless gambling is your occupation rather than merely entertainment or an occasional activity.\n\nBut, you would not owe New York State or New York local income taxes on those winnings.\n\nOf course, while U.S. gambling establishments report gambling winnings to the IRS, those in the U.K. might not, which doesn't mean that you don't owe the taxes, but reduces your odds of being caught if you do not."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John, a U.S. citizen living in New York, wins $10,000 from online gambling on a UK-based website.

For example, if a criminal trial is going on, I believe in most cases I cannot be prevented from entering that room and watching and listening to the proceeding, presumably because they are \"public\" proceedings. However, the legal basis for this is not clear to me.\n\nThis question about the legal basis for law proceedings being public has become more trenchant now in the COVID era because many court proceedings are being held by telecast now. Before a judge could just physically grab and expel anybody trying to record the goings on in a court, but now that trials are being webcast, anyone can simply record the webcast.

Is the public nature of courtroom proceedings at the whim of the state, or is there is a constitutional protection of public access to trials in public courts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes there is a right\n--------------------\n\nFor civil trials it is not a Constitutional right, it\u2019s a Common Law one. Civil trials in the USA are public because trials in England were (and are) public.\n\nFor criminal trials, the sixth amendment guarantees \u201cspeedy and public\u201d trials.\n\nBut, like all rights, it is not unfettered.\n\nIn addition to practical considerations like how much room there is for a public audience, there are also trials or parts of trials from which the public is excluded. Family law and children\u2019s court matters are almost always not public. Similarly, trials that deal with national security issues.\n\nThe limitation on the right to public access must be balanced with issues such as privacy and security. While Constitutional rights are subject to \u201cstrict scrutiny\u201d on limitations the same is not necessarily true of Common law rights, however, for such a longstanding right it would come close.\n\nAs for recording trials: there is no right to do so other than by taking notes. Unsurprisingly, there is no specific right in the Constitution for audio or visual recording because the technical ability to do so post\\-dates the Bill of Rights by about a century.

If it is to the agent's advantage to make a quick sale, the agent can reduce the commission by whatever amount s/he chooses to help induce the seller to agree to a lower asking price.

For unique goods such as real estate, it is even more problematic than cases where many identical widgets are sold at a fixed price.

This includes sharing information between doctors, even if one doctor did not directly request it. Option A is incorrect because there is no legal requirement to automatically share information without request. Option B is false because sharing is permitted without patient consent for treatment purposes.

I'm not familiar with DMCA stuff, would that help?\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: DMCA protects user\\-driven upload repositories like Youtube, where a user uploads \"their\" content which then becomes generally available. Youtube makes users swear that they have the right to upload the content, but some users lie. Ordinarily, Youtube would therefore be liable for contributory copyright infringement, and a better target than the uploader (easier to find, deeper pockets). DMCA provides special protect for that kind of hosting service. The basic procedure is that a person files a notice with the host, following a specific protocol, swearing that such\\-and\\-such content infringes their copyright (swearing under penalty of perjury). The host then takes the material down. Then the uploader can file a counter\\-claim that they didn't infringe, and then finally if the claimant doesn't pursue this further the material goes back up, or the claimant gets to say that they filed an infringement lawsuit and the material is taken down (the courts sort it out). The host never judges the legal merits of the claims, it's all just following procedures for notices.\n\nAlthough the letter of the law makes it look like you can make ridiculous claims as long as you don't know for sure that you are wrong, in fact people have been legally slapped for filing DMCA takedown notices when they should have known that the use was \"fair use\", which is something that can only be definitively determined in court (by the judge or jury, once given all of the defendant's arguments). Since you don't know that the material is actually infringing (it's unclear what you have access to: if this a program that users install on their machines?), it's questionable or at least risky to follow the DMCA route."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company discovers that their image effects are being used by mobile apps without permission.

She assumed she was the only heir.  \n\nPeter was an avid collector of SciFi and Fantasy books (same as me) and had approx. 6000 books in his apartment in Edinburgh.  \n\nNot knowing what to do with that enormous amount of books Carla called a local charity that runs thrift shops and offered them the books as donation.\nThey send a guy over and he took away about 500 books. He promised to come back a week later with a larger van and more people to carry.\n\nI flew to Scotland for the funeral (I live in The Netherlands) and to assist Carla in dealing with the situation.  \n\nThat is when I learned she had given away those books. I explained to her that those particular books were not very valuable and giving them away was probably the best thing to do, but I knew that the entire collection was insured for \u00a3 100\\.000 and that was most likely under valued.  \n\nGive it all away seemed silly. She agreed and we notified the charity to put the collection on hold.\n\nTwo days later Peters will was read. Turned out he was far wealthier than Carla or I knew.\n(We expected a few 100\\.000, but well over 10 million is a whole different game.)  \n\nHe bequeathed a substantial amount to a few charities and had made sure that Carla would never have to worry about money for the rest of her live.  \n\nAnd he granted me his entire book collection plus an amount of money to cover my expenses for travel and dealing with the books (storage and shipping).\n\nCarla was very upset she had given \"my\" books away.  \n\nI re\\-assured her that I didn\u2019t mind at all.  \n\nI would have given them away myself as that made far more sense for these books than shipping them to my home in The Netherlands.\n\nOver the following months I flew back and forth several times to further assist Carla and to deal with the books.  \n\nEventually I shipped about 2000 books home and integrated them into my own collection.\nAbout 2000 where sold to a trader in second hand books and the remaining 1500 were donated to charity as Carla had done with the first batch of 500\\.  \n\nThe proceeds of the sale and the remainder of Peters financial grant to me I donated in his name to the same charities that Peter had named in his will.\n\nTL;DR:  \n\nAn heir, assuming to be the only heir of the deceased, gives away part of his possessions prior to the content of the will being known.  \n\nWhat recourse does the other heir, to who those items were granted in the will, have if this can not be amicably settled?\n\nJurisdiction is UK, Scotland in case that matters.  \n\nFinancial value of the items approx \u00a3200 to \u00a3250\\.  \n\nPresume that the items themselves can\u2019t be retrieved anymore.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think the key word here is \"assume\". A person, N, who is clearly the next of kin of a recently deceased person D may not assume that s/he is D's sole heir, or indeed is D's heir at all. N must wait until D's will (if any) is known, and an executor or administrator is lawfully appointed.\n\nOnly the executor may lawfully dispose of D's property, by conveying it to specified beneficiaries, selling it, giving it away, or by any other means. Anyone who does so without the proper executor's authority is probably technically guilty of theft, although in a case like the one in the question, a prosecution would be very unlikely.\n\nBut N would be liable to any heir H for the value of items properly left to H but disposed of by N. H might not choose to pursue such a claim, but would be legally able to. N should remember that the value, monetary or sentimental, of objects may not be known to N, and may be much greater to H than N is aware of.\n\nI suppose that in the case of objects of slight value which must be dealt with promptly, such as perishable food on D's premises, reasonable steps would not be objected to."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, if Carla had given away Peter's entire book collection before the will was read, what would have been the most appropriate legal recourse for the rightful heir (you)?\n\nA) File a criminal theft charge against Carla\nB) Sue the charity that received the books for their return\nC) Take no action, as Carla was the next of kin and had the right to dispose of the property\nD) Seek compensation from Carla for the value of the books given away\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, only the executor has the lawful authority to dispose of a deceased person's property.

For a different example a person who simply omits to file an income tax return may be guilty of both failure to file a required return, and failure to pay tax due, and in some cases failure to par required estimated tax due as well.

The documentation explains that it is indeed possible for a single action to violate multiple laws and be chargeable as multiple crimes.

You would need to identify information available to them at the time and show that they ignored it, either deliberately or by negligence. For instance you might find a doctor who ignored evidence that the rest of his profession found persuasive, or you may find that your parents ignored mainstream medical advice and went with some fringe practitioner instead. However from what you say it doesn't sound like that is the case.\n\nBear in mind that not every drug works for everyone who takes it. Ritalin in particular has worked well for many people. If you were diagnosed with a problem for which Ritalin was indicated then it is not the fault of the doctors, the drug company or anyone else if you happen to be one of the unlucky ones for whom it did not work.\n\nYour parents duty of care for you ended when you turned 18\\. From then on you were legally considered an adult, capable of making your own decisions, taking responsibility for the outcomes, and generally looking out for yourself. Legally, anything that has happened since then is down to you, not your parents. If you want to argue that you were or are incapable of making rational decisions due to your upbringing and medical treatment as a child then you could try that argument, but claiming that you are mentally incompetent is probably not a good way to persuade a court that you can, for instance, be trusted when on the witness stand to tell the truth about what happened in your childhood. Also, your post shows that you are at least partly motivated by hatred of your parents, and that is likely to be used by the defence to impeach your testimony (e.g. \"I put it to you that you are lying about this incident because you hate your mother\"). All of this makes the prospect of courtroom success even more remote.\n\nIf you win a lawsuit then you may be awarded money in compensation. If the court believes that you cannot be trusted to manage the money yourself then they may appoint a conservator to look after it for you. If you really want to go down this road then you need to talk to a lawyer or three. But if they tell you that your case is unlikely to succeed then listen to them: they are not lying."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided content:\n\nQuestion: In a lawsuit regarding childhood medical treatment and parental care, which of the following factors would be most crucial for the plaintiff to prove in order to have a chance of success?\n\nA) That the parents are currently wealthy and able to provide financial support\nB) That the plaintiff has suffered long-term negative effects from the treatment\nC) That the decision-makers ignored available information or mainstream medical advice at the time of treatment\nD) That the plaintiff's parents have cut off communication and support in adulthood\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While the current financial status of the parents may be relevant for potential damages, it is not crucial for proving liability in the case.\n\nB) Long-term negative effects, while unfortunate, do not necessarily indicate negligence or malpractice if the treatment was administered in good faith based on available information at the time.\n\nC) This is the correct answer. To prove a failure in the duty of care, the plaintiff would need to show that the decision-makers (parents or medical professionals) ignored available information or went against mainstream medical advice at the time of treatment. This would demonstrate negligence or deliberate disregard for the child's well-being.\n\nD) Actions taken by the parents after the plaintiff reached adulthood are generally not relevant to a case about childhood treatment, as the legal duty of care typically ends when the child becomes an adult."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15480/copyright-breach-how-close-can-i-go", "docs_id": 15480, "title": "Copyright breach \u2013 how close can I go?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently I was working on usability for a web applicatioin (which I'm not allowed to share :( and the UI ended up looking just like the Gmail.

But, for $300 a month at issue, it probably doesn't make economic sense for either party to hire any kind of expert.
