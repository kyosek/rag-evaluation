But what if the protectee is discovered to be a bad guy? Can they insist on the detail to guard them from legitimate arrest? Or would the detail have to let the cops bust him/her? (I guess the detail would stay at the detention facility to watch over their charge.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most secret service details are protection for heads of government/state and thus their details would be afforded Sovereign Immunity (Such as POTUS, VPOTUS, and First and Second Families) OR Diplomatic Immunity (visiting dignitaries and leaders of other nations). Typically there are more diplomatic ways to handle the cases in the latter.\n\nIn the former case, thus far, it has not been handled. During visits, the traditional Executives and Families are usually closely guarded by the Service with additional law enforcement form local jurisdictions called in to aid in the protection, usually to secure routes the Motorcade will take to a designation (I speak from personal experience, POTUS coming to town is a nightmare on traffic). If they are speeding, they are typically doing so down a completely empty highway with police escort.\n\nFrom this point, most under of the Service would be monitored and controlled so closely, at least one Agent would notice if any protected was committing a crime and would have to write it up in a report. There is also considerable debate in legal circles if the President and Vice President could be arrested for a crime while in office, with the general acceptance being that they could not and would need to be impeached by congress. Secret Service will continue to protect former Presidents and Vice Presidents for life, along with their spouses and children up to a certain age.\n\nWith all that in mind, it would not so much be that the Secret Service would prevent arrest of an individual under their protection so much as the Secret Service would be the arresting authority. As they are law enforcement agents under the Federal Government, they can legally arrest people and then hand them to the proper law enforcement agency to effect the arrest. This would mostly happen with candidates for office OR former presidents OR family at any point in time as the scenario described is a bit harder to make a legitimate arrest.\n\nIn fact, the Secret Service does have arrest authority with one of the highest conviction rates of any Law Enforcement Agency in the Country. It's just most crimes they arrest have nothing to do with threats to those under their protection. The Secret Service is also charged with investigation of counterfeiting of US currency and they are very good at it. This was actually their original sole function in the U.S. government and they still exist under the Treasury Department to this day. At this point, if you're wondering how they got the job of protecting important people in the executive branch from that, well, it's simple. At the time of his assasination, the legislation to create the USSS was on Licoln's desk. At the time of their creation, the only other Federal Police services were the U.S. Park Police, the Postal Inspection Service, and the U.S. Marshals. The first two had specific jurisdictions and the Marshals were undermanned so the USSS was tasked with investigating all sorts of financial crimes and quickly became the most successful U.S. Law Enforcement Service. They were also the first U.S. Intelligence and Counterintelligence agency (though they no longer are part of the Intelligence Community) until the FBI took on those duties. So following the Assassination of William McKinley in 1901, Congress authorized them to take up full time Presidential Protection because at the time, they were pretty much doing everything else.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The United States Secret Service (USSS) is tasked with protecting high-ranking government officials.

While the USSS protects former Presidents for life, they are also law enforcement officers. If a former President committed a clear crime like shoplifting, the USSS would likely be the arresting authority and then transfer custody to local law enforcement.\n\nC) is incorrect because visiting foreign dignitaries typically have diplomatic immunity, which would complicate arrest procedures. This would likely be handled through diplomatic channels rather than arrest.\n\nD) is plausible but less likely than B. While the USSS does protect the Vice President's children up to a certain age, an adult child vandalizing property might be handled by local law enforcement rather than directly by the USSS.\n\nThe key here is understanding that the USSS has dual roles as both protectors and law enforcement officers, and that their ability to arrest varies based on the status of the protectee (sitting official, former official, or family member) and the nature of the crime."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45433/criminal-v-civil-litigation-what-are-the-differences", "docs_id": 45433, "title": "criminal v. civil litigation what are the differences", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: hypothetically speaking\n\nSomeone is in civil litigation and the defendant says that their actions are justified because the plaintiff committed a crime and the civil judge dismisses the civil litigation in favor of the defendant based on the defendants bare allegation that the plaintiff committed a crime. \n\nThe question; is civil and criminal litigation different?

In civil litigation, the defendant is *sued* by the plaintiff (who may be a government, body corporate or natural person) for *restitution* (damages or a court order) of harm. In a criminal trial the defendant is *prosecuted* by the government for *punishment* of an offense.\n2. Civil plaintiffs have to prove their case *on the balance of probabilities*. Prosecutors have to prove the offense was committed *beyond reasonable doubt* for a crime (e.g. murder) or *on the balance of probabilities* for a civil offense (e.g. failing to get a dog license).\n3. The administrative procedures around them are usually different.\n\nThe similarities are:\n\n1. In common law jurisdictions a trial is adversarial \\- the role of the court is to determine the *dispute*; not to establish the \u201ctruth\u201d.

This question tests understanding of the differences between civil and criminal litigation. In civil cases, matters are decided on the balance of probabilities, not beyond reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. The civil court doesn't have the authority to determine criminal guilt, especially without proper criminal proceedings. Sarah's alleged crime should not be a determinant in a civil case without being proven in a criminal court. The judge should have focused on the civil matter at hand (property damage) rather than dismissing based on an unproven criminal allegation.

Would it be enough for authors to file for plagiarism under lack of attribution and compensation for art generated this way?

But it's not against the law, and you can't be sued for doing it.\n\nCopyright violation *is* against the law\n----------------------------------------\n\nYou violate copyright when you copy or make a derivative work from the copyrighted work of another without permission or without an exemption under the law.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, authors and artists have moral copyright, which operates alongside proprietary copyright and gives certain rights, including the right of attribution and the right for their work to be treated respectfully. In those jurisdictions, even if you have the copyright holder's permission, you must still respect the moral rights.\n\nLet's make some things explicit by considering a particular artwork. Say, this one:\n\n[![Leonardo's Mona Lisa](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEuEL.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZEuEL.png)\n\nThis particular piece is not subject to copyright because a) it was created before there was such a concept, and b) da Vinci died in 1519, so if there had been a copyright law, copyright in this work would have long expired. So, you can make as many copies of this as you like.\n\nNow, let's consider what the situation would be if Leonardo's alchemical pursuits had been more successful and instead of dying in 1519, he died last Tuesday.\n\nIf you want to make a copy of this image, you must have Leonardo's heir(s) permission or be operating under an exemption under copyright law in your jurisdiction.\n\nWhen you train your AI, you will need to make a copy of the image.

The tenant is obligated to pay rent for the full lease period they agreed to, unless the landlord consents to early termination.

Given just this, you may, but are not required to.\n\nThe [Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (23\\)(1\\)](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90c34#BK22) says:\n\n> In a conveyance made on or after the 1st day of July, 1886, there\n>  shall, in the cases in this section mentioned, be deemed to be\n>  included, and there shall in those cases be implied, covenants to the\n>  effect in this section stated, by the person or by each person who\n>  conveys, as far as regards the subject\\-matter or share thereof\n>  expressed to be conveyed by him, with the person, if one, to whom the\n>  conveyance is made, or with the persons jointly, if more than one, to\n>  whom the conveyance is made as joint tenants, or with each of the\n>  persons, if more than one, to whom the conveyance is made as tenants\n>  in common:\n>  In a conveyance for valuable consideration, other than a mortgage, the\n>  following covenants by the person who conveys, and is expressed to\n>  convey as beneficial owner, namely, covenants for...ii. quiet\n>  enjoyment...according to the forms of covenants for such purposes set\n>  forth in Schedule B to the Short Forms of Conveyances Act, being\n>  chapter 472 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1980, and therein\n>  numbered 2, 3, 4 and 5, subject to that Act.\n\nIn other words, if the lease doesn't say anything about quiet enjoyment, there is an implied covenant whereby \"the landlord, by letting the premises confers on the tenant the right of possession during the term and impliedly promises not to interfere with the tenant\u2019s exercise and use of that right to possession during the term\". The implied covenant pertains to interference by the landlord, not to interference by other tenants (see [this analysis](https://renx.ca/the-tenants-right-to-quiet-enjoyment-how-far-does-it-go/)). Again, you would have a right to evict a noisy tenant, but not an obligation.\n\nHowever, the [Canadian Human Rights Act(6\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/h-6/page-1.html#h-3) states that:\n\n> It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of commercial\n>  premises or residential accommodation (a) to deny occupancy of such\n>  premises or accommodation to any individual, or (b) to differentiate\n>  adversely in relation to any individual, on a prohibited ground of\n>  discrimination.\n\nwhere 3(1\\) states:\n\n> For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination\n>  are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex,\n>  sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status,\n>  family status, genetic characteristics, disability and conviction for\n>  an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which\n>  a record suspension has been ordered.\n\nThe [Canadian Supremacy Clause](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-58) (52(1\\) of the Constitution Act, 1982\\) says that:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law\n>  that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to\n>  the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.\n\nand furthermore:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada includes (a) the Canada Act 1982, including\n>  this Act\n\nThe Constitution act (15\\)(1\\) [also states](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html):\n\n> Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right\n>  to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without\n>  discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on\n>  race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental\n>  or physical disability.\n\nSo under the Canadian Constitution, the national anti\\-discrimination requirement is superior to the provincial RTA. Since no provincial law actually requires eviction of a tenant with a noisy guest, there is no conflict.\n\nOntario also has an [anti\\-discrimination law](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90h19#BK3) (The Human Rights Code):\n\n> 1. Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination because of\n>  race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship,\n>  creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression,\n>  age, marital status, family status or disability.\n> 2. (1\\) Every person has a right to equal treatment with respect to the occupancy of accommodation, without discrimination because of race,\n>  ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed,\n>  sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age,\n>  marital status, family status, disability or the receipt of public\n>  assistance.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Every person who occupies accommodation has a right to freedom\n>  from harassment by the landlord or agent of the landlord *or by an\n>  occupant of the same building* because of race, ancestry, place of\n>  origin, colour, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sexual orientation,\n>  gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family\n>  status, disability or the receipt of public assistance.\n\nRight must therefore refrain from hassling Left.\n\nA problem could arise if there is a lease clause whereby you guarantee tenants a noise\\-free environment and promise to remove noisy neighbors. In that case, Right could sue you, and you would have to defend yourself by reference to the fact that Canadian and provincial law prohibits you from pursuing eviction in this case.\n\nAn alternative would be to ask Left to not have the noisy individual over. But that would not be a wise choice. The anti\\-discrimination laws are not stated as protections against tenants who have the protected characteristics, indeed all tenants have some sex, religion, race etc. You can't start eviction proceedings because the tenant is white, black, Catholic, or atheist, and you likewise can't evict a person for having a guest who is white, black, Catholic, or atheist. You also can't \"have a talk\" with a tenant \u2013 creating a \"poisoned environment\" \u2013 because they or their guest are white, black, Catholic, or atheist.

Currently, the United States treats online platforms as private property and so the users are granted no rights of freedom of speech on those platforms. Does the Netherlands provide any additional rights over the United States?\n\nI know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights. If so, are these rights extended only to citizens of the Netherlands, or are these rights universal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Freedom of speech in the constitution\n-------------------------------------\n\nI think this is a very broad question, but I'll attempt an answer. To my knowledge, there is no specific Dutch law that considers freedom of speech *on the internet*. Instead, there is one article in the Dutch constitution that considers freedom of speech and a prohibition on censorship. That's [article 7 of the Dutch constitution](https://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/id/via0istdaus2/artikel_7_vrijheid_van_meningsuiting) (link in Dutch).\n\nIt consists of 4 sections. The first deals with freedom of speech in print, the second deals with radio and television, the third deals with (translated by me) *revealing thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned* and the fourth states that the aforementioned sections don't apply to commercial advertisements.\n\nSince you are asking about freedom of speech online, the third section applies. The section states that no permission is needed to *reveal those thoughts or feelings through means other than the aforementioned* but it adds two conditions:\n\n1. In Dutch: *\"behoudens ieders verantwoordelijkheid volgens de wet\"*. This means that the freedom is subject to one's responsibilities under the law. In other words, other laws may curtail one's freedom under this section. This phrase is also included in the first two sections.\n2. The second condition which is specific to this section is that the law may restrict access to *performances* (*vertoningen* in Dutch; not sure if it translates well) to people under the age of 16 to protect good moral (*goede zeden* in Dutch; again not sure if it translates well).\n\nRestrictions under the law\n--------------------------\n\nSo the above about constitutional freedom of speech doesn't tell you a lot, it's very general. To answer your question you'd need to know what specific exceptions there are. These exceptions don't need to be specific to statements made online, if it's not allowed in public then the same rule would apply online.\n\nTo give these exceptions I'll summarize the information on [this page from the Dutch Amnesty International site on freedom of speech in the Netherlands](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland).\n\nHate speech and calling for criminal acts\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe Amnesty article starts with some information on articles of criminal law:\n\n* [Article 137](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel137d/) forbids hate against or discrimination of people based on race, religion, gender, sexual preference, or mental handicap.\n\nAccording to [the Amnesty article](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland) this covers holocaust denial (considered unlawful discrimination) but not homophobia (when it expresses fear of or aversion to someone's sexual orientation).\n\n* [Article 131](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel131) and [article 132](http://www.wetboek-online.nl/wet/Wetboek%20van%20Strafrecht/132.html): calling for a criminal act or violent action against public order.\n\nSome interesting jurisprudence regarding your question and articles 131 and 132 is this case: [ECLI:NL:PHR:2019:1232](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:PHR:2019:1232). It's a Dutch Supreme Court case that considers calls for 'participation in the armed jihad' in the context of the war in Syria. The calls were made in Facebook posts (containing photos of dead victims, photos of ISIS flags, and statements in Dutch supporting jihad). The linked ruling confirms that these posts were in violation of articles 131 and 132 and that the posts were not protected under religious freedom nor as freedom of speech.\n\n* Libel [article 261](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel261) and slander [article 262](https://maxius.nl/wetboek-van-strafrecht/artikel262) are also limitations on freedom of speech, even online.\n\nPreventing publication of military secrets\n------------------------------------------\n\nAccording to the [Amnesty article](https://www.amnesty.nl/mensenrechten-in-nederland/vrijheid-van-meningsuiting-in-nederland) censorship (as in ruling some statement against the law before publication) is not something Dutch courts may normally do. It names one exception: when military secrets may be revealed. Then a court may prevent publication, unless the military secrets are such gross violations of human rights that publication would be warranted.\n\nRights on a platform\n--------------------\n\n> I know that European countries have, in some cases, began treating those platforms as public utilities where users are granted rights.\n\nI'm not sure what you're referring to here but I don't think it refers to freedom speech. In any case, after some googling I found a case that is about this: [someone filed summary proceedings](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/inziendocument?id=ECLI:NL:RBAMS:2020:4966) in the Netherlands because they disagreed with Facebook removing pages on its platform that didn't conform with Facebook's policy on Covid\\-19\\. As far as I can see from skimming the court ruling, the ruling holds that freedom of speech does not extend to companies like Facebook having to host your posts. I think it's basically a long ruling that boils down to [the well\\-know XKCD on free speech](https://xkcd.com/1357/).\n\nOn the other hand, the ruling also points to the service agreement between Facebook and the user. Part of those terms and conditions are entered as facts in the proceedings. Since it's a civil case, I assume users might derive some rights from that if the agreement touches on that.\n\nAnother thing that sounds familiar (based on that quote from your question) is [net neutrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality). Like in the US, that's mostly about network providers having different rules for different content, which isn't allowed in most cases under net neutrality.

I even called the fire department, but they couldn't find out the source either.\n\nThen I found many odor eliminators and air fresheners in several concealed places in the house, which I believe were used to cover the smoke smell, such that it's hard to notice the smoke smell during a half\\-an\\-hour walk through or inspection.\n\nI also found a lot of smoke soot and dust when I was cleaning vents, and I even found a cigar in the fridge!

Fair housing, which is a federal concept, pertains to issues such as using prohibited personal facts to determine whether to accept an offer. (Hazardous materials disclosures are also mandated at the federal level, but are are included in state requirements which can get pretty broad). \n\nIf you are buying in Washington state, [RCW 64\\.06\\.020](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=64.06.020) says what and how you must disclose. The list of disclosures is very detailed, covering title and covenants, water, sewer, structure, systems and fixtures, environment, and mobile home related. The only one of the 86 questions about smoke is whether smoke alarms are present. Thus smell of smoke is not a legally material fact that must be disclosed, in this state. The California disclosures, even longer, are [here](http://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/re6.pdf), and there is likewise no \"smells bad\" disclosure.\n\nIt is unlikely that any state in the US mandates such a disclosure, since it is somewhere between a subjective evaluation and a self\\-evident fact. Some people are very sensitive to certain smells while others do not care. The burden is on the buyer to pursue matters of personal concern (in writing!), such as whether any dog has been present in the house in the past 5 years (some people care). You have to look carefully at the response. \"Don't know\" is usually a safe bet, unless you actually have factual knowledge.\n\nFrom what I can determine, Massachussetts is on the opposite end of the spectrum from California. There are some requirements imposed on real estate agents, and there is the federal lead paint disclosure, but otherwise it appears that nothing is mandated by law. [This form](http://startpoint.com/DocLibrary/SellerDisclosure.pdf) seems to be used by the real estate association, and there is a question about \"history of smoke/fire damage to structure\". The reasonable interpretation of that is \"has the house caught fire and suffered damage\", so \"no\" from a cigar\\-smoker would not be fraudulent. If the intent of the question were to reveal if someone has smoked frequently in the house, that would he the question they'd ask. You can check whether you have this form and see what it says, but \"smoke damage\" would not normally be interpreted as meaning \"smells a bit funny\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the disclosure of smoke odor in a house sale in Massachusetts?\n\nA) The seller is legally required to disclose any smoke odor in the property disclosure form.\nB) The buyer has no recourse if smoke odor is discovered after purchase, as it's considered a self-evident fact.\nC) Massachusetts law mandates extensive disclosures similar to California's requirements.\nD) Massachusetts has limited mandatory disclosures, and smoke odor is not typically included as a required disclosure item.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that Massachusetts is on the opposite end of the disclosure spectrum from California, with few mandated disclosures. The form mentioned asks about \"history of smoke/fire damage to structure,\" which is reasonably interpreted as actual fire damage, not odors from smoking. Smoke odor is not typically considered a material fact that must be disclosed in most states, including Massachusetts. The burden is generally on the buyer to investigate matters of personal concern.

Could stock markets or the authorized distributors of their data bring about any consequences legally to someone who republishes the data without permission?\n\n*Assuming financial market quotes can't be copyrighted,* can the distributors of the information (exchanges or their authorized distributors) use a contract (terms of service) to prevent someone from redistributing the data that they don't own (the copyright to) in the first place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I believe that it varies by country. The law provides protection for databases and data sets, where sufficient creativity/choice/curatorship has gone into its creation. It's separate from but similar to copyright law. So far it exists in several countries including the EU but I'm hazy whether it exists in the US (from memory it doesn't) and the exact criteria. \n\nIn any case such a website may not meet the criterion for copyright \\- although the original data creator (the stock exchange whose data is being used/reused) may have. \n\nI don't know about IP law \\- is the fact of a current price (or dataset of such facts at different times) protectable as IP instead? Are facts generally? Can I declare facts such as my street address, or a number, as IP? Clearly commercial effort goes into it, and clearly it can be protected by contract but copyright/IP law is less clear to me. The question of copyright protection for a commercially valuable *number* **has** been [tried in court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AACS_encryption_key_controversy), however, as has the question of [a commercially valuable number which is constructed into a number that is notable for noncommercial reasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime).\n\n(As a possibly similar thought\\-question that might shed light on it \\- suppose a website is hosted using stock settings of some \"off the shelf\" website software, can they sue for copyright/look and feel over the appearance of their site? Probably not since they didn't put creative/novel/original effort into it. But the original software creator probably could.)\n\nHope this partial answer helps.\n\n**Updated to answer follow\\-up comment**\n\nFirst off, you can't force a person to do something based on a contract with someone else. Only the websites contract with the end user (terms of use etc) can do that. So the supplier's contract with the stock price website cannot in any way force an end user to do or not do anything. It can however require the vendor to set specific terms and enforce them. It can require the vendor to sue an abuser of the website terms (or allow the supplier to do so in their place and at their risk) if the supplier says to do so. Or it can allow for anything else agreed between the data supplier and the stocks website.\n\nThe flip side is that this would be a contract case for damages. Unless there are statutory damages (which don't exist in most countries and exist but might not apply in the US), the supplier would have to prove the harm and loss forseeably and directly suffered and would only be compensated for that alone. A lot of breach of contract cases just aren't worth taking to court for that reason \\- because you could prove the contract was breached but not that you lost anything, much less that your loss was a direct result and foreseeable by the end user.\n\n(In the EU, you'd also have to be able to show that the terms were not unreasonable as the law protects consumers from gross disparity if ability to set contract terms, and fixed terms deemed unfair, but that probably wouldn't be an issue here).\n\nThe latter part of the followup is essentially discussing nondisclosure agreements. You don't have to own the data for that \\- there is legal consideration by each party and that's enough (each has given something to the other: \"I will show you some information if you agree to these conditions\"). But that's contractual too, and the same applies, if the user shared the data anyway or disclosed it, your damages would quite likely be limited to the loss you could prove, whatever the contract says.\n\nLast the law on databases/data sets isn't something I know huge amounts about. Where such a law existed, a supplier would probably argue that sufficient original effort went into the collation and organisation of the data and the user would probably counterargue that this was mere storage of data and no original work was involved, or that any damage (if any) was negligible and would have to be proven. As databases have their own law and not pure copyright law, they might be right or wrong, depending on the jurisdiction and wording of the law.\n\nWikipedia articles of relevance to databases/datasets:\n\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sui_generis_database_right> (global information)\n* <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_Directive> (EU specific and more detail what's covered)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A financial website republishes real-time stock quotes obtained from a major stock exchange without permission.

As mentioned in the source material, the protection of such data can differ by country. Some jurisdictions, particularly in the EU, have specific database rights that can protect compilations of data even if individual facts aren't copyrightable. Additionally, while the copyright status of raw stock market data may be questionable, exchanges and data providers often use contractual agreements (terms of service) to restrict redistribution. This means that even if copyright doesn't apply, there may still be legal consequences for violating these agreements. The answer also acknowledges the uncertainty around this topic, which is reflected in the original discussion about the limits of IP protection for factual information like stock prices."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88613/can-a-data-controller-refuse-a-second-sar-from-the-same-person", "docs_id": 88613, "title": "Can a Data Controller refuse a second SAR from the same person?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that a business subject to the GDPR responds to an SAR (Subject Access Request) from a customer, providing video footage of the customer in the store's entry, captured by a security cam.

Java code is compiled into bytecode that requires a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) for execution. This JVM, provided by Oracle, is what necessitates the specific license agreement. In contrast, C and C++ compile directly to machine code that can be executed by the computer's processor without an intermediate virtual machine. \n\nWhile option A is incorrect because C and C++ aren't necessarily open-source, and Java's licensing isn't solely due to Oracle's ownership. Option C is false because C and C++ do have standard libraries, but they're typically part of the operating system. Option D is partially true but oversimplified; while using a computer does involve accepting certain licenses, this isn't specific to C and C++ and doesn't explain Java's distinct licensing needs.\n\nThe correct answer, B, accurately pinpoints the technical and practical reason for Java's specific licensing requirements, which stem from the need to install and use Oracle's JVM."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45897/if-someone-orders-a-pizza-in-the-us-and-doesnt-pay-for-it-could-they-be-arrest", "docs_id": 45897, "title": "If someone orders a pizza in the US and doesn&#39;t pay for it, could they be arrested?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If you were to order a pizza in the US and didn't pay for it afterwards, could you be arrested?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n\nSee [Florida Man's Version of Dine and Dash Involving A Pizza Delivery](https://ktk985.radio.com/blogs/985-ktk-morning-show/florida-mans-version-dine-and-dash-involving-pizza-delivery)\n\nJames Chandler was arrested after allegedly ordering a pizza and cinnamon sticks and partially eating them without paying.

Rather, the entire discourse poetically describes a youth, presumably under the legal adult age of 18 (given restrictions on smoking cigarettes and owning adult literature in the second verse), who faces restrictions upon his or her rights by his legal guardians, in this case a mother, father, and teacher.\n\nWhereas the dictionary definition of the verb form of \"Party\" is defined by Oxford Dictionary as \"Enjoying oneself at a party or other lively gathering, typically with drinking and music.\" As established, the subject of the proposed treaty on this right is legally barred from drinking, though a party may exist without alcohol and thus would not prevent the subject from engaging in an act of partying.\n\nA party or lively gathering would meat the definition of \"Freedom of Peaceful Assembly\" under the First Amendment Rights of the United States Constitution as well as \"Freedom of Association\" under the same amendment. Said party may additionally be for any purpose so long as it is peaceful.\n\nThe state may impose reasonable restrictions on the party, such as noise ordinances, age based restrictions on minors including \"Adult Contents\", cigarettes and alchohol, as discussed. While typcial, they're absence does not prevent the assembly from rising to the level of \"party\" as previous defined.\n\nBeastie Boys contends that the restrictions place upon the subject of their discourse on the Right to Party is unreasonably restricted by the confiscation of several items, enforced school requirements, and dress code as defined by the legal guardian in their right as authority of the youth's rights. Beastie Boys offers little evidence that these restrictions are unreasonable or prevent the subject from \"partying\" as defined above. Beastie Boys do propose that the authority known as the father can not restrict the use of cigarettes by the youth as the father \"smokes two packs a day\". While Beastie Boys is correct that this meets the definition of hypocritical, the father is assumed to be of legal age to purchase cigarettes and is legal allowed to restrict access to them based on reasonable age restrictions and possible heath risks the father wishes to prevent in the youth that he may or may not be suffering from. As there are no formal requirements for a peaceful assembly to rise to the level of party, it can be presumed that these restrictions would not affect the party as defined. It should also be noted that in the Beastie Boys discourse, that the authority figure referred to as mother did not restrict the youths ability to listen to the content of the discourse, nor were any restrictions described tailored in such a fashion as to restrict the discourse specifically.\n\nWhile there is no amendment defining the right to party in the United States Constitution, the 9th Amendment does clearly state that citizens rights are not enumerated in the constitution and other rights not discussed in the constitution may exists and be claimed by the individual.\n\nFrom an originalist standpoint, it is widely accept that a good number of The Framers of the Constitution quite frequently met the accepted definition of the phrase \"Drunk off their Ass\" and thus, would not reasonably be against what can be defined as a \"party\". Additionally, many were participants in an event that was known as the \"Tea Party\", which was agreed by many to be quite the lively gathering at its time and was still viewed as quite the \"radical\" affair of the day, many wearing costumes such as those who attended in clothing traditional of Native Americans. They were also most likely not drunk during the course of this party. Thus, the intent of the framers was never to restrict or deniegn such a right\n\nThus, a reasonable court in the United States would hold that the Right to Party does exist for all U.S. citizens and is inalienable.\n\nBeastie Boys also argues that it is acceptable to fight for one's right to party. This does not conflict with the First Amendment Right to petition government for grievances so long as it is again a peaceable affair. Given the poetic nature of the discourse, we can presume that \"Fight\" would mean to defend or struggle in a non\\-violent manor for such a right. This is backed up through originalism as the restrictions placed on many citizens of Boston for their actions during the Tea Party were subsequently fought against for many years, culminating in the Constitution.\n\nThus, it can be assumed that the United States does recognize the right of the people to party and the right of the people to fight for the aforementioned right.

Trump is preparing to walk into a Manhattan courtroom as both a defendant and a candidate, making final plans for his **arrest** on Tuesday \\[...].\n\nWhy would he be arrested? Is there a danger of flight? That seems implausible, given that he has arranged his appearance in front of the court out of his own volition, and because of his commercial, family and real estate ties to the country, and his plans to run for president again.\n\nIs there a danger of destroying evidence? In all reality, that would have happened by now, and most relevant searches have probably been conducted already.\n\nWhat other reasons would be there for an arrest?\n\n**As a clarification:** If I'm not mistaken, in Germany an indictment would simply be delivered by special registered mail, unless one of the above\\-mentioned dangers was present.\n\nIn the U.S., a simple delivery of an indictment can take on an appearance which I can only perceive as unnecessarily disparaging. A defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty. To me this principle implies that defendants should be treated with respect like any other citizen. Putting them in humiliating situations, let alone using force like restraining them with handcuffs like in the [case of Mr. Weisselberg](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/trump-org-cfo-allen-weisselberg-waives-right-to-remain-silent-during-arrest-117095493824) contradicts this principle, unless there is reason to believe they would flee or otherwise obstruct the trial.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An accused would be arrested for the purposes of [***arraignment***](https://nycourts.gov/courthelp/criminal/arraignments.shtml) (\"even a scheduled arrest is still an arrest\").

Since the federal government controls both processes, it is free to create interdependencies between those processes. For example, it can require passport applicants to give their social security numbers if it wants to be able to cancel the passports of those who are delinquent in paying their taxes.\n\nThe \"bill by congress\" does not become binding law until signed by the president, as you no doubt are aware. Independent government agencies may create requirements for inter\\-agency business by agreement, as long as that does not conflict with the law. Some statutes will say things like \"... or as so\\-and\\-so may by regulation provide.\" This hints at the existence of another important code, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

[In particular](https://www.albertaregulations.ca/pdfs/hunting-regs/Licensing.pdf):\n\n> Hunters must possess a valid Wildlife Certificate and the applicable\n> hunting licence to hunt big game or game birds.\n\nThis includes bow hunting.

During the rainy seasons of 2017\\-2018 and the very wet 2018\\-2019, the tenant reported, on multiple occasions, leaks from the roof. These never seemed to have been properly addressed.\n\nMore recently, there was a severe enough leak that caused some damage by splattering as it dripped. The water is a dark rust color, and stains everything it touches.\n\nMore recently, water trapped in the ceiling insulation (which is held up by a plastic barrier) proved to be too heavy for the plastic and it ruptured, leaking all over numerous belongings. The landlord is unwilling to cover this damage, telling me that's what the tenant's insurance is for. The tenant has insurance that should cover this, but one of the few obligations the lease places on the landlord is to keep the roof in good working order.\n\nWhat are the legal options? It's very hard to search for information for commercial leases; almost everything online is about residential leases.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIs the landlord typically liable for damage to contents in a situation like this (that is, when they've failed to maintain the roof in proper working order, and the resulting water ingress damages the contents)? Or is it some kind of standard practice that the tenant's insurance should pay, and then the insurance company deals with the landlord?\n\nThe next question is, what kind of attorney handles this sort of thing?\n\nThe most important thing is to get the landlord to fix the roof to prevent further damage. Talking to other tenants suffering similar damage, it seems they're reluctant to fix it, and downright unwilling to pay for damages.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, keeping the roof in working order is the obligation of the landlord in a commercial modified gross lease. It would honestly be quite unusual for the tenant's insurance to cover it, and it would likewise be unusual for the landlord not to have insurance that covers an incident like this to the extent that it is insurable (usually, deterioration of a roof is not covered by anyone's insurance unless it is caused by a specific event like a hail storm, or toilet seat from an aircraft that blew up in mid\\-flight crashing down on it (if you miss the allusion to \"Dead Like Me\", don't sweat it)).\n\nIf the tenant's insurance does pay, it would normally have a right to subrogate against the landlord (i.e. sue the landlord for the money that it was out), but many commercial leases have an anti\\-subrogation clause that prohibits a tenant's insurer from pursuing a subrogation claim against the landlord (not all leases have such a term, but many do), since this is really the landlord's responsibility.\n\nThe landlord ordinarily would be liable to the tenant for damage foreseeably caused by the failure to the landlord to do what the landlord is obligated to do, but this is complicated because the tenant has a duty to mitigate damages if reasonably possible. So, rather than just allowing its stuff to be water damaged, the tenant is obligated to do what is necessary to prevent the damage (at least, if this is cheaper than allowing the damage to occur) and then sue for the cost of mitigation, rather than for the damage itself.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in many commercial leases, the landlord's obligation to repair is not triggered until a demand is made, the landlord refused, the tenant gives a written notice of default to the landlord, and the landlord does not address the problem within a \"cure\" period of a specified number of days after receiving the notice of default. A review of the lease for such provisions is in order.\n\nIf the landlord is allegedly in default, it may be possible to bring a lawsuit to compel the landlord to do the repair, or better yet, for the tenants to give the proper notices, then to make the repair, and then to withhold rent in the amount of the alleged damage or to sue the landlord for the cost of mitigation and to collect a judgment by withholding rent as a setoff against the judgment. If the lease is long enough for the litigation to run its course and still have enough of the lease left to setoff against rent due to collect, that may be a viable option.\n\n> what kind of attorney handles this sort of thing?\n\nReal estate, business law, commercial litigation and business litigation would all be common specialties for a law firm that handles this kind of dispute to advertise.\n\nLawyers who primarily do criminal law, immigration law, custody cases, personal injury, personal bankruptcy cases, and defense of residential evictions, would typically be inappropriate.\n\nThe lawyer will not be cheap, but usually, in a commercial lease situation, the dollar stakes are considerable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a commercial modified gross lease situation where the landlord has failed to maintain the roof, resulting in water damage to a tenant's property, what is typically the most appropriate course of action for the tenant?\n\nA) File a claim with the tenant's insurance company, as it's standard practice for tenant insurance to cover such damages\nB) Immediately sue the landlord for damages without giving any notice or opportunity to repair\nC) Take no action and continue to allow damage to occur, as it's solely the landlord's responsibility\nD) Mitigate damages if possible, document the issues, provide proper notice to the landlord, and if necessary, repair and seek reimbursement or rent offset\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because tenant insurance typically doesn't cover damages resulting from the landlord's failure to maintain the property. It would be unusual for the tenant's insurance to cover this.\n\nOption B is premature and potentially harmful to the tenant's case. Many commercial leases require proper notice and a cure period before legal action can be taken.\n\nOption C is incorrect because tenants have a duty to mitigate damages when reasonably possible. Allowing damage to continue could weaken the tenant's position.\n\nOption D is the most appropriate course of action. The tenant should mitigate damages if possible, document the issues, provide proper notice to the landlord (including any required default notices), and if necessary, make repairs and seek reimbursement or rent offset.

US $100 bills are a prime example of \"money\".

Anyone can print or otherwise \"emit\" objects with economic value, and such objects can be voluntarily accepted in trade. State and local governments can incur debts and thus spend money now that they do not yet have, as long as there is no legal limit on a government's ability to go into debt. California could issue IOU\\-bucks with the intent that a holder could redeem them as real federal money or as gold or silver at some point.\n\nThis limits the ability of a state treasury to print money, since in principle and practice\nit is redeemable in gold or silver. Each state has some set of laws and constitutional provisions that prevent writing rubber checks *ad infinitum*, for example only allowing debt for large capital projects (building) and requiring voter approval; requiring expenditures to not exceed projected revenues; granting emergency debt\\-mitigation powers (e.g. hiring freezes) to the governor when a state does go into unauthorized debt. In California, [Art IV \u00a712](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%2012.&article=IV) of the state constitution requires a balanced budget, meaning that the state cannot create infinite obligations without infinite revenues.\n\nFrom the legal perspective, private banks do not create money, although non\\-legally, [people may talk about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation) what banks do as \"creating money\".

However, states can incur debt and spend money within legal limits, such as for capital projects with voter approval or emergency situations.\n\nOption D is incorrect.

This would be the case where someone steals parts (or the whole car) from a dealership; a crime was committed.

The key factors are:\n\n1. Florida's burglary law requires intent to commit an offense when entering a vehicle.\n2. Merely inspecting a car at a dealership, even after hours, likely doesn't demonstrate criminal intent.\n3. The dealership's accessibility (unfenced, no \"No Trespassing\" signs) could be interpreted as the premises being \"open to the public\" or the public being \"invited to enter,\" which are exceptions to burglary under Florida law.\n4. Opening an unlocked door without damaging the vehicle or intending to commit a crime inside doesn't meet the criteria for breaking and entering or burglary.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the closed status of the dealership alone doesn't make it breaking and entering.

Does this reduce the risk of genericization? Is there any other legal advantage to doing this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is capitalized because the word NEXIUM has a conspicuous definition. In other words, they're using it in the specific way they have defined it to mean. This is to differentiate it from any other meaning it may have in some other context. Obviously with NEXIUM, it's a word they just made up and it's very unlikely that it could ever be confused with anything other than their particular drug.\n\nBut what if the drug were called PRAXIA? The word praxia might be confused with the medical term. It's also the name of a city in Romania (I just learned that while looking that word up). But PRAXIA in all caps refers specifically to their drug, and there can be no ambiguity between that and other uses of the term.\n\nThis is especially important for drugs, since they are legally required to disclose the side effects in their advertising, and you wouldn't want someone potentially confusing the name of the drug with the condition it treats.\n\nYou see this in contracts as well. When a contract provision is written in ALL CAPS, it is done to conspicuously call attention to the text, either because it is redefining an established legal term or is modifying rights you may have under the law (e.g. LIMITED WARRANTY, SEVERABILITY, BINDING ARBITRATION, etc.)\n\nThere is no established rule for this, by the way. It's mostly a matter of style. Some laws require conspicuous disclosure of certain provisions in contracts, so ALL CAPS has traditionally been used to meet that requirement.\n\nNOTE: The term \"Nexium\" (not in caps) is simply the registered trademark for the drug. It simply protects their intellectual property (i.e. the name), and isn't intended to describe or define anything in a legal way.\n\n---\n\n**Fun fact:** Subway got sued for making \"Footlong\" sandwiches that were not actually 12 inches in length. They tried to argue that \"Footlong\" was a trademark and not intended to convey the length of their sandwiches. They settled the lawsuit, because really, that's a jackass move right there.

Using \"ZEPHYREX\" in all capital letters within text serves to conspicuously define the term and differentiate it from any potential other uses or meanings. This is particularly important in safety information and side effect disclosures, where clarity is crucial.\n\n2. The all-caps usage helps to avoid potential confusion with other terms or generic uses, which could be especially important if \"Zephyrex\" had any other meanings or similar-sounding words.\n\n3. Using \"Zephyrex\" as a logo (likely with only the first letter capitalized) maintains the trademark protection for the brand name and visual identity.\n\n4. This dual approach mirrors the practice described in the example of Nexium, which uses all-caps in text but a stylized logo with only the first letter capitalized.\n\nOption A doesn't provide the conspicuous definition that all-caps offers.

Noone of your adversaries in A would say \"Hmmm, they're from B, we can't sue them here in A\".

You cannot have a food supermarket in the EU directly owned by a US company \u2014 it needs to be owned by an entity registered in the EU (which in turn can be owned by the US company though). If your business is purely online then you could get away without a local entity \u2014 but only until you become noticeable: Google, PayPal etc. all have entities in Europe and those are the targets for any litigation coming from Europe.\n\nIt is true though that having your *assets* registered in B would require your adversaries in A to litigate in B to get hold of your assets (unless they are present in A physically; it is not uncommon for two states in confrontation to arrest each other's property).\n\nBottom line:\n\n* if your customers are mostly/entirely in A, then having your business domiciled in B can only be justified if there are assets that can stay outside A without adversely affecting the business (e.g. intellectual property)\n* if your customers can be anywhere then definitely chose B to domicile your business.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A startup is considering establishing its business structure across two countries to minimize legal risks.

The answer explicitly mentions that adversaries in Country A would not be deterred from suing the company just because it's registered elsewhere.

No.\n\nIntellectual property practitioners and professors often describe copyright as \"a bundle of sticks.\" This means that intellectual property laws grant the creator of a copyrightable work a large number of rights, and the creator can grant or deny others each of those rights individually. So, for instance, an author can grant a publisher the right to publish his or her book in one country, but not in another, or to copy it verbatim but not to alter it.\n\nThe purpose of a license, any license, is to specify which of those rights pass to the licensee (the end user) and which stay with the licensor (the creator).\n\nThis is true of creative commons just as it is for any other license. For example, many open access publishers publish under the Creative Commons CC\\-BY journal. This is an attribution license; it requires as a term of the license that you give credit to the original creator. This is something you would not have to do with a public domain work. \n\nIn addition, under CC\\-BY, you have to include a copy of the license with each copy you distribute, and you cannot add your own copy protection to any copies you distribute. Again, these sort of restrictions do not apply to a public domain work.\n\nIn short: the purpose of a license\\-\\-any license\\-\\-is to define the ways in which you can, or can not, use the licensed materials.

Public domain works, on the other hand, can be used without any attribution requirements. Additionally, Open Access licenses may include other stipulations, such as including a copy of the license with distributed copies or prohibiting the addition of copy protection. These restrictions, however minor, make Open Access articles more restrictive than public domain works, which can be used without any conditions.

However, the actual game doesn't contain these characters at all.\n\nOn the one hand, I wondered if while the ad could likely be removed on copyright grounds, would the game itself be shielded by not actually including these characters?

The same issue would arise if the product contained public domain images in the advertisements that aren't present in the work itself.\n\nEssentially, the question comes down to whether there was actionable deceptive advertising. Usually, these claims arise under specialized consumer protection statutes that offer remedies and means of enforcement different from an individualized fraud lawsuit, and usually a deceptive advertising claim is easier to prove than traditional fraud lawsuit.\n\nTraditional fraud lawsuits normally require a showing of damages caused by reasonable reliance upon the misrepresentation, which is uneconomic to prove in the case of an individual small consumer purchase.\n\nUsually, deceptive advertising of consumer products is established in a lawsuit by a government official in charge of regulating deceptive advertising or a class action lawsuit, and often statutory damages are assigned to each violation rather than requiring detailed proof of economic harm for compensatory damages from some but not other images being present.\n\nOften fine print in the advertisement or in a purchase form before buying the product discloses the disconnect. Also, the mere presence of an image in an advertisement doesn't necessary imply that it is included in the product. So prove of deceptive advertising liability in these cases is often difficult even with these relaxed standards.

The text explains that this situation is not primarily a copyright issue, but rather a matter of potentially deceptive advertising. Consumer protection laws, which are typically easier to enforce than traditional fraud lawsuits, are more likely to be applied in such cases. While including a disclaimer (option D) might help, it doesn't guarantee protection from legal action.

In cases where contract terms appear to contradict each other, courts often apply the doctrine of contra proferentem. This principle states that ambiguities in a contract should be interpreted against the interests of the party that drafted the document. This approach encourages clear and precise contract drafting.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the court doesn't automatically rule in favor of the paying party. The terms of the contract and legal principles guide the interpretation.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the sequence of clauses in a contract doesn't inherently determine their priority or precedence.\n\nAnswer D is extreme and unlikely. Courts generally try to interpret contracts in a way that gives effect to the parties' intentions rather than declaring them entirely void, unless there are fundamental issues with the contract's formation or legality.\n\nThe court would likely examine the definitions and context carefully, potentially interpreting \"deliverables\" narrowly to exclude source code if that interpretation is reasonable, thus resolving the apparent contradiction in favor of the non-drafting party."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82846/who-should-pay-for-the-removal-and-reinstallation-of-the-screens-for-the-exclusi", "docs_id": 82846, "title": "Who should pay for the removal and reinstallation of the screens for the exclusive use balcony when HOA needs to remodel the balcony?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My HOA is doing this renovation project, which needs to get access and modify the balcony (where I have my screens), and asking me to pay the cost of removing and reinstallation?

It's very common for balconies to be [limited common elements](https://hoaresources.caionline.org/limited-common-element-hoa-condo/), that is, the balcony is actually owned by the condominium as a whole, but you are entitled to exclusive access to it. Depending on the details of the declaration the HOA may be entirely responsible for maintenance of the balcony or the owner may be partially responsible.

Balconies are often considered \"limited common elements,\" meaning they're owned by the condominium as a whole but with exclusive access granted to specific unit owners. The declaration would specify whether owners can make modifications like installing screens and who is responsible for maintaining or removing such modifications during renovations. Without examining the specific declaration and possibly consulting a lawyer, it's not possible to definitively state who is responsible for the costs.

This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\n> \n> \n> (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\n> \n> \n> (b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.\n\nSo whether someone is an EU citizen, is not relevant.
