Probate has been done for months now. We all 3 inherited her house in equal shares, two of us live there. I am being told because they were executors that they can decide to sell, without my consent as they are still in charge, due to being executors. Is this true? I was under the impression that when probate was settled and all the affairs of the deceased person had been settled, that the duty and/or authority of an executor is done.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If three people inherited a house in equal shares, then a new deed should have been prepared and filed with the appropriate governmental authority (the county in most US states) before probate is closed. When that is done the authority of the executors over the house **as executors** has ended.\n\nHowever, if I understand you correctly, the two former executors are also two of the three heirs to the house. Thus they own a 2/3rds interest in the house. At least they can sell their interests without your consent, leaving you a minority owner with the purchaser owner a majority. In some jurisdictions they may be able to force a sale, paying you your share of the purchase price. But this would be because of their majority ownership, not because of their former status as executors.\n\n**Addition**:\nIn some states co\\-owners who are joint tenants may not sell their interests without the consent of the other co\\-owners, but this is jnot true in North Carolina\n\nAccording to the site of the [Hutchens Law office](https://hutchenslawfirm.com/blog/real-estate/forms-ownership-interest-nc-real-property):\n\n> ownership as tenants in common provides each party with the right to\n> sell, gift, devise, or otherwise convey their interest in the property\n> without the permission of the other owners. This means that the\n> ownership interest is freely alienable or transferable.

But whichever form of co\\-ownership is chosen: tenants in common, joint tenants without a right of survivorship, or joint tenants with a right of survivorship, each of the co\\-owners has a right during his or her lifetime to sell, give away, or use as collateral on a loan his or her share of the property, without consulting the other co\\-owners. They cannot force the other co\\-owner(s) to sell, except by starting an action of partition in a court, when a judge would decide. An unrelated buyer might be unwilling to purchase only a 1/3 or 2/3rds interest, because the remaining co\\-owner(s) would still have full rights to use and occupy the house, can could sell to a different buyer.\n\nAll co\\-owners are responsible for their proportionate shares of all expenses, including mortgage payments, repairs, and taxes.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Three siblings - Alice, Bob, and Carol - inherit their mother's house in North Carolina as equal co-owners.

Which of the following statements is true?\n\nA) As former executors, Bob and Carol have the authority to sell the entire house without Alice's consent.\n\nB) Bob and Carol can sell their 2/3 interest in the house without Alice's permission, potentially leaving Alice as a minority owner with the new buyer.\n\nC) Alice can prevent Bob and Carol from selling their shares of the house because they are joint tenants.\n\nD) Bob and Carol must obtain a court order to force the sale of the house, regardless of Alice's wishes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In North Carolina, co-owners of property (whether as tenants in common or joint tenants without right of survivorship) have the right to sell their individual interests without the consent of other co-owners. Bob and Carol, owning a 2/3 interest together, can sell their shares without Alice's permission. This could result in Alice becoming a minority owner alongside the new buyer. The former executor status is irrelevant after probate is closed. While Bob and Carol cannot force Alice to sell her share without a court order (partition action), they are free to sell their own interests. Option A is incorrect because executor authority ends after probate. Option C is incorrect because in North Carolina, joint tenants can sell their interests freely.

Private schools can enforce these policies through their contractual agreements with parents. Refusing to comply with a school's disciplinary action could lead to further consequences, potentially including suspension or expulsion. The parent does not have the unilateral right to override the school's disciplinary measures, and the school is not obligated to release the child immediately upon parent demand if it conflicts with established policies.

Here is a link to a draft of the order: [https://kateklonick.com/wp\\-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT\\-EO\\-Preventing\\-Online\\-Censorship.pdf](https://kateklonick.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DRAFT-EO-Preventing-Online-Censorship.pdf)\n\nSome questions I have...\n\n* Is my summary an accurate description?\n* A common part of the debate has been \"free speech\", which isn't relevant to a private company. However, are there other times the FCC has set guidelines that effectively influence free speech?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Addressing only the document that you link to without assumption of accuracy or finality, it says that \"It is the policy of the United States to foster clear, nondiscriminatory ground rules promoting free and open debate on the Internet. Prominent among those rules is the immunity from liability\", referring to [47 USC 230](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230), and specifically \"the scope of that immunity should be clarified\". It is clear that the law say nothing about what counts as \"good faith\", nor does it say anything about what constitutes \"otherwise objectionable\". The document correctly say that the law \"does not extend to deceptive or pretextual actions restricting online content\", at leas as long as we understand \"extend to\" as meaning \"explicitly mention\". Similarly, the law does not explicitly say anything about whether a provider violating its own TOS nullifies the \"good faith restriction\" clause.\n\nThe order then directs the Dept. of Commerce to petition the **FCC** for regulations clarifying the interpretation of this law (I assume you meant FCC and not FTC). It specifically proposes explicitly interpreting \"taken in good faith\" to exclude actions that are deceptive, pretextual or inconsistent with a provider's TOS, or \"the result of inadequate notice, the product of unreasoned explanation, or having been undertaking \\[sic] without a meaningful opportunity to be heard\".\n\nEverybody is presently open to litigation for defamation (for example), because you can allege that pretextual or \"unreasonable\" restrictions on speech *are* in bad faith, then the courts have to evaluate that question. What the regulations would do is provide a default answer (\"yes, it is\"), which the courts would follow unless the regulation is overturned in court or is rescinded. \n\nThere are vast numbers of restrictions on free speech by the FCC: the whole purpose of the FCC is to restrict the freedom to speak as one may please. The initial premise was that the government didn't want broadcaster A to functionally obliterate broadcaster B due to the strength of his signal on a particular frequency, so you are not free to speak in certain ways. There are numerous other restrictions on what you may say within the sphere regulated by the FCC, e.g. you can't broadcast live sex acts on network TV during Saturday morning cartoon time. The [Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine) and the [equal time rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-time_rule) are / were other examples of restrictions on free speech (via compelled speech). \"Free speech\" is an open\\-enough concept that it is reasonable to consider anything with a governmentally\\-mandated \"non\\-level playing field\" to be a restriction on free speech (for example, statutory immunizations of a certain class of individuals against legal consequences of their acts). The problem with saying what acts of the FCC \"restrict free speech\" is that there isn't a clear definition of \"free speech\" that is consistent with laws against threatening, fraud, perjury and defamation.\n\nAs for the accuracy of your summary, there are also provisions regarding [deceptive practices](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/45). There is more to it than you summarized (obviously: that's what a summary is), but apart from misspelling FCC I'd say that the summary is brief and not as informative (or verbose) as the original, but it is not deceptive. If you want a well\\-intentioned criticism, I think it is important to be specific about the fact that there is been some statutory immunization against liability which is the core of the order, but you didn't clarify that point. Governments litigate against companies (mostly) all the time, but governments do not litigate against companies or individuals for defamation or violating a TOS, and nothing in the order suggests that the government could start to sue social media companies for defamation or breach of contract, that is, the scope of the potential litigation is limited in an important way.

Second, she might think that \"You're not a tenant, you're just living here\" but that is pretty much what it means to be a tenant \u2013 she agreed to let the relative live there. There does not have to be a detailed lease written up, though the term of such unwritten agreements is usually month\\-to\\-month (this is all about the laws of the particular state, but no state authorizes instant expulsion).\n\nYou would need to look at the laws of your state for the \"abuse\" question. Using Washington as [an example](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=74.34), and trying to make the best case possible that bailing out is against the law, the potential legal concern is \"abandonment\", which is defined as an\n\n> action or inaction by a person or entity with a duty of care for a\n> vulnerable adult that leaves the vulnerable person without the means\n> or ability to obtain necessary food, clothing, shelter, or health\n> care.\n\nthe failure of a vulnerable adult, not living in a facility, to provide for himself or herself the goods and services necessary for the vulnerable adult's physical or mental health, and the absence of which impairs or threatens the vulnerable adult's well\\-being. This definition may include a vulnerable adult who is receiving services through home health, hospice, or a home care agency, or an individual provider when the neglect is not a result of inaction by that agency or individual provider.\n\nRCW 74\\.34\\.200 creates a legal cause of action for abandonment, abuse, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable adult. Then one might sue for abandonment if one is living at home and\n\n> receives care from a home health, hospice, or home care agency, or an\n> individual provider\n\nBut, \"individual provider\" is a defined legal term:\n\n> a person under contract with the department to provide services in the\n> home under chapter 74\\.09 or 74\\.39A RCW\n\nIf the tenant is under contract with the state to provide services, then abandoning the vulnerable adult could get you sued. The courts do not declare that a duty of care exists because of a genetic relationship. A duty of care might be found from a contractual relation (one not involving a state social services agency), for example \"You can live here if you take care of me\". So there is a legal concern over abandonment, which the person should talk out with an attorney (which is possible since instant\\-eviction is not an option).

It's obvious that if you spend 3\\-4 hours a day commuting and share a flat with a bunch of people, your performance at work is bound to be suboptimal, even though we have no specific complaints about your performance. Your work is critically important to our group, so we want to get the most from you and expect you to rent a comfortable apartment solely for yourself and close to work. That's why we pay you that much and your salary is supposed to cover this.\n\nThere are some other details in the secretary's message regarding dress code and eating together with colleagues, but for this question I want to focus only on the matter of how far away the employee lives and whether they live with other people or alone.\n\nGiven that there are admittedly no issues with the employee's performance, would it be legal for the employer to decline to renew the employee's fixed term contract solely because their commute is long and they live in a shared flat? Suppose for the sake of this question that the employer would definitely renew the contract if the employee acceded to the demand that they move closer and live alone, and the employer's demand is not related to the nature of the work (e.g. the employee is not required to get to the office quickly in case of emergency, and they do not take home sensitive information which would need to be kept from others in their household). If it would change the answer, assume that these demands would not be written into a renewal contract, rather they only form the basis of whether the employer chooses to offer a renewal.\n\nThe original question regards a German employer, and probably in the public sector, but information about other jurisdictions may be interesting too.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Restatement of facts\n\n* Employee Kaya3 has been working for 22 months with employer E under a 2\u2011year fixed term employment contract.\n* E has informally hinted they would like to extend/renew the contract with Kaya3\\.\n* Yet there is no employment contract about the subsequent period yet.\n* E cites Kaya3\u2019s distant place of residence and living conditions (a shared apartment) as the reasons for not concluding an employment contract.\nE fears Kaya3\u2019s performance would suffer under these circumstances.\n* Kaya3 comes from a developing country and likes to save as much earnings as possible, i.\u202fe. prefers cheaper accommodation.\n* There is no public or internal job posting concerning the subsequent period.\n\n### ~~Opinion~~ Thoughts\n\n1. **Contractual obligations**  \n\nThere *is no contract* obligating the parties to conclude an employment contract.\nThere is also no legal obligation to conclude a contract.\nThis is an expression of freedom of contract.\nThere *are* restrictions:\nFor instance, the [Universal Equal Treatment Act](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_agg/index.html) (AGG) forbids discrimination based on grounds of sex, ethnicity, age, among others.\nYet violation of none the restrictions bear the consequence that a contract is concluded, as emphasized for instance in \u00a7\u00a015\u00a0\u2165\u00a0AGG.\n2. **Quasi\\-contractual obligations**  \n\nInstead German labor law is completely focused on damages.\n\n\t1. *culpa in contrahendo*  \n\n\tBy starting business relations you are already entering a semi\\-contractual relationship, \u00a7\u00a0311\u00a0\u2161\u00a0BGB.\n\tHere E and Kaya3 started talking about a future employment (\\=\u00a0*start* of business relationship possibly culminating in conclusion of a contract).\n\tThis \u201ccontract\u201d imposes the duty to take account of each other\u2019s interest, \u00a7\u00a0241\u00a0\u2161\u00a0BGB.\n\tThat means e.\u202fg. gaslighting someone, say, *pretending* you *would* like to conclude a contract even though there has never been such intent, is forbidden, because it is not in good faith, \u00a7\u00a0242\u00a0BGB.\n\tBreaching this duty could lead to a claim in damages, \u00a7\u00a0280\u00a0\u2160\u00a01\u00a0BGB.\n\tHowever, in the present case there is not enough evidence that E was trying to \u201churt\u201d Kaya3\\.\n\tQuite the contrary, it is in the *fixed\\-term* contract\u2019s nature to fulfill a *temporary* need.\n\tFurthermore, since Kaya3 still has 2 months to work, there is still time to conclude a follow\\-up contract.\n\tA damage\u00a0\u2013 here lack of income\u00a0\u2013 has not even occurred yet.\n\t2. unequal treatment *c.\u202fi.\u202fc.*  \n\n\tE\u2019s decisions to not (yet) hire Kaya3 could be *veiled* racial discrimination or xenophobia, illegal considerations as per \u00a7\u00a7\u00a07\u00a0\u2160,\u00a06\u202f\u2160\u202f2,\u00a01\u202fAlt.\u202f1\u202f\\+\u202f2\u00a0AGG.\n\tE says he was afraid of Kaya3\u2019s work performance suffering when in fact he does not want to hire foreigners (here characterized by the circumstance that Kaya3 in fact prefers his current living situation which is quite normal in his country of origin).\n\tOn the one hand E having already hired Kaya3 once indicates he does not discriminate based on such criteria.\n\tOn the other hand it is possible that there was a change in HR\u2019s personnel so a different recruiter (for which E is responsible) is in charge now.\n\tOn the one hand Kaya3\u2019s performance on the job never gave rise to consider firing him.\n\tOn the other hand the fixed\\-term contract fulfilled a temporary need, thus a subsequent open\\-ended contract could have legitimately higher standards.\n\n\tAnswering this will require complete details, but this kind of question is in fact very frequent in practice:\n\tIs it still a *legitimate reason* or already *indirect discrimination*?\n3. **Tort obligations**  \n\nThe regulations of the Universal Equal Treatment Act (AGG) could be considered guard statutes for \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0823\u00a0\u2160,\u00a0\u2161\u00a01\u00a0BGB, yet the AGG is *lex specialis* to the general provisions of the BGB.\nIn general, damages are those legal rights the damaged party would have without the damaging event, \u00a7\u00a0249\u00a0\u2160\u00a0BGB.\nThus you could say, \u201crefusing to contract\u201d was the damaging event; if we omit the \u201cdamaging event\u201d there would have been an employment contract.\nHowever, as \u00a7 15 \u2165 AGG emphasizes, conclusion of a contract cannot be damages.\nThis is again a consequence of the freedom of contract which is an expression of the universal personal rights enshrined in the Basic Law, Art.\u00a02\u00a0\u2160 in conjunction with\u00a0Art.\u00a01\u00a0\u2160\u00a0GG (partially applicable to a company, Art.\u00a019\u00a0\u2162\u00a0GG, even though a company doesn\u2019t have a \u201cpersonality\u201d).\n4. **Conclusion**  \n\nKaya3 is not entitled to get an employment contract, nor does he have a claim for damages.\n\n### Answer\n\nJust to answer your question:\nYes, generally speaking an employer is allowed to discriminate based on where and how someone lives.\nAn employment contract, \u00a7\u00a0611\u00a0BGB, has to be fulfilled in person.\nYou cannot, say, send *your brother* to do the work which *you* are supposed to do (the employer will rightfully reject such performance).\nThus the employer can have arbitrary standards when filling a vacancy, even criteria that do not seem related to the job.\nThere are just the criteria like religion, beliefs, sex, ethnicity, and so on, which may not be taken into consideration.\nSo, even though an employer\u2019s question like \u201cHave you visited a mosque before?\u201d is neutral in nature, it creates exposure to litigation (potential indirect discrimination again).\n\nIt is also perfectly legal not to hire somebody, simply because they have already worked for the same employer (or predecessor) under a fixed\\-term contract and thus *the next* employment contract (if any) *must* be an open\\-ended contract (unless there is a good reason) \\[simplified summary of the TzBfG].\nThis practice has been repeatedly criticized by (left\\-leaning) labor unions and other parties.\n\n### Advice\n\n* Social insurance:\nAlways inform the employment agency (3 months ahead) about looming unemployment even if the current employer says \u201cwe\u2019ll extend your contract\u201d.\nOtherwise you run the risk of a period of disqualification (*Sperrzeit*, \u00a7\u00a0159\u00a0\u2160\u00a02\u00a0No.\u00a09\u00a0SGB\u00a0\u2162), because the employer might change his mind until you have concluded a contract.\n* Switching employers:\nNever terminate an open\\-end employment contract until you *have signed* the contract with the new employer.\nOtherwise, the new employer might retract his (informal) offer and then you\u2019re out of work completely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee at a German research institute has been told by their employer that their long commute and shared living situation may negatively impact their work performance, even though there are no specific complaints about their current performance.

Few months later, they did a chargeback for everything. The total, fittingly, was $2,666 dollars.\n\nI always took money out of paypal asap, since I don't trust them to hold money, so now my paypal balance is massively negative.

The most I can own is up to the high tide mark. However, if the sea level rises then the amount of land I own would also decrease, in which case do I get compensation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") and [scotland](/questions/tagged/scotland \"show questions tagged 'scotland'\"), no.\n\nAt common law, with a hefty influence from Roman writers such as [Gaius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_(jurist)) who tackled the topic, gradual changes in a natural boundary are distinguished from others. This is usually encountered in the case of a river, whose course may change slightly from year to year. New deposits are laid down and other parts are eroded, generally imperceptibly. These processes are called *alluvion* and *diluvion*, and distinguished from *avulsion* where a chunk of identifiable land is washed downriver. Deliberately\\-induced changes are also different.\n\nFor those slow and natural changes, the position is that where ownership of the land is defined with reference to the natural boundary, the extent of ownership also changes when the boundary moves. This is a sensible rule in the absence of modern surveying methods, and generally matches what people expect \\- I own the land on the south bank, you own it on the north, and it doesn't make sense for me to gain a sliver of land on the other side if the river should happen to meander a bit. It is possible to override that assumption by agreement between the landowners (or else litigate it) but that is the starting point.\n\nThe sea works in the same way, except that the \"landowner\" on the other side is the Crown. (Quotation marks because it is not the same kind of ownership that ordinary people exercise.) The intermediate area, the foreshore, has its own rules, so in fact there are multiple boundaries to think about \\- the mean high water mark, the mean low water mark \\- but it's the same idea. The foreshore might be owned by the Crown, as the sea is, but maybe by somebody else. Perhaps what was my land is now underwater at high tide, but exposed at low tide; and some other bit of land used to be foreshore and now is totally submerged.\n\nEveryday tidal changes do not affect ownership, nor do unusually large tides either way. But if I own land next to the sea, I may gain some land, or lose it, by natural action. Gradually rising sea levels move the tide lines and the property rights follow. Some riverbeds are also owned by the Crown, so the same principle is at work there too for the motion of Crown boundaries.\n\nThe rationale for *why* the Crown owns these places is not clear: there are several possible explanations to do with it being for the common good, or alternatively just an old feudal rule. That might affect adjudication of rights in some cases, such as for access to the \"new foreshore\" for particular activities: see [*R (Newhaven Port and Properties Ltd) v East Sussex CC* \\[2015] UKSC 7](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2015/7.html) for an investigation of the public right to swim on an English beach. Even in the case of Udal law in Orkney and Shetland, ownership does not extend to the sea beyond the low\\-tide mark, since the Crown has sovereign rights (*Shetland Salmon Farmers Association v Crown Estate Commissioners* 1991 SLT 166\\).\n\nIn land registration, a boundary marked on a cadastral map is not taken as authoritative when the underlying geographical feature moves. That's in the [Land Registration Act 2002, section 61(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/9/section/61) for England and Wales, and the [Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2002, sections 66](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/66) and [73(2\\)(i)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/5/section/73) in Scotland. Courts have inferred that a boundary coinciding with such a feature is \"meant\" to be this way, even if it wasn't defined like that in words \\- see for example [*Southern Centre of Theosophy Incorporated v The State of South Australia (Australia)* \\[1981] UKPC 41](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1981/1981_41.html) in the Privy Council.

McAlpine also provided a \u2018duty of care deed\u2019 to UIPL directly\n>  whereby they agreed to use all reasonable skill, etc. in constructing the building.\n\np 350\n\n> The project did not go well and the costs of repairs for the alleged defects plus damages for\n>  delay were estimated to be tens of millions of pounds. **The decision was made by the group of\n>  companies to sue under the main contract between McAlpine and Panatown rather than under\n>  the duty of care deed between McAlpine and UIPL. \\[I boldened.]** McAlpine argued that Panatown, as opposed\n>  to UIPL who was the owner of the defective building, had suffered no loss. Panatown\n>  argued in the House of Lords: (i) that it was entitled to recover the loss suffered by UIPL on its\n>  behalf; and (ii) that in any event it had suffered a loss itself in that it had not received what it\n>  bargained for even if it was itself financially no worse off.\n> \n> \n> [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8zd3I.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8zd3I.jpg)\n> \n> \n> On the first point relating to recovery of loss suffered by a third party, the House of Lords was\n>  clear, as has already been said, that there was no general rule permitting such recovery. The real\n>  issue here however was whether Panatown could rely on a special rule traceable back to *Dunlop\n>  v Lambert* in 1839 and referred to in *The Albazero* (1977\\) by Lord Diplock in relation to contracts\n>  for the carriage of goods. This rule was then developed by the House of Lords in *Linden Gardens\n>  v Lenesta* (1994\\) so as to apply to contracts for the construction of a building.\n> \n> \n> The *Dunlop v Lambert/Albazero* exception applies to contracts whereby the claimant is the\n>  original consignor of goods to the defendant carrier, it being contemplated that the ownership\n>  of the goods will be transferred on by the claimant to subsequent purchasers whilst still being\n>  carried by the defendant. The subsequent purchasers are therefore the ones who are, by the\n>  time of the breach, the owners who suffer the actual loss or damage to the goods but who have\n>  no contract with the defendant carrier. The exception recognizes that the claimant can recover\n>  damages even though he suffers no loss personally and that he holds the damages on behalf\n>  of the subsequent purchasers who have suffered loss.\n> \n> \n> This exception was applied by the House of Lords in *Linden Gardens v Lenesta* (1993\\), or more\n>  accurately in the second case heard and reported with that case, *St Martin\u2019s Property Corporation\n>  v McAlpine*.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ewan McKendrick's [The Common Law at Work: The Saga of Alfred *McAlpine Construction Ltd v Panatown Ltd*](https://doi.org/10.1080/14729342.2003.11421428) answers your question at p. 151\\.\n\n> The defects alleged to exist in the works presented the Unex Group with the\n> need to make a decision.

The passage explains that the Unex Group chose to sue under the main contract between McAlpine and Panatown for several strategic reasons, despite the potential difficulty in proving Panatown's loss. The main advantages were:\n\n1. The contract contained an arbitration clause, allowing the dispute to be resolved before an arbitrator without McAlpine being able to join numerous subcontractors.\n2. The rights in the contract were more extensive than those in the duty of care deed, including strict obligations and provisions for liquidated damages for delay.\n3. There was a parent company guarantee from Alfred McAlpine plc to Panatown, ensuring due performance of the contract.\n\nWhile suing under the duty of care deed would have made it easier to establish UIPL's loss, it lacked these advantageous features. Therefore, despite the challenge of proving Panatown's loss, the Unex Group decided that the benefits of suing under the main contract outweighed this difficulty."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5081/how-to-prove-legally-that-a-user-actually-clicked-the-i-accept-for-tos-etc", "docs_id": 5081, "title": "How to Prove, Legally, That a User Actually Clicked the &quot;I Accept&quot; for TOS, etc", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a click\\-wrap scenario, how does one prove, legally, that a user actually clicked or checked the \"i accept\" or equivalent on a given site. \n\ne.g. what if the website owner doesn't track clicks, track TOS versions, etc. What if the whole user flow changed since the alleged acceptance of TOS, etc. \n\nWhat do the courts look for to determine whether the user did in fact take the action which confirms their agreement with the TOS, and what those TOS actually were at the time of the issue in question? ...and, with which party does the burden of proof rest and what constitutes proof?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The website owner brings in an expert programmer who testifies that the user cannot have gotten to a certain part of the site (or download, etc.) without having clicked to accept the terms of service, and that this document they're holding is a true and correct copy of the terms of service as of that date. That's evidence in favor of the site, and an adverse party has to have stronger evidence in order to overcome it.

[This item](https://www.aclu.org/other/joint-statement-current-law-religion-public-schools) by the ACLU summarizes what that law is. Regarding your concern, public schools are not required to be \"religion\\-free zones\". Individuals have the right to hold and express their religious beliefs, or their lack of such beliefs, as long as it is contextually appropriate. That is, you don't get to invoke the First Amendment in the middle of a math lesson in order to engage in a rant. Students are allowed to try to persuade others to believe whatever they want, and students are allowed to be snarky about people who don't share their beliefs. Schools can teach about religion as part of the curriculum, though they cannot teach religion. It is okay to teach the historical fact that some guy decided based on the Bible that the world was created 10,000 years ago, but it not not okay to teach as a scientific fact that the world was created 10,000 years ago.\n\nAlthough I can't name a specific movie about Christmas that would be plainly objectionable to a non\\-Christian, we could assume that there is some such movie which is plainly advocacy of a religious viewpoint and which mocks Yazidism.

According to the information provided, public schools are not required to be \"religion-free zones,\" but they cannot promote or teach religion. While schools can teach about religion as part of the curriculum, they cannot present religious beliefs as facts. In this case, the movie goes beyond teaching about religion by presenting the Christian nativity story as historical fact and suggesting non-believers are misguided, which could be seen as promoting a specific religious viewpoint.\n\nHowever, completely banning the movie (option B) would be an overreaction, as schools are allowed to include some religious content in their curriculum. Option A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the need to respect students' diverse religious beliefs. Option D, while potentially a good educational approach, is not necessarily required by law.\n\nThe most appropriate action, as reflected in option C, would be to show the movie but provide an alternative activity for students who object to the content on religious grounds.

Presumably Washington legislators are aware of the previous ruling and have modified the new law accordingly.\n\nIdeas:\n\n1. Reduction of loan principle v. loan interest?\n2. Federal law v. state law?\n3. Farm loans v. home loans?\n\nThey seem to be aware that there is likely to be a constitutional challenge, since Sec 14\\-15 specify what to do in the case when it is held unconstitutional (it disperses the money without regard to race).\n\nEDIT: The law is explicit that it applies to anyone of a certain \"race, national origin, or sex\". The races, national origins, and sexes will be determined by a committee. Is there precedent for racial testing? *Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ* and *Coral Construction Co. v. King County (1991\\)* limit historical arguments about past discrimination to discrimination by the government in the recent past. Covenants were private and ceased in 1968\\.\n\nEDIT: Still haven't seen an answer that answers how this is consistent with *Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Educ* and *Coral Construction Co. v. King County (1991\\)*. Can the government impose race tests based on claims on non\\-governmental action in the distant past?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Washington's [HB 1474](https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/House/1474-S2.SL.pdf?q=20230527161703) actually does not give low interest loans to all but white borrowers. It initiates the process of creating a bureaucracy that will eventually provide loans for down payment and closing cost assistance for first\\-time home buyers (a loan that must be repaid when the house is sold). There are various qualifications that a program participant must meet, such as below\\-average income, being a resident, and *also* they must be a state resident before April 11, 1968 or a descendant of someone who was, and\n\n> was or would have been excluded from homeownership in Washington state\n> by a racially restrictive real estate covenant on or before April\n> 11,28 1968\n\nThe \"would have\" part refers to the fact that a person may have been interested in buying a particular house but gave up when they were told that there is a racially restrictive covenant associated with the property. It is then the duty of the covenant homeownership program commission to determine what such covenants may have existed, and also\n\n> to what extent existing programs and race\\-neutral approaches have been\n> insufficient to remedy this discrimination and its impacts\n\nThe law simply states that eligibility is based on\n\n> a recorded covenant or deed restriction that includes or included\n> racial restrictions on property ownership or use against protected\n> classes\n> that are unlawful under [RCW 49\\.60\\.224](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.60.224)\n\nwhich would include any covenants against sale to Irish or any other anciently discriminated\\-against Europeans, if such are found to exist.\n\nReferring to [Wynn v. Vilsack](https://casetext.com/case/wynn-v-vilsack), it was noted that\n\n> A strong basis in evidence cannot rest on an amorphous claim of\n> societal discrimination, on simple legislative assurances of good\n> intention, or on congressional findings of discrimination in the\n> national economy. However, a governmental entity can justify\n> affirmative action by demonstrating gross statistical disparities\n> between the proportion of minorities hired and the proportion of\n> minorities willing and able to do the work.\n\nAnalogous reasoning would apply to government action that deprived individuals of the opportunity to purchase a home based on their race. If (when) this new law is challenged, one of the central questions would be what remedial actions the government(s) took to correct this past discrimination. While it is clear that such discrimination was ended in 1968, it is far from clear that there was any remedial action taken by the state. Of course there is always the possibility that SCOTUS will discover new law that changes the landscape, but as it stands, such corrective actions are legal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Washington state's HB 1474 aims to provide loans for first-time home buyers based on certain criteria. Which of the following statements most accurately describes a key aspect of this law that attempts to address potential constitutional challenges?\n\nA) The law explicitly excludes white applicants from receiving loans, similar to the Biden administration's 2021 loan forgiveness program.\n\nB) The law bases eligibility on whether an applicant or their ancestor was affected by racially restrictive real estate covenants prior to April 11, 1968, rather than on race itself.\n\nC) The law creates a commission to determine racial eligibility through genetic testing and historical family records.\n\nD) The law provides loans exclusively to Native American and African American applicants as a form of reparations for historical injustices.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Washington's HB 1474 attempts to address potential constitutional challenges by basing eligibility on whether an applicant or their ancestor \"was or would have been excluded from homeownership in Washington state by a racially restrictive real estate covenant on or before April 11, 1968.\" This approach focuses on the historical impact of discriminatory practices rather than explicitly excluding or including applicants based on their current racial identity. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the law does not explicitly exclude white applicants.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Sarah's potential legal recourse?\n\nA) Sarah can sue the company for wrongful termination because John's comments were exaggerated.\nB) Sarah has no legal recourse as long as John's comments were based on factual events, regardless of exaggeration.\nC) Sarah can claim discrimination if she can prove John targeted her due to a protected characteristic.\nD) Sarah may have a case if the company failed to follow proper procedural requirements for termination.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement. While factual negative feedback, even if exaggerated, is generally not grounds for a legal claim, Sarah may have a case if the company failed to follow proper procedural requirements for termination. The documentation mentions that an employee should be given sufficient notice of their performance issues, typically through formal evaluations.

Don't fill out this expense in the report\n3. etc.\n\nIn the original workplace question, could the employee be found infringing if he was acting on good faith?\n\nCivil vs criminal?\n\nDoes the complexity of the statute have any bearing (e.g. Thou shalt not kill is pretty clear rule)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The consequences for the employee depend upon the nature of the offense.\n\nThe general rule is that anyone who participates in carrying out a tort or crime is liable, even if it was done on behalf of an employer and at their direction, but that an employee working on behalf of a disclosed employer is not liable for any breach of contract that results.\n\nThe employer has liability in all of those cases that is called vicarious liability for everyone acting as its agent or employee within the scope of their employment or agency.\n\nBut being an employee who is part of the chain of command doesn't necessarily give rise to liability.\n\nFor example, suppose that the top management of an entity employer directs a middle manager to get something done, and the middle manager tells the direct manager to get that thing done, and then the direct manager directs the employee to get it done by breaking the law in a tortious manner, rather than lawfully. The entity employer has vicarious liability for the actions of the employee who broke the law, the employee who broke the law probably has liability, and the direct manager might as well for personally directing an employee to break the law. But the middle manager and top managers probably do not have personal liability for the wrongdoing of the rank and file employee and the direct manager that directed the rank and file employee to break the law.\n\nIn the case of statutory violations, it turns on the language of the statute (although, if a statute creates a private cause of action it is often possible to sue an employee for civil conspiracy to commit a statutory tort that an employer has primary liability under).\n\nThere are some exceptions to the general rule, that usually pertain to \"business torts\" and \"white collar crimes\".\n\nFor example, a notable U.S. Supreme Court case held that if a company makes a false statement of fact in a disclosure submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (for the purpose of reliance upon it by all investors dealing in the company's stock) in the name of the company only, that the attorneys and company officials and employees who drafted the disclosure statement do not have any legal responsibility for the misstatement made on behalf of the company in its authorized statement in its own name (contrary to the usual common law rule that someone who participates in carrying out a fraud on behalf of an employer has joint and several liability with the employer for damages caused by the fraud).\n\nOn the other hand, knowingly putting a false dollar amount on an expense report resulting in an intended overpayment of the employer would probably give rise to common law fraud liability on the part of the employee.\n\nThere can also be exceptions based upon the elements of the crime involved.\n\nFor example, one of the elements of defamation liability is publication of the defamatory material, and merely taking dictation of and mailing a letter signed by the employer containing a defamatory statement prepared at an employer's direction would not normally sufficient to establish publication for purposes of defamation law by the employee typing it up and mailing it. Similarly, the postal employee delivering the letter wouldn't have engaged in a defamatory publication despite delivering the letter to the person to whom the defamatory statement was published.\n\nSimilarly, some environmental crimes and regulatory violations are defined in such a way that only an entity employer can be guilty of them, particularly crimes of omission (e.g. the failure of a licensed point source emitter to file a report of an emission in excess of the amount allowed by an environmental regulation, or the failure of a mining permit company to restore property mined to its original condition).\n\nOne question the OP appears to single out in particular are copyright infringements (and presumably patent infringements and trademark infringements) by an employee on behalf of an employer.

How does this exactly work with many of these states having their own parliaments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contemporary decisions of domestic British courts (e.g. the Supreme Court) are not binding in foreign jurisdictions. They may be persuasive for courts there, because there is a common legal tradition and the U.K. judiciary is often considered to be quite good.\n\nSome countries have preserved a right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (aka \"The Queen in Council\"). This body is basically the same judges as the Supreme Court but sitting in a different room. As the JCPC their decisions are precedential in wherever the appeal came from, and potentially elsewhere if the law in question is the same. Corollary: JCPC decisions are *not* precedential for British courts, unless the JCPC goes out of its way to say so. In these cases, the JCPC applies the law and constitution of the origin country, which can include retained pre\\-independence British laws as well as the common law. That country could pass a subsequent statute or constitutional act overriding the JCPC's decision (as Parliament could in the U.K.), so that country retains ultimate control even though one of \"its\" courts is a shared one sitting in London.\n\nThis arrangement can cause dissonance. For example, some Caribbean countries would like to execute people, but that is prohibited in the U.K.; the JCPC continues to permit executions to go ahead in some cases, even though that would be illegal if the same judges were in a different room hearing a British case.

The passage provides an example where the JCPC can permit executions to go ahead in some cases for Caribbean countries, even though this would be illegal if the same judges were hearing a British case in the UK Supreme Court.

It's one thing to enforce laws on some random citizen, but it seems there is no way for SCOTUS to enforce laws against the branch of government that's responsible for enforcing laws.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US courts (including the US Supreme Court) do not have an army or even a police force under their direct control, except for a few court bailiffs. Ultimately, if the executive simply defies the courts, the only remedy is a political one.\n\nA court can order a person held unlawfully to be released from detention, but the jail/prison authorizes might ignore such an order. A court might order DACA applications to be accepted, and if they are not, might rule that deportations or other negative actions are unlawful. A court might hold persons who defy its orders in contempt, and send marshals to jail such persons. But if the executive branch in an organized way defies such orders, there is no judicial power to compel obedience to court orders.\n\nThis is why the judiciary has famously been called the \"least dangerous branch\" of the government: it cannot actually **do** anything without at least the tacit cooperation of the executive.\n\n### Cherokee Case (*Worcester v. Georgia*)\n\nThere was a reference in the comments above to the the Cherokee Indians case, [*Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia). In that case the US Supreme Court, in a decision written by Chief Justice Marshall held that the Georgia laws purporting to seize Cherokee lands were invalid as violations of Federal treaties. President Jackson was strongly displeased by this ruling. He was supposed to have said:\n\n> John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\n\nIt appears that President Jackson probably did not say that, at least not publicly. But in fact Jackson did not take any steps to enforce the decision, and the decision was in fact not enforced. The lands were seized, and the Cherokee were forcibly relocated across the infamous trail of tears.

Suppose the company and all customers are in\nLos Angeles, California.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On the one hand, there are statutes that prohibit the delivery of instructions which distort or circumvent the official/intended use or safety of a device. For a somewhat related example of this, see [MCL 750\\.540c(1\\)(3\\)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(j44pfulxvqjfox2egdt1nlq0))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-750-540c).\n\nOn the other hand, the company/manufacturer is unlikely to prevail under contract law no matter how clearly and conspicuously its EULA prohibits the disclosure of discovered weaknesses. That is because the prohibition in the EULA is outweighed by the severe vulnerability to which all other unsuspecting customers are subjected.\n\nFrom the standpoint of public policy, people's awareness of the discovered vulnerability is certainly in the public's best interest. The disclosure will warn both (1\\) *potential* customers not to purchase a product that fails or misses its primary purpose, and (2\\) *current* customers to adopt precautions now that the product's reliability has been disproved. Thus, the effectiveness of broadcasting the discovery of such weakness is in stark contrast with the technical deficits and managerial politics that typically hinder a company's ability (or its will) to respond to the issue.\n\nIf the weakness was known to the manufacturer prior to the disclosure, the release of that product would constitute *fraudulent misrepresentation*. The details of the demonstration in the video supports the argument that the manufacturer knew \\-\\-or should have known\\-\\- about that weakness, since a padlock design is supposed to pass all kinds of tests of breakability and not be disabled by a screwdriver. \n\nIt is hard to deny that the notion that \"the padlock is secure\" *induces* customers to purchase the product. As such, the misrepresentation violates the contract law principle that a contract \\-\\-such as a purchase\\-\\- be entered *knowingly*. See [*Restatement (Second) of Contracts*](https://nylitigationfirm.com/files/restat.pdf) at \u00a7 161\\-167. With respect to the publisher of the weakness, that misrepresentation renders the EULA\\-prohibition void. See *Restatement at \u00a7 164(1\\)*.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the manufacturer incurred misrepresentation, the manufacturer's decision to sue the publisher is only likely to backfire by bringing more attention to the poor design of the product.\n\nIn all, the manufacturer's best option is to do a product recall ASAP and enhance the design.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company manufactures a padlock with a previously unknown weakness that can be easily exploited with a screwdriver.

This public interest outweighs any contractual obligations that might exist in a user agreement.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation suggests that even with a clear prohibition in the End User License Agreement (EULA), the company is unlikely to prevail in a lawsuit due to the overriding public interest in disclosing such vulnerabilities.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while there are some statutes prohibiting instructions that circumvent a device's intended use, they are unlikely to apply in this case where a genuine security flaw is being exposed.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation advises against legal action, stating that suing the publisher would likely backfire by bringing more attention to the product's poor design. Additionally, if the weakness was known or should have been known to the manufacturer, it could constitute fraudulent misrepresentation, which would void any contractual prohibitions against disclosure."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15604/is-selling-pictures-of-merchandise-illegal-if-you-imply-that-you-are-selling-the", "docs_id": 15604, "title": "Is selling pictures of merchandise illegal if you imply that you are selling the actual merchandise?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 1.

This is prohibited by consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions, such as the Australian Consumer Law mentioned in the example.

Let's say I text with the guy, we meet up in public, and I buy the item with cash. Then let's say, it turns out it was stolen, the guy gets caught, and confesses to the police/victim and tells them my name/phone number/transaction details.\n\nI have several similar/related questions about this scenario:\n\n1. How would this proceed? It seems like it would be very difficult to prove (short of getting public surveillance footage) that I even bought the item. What if I just said \"sorry, I never ended up buying it.\" Surely they couldn't/wouldn't get a warrant to search my house?\n2. Let's say they somehow *do* prove that I bought it (very contrived, but the guy was recording our conversation or something). Could I be prosecuted if I didn't know it was stolen? That's what [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_of_stolen_goods#United_States) section seems to be saying, but that sounds crazy to me, because it would mean basically buying *anything* puts you at risk.\n\nI ask this because I was getting a little paranoid and was thinking about the implications of this: I'm imagining a scam where someone sells me a \"stolen\" item and then the \"victim\" (really their accomplice) says \"I found out that you bought an item stolen from me, but the thief got away\" and presents me with irrefutable evidence (e.g., a receipt for the item with its serial number) that the item was his. He could potentially threaten me to return it to him, and then I've lost my money (since the \"thief\" is in the wind) but they still have their item.\n\nIt's unlikely, I know, but I'm wondering what the legal implications of this would be. Thank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are conflating the crime against the state of [possession stolen goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_of_stolen_goods#United_States) with the common law tort against the owner for [conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(law)).\n\nTo your questions:\n\n> How would this proceed? It seems like it would be very difficult to prove (short of getting public surveillance footage) that I even bought the item.\n\nIf you read the second paragraph of the page you linked it says:\n\n> In many jurisdictions, if an individual has accepted possession of goods or property **and knew they were stolen**, then the individual is typically charged ... If the individual **did not know** the goods were stolen, then the goods are returned to the owner and the individual is not prosecuted.\n\nProof of the crime involves a \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard of evidence of both the fact that you have the goods and that you knew they were stolen. If you become aware that they were stolen (e.g. the police tell you) and try to keep them then you have just committed the crime.\n\nProof of the tort requires a \"balance of probabilities\" standard of evidence that you have the goods and that they belong to someone else; your knowledge that they were stolen is immaterial.\n\nIn the first instance, the police would probably knock on your door, tell you why they were there and ask if the version of the story they have from the thief is essentially true. What happens next depends on your response:\n\n1. \"Yes, I knew it was stolen; you better arrest me and I will plead guilty.\" This will play out as you expect.\n2. \"Yes, I didn't know it was stolen, I will go and get it for you.\" You return the goods, give a statement and may have to act as a witness in the prosecution of the thief. You are down $1,000 but are now older and wiser.\n3. \"No, I have no idea what you are talking about.\" Well, you have now committed the crime of hindering a police investigation and have also committed the crime of possessing stolen goods \\- you can no longer claim that you didn't know the goods were stolen; the police have told you they are. What happens next depends on if the police believe you or the thief.\n\n> Surely they couldn't/wouldn't get a warrant to search my house?\n\nWant to bet? They certainly have enough to get a search warrant if they want one (probably). Whether they seek one probably depends on the value of the goods, how busy they are and how much you pissed them off.\n\n> Could I be prosecuted if I didn't know it was stolen?\n\nNot if you return it as soon as practicable after being made aware that they were.\n\n> The scam\n\nThis seems like a lot of work for a very small return \\- spend your time worrying about things that are more likely to happen.\n\nGood Title\n----------\n\nAll of this is tied up with the concept of [good title](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Title_(property)&redirect=no). Basically, you cannot gain good title to property from someone who does not have good title themselves; if you buy goods from a thief you do not own them.\n\nFor example, if A has good title to the goods, B steals them and sells them to C who sells them to D then A still owns them and can demand their return from D, D could demand the return of their money from C and C could do likewise with B but as far as A is concerned it doesn't matter that C \\& B have lost money; that is simply too bad for them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: John buys a laptop from a stranger on Craigslist for $800.

Assume that the person will be caught.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What happens to someone who\u2019s committed a murder in the UK?\n> Considering the person will be caught.\n\nThis is a basic and somewhat vague question so I will provide a basic and very general answer.\n\nThe name of the court with proper jurisdiction, the relevant criminal procedural rules, and the substantive law that applies varies within the U.K. In particular in Scotland and the various dependencies of the U.K. differ significantly from England\\-Wales. There are some minor differences in Northern Ireland. England\\-and\\-Wales are treated as one for most purposes, but there are some slight differences at the very lowest levels but none materially impact a murder case.\n\nIf they are caught in England and Wales they are arrested, interviewed, charged then brought before the next available Magistrates' Court who send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial. As a Magistrate has no power to grant bail for murder the defendant must be remanded in custody until he can make an application for bail before the Crown Court, but the default position is that bail should not be granted for murder unless in very exceptional circumstances. In other U.K. jurisdictions, the names of the courts will differ and there may be some other fine details that aren't the same in the pre\\-trial process but the same general outline applies.\n\nIf they are outside of the U.K. they will be subject to either an International or European Arrest Warrant and extradited to the UK at the request of the U.K. Government under the terms of the relevant extradition treaties. On arrival in the UK they are arrested for murder and the process proceeds in the same manner. (If they are someplace that does not have an extradition treaty with the U.K., the trial may be deferred until U.K. officials have an opportunity to arrest him and are often dogged in attempting to accomplish, perhaps, for example, while the suspect is on holiday somewhere that there is an extradition treaty.)\n\nPrior to the trial, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the defence will prepare their cases and return to court at various times to settle any issues etc before going to the expense of a full trial. Also, at any time the CPS determine the case to be too weak for a realistic prospect of conviction or the suspect is innocent, they are supposed to dismiss or amend the indictment.\n\nThe defendant is then tried for murder before a jury (almost always, but not in every single case, e.g., if the defendant admits guilt and the plea is accepted in appropriate proceedings before a judge). The CPS instruct a barrister to present their case with another barrister acting on behalf of the defendant. The process is for juvenile defendants is pretty much the same as for adults, apart from added safeguards to ensure the juvenile understands the proceedings and is not put at any disadvantage due to their age.\n\nAll of the jurisdictions within the U.K., however, will have a trial that involves presentation of sworn evidence and exhibits and opening and closing arguments from both prosecution and defence counsels to a jury, procedural objections, cross\\-examination, and sometimes offering of additional evidence under the supervision of a single judge; normally with the defendant present. There will be some means of court reporting, and unless the judge orders otherwise (which is only done in relatively exceptional circumstances), the trial will be open to the public and the press to observe.\n\nIf the defendant dies before the legal process to secure a conviction is not completed, the case is dismissed as moot.\n\nIf the defendant is convicted of a homicide offense the trial/sentencing judge will impose a prison sentences, which is \"fixed by law\", with a life sentence in the case of the most serious homicide offense, murder (there are multiple homicide offenses that hinge largely on the intent of the defendant, often a murder prosecution will include less included homicide offenses as options for convictions). Only in exceptional cases this will be a whole\\-life term, in all others the judge will prescribe a minimum sentence according to the judicial sentencing guidelines after which the defendant may be released on licence, which is what an American would call parole. Any offences committed on licence will normally result in a recall to prison.\n\nThe U.K. does not have a death penalty and does not authorise corporal punishment. The vast majority of people who are arrested and tried for murder are convicted, although there are sometimes acquittals or hung juries.\n\nThis conviction may be appealed by the defendant to the Court of Appeal (and again up to the Supreme Court) (the intermediate appellate court may not be the same in all U.K. jurisdictions) which reviews the proceedings to determine if the law was applied correctly and if there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. If the court finds that this was not the case, it can vacate the conviction and orders an appropriate revised disposition of the case depending upon the circumstances justifying the reversal of the trial court. If the appeal court affirm the trial verdict then the sentence continues to be carried out. Usually, but not always, the defendant will be in prison pursuant to the sentence imposed pending an outcome of any appeal.\n\nEventually, if the sentence imposed upon a conviction is affirmed (and not a whole life term) the prisoner may be released on licence (which includes some post\\-release supervision) and is free and to about living their life again, subject to some collateral consequences based upon their criminal record (e.g. inability to work in certain occupations).\n\nIf the defendant is acquitted, then they go free and cannot be tried again for the same offence, unless the exceptions under the double jeopardy provisions that apply in that jurisdiction apply. The main exception of double jeopardy is for newly discovered evidence of guilt in a case where there was an acquittal.\n\nIf the person convicted is not a British citizen, they will usually be deported at the conclusion of their sentence if international law allows for it.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to these rules that come up in a tiny percentage of all U.K. murders that apply (1\\) in the case of people subject to courts\\-martial such as active duty military service members, (2\\) in the case of foreign diplomats with diplomatic immunity, (3\\) when the murder is classified as an act of terrorism, and (4\\) in the case that the defendant has a title of nobility that calls for special treatment such as, e.g., Prince Charles (the current heir to the throne) or the Queen. These special cases are really too esoteric for the plain vanilla facts stated in the question and involve unique processes that are very different from the usual one described above. The fourth case is one that does not exist in my country (the U.S.) and in other countries that are republics rather than constitutional monarchies like the U.K., although most countries have some special rules for criminal trials of their very highest officials (like Presidents and Prime Ministers).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK legal system, which of the following statements is NOT true regarding the process for a person accused of murder?\n\nA) The defendant is always tried before a jury in a Crown Court, with no exceptions.\nB) If convicted, the defendant will receive a life sentence, but the judge will prescribe a minimum term before parole eligibility in most cases.\nC) The defendant can appeal their conviction to the Court of Appeal, and potentially to the Supreme Court.\nD) If acquitted, the defendant cannot be tried again for the same offense, unless new evidence is discovered under double jeopardy provisions.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A because, while jury trials are the norm for murder cases in the UK, there are exceptions.

Section 418(2\\) sets out the circumstances where self\\-defence is available. The questions to be asked by the jury under s 418(2\\) are succinctly set out in *R v Katarzynski* \\[2002] NSWSC 613 at \\[22]\u2013\\[23] which was approved in *Abdallah v R* \\[2016] NSWCCA 34 at \\[61]. Section 419 provides that the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person did not carry out the conduct in self\\-defence.\n\nSelf defence does not have to be raised by the defendant for the jury to consider it \\- it must be eliminated by the prosecution. Where self\\-defence is an issue in the case (i.e. there is evidence that could support a reasonable doubt that the accused acted in self defence) the judge must direct the jury on how to deal with it.\n\nFor a murder case, the direction must include:\n\n1. An acknowledgement that the law allows self defense.\n2. That the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not act in self defense\n3. The Crown may prove this by either: (a) the accused did not believe at the time that they were acting in self defence \\- if this is not proved, the appropriate verdict is \u201cnot guilty of murder\u201d, or (b) that the accused\u2019s acts were not a reasonable response to the circumstances *as they perceived them* \\- if this is not proved the appropriate verdict is \u201cnot guilty of manslaughter\u201d. However, if 3(a) is not proved but 3(b) is the appropriate verdict is \u201cnot guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter\u201d.\n4. In determining the issue of whether the accused personally believed that his or her conduct was necessary for self\\-defence, the jury must consider the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be at the time. For example, if the accused had an irrational fear of and belief in ghosts, that is a factor that tends towards self defence for Alice.\n\nPenalties\n---------\n\nThe maximum sentence for murder is life or 25 years imprisonment. The actual sentence depends on the severity of the crime and any mitigating circumstances in accordance with the [sentencing guidelines](https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/murder.html). For the circumstances you describe Alice cold expect 6\\-10 years if convicted.\n\nThere are different categories of [manslaughter](https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/manslaughter.html), this one falls neatly into the excessive self defence category. In sentencing, the judge must explicitly decide if the convicted person intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm by their act or not. Alice used a gun; she intended to kill or cause GBH, this will increase her sentence. Because this is a relatively rare outcome (there are lots of convicted murderers and lots of acquittals, but very few manslaughter due to excessive self defence) its difficult to estimate the sentence.

If the jury believes Betty genuinely thought she was acting in self-defense (due to her perception of the situation, even if mistaken), but her response (shooting Alan) was not considered reasonable given the circumstances, she could be found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

Content\\-based speech regulation can be constitutional if it passes strict scrutiny, but in the case of banning swastikas, it would fall under an even narrower subset of content\\-based speech regulation called \"viewpoint regulation.\" I haven't found a case where the swastika or Nazi flag was banned in particular, but we can find reasoning that appears to safely protect the peaceful display of the Nazi flag and ideology from government restriction in [*Police Dept. of City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92 (1972\\)*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/408/92/), a case in which Chicago banned picketing within 150 feet of a school except in the case of labor disputes related to the school. The Supreme Court found that this amounted to viewpoint\\-based discrimination, writing in the majority opinion:\n\n> But, above all else, the First Amendment means that government has no\n> power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its\n> subject matter, or its content\n\n> Necessarily, then, under the Equal Protection Clause, not to mention\n> the First Amendment itself, government may not grant the use of a\n> forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those\n> wishing to express less favored or more controversial views. And it\n> may not select which issues are worth discussing or debating in public\n> facilities. There is an \"equality of status in the field of ideas,\"\n> and government must afford all points of view an equal opportunity to\n> be heard. Once a forum is opened up to assembly or speaking by some\n> groups, government may not prohibit others from assembling or speaking\n> on the basis of what they intend to say. Selective exclusions from a\n> public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not be\n> justified by reference to content alone.\n\nAs with all rights restrictions, a particular restriction may be Constitutional if it passes \"[strict scrutiny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny),\" namely, it:\n\n> is necessary to a \"compelling state interest\";\n> \n> \n> is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieving this compelling purpose; and\n> \n> \n> uses the \"least restrictive means\" to achieve the purpose.\n\nIn general, a ban on the peaceful display of Nazi imagery or promotion of Nazi ideas would fail the first test, as the government does not have a compelling interest to suppress ideas which might be distasteful to some or even the majority of people.\n\nI have seen an argument that because the Nazi regime's stated goal included genocide, that promoting that ideology amounts to advocating violence. Speech which advocates violence or criminality may be criminalized, but only under a specific \"imminent lawless action\" test expressed in *[Brandenburg v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/)*:\n\n> Freedoms of speech and press do not permit a State to forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\n\nThis case was brought against a KKK member who advocated various violent acts at a rally. The main distinction is that his speech did not call for specific violence, but merely advocated for it in general. This almost exactly mirrors the rationale for banning the Nazi ideology based on its advocacy of violence, and shows that a ban on such grounds would be unconstitutional. \"Imminent\" was clarified in *[Hess v. Indiana](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/414/105/)* to mean that the action must be intended to produce actual lawless action at a specific point in the future, not simply advocate for it in general. Hess was a protester who was being forced off a street by police, said \"We'll take the fucking street later\" and was convicted of disorderly conduct for it, which the court reversed as his statement \"amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time\" and was therefore protected by the First Amendment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small town in the United States passes an ordinance banning the public display of Nazi symbols, including swastikas, within city limits.

Which of the following best describes the likely outcome if this ordinance is challenged in court?\n\nA) The ordinance will be upheld because Nazi symbols promote violence and are therefore not protected speech.\n\nB) The ordinance will be struck down as unconstitutional because it violates the First Amendment's protection of free speech, even for controversial viewpoints.\n\nC) The ordinance will be upheld because the town has a compelling interest in maintaining community safety.\n\nD) The ordinance will be partially upheld, allowing the ban in certain sensitive areas like schools but not citywide.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Based on established Supreme Court precedents, this ordinance would likely be struck down as unconstitutional. The ban represents a content-based and viewpoint-based restriction on speech, which is subject to strict scrutiny. As noted in Police Dept. of City of Chicago v. Mosley, the government cannot restrict expression based on its message or content, even if it's controversial or offensive. \n\nThe display of Nazi symbols, while deeply offensive to many, is generally protected under the First Amendment as a form of expression. The ordinance would fail the \"strict scrutiny\" test because:\n\n1. There isn't a sufficiently compelling state interest to justify banning the peaceful display of symbols.\n2. A blanket ban is not narrowly tailored.\n3. It doesn't use the least restrictive means to achieve its purpose.\n\nFurthermore, as established in Brandenburg v. Ohio, advocacy of general ideas, even if they include violent ideologies, is protected unless it is directed at inciting imminent lawless action. A general ban on Nazi symbols doesn't meet this \"imminent lawless action\" standard.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they don't align with current First Amendment jurisprudence regarding protected speech and viewpoint discrimination."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19374/is-it-illegal-for-my-landlord-to-lie-to-me", "docs_id": 19374, "title": "Is it illegal for my landlord to lie to me?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My landlord has lied to me multiple times and I have proof that he has lied.

At trial, prosecutors typically win convictions well over 50% of the time (although not too much more, because the more clear cases are either dismissed by prosecutors as unproveable prior to trial or are plea bargained).\n\nThe net effect of the current system is that the severity of the sentence imposed in the vast majority of cases is proportional to the probability of the prosecution prevailing at trial times the likely sentence if it does prevail, as evaluated mutually by the prosecution and the defense. When there is not a sufficient consensus on the fair sentence in light of those factors the rare trial happens (and more often than not the defense rather than the prosecution overestimates its chances).\n\nUnfortunately, this also means that the biggest penalties for going to trial are in the weakest cases in which the prosecution just barely manages to convince the jury and there is a strong probability that the defendant is actually innocent, as opposed to the cases where it is fairly clear that the defendant is guilty. And, people who are actually innocent of everything are most likely to roll the dice and go to trial, since people who are guilty of something know that in any fair resolution that are going to face the significant downsides of having any criminal conviction on their record, while people who are actually innocent may reasonably (although sometimes inaccurately) believe that the system will protect them and allow them to escape all consequences except the costs of defending themselves in court (if they can afford it).\n\nAnother option that prosecutors have in a case where proof beyond a reasonable doubt may be difficult or impossible, is to bring a civil lawsuit or to seek an administrative penalty, which may result in loss of a licenses or payment of a fine or compensation, rather than bringing criminal charges. In these cases, the prosecution only has to prove a case by a preponderance of the evidence in most cases, and usually, the defendant has no right to an attorney at public expense even if the defendant is indigent. These fines (or civil forfeitures) can also help fund the criminal justice system that pays prosecutors and other participants in the process.\n\nBelow that standard, prosecutors can seek search warrants, wire taps and arrest warrants in cases where there is merely probable cause to believe that a person committed a crime, which in addition to setting up future prosecutions can also be used as a form of punishment/harassment of someone prosecutors believe to be guilty of a crime even though they may not even have the evidence necessary to prove a civil suit, but the amount of impact that a search warrant, wire tap, or arrest can have on a suspect is much less than a full blowed prosecution.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the current legal system, how does plea bargaining effectively create a system where punishment is somewhat proportional to the probability of guilt?\n\nA) Prosecutors always insist on going to trial, regardless of the strength of their case.\nB) Plea bargains are only offered in cases where the prosecution has a weak case.\nC) The severity of the negotiated sentence in plea bargains typically reflects the strength of the prosecution's case and the likely trial outcome.\nD) Plea bargaining rates are consistently low, around 10-20% in both federal and state systems.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that plea bargaining effectively creates a system where punishment is somewhat proportional to the probability of guilt. In cases where the prosecution has a strong case with a high probability of winning, they typically make only slight concessions in plea bargains. In cases of average strength, prosecutors often offer significant concessions. In weak cases, very deep concessions are usually made to avoid trial.

The employee continues working for the company for several years. After a few years the company renews the employees contract for 8 more years at $75 an hour but continues to pay the employee $50 an hour and the employee never demands the higher salary. Let's further assume that the second contract contains several other benefits for the employee but the employee continues to act *as if* the first contract is in force.

Parties entitled to resume enforcement of their rights anytime. A party's noncompliance with his obligations gives the counterparty a viable claim of *breach of contract*, although the proper approach would be to first try to solve the dispute outside the court.\n\nIn the employment scenario you describe, the employee is entitled to \\-\\-at least\\-\\- back pay as per the second contract (the difference between $75 and $50\\) subject to the *statute of limitations*, which under NJ is six years for contract disputes. See [*Hagans v. Nickerson*, Superior Court of NJ (Oct. 2022\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/innjco20221215338), (citing NJSA A:14\\-1(a)). This precludes the recovery of some of the back pay if \"*the employee wishes to enforce during his 7th or 8th year of employment*\".

According to the documentation, a contract does not become null and void if some or most of its terms were not followed by one or both parties. The employee's failure to enforce the contract earlier does not waive their rights under it. The employee is entitled to enforce the contract's provisions, including claiming back pay for the difference in salary, subject to the statute of limitations (which is typically six years for contract disputes). While some retroactive enforcement may be limited by the statute of limitations, the employee can still enforce all rights going forward and claim back pay for the period allowed by law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the contract remains valid even if its terms were not enforced. Option B is wrong because temporary or systematic waiver of contractual rights does not permanently alter the contract or waive all rights.

The judge granted leave to appeal on the grounds that Google's use of AI to generate predictive keywords could make them liable as a publisher of potentially injurious content. \n\nThis precedent implies that software distributors using AI might be held responsible for the actions of their AI, even if those actions are the result of randomly generated code. The court's reasoning suggests that deploying AI is an active choice that carries potential liability, rather than viewing the AI as a passive tool or independent entity.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they don't align with the precedent set by the Hong Kong case.
