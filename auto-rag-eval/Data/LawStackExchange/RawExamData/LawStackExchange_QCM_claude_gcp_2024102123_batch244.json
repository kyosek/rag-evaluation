This would result in paying more taxes than the person actually owes. \n\nSpecifically, this unreal income would be reported on 1040 Schedule C, line 1 or line 6\\. \n\nAre there any laws or IRS regulations which prohibit that? Since the \"error\" (actually, deception) is in the government's favor, would there be any penalty other than $0? \n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1pN5I.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1pN5I.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [26 USC 7206](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7206):\n\n> Any person who\u2014 (1\\) Willfully makes and subscribes any return, statement, or other document, which contains or is verified by a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury, and which he does not believe to be true and correct as to every material matter \\[...] shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $100,000 ($500,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.\n\n(\"Return\", as defined in 26 USC 6696, includes an income tax return.)\n\nThis clause notably doesn't care whose favor the falsification was in, or why you did it. You knew it wasn't true and you put it on your tax return anyway, and you declared under penalty of perjury that it was true and correct. That's a felony, end of story.\n\n(Paragraph (4\\) of this section covers some other types of fraud done \"with intent to evade\" taxes, but that restriction does not apply to paragraph (1\\).)\n\nThe likelihood of actually being prosecuted in such an instance is beyond the scope of this site. But in the given case, the falsification really *isn't* in the government's favor. The purpose was to become eligible to collect government social security benefits, which you otherwise wouldn't be eligible for. Presumably you would only bother to do this if you thought you'd collect more in benefits than you pay in extra tax, which means the government loses in the long run. \n\nThis also eliminates any chance you'd have of claiming the falsification was \"immaterial\": it affected your eligibility for social security, and you knew that \\- it was the whole reason you did it.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John deliberately reports $10,000 more income than he actually earned on his Schedule C (Form 1040) in order to become eligible for higher Social Security benefits in the future. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal implications of John's actions?\n\nA) John's actions are legal because he is paying more taxes than required, which benefits the government.\n\nB) John could be charged with a felony under 26 USC 7206, punishable by up to 3 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $100,000.\n\nC) John's actions are legal as long as he doesn't claim the falsely reported income for any other government benefits.\n\nD) John would only face civil penalties, not criminal charges, because his actions result in overpayment of taxes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to 26 USC 7206, willfully making and subscribing any tax return that contains information the person does not believe to be true and correct is a felony. This law applies regardless of whether the false information results in underpayment or overpayment of taxes. The crime is in the act of knowingly providing false information on a tax return sworn under penalty of perjury. The potential punishment includes imprisonment for up to 3 years and/or a fine of up to $100,000 for individuals. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the legality of the action is not determined by whether it benefits the government financially. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the law prohibits providing false information on tax returns regardless of the intended use of that information.\n\nOption D is incorrect because this offense can lead to criminal charges, not just civil penalties, due to the deliberate nature of the false reporting and the potential for future government benefit fraud."

For this app, I want to have Christmas music.\n\nIn order to make sure that I don't run into any copyright issues, I am using Creative Commons. Doing a search on there led me to [this site](https://www.jamendo.com/search?q=tag:christmas). The main songs that I am a, interested in so far are `We wish you a merry Xmas` and `Jingle Bells Bluegrass` by `Akashic Records`. There may also be others I want later on.\n\nNow, the question is, as these are remixes of original songs that are copyrighted, do I still have permissions to put the tracks in my app or would I still have to contact the original artist of the song first? If it makes a difference, this app will be free and not for profit. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are, under US law, two separate copyrights (at least) in any musical recording. The first is the copyright on the recording itself. The second is is the copyright on the musical composition that is being recorded. If that composition is an arrangement or modification of an original, there will be a separate copyright on the original, as well. \n\nThe copyright on the performance will be initially held by the musicians, but may have been signed over or sold to a recording company or someone else. If the performance was recorded before 1972, there will be no copyright under US Federal law, but there may be limited protection under state law.\n\nThe copyright on the composition, and on the arrangement if any, has terms basically the same as on a printed work. Works published before 1923 will be in the public domain. Later works may have a term of 95 years, or 70 years after the death of the author. See [the cornell chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain) for details. Such copyrights are initially owned by the composer or composers, and possibly the writer of the lyrics, or in some cases the employer of the composer(s)/lyricist(s). They may well have been sold or transferred and be owned by some company.\n\nThe exact rules will differ under the laws of other countries, but the general structure is much the same, i understand.\n\nTo use a recording you must obtain permission (a license) for the recording itself, for the composition (unless it is out of copyright) and for any arrangement (unless the arrangement is out of copyright). [Performing rights societies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_rights_organisation)  are how professional performers and venues usually secure such rights. They charge fees which depend on the use someone wants to make. They offer licenses to a variety of music for a single payment.\n\nA recording released under a creative commons license may or may not include a license for the underlying composition. Often it does not. Also, someone who uploads a recording to an online site such as YouTube stating that it has a creative commons license, may be lying, have no rights to the recording at all, and expose any reusers to the chance of lawsuit. If you want to use and reproduce such recordings, you must verify that you have proper licenses from all copyright holders.\n\nThe site [Jamendo](https://licensing.jamendo.com/en/static/termsofsales) says that it offers \"royalty free\" music for various purposes. It says that the recordings it offers have all needed rights included. It charges various fees depending on the kind of license purchased, with discounts for bulk purchases. It offers a guarantee against claims of infringement by 3rd parties, but the terms seem to make this guarantee quite limited. It appears that for use in an online/mobile app, one must purchase their 'large\" license or higher. Its terms do not seem to be compatible with creative commons licenses. I know nothing about this site, or its reputation, beyond what it says of itself.\n\nMost of its licenses seem to permit creation of derivative works with the licensed music part of an audiovisual or multimedia work, but not the unaltered distribution of the music by itself.\n\nI am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice. Specifics matter in copyright cases. The above are only general principles.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app developer wants to include Christmas music in their free advent calendar app. They found a recording of \"Jingle Bells\" on a website claiming to offer Creative Commons licensed music. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal use of this music in the app?\n\nA) As long as the recording is under a Creative Commons license, the developer can freely use it in the app without any further considerations.\n\nB) The developer only needs to obtain permission for the use of the recording, as the composition of \"Jingle Bells\" is likely in the public domain.\n\nC) The developer must verify that they have proper licenses for both the recording and the arrangement of the composition, even if the original composition is in the public domain.\n\nD) Since the app is free and not for profit, copyright laws do not apply, and the developer can use any music they find online.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because there are multiple layers of copyright to consider. Even if the original composition of \"Jingle Bells\" is in the public domain due to its age, the specific recording and arrangement may still be under copyright protection. The developer needs to ensure they have proper licenses for both the recording itself and the particular arrangement used in that recording. Additionally, claims of Creative Commons licensing on websites are not always accurate or comprehensive, so it's crucial to verify the rights. The fact that the app is free does not exempt it from copyright laws. Options A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify the copyright considerations. Option B is partially correct but incomplete, as it doesn't account for the potential copyright on the arrangement."

However, the opposition in question continued to try and sue for more, claiming that the information on these properties were taken from them (which is apparently incorrect and lacks proof), but they continue to drag this on in an assumed attempt to try and make the defendant basically spend all their money fighting this off before it gets before a judge.\n\n**My questions is**: to what end can something like this continue to be dragged out?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> These images were quickly taken down to settle this problem.\n\nIt *doesn't* settle the problem, at least under US law, because a former infringer may still owe statutory damages under [17 USC 504](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/504) (and I imagine under some analogous Canadian law). Ceasing the infringement does not extinguish the plaintiff's right to those damages, although it may limit the size of the damages.\n\n> However, the opposition in question continued to try and sue for more, claiming that the information on these properties were taken from them (which is apparently incorrect and lacks proof)\n\nInformation, in and of itself, is not subject to copyright protection in just about any jurisdiction in the world (see for example [17 USC 102(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102)). It has been suggested in the comments of another answer that this may nevertheless be a trade secrets violation, but that would only be the case if the information had been non\\-public *and* the site appropriated the information from an unpublished source belonging to the plaintiff. If the plaintiff deliberately caused this information to be published on their own website, then trade secret law certainly does not apply to it.\n\nNevertheless, if the site copied literal text or images from the plaintiff's website, or closely paraphrased it, that is an infringement of copyright. Copyright protects the creative elements of the text, even where the text is serving a primarily utilitarian or functional purpose.\n\n> but they continue to drag this on in an assumed attempt to try and make the defendant basically spend all their money fighting this off before it gets before a judge.\n\nIt is unclear what you mean by this. The normal process is for the plaintiff to send the defendant some sort of written demand, the defendant either complies or they don't, and then the plaintiff either files a lawsuit or they don't. If the plaintiff never files a lawsuit, the defendant is under no obligation to continue interacting with the plaintiff, and can simply wash their hands of the matter. Depending on the circumstances, this may or may not be wise, as settling is often more cost\\-effective than going to court. Ignoring the plaintiff increases the likelihood of a lawsuit being filed. But if there is no lawsuit, then there is nothing to \"fight off\" in the first place.",

To access the money, John would need to receive it as salary, dividends, or some other form of payment from the company to himself.

However, the jury is specifically prohibited from being instructed about such stakes! However, knowing what he knows, can the judge still be objective, or would he have to recuse himself out of fear of showing prejudice? Can he require the litigants to have a proper jury, including the associated fees, even though the case is supposedly eligible for a judge\\-only trial, too? How would it affect a potential appeal?\n\nLikewise, California statutes require that a 3\\-day notice preceding the UD has to specify the exact amount of rent (e.g., cannot include random fees). Is the judge allowed to show prejudice against mistakes in said amount?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The concept of \"jury nullification\" is not really applicable to civil litigation, whether it's a bench or a jury trial.\n\nThe short answer is: generally in the United States, civil judges, and civil juries, have to follow the law. If the jury doesn't follow the law, the judge can entertain and grant a JNOV motion on the basis that no reasonable jury could have reached the verdict in question. If the judge doesn't follow the law, the aggrieved party can appeal the judgment as an abuse of discretion or on similar grounds.\n\nJury nullification occurs when a criminal jury returns a verdict of \"not guilty\" although they feel the defendant was in fact guilty under the law. That is the only circumstance where no legal review can reverse the verdict. Civil \"jury nullification\" is not a particularly meaningful concept.",

While judges in civil cases do not have the ability to nullify laws in the same way that criminal juries can exercise jury nullification, they do have some discretion in interpreting and applying the law. However, this discretion is not unlimited. Judges must generally follow the law, but they can make rulings based on their interpretation of the law and the facts of the case. If a party believes the judge has abused this discretion or made an error in applying the law, they can appeal the judgment. This balances the need for judicial discretion with the requirement to follow established law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because jury nullification is a concept specific to criminal juries and does not apply to judges in civil cases. Option B is too extreme, as it doesn't account for any judicial discretion. Option C is also incorrect, as ignoring even minor legal requirements could be grounds for appeal and is not within a judge's authority."

The main two are (1\\) criminal law, which generally addresses violations that injure the government's interests; and (2\\) civil law, which largely addresses violations that injure private parties' interests.\n\nSome conduct can violate both sets of laws:\n\n* If you steal something from a store, the government can put you in jail for theft, and the store can sue you for the value of the item you stole.\n* If you punch someone in the face, the government can can put you in jail for assault, and the person you punched can sue you to pay for their hospital bills.\n* If you grope a woman in a dressing room, the government can put you in jail for sexual assault, and the woman can sue you for battery.\n\nDonald Trump falls into that last category. Jean Carroll has sued him for battery, but the government cannot prosecute Trump for the crime because enough time has passed that the criminal statute of limitations has expired. Moreover, a civil trial cannot subject someone to jail time because such a deprivation of liberty requires greater procedural safeguards \\-\\- jury unanimity, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, etc. \\-\\- that do not always apply to civil trials like this.\n\nTrump's status as ex\\-president has no bearing on the penalties the court may legally impose on him.",

Back then I have used my full name as a user\\-name on that website. I have deleted those comments from the indexed website successfully and they have now disappeared from the website entirely. However, they still show up on google searches, although if one accesses that website, none of my entries are there anymore, so the way I see it, the website did its job and respected my right to be forgotten.\nI wonder if the indexed entry will ever disappear from Google now. This is very concerning for me as I feel that my right to be forgotten is blatantly violated as that Google search entry is still there, even though that entry does not exist anymore.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes. The GDPR's right to be forgotten is even modeled after case law that was developed around Google search results. Thus, you *may* have a right \u2013 depending on your individual circumstances \u2013 to order Google to stop showing search results in Europe, where those results relate to you.\n\nNote that this only affects search results in Europe, not searches from other regions. (See CJEU case C\\-131/12\\)\n\nIn your particular case, there's nothing to do but to wait. Google regularly checks and updates the pages that it has crawled and indexed. This can easily take multiple weeks. But once Google sees that the page no longer contains the information in question, the information will no longer appear in search results. Any process you'd try to accelerate this will probably take longer than just waiting.\n\nOther sites may be keeping archives of the old version of the page, e.g. the Wayback Machine (<https://web.archive.org>) or <https://archive.is>. These will not typically be deleted automatically, and due to the way how these sites operate they might not be subject to GDPR.\n\n---\n\nDetails on the RTBF:\n\n* The GDPR enshrines a Right to Erasure / RTBF in Art 17\\.\n* This right only applies under certain circumstances, for example if the personal data was collected based on a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d and you successfully \u201cobjected\u201d to further processing. Such an objection would have to override the legitimate interests, and depends on your particular situation \u2013 why you want this data to be gone. Sometimes, there might be very good reason to keep the information, for example politicians should not be able to use this mechanism to censor reports of past misconduct.\n* More relevant in this context is Art 17(3\\): when the website on which the information was published fulfilled your request to erasure, then,\n\n> taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, \\[it] shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform \\[other] controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.\n\nThis is legalese for: if someone removed personal data from their public website, they're supposed to tell Google that the information is gone and should be deleted from Google's indexes. This is possible e.g. by providing a `sitemap.xml` with accurate last\\-modified times, or by providing appropriate HTTP status codes like \u201c410 Gone\u201d when an entire URL is deleted.",

They made the monthly payments for a few years, but haven't paid anything for more than twenty years.\n\nNow that relative has died, and his widow says she's concerned that if I die, it will be difficult to sell her house. \\[Edit: Her stated concern, borne from her current situation, is that upon my death the mortgage might become the property of multiple creditors and the question of that ownership might take a long period to resolve.] She has proposed making monthly payments again if we immediately file that the mortgage has been satisfied. I realize the big disadvantage here \\- I'll have no recourse if she doesn't pay \\- but are there any other advantages I should be aware of?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think it would be significantly more difficult for her to sell her house if you die than if you don't. She would have to pay the mortgage \\[to your heirs in case you die] which she is already offering to do (because she is definitely going to pay it\u00a1, *right?*).\n\nEven if she doesn't have the amount to satisfy the owed amount X before selling, that's no reason not to have it sold. She would simply sell it for Y \\> X, then when it is being sold, X goes to you / your heirs, Y\\-X to her. **It happens every day with mortgages hold by banks.**\n\nThe part where there might be an advantage for her would be that if you die there may be multiple heirs she might need to deal with. If there is a single person, she could be able to convince it to settle for Z amount (Z \\< X), or to forgive she hasn't paid a dime in all those years. If there are multiple heirs, all of them would probably need to agree on that lower amount, not to mention that any of them could want to sue her for non\\-payment of the mortgage. If she was to make all the agreed payments, this shouldn't really be an issue for her, as your heirs wouldn't be entitled to receive an higher amount anyway.\n\nYou might want to please her by leaving that mortgage to a single person, but that complicates providing a balanced will, and getting payed this mortgage seems a can of worms on itself. A way to let your heirs off from this might be to set up a trust tasked to collect these payments, although that comes with its own costs (she will probably hate you for that as well, but at that point it's likely you won't care, and you are avoiding that trouble from your heirs).\n\n**I recommend you not to file that mortgage as satisfied when it's not.** I see no benefit for you (and not that much for her, unless she is planning not to pay it). Plus, as mentioned by Ron Beyer, there may some legal costs for doing that. Not to mention how you / your heirs will feel when she stops paying again and she basically stole you/them that amount.",

Filing the mortgage as satisfied when it's not actually paid off provides no benefit to the mortgage holder and could potentially lead to significant financial loss. If the widow stops making payments again, the mortgage holder would have no legal recourse to recover the debt. Additionally, the current mortgage arrangement doesn't significantly hinder the widow's ability to sell the house in the future, as the mortgage can be paid off from the sale proceeds. Option B (setting up a trust) could be a potential solution but comes with its own costs and complications. Options A and D both involve misrepresenting the status of the mortgage, which could lead to legal and financial issues."

[The United States Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence),\n2. [The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union of November 15, 1777](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation),\n3. [The Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance), and\n4.

If not, on what basis are they ranked? I ask this question because in [Supreme Court](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) decisions, it seems to me that it is *only* the U. S. Constitution that is, in practice, considered.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does this mean that all four of the above are \"equipotent\"?\n\nNo. The inclusion of these foundational documents in the *Front Matter* of the United States Code does not indicate anything regarding their legal status. It is more of a political statement, as a preamble to all laws in today's sovereign federal state, describing the foundation of the United States of America and its constitutional order.\n\nThe only constitutional law in force today in the U.S. is the *Constitution for the United States of America*, beginning with\n\n> We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.\n\nand the subsequent amendments.\n\nThe ratification of the Constitution replaced any previous constitutional orders in effect between the States. A new government was [created by the Constitution](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-7/ratification-clause) and replaced the old one under the Articles of the Confederation:\n\n> Both Governments could not be understood to exist at the same time. The New Government did not commence until the old Government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution being ratified by the ninth State; for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new Government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a Government until it dissolved on the 1st of November, by the successive disappearance of its Members. It existed potentially until the 2d of March, the day proceeding that on which the Members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\n> \n> \n> *[Owings v. Speed](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/18/420)*\n\nThe States abandoned their old agreement (the Articles of Confederation) and subjected themselves to the new Constitution.\n\nOf course, the other documents remain historically very significant and may shine lights on the interpretation of the present Constitution, for example, in *[Texas v. White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._White)*, the reference made to the concept of \"perpetual union\" found in the Articles.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence is not so much a legal document per se but a declaration of the existence of the States sovereign from the British Crown; but such sovereignty is not a result from the declaration, but from the acts of war.\n\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787, while remaining in effect under the Constitution by Acts of (the new) Congress, is in any case spent as its territorial extent is extinguished by the establishment and admission of states, who enjoy equal status under the Constitution. See for example, [*Permoli v. Municipality No. 1 of the City of New Orleans*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/44/589/) and [*Strader v.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the court's jurisdiction in this case?\n\nA) The New York court lacks jurisdiction because the defendant never actually conducted business in the state.\n\nB) The New York court has jurisdiction only if the contract explicitly stated that disputes must be litigated in New York.\n\nC) The New York court has jurisdiction based on the state's long-arm statute and the defendant's purposeful engagement with New York.\n\nD) The New York court's jurisdiction depends entirely on whether the doctrine of \"unclean hands\" applies to the defendant's actions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. New York's long-arm statute (NY CPLR \u00a7 302) allows courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over non-domiciliaries who contract to supply goods or services in the state, even if they haven't yet performed those actions. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Burger King v. Rudzewicz supports that a forum can assert specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant when the alleged injury relates to actions purposefully directed toward forum residents. In this case, the defendant purposefully entered into a contract with a New York company to do business in New York, which is sufficient for the court to claim jurisdiction, regardless of whether the business was actually conducted. Options A and B are incorrect because they misstate the requirements for jurisdiction. Option D is incorrect because while \"unclean hands\" might be relevant to the case, it's not the primary basis for determining jurisdiction in this scenario."

The main example is the\u00a0[redaction of Grand Jury Testimony](https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/04/mueller-report-attorney-general-grand-jury-information/)\u00a0that cannot be unredacted under any circumstances (as I understand the article on the case cited). I did not see an exception for Grand Jury Testimony, or other forms of redaction, in the subpoena\n\nQuestion\n========\n\nGiven the situation above, can Barr be able to legally fully comply with the House Judiciary committee's subpoena?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best course of action for Barr would be to file an objection to the subpoena in the proper court (probably the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia) under or by analogy to [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(d)](https://www.federalrulesofcivilprocedure.org/frcp/title-vi-trials/rule-45-subpoena/) (which governs disputes over subpoenas in civil cases in the federal courts), if he thinks that there are matters he cannot lawfully divulge or thinks it is improper to divulge even if they are not privileged, and to let a judge decide.\n\nGenerally speaking, in a civil action, you can only object to a subpoena by following this process and Congress has increasingly used the civil lawsuit discovery process as a benchmark. Failure to file an objection with the proper court, or at least in a response to Congress by the date required in the subpoena to produce the materials, will generally constitute a waiver of the objections that might otherwise have been asserted to the subpoena. \n\nSimply not responding without explanation by the due date would be a pretty clear case of Contempt of Congress which is the basis for both a civil action and criminal contempt charges. \n\nFor example, in the *Lynch* case, cited below, the Court stated with respect to information that was withheld without any claim of privilege:\n\n> Failure to provide any grounds for withholding particular records does\n>  not comply with the order or enable the Court to resolve defendant\u2019s\n>  privilege claims as to those documents. Accordingly, defendant must\n>  produce the material withheld without any proffered justification.\n\nThis said, in any dispute between Congress and the Executive Branch there is always some uncertainty, and the courts strongly favor negotiation and conferral between the parties before bringing these matters to a head.\n\nA general discussion of Congressional subpoenas can be found [here](https://www.lawfareblog.com/congressional-subpoena-power-and-executive-privilege-coming-showdown-between-branches), recognizing, however, that while there are a variety of grounds for redaction asserted in the Mueller report case, \"Executive Privilege\" is not among them and so the special considerations that apply to an assertion of executive privilege do not apply. The authority of the judicial branch to resolve these issues has been upheld, for example, in the cases of *[United States v. Nixon](http://cdn.loc.gov/service/ll/usrep/usrep418/usrep418683/usrep418683.pdf)* (U.S. 1974\\) and *[Committee on Oversight and Government Reform v. Lynch](https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2012cv1332-117)* (D. D.C 2016\\) (both of which involved the more difficult scenario of an assertion of executive privilege in addition to the more ordinary assertions of privileges like the grand jury privilege).\n\nNot infrequently, the judge will review the unredacted material *in camera* (i.e. privately in chambers without showing it to the requesting party) to determine if the claim of privilege or other basis for redaction is really valid (e.g. maybe something that was redacted under the label grand jury testimony is not, in fact, grand jury testimony). But, there is case law to support the notion that Congress would have to demonstrate some specific reason why it doubts the accuracy of the assertions of the executive branch regarding redactions in this particular case to make it necessary for there to be an *in camera* review. In the *Lynch* case (which is a non\\-precedential opinion itself) the Court said:\n\n> As for whether the redactions are what they purport to be, the Court\n>  notes that counsel for even the most disputatious parties are often\n>  called upon to trust each other, and that the judiciary relies\n>  regularly on declarations by the executive branch that matters\n>  redacted from FOIA productions are what they are described to be in\n>  the Vaughn index. *See Loving v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Def.*, 550 F.3d 32, 41\n>  (D.C. Cir. 2008\\) (holding that district court had not abused its\n>  discretion by relying on agency\u2019s Vaughn index and declaration in\n>  determining whether a disputed document contained segregable\n>  portions); *Judicial Watch, Inc. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau*, 60 F.\n>  Supp. 3d 1, 13 (D.D.C. 2014\\) (\u201cThe reviewing court may rely on the\n>  description of the withheld records set forth in the Vaughn index and\n>  the agency\u2019s declaration that it released all segregable\n>  information.\u201d). **The Court has been provided with no reason to believe\n>  that its assistance is needed to verify for counsel for one branch of\n>  government assertions made in pleadings by an officer of the court\n>  representing another, equal branch of government.** If in the end, a\n>  neutral is required to read each individual redaction and confirm that\n>  what the Department claims is simply a name or a telephone number is\n>  in fact a name or a telephone number, the parties can arrange for that\n>  on their own.\n\nThese discretionary issues are likely to be influenced by the partisan leanings of the particular judges involved.\n\nAnother question is to whom a subpoena could be directed. While attorney\\-general Barr is one possible person to whom it could be directed, Mueller himself is another possible person to whom a subpoena could be directed and that might lead to a more tractable counter\\-party in the lawsuit and might simplify some of the conflicts of interest present in a subpoena of the attorney\\-general himself that in criminal contempt cases is enforceable by his subordinates, i.e. U.S. attorneys, who are required by law to bring such charges.",

This approach allows Barr to present legal arguments for withholding certain information (such as grand jury testimony) while respecting the subpoena process. It also allows a judge to review the objections and make a determination, potentially through an in camera review of the unredacted material. \n\nOption A is incorrect because ignoring the subpoena without explanation could result in contempt of Congress charges. Option B is incorrect because there are legal restrictions on disclosing certain types of information, such as grand jury testimony. Option D is incorrect because unilateral action without court involvement could lead to legal challenges and doesn't follow proper procedure for addressing subpoena disputes."

Several federal cabinet ministers and some prominent members of Parliament have allegedly given tax money to a Canadian charity that is a branch of an international charity that has allegedly given money in turn to well\\-known terrorist organizations. Various other countries and some major banks have already broken all ties with the aforementioned international charity. Also, the prime minister himself has appeared in videos urging people to give money to the Canadian branch of the charity. Giving money to terrorist organizations is against Canadian law. \n\nIf these claims are potentially true \\- and I don't know they are, not having seen the evidence, just heard it paraphrased by an alleged former intelligence agent \\- is there anything I can do as a concerned citizen to ensure that the claims are duly investigated by the relevant authorities? If so, what? \n\nI've lived in Canada all my life but I have had very little to do with the legal system and do not know which occurrences get investigated and who initiates the investigation.

Or can I count on the relevant agencies to initiate an investigation themselves because they monitor the media? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a nutshell:\n--------------\n\nAnyone can initiate a prosecution in Canada by laying evidence of each element of the alleged crime before a Justice of the Peace. the Justice sets up a hearing with a Judge who will rule if the accused has a case to answer. If there is a case to answer then the State has the right to intervene by either taking over the prosecution or terminating it.

One can reasonably refer to such a method as a business method as the process results in direct revenue.\n\nIt is doubtful that the referenced examples would not be rejected as lacking patent eligible subject matter, that is, it be more than an abstract idea, and even if some extremely narrow claim may be granted, it would not have commercial value as it could be easily worked around.\n\n**2nd question**\n\nWhether or not they would operate until anyone tells them to stop would require speculation, but whether or not they then could be compelled to stop is a question on\\-topic here, and the answer is they may very well be compelled to stop if discovered or the IP holder decides to do so.",

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of their activities?\n\nA) The club is likely protected under fair use laws and can continue operations indefinitely without concern.\n\nB) The club may be violating copyright laws and could potentially face legal action, but trademark infringement is unlikely unless they use official logos.\n\nC) The club's activities are completely legal as long as they don't use official logos or screenshots from the show.\n\nD) The club is primarily at risk of patent infringement for replicating the show's business methods.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The fan club's activities, while not using official logos, still involve using character likenesses, quotes, and images clearly derived from the TV show. This makes copyright infringement the primary legal concern, as they are likely creating derivative works without permission. Trademark infringement is less likely without the use of official logos, but could still be possible if certain elements are highly recognizable. Patent infringement is unlikely, as TV show concepts and business methods are generally not patentable. While the club may operate until asked to stop, they could face legal action for copyright infringement if discovered by the rights holders."

The answer states that \"There were methods of having your tyres fixed without driving on the road (e.g. taking the tyres to the mechanic in a different vehicle, calling a mobile mechanic etc.) so you have no defence of necessity.\" This means that safer alternatives were available, and the driver chose to break the law by driving an unsafe vehicle.

While legal advice is recommended, the outcome is not solely dependent on hiring a lawyer (eliminating option D).

My sister, who is the personal representative, has continued to live in his house while not paying rent nor utilities for the last 19 months. She has also been collecting rent from two renters who live in the downstairs complex. The only proof I have of her collecting rent is my eye witness account and some messages I have had with the renters as she is not claiming this money. She is now trying to buy us out of the house for a steal.\n\nMy brother and I had to hire our own lawyer to help protect our share of the estate. He did inform me that she needs to pay rent, but said that the estate has to pay for her utilities as well as maintenance, summer and winter taxes and house insurance.\n\nIs the estate really responsible for paying the utilities for the last 19 months? My brother and I have been wanting to sell the house but our sister has been dragging her feet and getting a free ride. Is there anything we can do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Until the estate is settled and the interest in the house is definitively resolved, the estate has to pay property taxes. There is no requirement for the house to be insured, unless there is a mortgage and insurance is mandated by the lender. The duties of the personal representative generally include taking reasonable steps to protect the assets of the estate, which would include reasonable insurance coverage \\-\\- which the estate would pay for. Necessary maintenance would also be included in the things that are to covered by the estate, for example the cost of repairing a broken water pipe (which can cause serious loss, if not repaired). Freshening up the paint in preparation for selling the house, assuming that the house is to be sold and the assets divided, would also be covered by the estate. Utilities, on the other hand, are not within the realm of things that need to be done to protect the interests of the beneficiaries: that is a benefit to whoever lives there, making it their responsibility.\n\nThe question is foot\\-dragging is a separate issue, one that should be resolved with the aid of your lawyer.

Without knowing the exact details of the contracts, it's impossible to definitively state whether the most recent contract completely replaces the older ones.

Should I however, provide an example text which the court can then insert into their injunction? Where can I find example text I can use? Can I just go to the court and ask to see all their injunctions and read through them?\n\nIn my case the ideal text will be something like \"The court orders the XYZ Corporation of 123 Main Street to make available to Joseph Plaintiff any all their financial records from 2015 through 2017 and to return a sworn statement to the court that this has been done by June 1, 2017\\.\" Is there standard text for such injunctions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There really is no standard form for orders imposing injunctions. They are, in general, arguably the most customized documents in the entire legal system, because they are a court order to do or not do something. They would generally, however, say to whom they are directed and might provide for how they should be served.\n\nAlso, it is hard to find examples in public records because injunctions are documents entered by trial courts whose orders are public records but are not indexed or easily accessible. Decisions of appellate courts reviewing injunctions are much more widely available, but they rarely quote the entire language of the injunction in full.\n\nYour best bets to find models in accessible sources with full text are the PACER system which has the full text of every federal trial court pleading and order at a minimal cost, and the SEC's EDGAR system in which publicly held companies must disclose documents such as court orders entered against them in litigation that are pertinent to the fair market value of the company.\n\nEither way, you really need to know in advance of searching the particular case with the particular parties in which some injunction you would like to use as a model was issued (e.g. from newspaper or trade press accounts), and then either search in PACER or EDGAR using that information.\n\nLaw libraries also often have treatises with forms in them, as practice guides, and sometimes there will be examples there.\n\nIn general, a court order will have a court caption, recite the information it considered (pleadings, hearings, etc.) to reach its decision, sometimes will restate the arguments of each party and the findings of fact and conclusions of law it reached in light of those arguments with the factual and legal basis for that decision, and then will set forth in as precise language as possible the terms of the order it chooses to impose. If there is a bond requirement, it will set a bond, direct its form (e.g. cash, personal recognizance, property) and explain the reasons for the bond required. Often it will set forth a deadline and expressly state who is bound by the order. It will close by saying something like \"Done the \\_\\_\\_ day of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_, 2017\" and have a signature line for the judge with the judge's name and title appearing below that line).

The documentation indicates that injunctions are highly customized documents with no standard form. While the court ultimately issues the injunction, it's beneficial for the lawyer to propose specific language tailored to their case. This allows the court to consider the lawyer's requested terms and modify as needed. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states there is no standard form for injunctions. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while courts do issue the final order, they often consider proposed language from attorneys.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while databases like EDGAR can be useful for reference, directly copying another injunction is not appropriate due to the customized nature of each case."

That's why websites use passwords in addition to just the email and why mail programs have spam filters.\n* Your email was probably not used to *sign up* anywhere. Instead, spammers pretend that you signed up to slow attempts to prosecute them. A bit of a joke, really, considering how hard it is to prosecute spammers. The valid/invalid remark is used to facilitate spamming, no need to send mails to long\\-inactive addresses.\n* More concerning than a 'leak' of your email would be a leak of your email plus password. (Such things also happen, and they are a reason why one should use different passwords and 2FA/MFA on important sites.) If it is just the email, see my first bullet point.\n* There is a significant likelihood that the 'website owner' you *think* you identified is another victim of the address trader. Getting to the real culprit will require significant forensic effort. That effort is unlikely to happen for *just* emails.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the advice given, which of the following actions would be the most appropriate next step for the user concerned about their email being found in an online list?\n\nA) Immediately file a police report against the website owner they identified\nB) Continue using the same email but implement stronger passwords and two-factor authentication on important accounts\nC) Pursue legal action under GDPR against the website hosting the list\nD) Completely abandon the email address and create a new one for all accounts\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The advice suggests that finding an email address in such a list, while annoying, is not necessarily a major security concern on its own. The expert emphasizes that emails becoming exposed over time is common, which is why websites use additional security measures like passwords and two-factor authentication. The recommended approach is to strengthen security on important accounts rather than abandoning the email entirely or taking legal action, which may be premature or misdirected. Filing a police report or pursuing GDPR action is not advised as the primary step, especially since the identified website owner may be another victim rather than the actual culprit. Therefore, implementing stronger passwords and two-factor authentication on important accounts (option B) aligns best with the given advice as a practical next step to enhance security."

The employer only put the check number on my exit interview form and did not put the check amount and I believe that was bait and switch to be able to change the check amount that they would give me if I didn't sign the nondisclosure Agreement.\n\nAfter I signed the exit interview form they did not give me my check. They said, \"In consideration for those, meaning my checks, I had to sign the nondisclosure agreement.\"\n\nIs that considered extortion or is it illegal? I know in the state of Virginia it's illegal to withhold someone's paycheck but did they commit a crime of extortion or any other crime when they told me I had to do something to get what was rightfully mine? I have them on tape saying what I just disclosed to you. \n\nADDED....Also the employer in the general release form they offered to forgo let's say $2,000 worth of vacation time for me to sign the release form. This mirrors the characteristics of a severance agreement. At the time that they presented that general release to me I was over 50 years old which would have given me certain rights and they would have had to do certain things that they did not do. For instance for older adults being offered a severance agreement they would have had to have given me 7, or 21 days or something to the resend it if I wanted to. I would have had to have been told to consult with a lawyer before I signed it and I think I should have been given time to look it over like seven days or something like that by law. But they called it a general release not a severance pay agreement or a severance agreement. \n\nMy question is just because they called it a general release does that not make it a severance agreement? When I pulled up severance agreement form or template it was exactly the same as this general release so in my view they should have treated me and the general release form with the rules that govern a severance agreement. paragraph a paragraph that general release form was exactly the same as the severance agreements that I pulled up from online. \n\nMy question is should they have been held to the standard of a severance agreement when it had all of the characteristics of a severance agreement?\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They have exactly zero legal grounds to withhold your last paycheck. From [Code of Virginia 40\\.1](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title40.1/chapter3/section40.1-29/):\n\n> All employers operating a business shall establish regular pay periods and rates of pay for employees except executive personnel. All such employers shall pay salaried employees at least once each month and employees paid on an hourly rate at least once every two weeks or twice in each month, except that (i) a student who is currently enrolled in a work\\-study program or its equivalent administered by any secondary school, institution of higher education or trade school, and (ii) employees whose weekly wages total more than 150 percent of the average weekly wage of the Commonwealth as defined in \u00a7 65\\.2\\-500, upon agreement by each affected employee, may be paid once each month if the institution or employer so chooses. **Upon termination of employment an employee shall be paid all wages or salaries due him for work performed prior thereto; such payment shall be made on or before the date on which he would have been paid for such work had his employment not been terminated.**\n\nThe Virginia Department of Labor and Industry unfortunately [does not take claims](https://www.doli.virginia.gov/labor-law/payment-of-wage-english/) if there is a written contract and recommends you pursue the matter in court. You may want to consult with a local labor attorney to get an idea of where to go from here, even if you plan to file in small claims court.\n\nVirginia extortion law doesn't appear to apply to withholding stolen property, but their claim that release of the last paycheck is consideration for signing the NDA may be some other civil wrong, like conversion. I do not know whether you could recover damages above the wage owed for that.",

This payment must be made on or before the date on which the employee would have been paid had their employment not been terminated. The employer's attempt to withhold the final paycheck as leverage to get the employee to sign an NDA is illegal. The law clearly states that wages for work already performed must be paid, regardless of any other agreements or conditions the employer tries to impose. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they suggest scenarios that violate Virginia labor law regarding final pay upon termination."

For example, recently the Supreme Court ruled that blanket give\\-all\\-records\\-to\\-police hotel ordinances were unconstitutional. Nevertheless, many cities and town have ordinances that require hotels to record extensive information on all their guests and to allow police to search those records whenever the police want without a warrant or even notice of any kind.\n\nSo, the question is how can a hotel challenge such ordinances and have them voided by the courts without breaking them and criminalizing themselves?\n\nUpdate: I found an article on this subject dating back to 1967 (Declaratory Relief in the Criminal Law, Harvard Law Review, Vol. 80, No. 7 (May, 1967\\), pp. 1490\\-1513 (24 pages)). So, answers to this question could be seen as modern extensions to this paper with specific emphasis on civil or regulatory law (not criminal and not private).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two cases to consider.\n\n* If there is some evidence that the city intends to enforce the ordinance, then the business can go to court for an injunction preventing the city from doing so, if they can show that such enforcement would harm them (e.g. by making them impose a records policy they don't want). They don't have to risk arrest by actually violating the ordinance first. In granting the injunction, the court would likely rule that this particular ordinance is unconstitutional, which seems to be the \"voiding\" that you're looking for.\n* If the city shows no signs of wanting to enforce the ordinance (e.g. they are well aware that it is unconstitutional and not legally enforceable), then a request for an injunction would likely be dismissed as not [ripe](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ripe). Courts do not want to waste their time on cases where there is no real dispute between the parties, or on issuing orders for an entity not to do something that they weren't going to do anyway. It's understandable that the business might wish for an explicit ruling anwyay, in case they fear that the city will change its mind tomorrow and start cracking down, but unfortunately for them, courts do not agree that this is worth doing.\n\nNote in either case the ordinance will remain on the books until such time as the town council (or other relevant legislative body) should vote to repeal it. Courts have no power to make that happen, no matter how unconstitutional the ordinance might be. So the business might find it more effective to petition the council for a repeal.",

If the house was bequeathed specifically to the beneficiaries then the executor must arrange for the legal transfer. However, if there is no will or the will just bequeaths assets without identifying them then the executor/administrator has discretion on whether to transfer the house or to sell it and distribute the proceeds. If this is shortly after the death and the sister was the administrator, she could decide to sell.\n\nThe house could be owned by a company. If so, the director(s) would be able to dispose of it. The director(s) are appointed by the shareholders and if the sister had more than 50% of the shares, well. This is not a particularly common way of owning residential property because it has tax disadvantages but it is a common ownership method for industrial or commercial property: many companies own the land where they do business. Perhaps the house is a small part of a large factory complex?\n\nThe property could be inside a trust with the brother and sister as beneficiaries but the sister as trustee. Trusts can be discretionary (i.e. the trustee decides who gets what) or unit trusts (like having shares in a company \\- you get it in proportion to your holding). The latter is the way publicly traded property trusts work. While the trustee has to operate in line with the trust deed and for the benefit of all the beneficiaries, the sister may, reasonably or unreasonably, decide that selling the house is in those interests.",

Which interpretation is correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This would probably fall under the \"[legitimate interest](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/)\" basis. However the service provider would need to show that the processing they did was aimed at this objective and in accordance with the data protection principles, particularly of [data minimisation](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/data-minimisation/) and [storage](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/storage-limitation/). \n\nThey should consider what data they want to extract from the detailed logs, whether the logs can be anonymised, how long they need to keep them, and whether they can achieve their objectives by storing aggregate data (e.g. percentage of people who clicked this link when viewing this page) rather than individual clicks and key presses. They should also consider whether the logs might reveal special category data (e.g. health, sexuality, religion, politics). This can happen if, for instance, the site contains information about a particular disease; people who read it are likely to have that disease or know someone who does.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided GDPR documentation:\n\nQuestion: A web application company wants to collect detailed user interaction data (including button clicks and keystrokes) to improve their service. Under GDPR, which of the following approaches is most likely to be compliant?\n\nA) Require users to agree to terms and conditions that include consent for data collection before they can log in, with no option to opt out while using the service.\n\nB) Collect the data under the \"legitimate interest\" basis, but store only aggregate data (e.g., percentage of users who clicked a specific link) rather than individual user actions.\n\nC) Collect and store all user interactions indefinitely, justifying it as a direct business need for future service improvements.\n\nD) Obtain separate, explicit consent for data collection, allowing users to decline consent while still accessing the core service features.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most likely to be GDPR-compliant. It uses the \"legitimate interest\" basis, which can be appropriate for improving services. However, it also adheres to the principles of data minimization and storage limitation by only keeping aggregate data rather than detailed individual user actions. This approach balances the company's need to improve their service with user privacy.\n\nOption A is problematic because it doesn't allow users to opt out of data collection while still using the service, which goes against GDPR principles.\n\nOption C violates the principles of data minimization and storage limitation by collecting and storing excessive data indefinitely.\n\nOption D, while generally a good practice, may not be necessary if the legitimate interest basis is properly applied, and could potentially hinder the company's ability to improve their service if many users opt out."

You are one of the three owners and the two others are resident abroad. You're assuming that jurisdiction is in the US and your defendandants are the two other partners, not the business entity. To me, it looks like this assumption is correct but I don't know the details of your case.\n\nIn this case, it will likely not be possible to use domestic process service; However, since international process service tends to be a dark art that is associated with a lot of red tape, you should first try to figure if you can use domestic service after all.\n\nOptions for domestic service include:\n\na) Service while travelling: If your defendants travel to the US, you can serve them personally as long as they are on US soil. Residency doesn't matter. You just need to get a US process server to ambush them whereever they are in the US.\n\nb) Service on service agent: If your defendants have arranged a US\\-based service agent who is allowed to be served on their behalf, you can serve the service agent. (I'm mentioning this for the sake of completeness, because international contracts sometimes include a clause that requires the parties to appoint a domestic service agent just in case there will be a lawsuit.)\n\nc) Service on subsidiary, Service on legal counsel: There have been cases where a US court decided that service on 1\\) a lawyer who used to represent the respondant in the past or 2\\) service on a subsidiary of the respondant is sufficient. I would be careful with these options because this looks like making up a service authorisation that doesn't exist.\n\nIf none of the above is available to you, you will have to serve process abroad. (Nota Bene: This doesn't mean that you have to exhaust your options for domestic service before intl service is allowed.) International process service is quite different from domestic service; In many cases, it involves some red tape, costs more than domestic service and it is much slower. In most cases, you are **not** allowed to hire a process server directly as this would (in most cases) be considered a violation of the Hague service convention, a violation of the destination country's national sovereignty and/or assumption of powers without authority.\n\n**The exact procedure varies for serving abroad varies heavily between countries; For further reading, I recommend this blog: <https://www.haguelawblog.com/>**\n\n**If you tell me in which country you need to have your documents served, I may also be able to tell you more about service in that country.**",

The text specifically warns against hiring a process server directly in international cases, as this could violate the Hague Service Convention and the destination country's sovereignty.\nOption D, while described as potentially risky, has been accepted by U.S. courts in some cases as a sufficient method of service.\n\nThe correct answer is C because it directly contradicts the advice given in the passage, which emphasizes the complexities of international service and the need to follow specific procedures rather than hiring a local process server directly."

I'll start with the USA since they're basically the only major copyright jurisdiction for which I could find a straightforward answer, then discuss internationally.\n\nUSA\n===\n\nIn the USA, Bob would generally **not hold copyright** in modifications thus there is no copyright for Alice to violate, assuming no copyright exceptions like fair use apply. This is due to [17 U.S.C 103(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/103) (see also *[Anderson v. Stallone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Stallone)*):\n\n> The subject matter of copyright as specified by [section 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102) includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully.\n\nWhile I couldn't find any commentary on this point, the wording does seem to imply that portions of a derivative with additions far enough removed from the original work might qualify for copyright protection.\n\nInternational copyright law\n===========================\n\nThe main provisions governing derivative works in international copyright law come from [Berne Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) Article 2(3\\):\n\n> Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work.\n\nand Article 12 (with a similar provision specifically for translation in Article 8\\):\n\n> Authors of literary or artistic works shall enjoy the exclusive right of authorizing adaptations, arrangements and other alterations of their works.\n\nThere's the argument that since unauthorized derivatives aren't explicitly excluded from protection that they should be protected, however, there's also the argument that granting unauthorized derivatives their own copyright is in itself prejudicial to the original copyright holder. Note I don't think it's debated that non\\-infringing derivatives gain their own copyright, including unauthorized derivatives that nevertheless fall into a copyright exception such as fair use.\n\nDr. Daniel Gervais points out in *[The Derivative Right, or Why Copyright Law Protects Foxes Better than Hedgehogs](https://www.jetlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Gervais.pdf)* section III.B that there's a bit of history here. The original Berne Convention 1886 text stated that \"Lawful translations shall be protected as original works.\" However, the word \"lawful\" was struck out in the 1908 Berlin Convention coming up with wording similar to today's Article 2(3\\). Gervais's article cites *\u00c9tude sur la Convention de Berlin de 1908 pour la Protection des \u0152uvres Litt\u00e9raires et artistiques* by Andr\u00e9 Petit implying disagreement between the countries about whether or not to protect unlawful derivatives, thus leaving it unsaid. Unfortunately, I'm unable to locate any copies of this source.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to a fortunate snippet Google Books displayed, I know that *[La conf\u00e9rence de Berlin (14 octobre\\-13 novembre 1908\\)](https://books.google.ca/books/about/La_conf%C3%A9rence_de_Berlin_14_octobre_13_n.html?id=3wNCAQAAIAAJ&redir_esc=y)* by Georges\\-Fran\u00e7ois\\-Joseph Martin also discusses this exact point on page 187, quoting someone who thought unlawful derivatives would be protected now, though I couldn't get enough context to really determine anything. While I could find available copies of this book, for now it's a little on the expensive side for me.\n\nOverview of various jurisdictions\n=================================\n\nIn the **EU**, the derivative right is not harmonized and so the question is punted to the Member States. There is no implementation of either Berne Convention Article 2(3\\) or Article 12 in the *[Information Society (Copyright) Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0029:EN:HTML)*, Article 12 being specifically acknowledged by the Court of Justice in the *[Allposters](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=161609&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1)* case.\n\nIn the **UK**, infringing derivatives are probably protected, see *Redwood Music Ltd. v. Chappell \\& Co. Ltd.*, \\[1982] R.P.C. 109 (Q.B. Div.) at 120\\. I can't find the judgement text outside a paywall, but an [article by William J. Braithwaite](https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1990&context=ohlj) (PDF) quotes the relevant part on page 209 (the square brackets are his):\n\n> \\[T]he idea that \\[the owner of the underlying copyright] should be entitled to reap the benefit of another's original work, by exploiting it, however extensive such work might be, however innocently it might have been made, offends against justice and common sense.\n\nAdditionally, the justice noted the argument that unlawful derivatives are not explicitly excluded from copyright protection and that parliament has declined to make this explicit.\n\nIf I understand the [English court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_England_and_Wales) correctly, this decision was two appeals away from the Supreme Court (House of Lords back then), but there doesn't appear to have been any appeal. For what it's worth though, the [justice who issued the decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goff,_Baron_Goff_of_Chieveley) ultimately became [Senior Law Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_Kingdom).\n\nIn **Italy**, the Supreme Court has determined that [derivative works can be simultaneously infringing and protected](https://elawnora.blogspot.com/2018/10/italian-supreme-court-holds-that.html).",

This may include such provisions as:\n\n* Assignment of any patents\n* Documentation and assignment of algorithms\n* Non\\-disclosure agreements\n* Release and removal of all documentation/source/notes/etc from the contractors system related to the developed system via signed affidavit\n* Documentation of trade secrets\n* Marking sensitive documents as such (Confidential/Internal use only, etc)\n\nAnother important step from the client side is an indemnification agreement, which basically would say that if Client A were to sue Client B for an IP violation arising from work produced by the contractor, that the contractor would be the one to pay for that particular violation (and court costs/lawyer fees, etc). This is a huge incentive for the contractor to clearly demonstrate that while the output is similar, it was developed independently.\n\nThe important thing here is to remember that Intellectual Property and Expertise are two different legal concepts. Intellectual Property is something that can be legally protected, while expertise is general knowledge that cannot.",

They have just completed a project for Client A and are now working on similar projects for Clients B and C. Which of the following statements best describes the legal and ethical considerations for Company XYZ in this situation?\n\nA) Company XYZ cannot take on any projects similar to Client A's, as it would automatically infringe on Client A's intellectual property rights.\n\nB) Company XYZ can work on similar projects for Clients B and C, but must use entirely different programming languages and development tools to avoid any potential IP conflicts.\n\nC) Company XYZ can work on similar projects for Clients B and C, utilizing their expertise and independently developed algorithms, as long as they don't directly copy or reuse code from Client A's project and have proper documentation and agreements in place.\n\nD) Company XYZ must obtain written permission from Client A before taking on any new projects in the same field, regardless of the similarities or differences in the actual work.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the legal and ethical considerations for a consultancy working on similar projects for multiple clients. Company XYZ can leverage their expertise and independently developed algorithms for new projects, as long as they don't directly copy or reuse code from previous client projects. It's important to have proper documentation, development processes, and agreements in place to demonstrate that the work for each client is independently created. This approach allows the consultancy to continue operating and serving multiple clients while respecting each client's intellectual property rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's too restrictive and doesn't accurately represent the reality of consultancy work. Option B is unnecessary and impractical, as using different programming languages and tools doesn't guarantee IP protection. Option D is also overly restrictive and not typically required in consultancy work, as long as proper IP protections are in place."

He showed a website that also states it is [not essential](https://thebla.co.uk/latest-2020-assured-shorthold-tenancy/) to have a written tenancy\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Jurisdiction: [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")\n\nYour landlord probably is obliged to provide you with at least *some* written terms if you request it, but other than that there is no requirement to have a written tenancy agreement encompassing all of the agreed terms.\n\nAssured shorthold tenancies\n---------------------------\n\nI'm assuming that you have an assured shorthold tenancy under [section 19A of the Housing Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/19A) (the \"**HA 1988**\"). This is the type of tenancy which most residential tenants have. To be an assured shorthold tenancy:\n\n* You must occupy the property as your only or principal home ([section 1(1\\) HA 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/1))\n* You do not pay a very low rent (\u00a31000 a year or less in London, \u00a3250 a year or less anywhere else) or a very high rent (\u00a3100,000 a year or more), your landlord is not a university, your landlord does not live in the building with you, it is not a holiday let, and none of the other paragraphs in [Schedule 1 HA 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/1) apply.\n\nStatement of basic terms\n------------------------\n\nSection [20A HA 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/20A) provides that:\n\n> (1\\) Subject to subsection (3\\) below, a tenant under an assured\n> shorthold tenancy to which section 19A above applies may, by notice in\n> writing, require the landlord under that tenancy to provide him with a\n> written statement of any term of the tenancy which (a) falls within\n> subsection (2\\) below, and (b) is not evidenced in writing.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) The following terms of a tenancy fall within this subsection,\n> namely\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) the date on which the tenancy began or, if it is a statutory\n> periodic tenancy or a tenancy to which section 39(7\\) below applies,\n> the date on which the tenancy came into being,\n> \n> \n> (b) the rent payable under the tenancy and the dates on which that rent\n> is payable,\n> \n> \n> (c) any term providing for a review of the rent payable under the\n> tenancy, and\n> \n> \n> (d) in the case of a fixed term tenancy, the length of the fixed term.\n\nA failure by the landlord to do so is a criminal offence pursuant to [section 20A(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/20A) but the landlord does not have to respond more than once in relation to a term which has not changed in the meantime ([section 20A(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/20A)).\n\nLandlord's address\n------------------\n\nUnder [section 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/31/section/48), the landlord is also obliged to give you a notice containing an address in England and Wales at which notices can be served on him by you. A failure to do so means that no rent is due until such time as the landlord complies (but he can then request all outstanding rent retrospectively) (section 48(2\\)).\n\nYou can also request the landlord's address from the person you pay the rent to and they must provide that information in writing within 21 days or commit an offence pursuant to [section 1 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/70/section/1).\n\nNote these are two slightly different things. The first is an address in England and Wales to which notices can be served, but doesn't necessarily need to be the landlord's address. The second is the landlord's actual address (which might not be in England and Wales). Usually these will be the same address.\n\nConsequences to the landlord\n----------------------------\n\nNot having a written agreement is generally worse for the landlord than for the tenant. This is because it is typically the landlord who would draft the tenancy agreement and a well drafted one will have lots of terms favouring the landlord and relatively few favouring the tenant. Without such terms, the landlord and tenant generally only retain their statutory rights and obligations (which apply with or without a written agreement) unless it can be proven that something else was agreed verbally.",

These include the start date of the tenancy, rent amount and payment dates, any rent review terms, and the length of a fixed-term tenancy if applicable. The landlord's personal phone number is not listed as one of these required terms. While landlords must provide an address in England and Wales for serving notices (under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987) and their actual address if requested (under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985), their phone number is not a legally required piece of information."

For example, if a science fiction movie presents a race which has a particular habit or nuance which is not known to exist elsewhere, can an author make use of that habit or nuance to create a fictional race which also portrays that habit or nuance? This could apply to many art forms including, written stories and poetry among others.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright never protects ideas as such, whether in movies, novels or text books or any other kind of work. However, if an aspect of work, such as a character, place or fictional society are sufficiently distinctive, and if another work uses that aspect, with **detailed** similarity to the previous work, it might be found to be a derivative work of the original. A derivative work requires permission from the copyright holder of the original work.\n\nFor example, in Ursula K. LeGuin's famous SF novel *The Left Hand of Darkness* a fictional race or species, the Gethenians, is portrayed which is neither male nor female most of the time, but becomes sexually active and gendered a few days a month, and an individual may be male one month and female the next. This is an original and distinctive idea. Another author could create a different group of people with a similar nature without infringing copyright, but if the detailed description of how the process worked, or how it felt to the individuals involved was similar, that might make it a derivative work, and LeGuin's estate might be able to sue and win.\n\nThis is something that gets decided on a case\\-by\\-case basis, and such decisions are highly fact\\-based. But if the new work has a society or species which is clearly different from any previously invented one, even though it shares some aspect, and if there is no detailed, point\\-by\\-point similarity, an infringement suit seems unlikely. Several SF authors have said \"Its not the idea, it's what you do with it that matters.\"\n\nFilmmakers, because of the money involved, tend to be more cautious than book authors. For example, Paramount bought rights to the \"flat cats\" from Robert A. Heinlein before filming the *Star Trek* episode \"The Trouble with the Tribbles\", although the similarity was quite probably not enough for a successful infringement suit (but no one will ever know for sure, since they bought permission). This is described in some detail in David Gerrold's book about the making of that episode. Gerrold wrote that his conscious model was the importation of rabbits into Australia, not RAH's flat cats, but there are some similarities, and DG had read *The Rolling Stone* (where the flat cats appear) years before.\n\nIn any specific case. consulting a lawyer with expertise in the area would be a good idea, as the details will matter.",

Copyright law does not protect ideas themselves, but rather the expression of those ideas. In this case, while the basic concept of an alien species with a unique biological trait is not protected, the detailed implementation and description of that trait could be. If the second author's work shares substantial similarity in the specific details of how the biological trait functions or is described, it could potentially be considered a derivative work, requiring permission from the original copyright holder. However, if the second author's implementation is sufficiently different in its details and cultural implications, it would likely not infringe on the original work's copyright. This reflects the principle that it's not the idea itself, but how it's executed that matters in copyright law."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in England in the UK. I frequently commute to work via a scenic country route. Sometimes a farmer marches his livestock down one of the public roads. The cars stop on one side and the farmer leads them down the other.\n\nIllustration:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dodIn.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dodIn.jpg)\n\nI was wondering: if one of the cows reared up and damaged my car, who would be liable? My car is stationary on a public highway. Would it be the farmer? Or would it be considered an \"act of god\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is covered in the Animals Act 1971 Chapter 22: \"An Act to make provision with respect to civil liability for damage done by animals and with respect to the protection of livestock from dogs; and for purposes connected with those matters.\" <http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/22> \n\nThe use of the roads by livestock under control is legal. If a cow damaged a car when a herd of cows was being moved, the driver *could probably* make the case that it is the farmers fault, as they are using and operting on the highway in much the same way as any other traffic: car, truck, horse drawn carraige, etc. And much the same way if the farmer was driving a car and collided by his own fault with the driver.\n\nIn the US West, \"Open Range\" laws can work in the opposite manner; in some cases, you hit a cow, you pay for it, and pay for the damage to your own vehicle.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In England, a farmer is moving his herd of cows along a public road. Your car is stationary on one side of the road as the cows pass. Suddenly, one of the cows rears up and damages your car. According to the Animals Act 1971, who is most likely to be held liable for the damage?\n\nA) You, the car owner, as you chose to park on a road where livestock movement is known to occur\nB) The local council, as they are responsible for maintaining public roads and ensuring safety\nC) The farmer, as they are responsible for controlling their livestock on public roads\nD) No one, as this would be considered an \"act of God\" and therefore no party is liable\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Animals Act 1971, the farmer would likely be held liable for the damage caused by their cow. The Act covers civil liability for damage done by animals, and in this case, the farmer is using the public road to move their livestock, which is legal but comes with responsibilities. The farmer is expected to control their animals and is operating on the highway in a manner similar to other road users. Just as a driver would be responsible for damage caused by their vehicle, the farmer is responsible for damage caused by their livestock while under their control on a public road."

The policy should name a beneficiary, which could be the policyholder, the owner(s), or even another party. Without knowing the exact terms of the policy, we can't definitively state who has a legal claim to the payout.

It is served in a large plastic cup with a straw. There is no place to sit in the deli so you must carry the drink out into the hallway, past the watchful eye of many NYPD, DHS, and even US Army personnel (because this is a large US transit station in the 21st century).\n\n[![Beer for sale](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iavcJ.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iavcJ.jpg)\n[![Sign](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vKi3E.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vKi3E.jpg)\n\nYet there are also signs clearly stating the consumption of alcohol to be a violation of \"NYC Admin Code 10\\-125\". Is Penn Station some sort of Amsterdam\\-like decriminalization zone for draft beer?\n\nI am mainly interested in the crowded central corridors.

The police do not have an obligation (separate from what their job might be) to enforce all the laws.

The documentation states that signs in Penn Station correctly cite NYC Admin Code 10-125, which prohibits alcohol consumption. However, the sale of beer is openly permitted, creating an apparent contradiction. The top answer explains that this situation demonstrates selective enforcement, where police use their discretion in applying the law. They may choose to enforce it against disruptive individuals while allowing quiet, non-disruptive consumption to continue. This discretionary enforcement explains the coexistence of alcohol sales and prohibition signs without Penn Station being a special legal zone or the law being officially overridden."

Where the platform owners are the third\\-party as far as money goes. So Person A sells an item, and Person B buys it. The platform owners, accept the payment, and when the goods have been transferred (lets say digital goods), then the platform owners release the funds to the seller. However, what happens if they send the payment twice. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The party that made the overpayment would have the right to sue you for \"unjust enrichment\" or \"breach of contract\" (since the terms of service no doubt provide or strongly imply that you are entitled to only one payment per sale), if you didn't voluntarily return the overpayment following a demand to do so, even though you received it through no fault of your own. Most of the core cases involve clerical errors in the bank account number used for a bank deposit.\n\nIn general, there is a right to recover an accidental transfer of property to another, even in the absence of a clearly applicable contractual arrangement. As another example, if you were accidentally given a valuable coat at a coat check by accident and didn't notice it until later, the true owner would have a right to have it returned.\n\nThe FTC regulation applies (as demonstrated by the link cited in the question) to intentional unsolicited deliveries of merchandise (which would always be tangible personal property by definition) to you through the mail. It does not apply to transfers of money, or to the accidental mis\\-delivery of property to the wrong person or the wrong address.\n\nThe law in question is as follows:\n\n> 39 U.S. Code \u00a7 3009 \\- Mailing of unordered merchandise\n> \n> \n> (a) Except for (1\\) free samples clearly and conspicuously marked as\n>  such, and (2\\) merchandise mailed by a charitable organization\n>  soliciting contributions, the mailing of un\u00adordered merchandise or of\n>  communications prohibited by subsection (c) of this section\n>  constitutes an unfair method of competition and an unfair trade\n>  practice in violation of section 45(a)(1\\) of title 15\\.\n> \n> \n> (b) Any merchandise mailed in violation of subsection (a) of this\n>  section, or within the exceptions contained therein, may be treated as\n>  a gift by the recipient, who shall have the right to retain, use,\n>  discard, or dispose of it in any manner he sees fit without any\n>  obligation whatsoever to the sender. All such merchandise shall have\n>  attached to it a clear and conspicuous statement informing the\n>  recipient that he may treat the merchandise as a gift to him and has\n>  the right to retain, use, discard, or dispose of it in any manner he\n>  sees fit without any obligation whatsoever to the sender.\n> \n> \n> (c) No mailer of any merchandise mailed in violation of subsection (a)\n>  of this section, or within the exceptions contained therein, shall\n>  mail to any recipient of such merchandise a bill for such merchandise\n>  or any dunning communications.\n> \n> \n> (d) For the purposes of this section, \u201cun\u00adordered merchandise\u201d means\n>  merchandise mailed without the prior expressed request or consent of\n>  the recipient.",

Which of the following is correct?\n\nA) The customer can keep both copies as gifts, as the FTC rule applies to all unordered items, including digital goods.\n\nB) The business has no recourse, as accidental duplicate digital deliveries are treated the same as unsolicited physical mail under the law.\n\nC) The business can sue the customer for unjust enrichment, as the FTC rule doesn't apply to this situation.\n\nD) The customer must return or delete the extra copy, but the business cannot charge for it or send dunning communications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The FTC rule on unordered merchandise (39 U.S. Code \u00a7 3009) specifically applies to physical items sent through the mail, not digital goods or accidental overpayments. In this case, the business has the right to sue for unjust enrichment or breach of contract if the customer refuses to return or delete the accidentally sent extra copy. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the FTC rule doesn't apply to digital goods or accidental duplicate deliveries. \n\nOption B is wrong as it misapplies the scope of the FTC rule. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while the business shouldn't charge for the accidental copy, they do have legal recourse to recover it, unlike with unsolicited physical mail.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the limitations of the FTC rule and how it differs from general principles of unjust enrichment in contract law."

Some employees have decided to see if they can not provoke, more trick, him into losing his cool (he has a history of a foul temperament) and attack a colleague physically, ergo providing HR a credible excuse to finally fire him, and protect themselves at the same time. The main part of the plan is not to involve the cops, as we have no intention of causing unnecessary hassle, we just want rid of him. Would such an action be illegal under law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, many jurisdictions have criminal offenses outlawing behavior that may include what you're describing here. \n\nIn Ohio, for instance, [disorderly conduct (R.C. 2917\\.11\\)](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2917.11v1) includes \"insulting, taunting, or challenging another, under circumstances in which that conduct is likely to provoke a violent response.\" \n\nIn Indiana, there's the offense of [provocation (IC 35\\-42\\-2\\-3\\)](https://codes.findlaw.com/in/title-35-criminal-law-and-procedure/in-code-sect-35-42-2-3.html), which is even broader and includes \"recklessly, knowingly, or intentionally \\[engaging] in conduct that is likely to provoke a reasonable person to commit battery.\" It looks like this has been interpreted to include even actions that don't directly involve the provoked person, such as [kissing another man's wife](http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/porter/it-s-the-law-don-t-provoke-anyone-to-fight/article_8fc16f6b-ae4b-577c-a823-7360df90fd59.html).\n\nBeyond the criminal offense, there are also jurisdictions that will permit a civil suit for damages resulting from the criminal act.

In [another Iran\\-USA prisoners exchange](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-usa-prisoners-idUSKBN1YB08X), charges were dropped for Masoud Soleimani.\n\nThen as \"free\" men and women who are foreign nationals, they can still be inadmissible to the United States and be deportable aliens under the *Immigration and Nationality Act* (8 U.S. Code [\u00a7 1182 \\- Inadmissible aliens](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182), [\u00a7 1227 \\- Deportable aliens](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227)). In this case, there are so many potential grounds to choose from: conviction of a crime of moral turpitude, misrepresentation, national security, foreign policy, etc. The Secretary of State can also [revoke their visas](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1201#i) at the Secretary's discretion and make their presence unlawful.\n\nThey have the right to contest deportation if they are considered \"free\" as far as the criminal law is considered. But, they usually want to go home. The US may choose to prosecute them for other potential crimes if they contest.\n\nThen if they are deportable and there is no stay on the proceedings due to judicial or administrative intervention, they can be removed from the United States.\n\n> Is there a formal agreement in international law between the US and UK?\n\nI do not believe the United Kingdom was involved directly to the exchange itself. The prisoner swap was done in Vienna. Agreement needs to be obtained from the Austrian government regarding entry conditions etc.\n\nUK revoked Anna Chapman's British citizenship. Igor Sutyagin and Sergei Skripal moved to UK. But those are not really international matters legally. The UK alone determines how its citizenship works and who can enter and stay in the UK.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of international prisoner exchanges, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal process in the United States?\n\nA) The President must always issue a formal pardon for prisoners involved in international exchanges.\n\nB) Deportation is the only legal mechanism available for releasing foreign prisoners in exchange deals.\n\nC) The Secretary of State has no authority to revoke visas of foreign nationals involved in spy swaps.\n\nD) Multiple legal mechanisms, including deportation, commutation, and charge dismissal, can be employed depending on the specific circumstances of the exchange.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation provides examples of various legal mechanisms that can be used in international prisoner exchanges:\n\n1. Deportation: In the 2010 USA-Russia exchange, defendants were sentenced to time served and then deported as inadmissible aliens under immigration law.\n\n2. Commutation: President Obama commuted sentences of Iranian citizens in a spy swap deal.\n\n3. Charge dismissal: In another Iran-USA prisoner exchange, charges were dropped for Masoud Soleimani.\n\n4. Visa revocation: The Secretary of State has the authority to revoke visas of foreign nationals at their discretion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pardons are not always necessary; other mechanisms can be used. Option B is false as deportation is not the only mechanism available. Option C is incorrect because the Secretary of State does have the authority to revoke visas. Option D correctly summarizes the various legal tools that can be employed based on the specific circumstances of each exchange."

I got to looking through the bounties and got to thinking that the prices offered for \"information leading to the identification or location of any person\" seemed a bit on the low side. I mean, Bin Laden's reward was only 25 million when he was killed, the US military alone pisses that away more than that on an *hourly* basis.\n\nThis got me to thinking, what if a group was able to capture someone who was internationally wanted and then... auctioned them off to the highest bidder?\n\nI mean, on one hand, this could *probably* be regarded as human trafficking, but outside that... I have no idea.\n\nNote:\n\\-\\-This is assuming this group is able to maintain its anonymity and operations during the auction and transaction process without groups X, Y, or Z knocking down their door rather than get into a potential bidding war.\n\\-\\-Also, for the sake of the argument, let's say it is someone of international renown that is just as wanted and famous as Bin Laden.\n\\-\\-As a method of protecting themselves from attack the auction may be released.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Upon failing to turn the individual over to lawful authorities, a private citizen would be guilty of kidnapping, because at that point their authority to make a citizen's arrest would terminate.\n\nA sovereign government, in contrast, who has the individual in lawful custody, is probably free to do so, although it would be diplomatically harmful to do so.",

According to the information provided, once a private citizen or group fails to turn over a captured individual to lawful authorities, they would be guilty of kidnapping. This is because their authority to make a citizen's arrest would terminate at that point. The other options are incorrect: maintaining anonymity (A) or publicly releasing auction information (D) does not make the action legal, and this situation goes beyond typical bounty hunting (B) into the realm of illegal detention and potentially human trafficking."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I created a website that cataloged every possible sequence of letters in order.  \n\nYou would start with the letter \"a\", could swipe right to read \"b\", and further to find \"aa\", or \"ab\" (appearing in dictionary order, as you would observe on the rows of an excel sheet).\n\nMy website has a feature where you can instantly read any text given a numerical ID. The IDs could, for example, be ordered as follows:\n\n[![catalog of text with their respective IDs](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPJhU.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/JPJhU.png)\n\nWhere individual texts in the catalog are separated by red bars, and the blue numbers are their respective IDs.\n\nThis website happens to be a harbor for internet piracy. One user, for instance, discovered the numerical ID referring to the entire text of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*, and has distributed the ID to their friends so that they may read the novel at their leisure.\n\nIt's unclear to me where the copyright infringement occurs. Is it the website for \"storing\" every possible non\\-public domain text? Is it the user for finding and sharing a number that has apparent meaning to this website?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's not clear to me that your website is, *per se*, illegal. (Though good luck finding a webhost with a hard drive large enough to store it. *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* is roughly 38,000 characters. If I've done my calculations correctly, storing all of the strings of this length or shorter would require something like 1053760 GB of storage. Give or take.)\n\nThe main problem is in distributing the \"index\" of the string containing the text of *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*. This index is just the integer obtained by taking the entire text as a string and treating it as a number in base 26 (A \\= 1, B \\= 2, etc.) In other words, all of the information contained in the book is also contained in the index number, and in a relatively simple way.\n\nDistributing this number is therefore entirely equivalent to distributing the text; you don't need the website at all. It's entirely analogous to e\\-mailing the text to someone else; in that process, the text is transformed into a number (in binary, under a different encoding scheme) along the way. But you couldn't seriously argue in a court of law that you were not distributing the text, you were just telling a friend about a very large number.\n\nJust to back this up with some actual law citation: US copyright law gives the copyright owner the exclusive right to make and distribute copies of the work. And a \"copy\" is defined as follows:\n\n> \u201cCopies\u201d are material objects, other than phonorecords, in which a work is fixed by any method now known or later developed, and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device.\n\nIn other words, J.K. Rowling (and/or her publishers) have the exclusive rights to distribute that integer, since the work is \"fixed\" in it by its very nature, and since the work can be reproduced from it.",

The website itself, while impractical due to storage requirements, is not necessarily illegal per se. It's not actively targeting copyrighted works, but rather cataloging all possible letter sequences.\n\n2. Distributing the numerical ID for a copyrighted work (like Harry Potter) is equivalent to distributing the work itself. The ID contains all the information of the text in a coded form, which can be easily decoded using the website's system.\n\n3. US copyright law defines \"copies\" as material objects in which a work is fixed and from which it can be perceived or reproduced. The numerical ID fits this definition as the work can be reproduced from it using the website.\n\n4. The act of sharing the ID is analogous to sharing the actual text, just in a different form. It still violates the copyright owner's exclusive right to distribute copies of the work.\n\n5. The intent or knowledge of the website's creators is not the primary factor in determining copyright infringement in this case.\n\nThis question tests understanding of digital copyright concepts, the nature of information encoding, and the legal definition of copying and distributing copyrighted material in the digital age."

If you violate the first, which is the less likely option, you could be traced, located and prosecuted by your own country. If you violate the second, which is the more likely option, the target country would target you for extradition and prosecution. Depending on the amount of political power your target country has, this could result in you being shipped off to another country to face their courts, without the protection of your own country.\n\nIn other words, it could very well be illegal, though the specific sentence resulting from such a crime is far too specific to even attempt to address in the general case.",

The hacker's own country (Country A) may have laws against hacking that include foreign computers.\n2.

Option B is incorrect for the same reason in reverse - it doesn't consider Country A's potential laws.
