The landlord knew when I was moving out and I sent him a message confirming I had moved out and provided my new address. He never replied but almost 3 weeks latter he contacts me asking for the key to the front door. I can\u2019t recall what I did with it. I may still have it. I was under the impression we would meet to inspect the place to get my damage deposit back. Now he\u2019s saying that he will deduct the cost of changing the locks if I don\u2019t return the key by tomorrow.\n\nThis is ridiculous as clearly it hasn\u2019t been an issue for two weeks and in theory I could have made a copy if I wanted to sneak back in anyway.\n\nTo my understanding where I live it\u2019s the landlords responsibility to make time to do a move out inspection. I took pictures of the place to ensure I have evidence no damage was done. Also the landlord failed to do a written report on the move in inspection.\nDoes the landlord have anything on me?

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant moves out of a shared house where they had an individual lease. Three weeks after moving out, the landlord requests the return of the front door key. The tenant can't find the key. According to British Columbia tenancy laws, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The landlord cannot charge the tenant for not returning the key since they didn't schedule a move-out inspection.\n\nB) The tenant is not responsible for the key since they've already moved out and three weeks have passed.\n\nC) The landlord can charge the tenant a reasonable amount for replacing the lock or getting a new key cut.\n\nD) The tenant can refuse to pay any charges related to the key since they took pictures of the property condition upon moving out.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, the landlord has the right to charge the tenant for correcting the oversight of not returning the key. The landlord may need to change the lock or get a new key cut to ensure the property's security, and this falls under \"Claims for Damages or Loss\" in British Columbia tenancy laws. The purpose of compensation is to put the landlord in the same position as if the loss had not occurred. While it's true that the landlord should have scheduled a move-out inspection, this doesn't negate the tenant's responsibility to return all keys. The passage of time or the tenant's documentation of the property condition doesn't affect their obligation to return the key or compensate for its loss."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: To explain briefly \\- we moved to a new home a little over 3 years ago \\- our next door neighbors are government auditors. He is an auditor for the IRS, and she does something internal. On our first visit over to their house he made several jokes around the ideas of institutional abuses of power. We have never become friends, but have maintained a neighborly congeniality over the years. Over that time our main source of interaction has been them consistently and repeatedly asking my family and I for many favors. Ranging from the neighborly and entirely reasonable \"could you bring in our trashcans\", to asking for goods and services that my wife and I provide professionally. The most troubling in my eyes is that her work, which requires security clearance, and her immigration status, require her to have a yearly background check \\- since the year after we moved in, she has pressured my wife to be her listed social reference for that, and for the last several years, we've complied.\n\nGiven their status as auditors, we feel extremely pressured to comply with all of their requests, and are unsure of how to decline these regular and excessive requests.\n\nMy main question is \\- isn't there some sort of regulation or statute that should prevent them engaging in such behavior? Even when I was a nobody $15/hr shift area supervisor for a major shipping company back in the day, my training included a not insignificant portion on avoiding such impropriety.\n\nMy follow up question is \\- if there is something legally inappropriate in what they are doing \\- how and where can I go about reporting it?\n\nI have tried several internet searches, but thus far anything containing the terms \"Report\", \"IRS\", \"Agent\" and/or \"Auditor\" tend to be awash in what google deems more relevant information. I have searched, and looked a bit on the IRS website, as well as a few other government sites, but again most of my searches turn up what to do in the case that I am being audited. Thankfully we are not, but that is very much the nature of my concern.\n\nTo be clear \\- this is not a social question. I am not worried about maintaining a social relationship \\- I feel my family is being implicitly threatened and outrightly taken advantage of. I need to know if I have any legal recourse to stop it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is an [Ethics Handbook](https://www.nteu.org/%7E/media//Files/nteu/docs/public/letters/2019/irs-plain-talk-about-ethics-and-conduct) which IRS employees are required to comply with (turns out one of those duties is to comply with\nOGE Standards, Treasury Supplemental Standards, Treasury Employee Rules of Conduct, and OPM Employee Standards of Conduct, so this is not an exhaustive description). The above\\-described actions do not clearly constitute a breach of that duty as described in document 12011\\. They specifically identify a gift prohibition [5 CFR 2635\\.202(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=sp5.3.2635.b&rgn=div6), the\n\n> standards that prohibit an employee from soliciting or accepting any\n> gift from a prohibited source or any gift given because of the\n> employee's official position, unless the item is excluded from the\n> definition of a gift or falls within one of the exceptions set forth\n> in this subpart\n\nThis includes meals. However, that does not mean you cannot invite a person to dinner if they work for the IRS, because the gift is given out of friendship, and not because of the person's official position. A person (gift\\-giver) might be a prohibited person because for example they are \"doing business with or trying to do business with the Service\". But furthermore, \"a person is not considered a prohibited source just because he/she is a taxpayer\".\n\nThe regulations prohibit soliciting gifts in exchange for \"professional favors\": but I could wonder, if I don't do this, might they not seek my return and flag it for an audit? It's not clear exactly what discretion an IRS auditor has to trigger an audit, but [reportedly](http://www.boston-tax-lawyer.com/files/A%20Rare%20Look%20Inside%20the%20IRS%20Tax%20Audit%20Process%20in%202020%20-%20boston-tax-lawyer.com%20.pdf), audits are triggered by objectively verifiable facts such as a relationship with an existing audit or a reporting discrepancy. Or, there are [random\\-selection audits](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/irs-audits). [This was studied](https://www.gao.gov/assets/ggd-98-40.pdf) a couple decades ago. The computational details of random selection are not publically scrutinizable, so we cannot say whether it is literally impossible for an auditor to \"put his thumb on the scale\" for random audits.\n\nOne thing that is certain is that the auditor has the discretion to recommend assessing additional taxes, though of course they can't just make stuff up. But there is a [general conflict of interest rule](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=944c05eef4d1a8464853a918ee74fa53&mc=true&n=pt5.3.2635&r=PART&ty=HTML#sp5.3.2635.d) that would say that an agent should not be involved in an action with a close personal friend.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An IRS auditor who lives next door to you has been repeatedly asking for favors, including professional services and acting as a social reference for background checks. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ethical and legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The auditor is clearly violating IRS ethics rules by soliciting gifts and services from a neighbor.\n\nB) There is no ethical concern as long as the auditor does not directly audit your tax returns.\n\nC) The situation presents potential ethical issues, but does not necessarily constitute a clear violation of IRS ethics rules.\n\nD) The auditor's actions are completely acceptable as long as they are done out of friendship rather than professional interest.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The situation presents potential ethical concerns, but does not necessarily constitute a clear violation of IRS ethics rules. While IRS employees are bound by ethics guidelines that prohibit soliciting gifts from prohibited sources or because of their official position, neighbors are not automatically considered prohibited sources just for being taxpayers. The key ethical issues arise from the potential conflict of interest and the appearance of impropriety, especially given the auditor's position of power. However, the actions described do not clearly breach the ethics handbook guidelines. The correct approach would be to report the situation to the appropriate authorities for review, as it falls into a grey area that requires careful consideration of the specific circumstances and potential conflicts of interest."

She picks up one of Larry's bricks and throws it at the building. She is immediately arrested by one of President Donald J. Blumpf's heavily armed counter\\-revolutionary guards.\n\nShould Larry be arrested too?\n\n**Edit for clarity**: I'm asking if Larry, who dumped bricks on a sidewalk next to a government building with the intention of instigating a protest, committed any crime.

The guy who drops off the bricks hasn't done any of those things. Doing things that might result in a law violation is not a crime. [Conspiracy](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/22-1805a.html) to throw bricks is a crime, but this is not a conspiracy; it is not an [attempt](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/22-1803.html), nor is it a [threat to damage property](https://code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/22-1810.html). There is nothing in DC law that criminalizes this action. It could be a [federal crime to damage government property](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1361), so the brick thrower can be prosecuted. Under [18 USC 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2)\n\n> (a) Whoever commits an offense against the United States or aids,\n> abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is\n> punishable as a principal.\n> \n> \n> (b) Whoever willfully causes an act to be done which if directly\n> performed by him or another would be an offense against the United\n> States, is punishable as a principal.\n\nAiding and abetting is explained [here](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-2474-elements-aiding-and-abetting) (archived version, dunno if anything has changed).\n\n> 1.

That someone committed the underlying offense.\n\nA reasonable person could find that the underlying offense had been committed (throwing is not itself a crime, so I'll say that there was property damage); Larry's actions did assist in the commission of the crime; and Larry had the intent required (this is distinct from Curly, who was supposed to deliver a load of bricks to a construction site, and had the wrong address).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the scenario and legal information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Larry's potential criminal liability?\n\nA) Larry cannot be held criminally liable because he did not physically throw any bricks himself.\n\nB) Larry can be charged with conspiracy to damage government property, as his actions demonstrate a clear agreement with Alice to commit the offense.\n\nC) Larry can be prosecuted under federal law for aiding and abetting the damage of government property, even though he did not directly participate in throwing the brick.\n\nD) Larry is only guilty of littering for leaving the bricks on the sidewalk, but cannot be tied to any more serious offenses.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate based on the provided information. While Larry did not physically throw the brick, his actions could be interpreted as aiding and abetting under 18 USC 2. The scenario suggests that Larry had the specific intent to facilitate property damage (by providing the means), had the requisite intent of the underlying offense (wanting to instigate a revolution), assisted in the commission of the offense (by providing the bricks), and the underlying offense was committed by Alice. This meets the four elements of aiding and abetting as outlined in the Department of Justice guidelines.\n\nOption A is incorrect because aiding and abetting does not require direct participation. Option B is incorrect because there's no evidence of a clear agreement between Larry and Alice, ruling out conspiracy. Option D understates the potential severity of Larry's actions and ignores the federal aiding and abetting statute."

This requires a bit of background, so please bear with me.\n\nOur school district published just now, in the middle of school year, the following schedule for \"hybrid learning\" for elementary school kids:\n\n1. The kids will be separated into two cohorts; each cohort will attend school for 1\\.5 hour per day, 4 days a week. That's 6 hours per week of instruction, roughly same as used to be per day.\n2. During other hours the kids will have no guidance whatsoever, they are on their own. Basically homeschooling.\n3. If the parents opts for online learning, the kids will be pulled from their classes and grouped with other online learning kids from different schools and **different grades**. Meaning there will be zoom sessions with kids from different grades who don't know each other, far worse than what they have now.\n\nThis is all very shocking, especially since there are other school districts that are fully open and that the proposal is far worse than even the current situation. It's puzzling why would they do that; however, during discussions with other parents the following came up:\n\n\"I am in a nearby district with many teacher friends. This is what they tell me: **these terrible schedules and plans for reopening are to detour parents from wanting the reopening! It is arranged to fail, so\\-to\\-speak. The teacher unions are working against reopening (for some reason) even if some teachers want to resume classes.** I am not saying all teachers agree with the Union tactics, but many do.\nAll of these tactics are unconstitutional since education is paid for with our taxes. If parents come together and (respectfully/responsibly)  \n\ndemand the schools open, fully, the districts and unions will have to comply. There is no way around it.\"\n\nIf this is true, if some school districts, under the guidance of CTA, are indeed sabotaging re\\-opening with deliberately unworkable plans, how illegal is that? What options do parents have to fight them to rectify the problem in a timely manner? I understand from your answers to my previous question that class action suits take forever; what would be more effective methods to resolve this faster, within weeks if possible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you are interested in California law about education and labor unions, [this page](https://perb.ca.gov/laws-and-regulations/) lists numerous laws relevant to public jobs and labor unions, the first entry being about [collective bargaining and public schools](https://www.leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=GOV&division=4.&title=1.&part=&chapter=10.7.&article=4.). In general, it is legal for there to be a union which represents teachers and which negotiates with school boards on behalf of the members. No law requires them to put some other party's interest ahead of the interest of the employees. Metaphorical \"sabotaging\" as you indicate is a completely legal negotiating position for an employee.\n\nIt is not true that a band of parents respectfully demanding that the schools do a thing meant that the school district must comply. The *voters* which will include some subset of parents can have some influence, in that they can force out the current board at the next election, but the voters have no power over the unions. The board has the power to set district practices; the union has the power to call a strike within certain limits, which include unfair labor practices (endangering the lives of employees). The courts have the final say in determining whether a strike is legal or not (education strikes are legal in California, whereas they are technically illegal in Washington though we have them).",

These include Sections 2381, 2382, some of the subsections of 2386, 2388, 2389 and 2390\\.\n\nThey are:\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2381\\. **Treason** (\"Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; \u2009and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\")\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2382\\. **Misprision of treason** (i.e. failure to report knowledge of someone else's treason to an appropriate government official).\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2386\\. **Registration of certain organizations** (the guts of this offense's treason component are found in part B(1\\) which provides that: \"The following organizations shall be required to register with the Attorney General: Every organization subject to foreign control which engages in political activity; . . . \\[and] Every organization subject to foreign control which engages in civilian military activity\")\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2388\\. **Activities affecting armed forces during war**\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2389\\. **Recruiting for service against United States**\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2390\\. **Enlistment to serve against United States**\n\nNone of these are implicated by the question.\n\n### Sedition Offenses\n\nSedition offenses pertain to acts to overthrow or interfere with the government that do not have a clear nexus with a foreign country.These include Sections 2383, 2384, 2385, some of the subsections of 2386, and 2387\\. They are:\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2383\\. **Rebellion or insurrection** (see below)\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2384\\. **Seditious conspiracy** (see below)\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2385\\. **Advocating overthrow of Government**\n\n> Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches\n> the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or\n> destroying the government of the United States or the government of\n> any State, Territory, District or Possession thereof, or the\n> government of any political subdivision therein, by force or violence,\n> or by the assassination of any officer of any such government; \u2009or\n> \n> \n> Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such\n> government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells,\n> distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter\n> advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability,\n> or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the\n> United States by force or violence, or attempts to do so; \u2009or\n> \n> \n> Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group,\n> or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow\n> or destruction of any such government by force or violence; \u2009or\n> becomes or is a member of, or affiliates with, any such society,\n> group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof\\-\\-\n> \n> \n> Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty\n> years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United\n> States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next\n> following his conviction.\n> \n> \n> If two or more persons conspire to commit any offense named in this\n> section, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n> than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by\n> the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five\n> years next following his conviction.\n> \n> \n> As used in this section, the terms \u201corganizes\u201d and \u201corganize\u201d, with\n> respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include the\n> recruiting of new members, the forming of new units, and the\n> regrouping or expansion of existing clubs, classes, and other units of\n> such society, group, or assembly of persons.\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2386\\. **Registration of certain organizations** (the guts of this offense are found in part B(1\\) which provides that: \"The following organizations shall be required to register with the Attorney General: . . . . Every organization which engages both in civilian military activity and in political activity; . . . \u2009and Every organization, the purpose or aim of which, or one of the purposes or aims of which, is the establishment, control, conduct, seizure, or overthrow of a government or subdivision thereof by the use of force, violence, military measures, or threats of any one or more of the foregoing.\")\n\n18 USC \u00a7 2387\\. **Activities affecting armed forces generally** (in the pertinent part: \"Whoever, with intent to interfere with, impair, or influence the loyalty, morale, or discipline of the military or naval forces of the United States: (1\\) \u2002advises, counsels, urges, or in any manner causes or attempts to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval forces of the United States; \u2009or (2\\) \u2002distributes or attempts to distribute any written or printed matter which advises, counsels, or urges insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty by any member of the military or naval forces of the United States\\-\\- Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next following his conviction.\")\n\nBut **the sedition offenses potentially pertinent to the question are Sections 2383 and 2384\\.** They are as follows (emphasis added)\n\n> 18 USC \u00a7 2383\\. **Rebellion or insurrection**\n> \n> \n> **Whoever incites**, sets on foot, assists, or engages in **any rebellion or\n> insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws\n> thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto**, shall be fined under this\n> title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; \u2009and shall be\n> incapable of holding any office under the United States.\n\nAnd also (line breaks and line numbers inserted editorially for ease of reading and discussion purposes):\n\n> 18 USC \u00a72384\u2014**Seditious Conspiracy**\n> \n> \n> (1\\) If two or more persons\n> \n> \n> (2\\) in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction\n> of the United States,\n> \n> \n> (3\\) **conspire**\n> \n> \n> (4\\) to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the\n> United States, or to levy war against them,\n> \n> \n> (5\\) or to oppose by force the authority thereof,\n> \n> \n> (6\\) or **by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of\n> the United States,**\n> \n> \n> (7\\) or **by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United\n> States contrary to the authority thereof,**\n> \n> \n> (8\\) they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than\n> twenty years, or both.\n\nLines (1\\), (2\\) and (3\\) are elements of the offense which must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution in a criminal trial. In addition one of the four elements (4\\), (5\\), (6\\) or (7\\) must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution in a criminal trial. Elements (6\\) and (7\\) are particularly relevant to the question here.\n\nThe meaning of the words used in those elements is further defined in case law interpreting the statute in connection with the preparation of a jury instruction applying this statute to the facts presented at trial in a case (as well as lots of more general instructions on how a jury makes factual determinations). Only elements of the offense upon which some evidence has been presented by the prosecution are included in jury instructions.\n\nBut the definitions in a jury instruction which is operationally the law in any particular case doesn't get a whole lot more specific than the statutory language quoted above. Ultimately, any vagueness in that language has to be resolved unanimously by the jury (or by a judge in a trial to the court).\n\nIf these elements are established, the maximum punishment of (8\\) is authorized.\n\n### Caveat\n\nThe discretion of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence is not nearly as unfettered as it appears due to general provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code related to the exercise of sentencing discretion by a judge which incorporate by reference the federal sentencing guidelines adopted by an appointed federal government commission. These guidelines are advisory, rather than mandatory, but still have real effect. A judge has to calculated the guideline sentence, then articulate based upon judicial findings of fact any reason for deviating from the guideline sentencing range, and if this process is not followed, or if the findings of fact made aren't supported by the trial court record or don't support the conclusion reached, the sentence can be reversed for an abuse of discretion when the guideline sentence isn't followed, even if the maximum sentence authorized by this statute is not exceeded.",

Here's why:\n\n1. It involves \"two or more persons\" (as required by 18 USC \u00a7 2384).\n2. The act of forcibly entering the Capitol building could be interpreted as using \"force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States\" (the electoral college certification).\n3. The coordinated planning could be seen as a conspiracy.\n4. The intent to disrupt the electoral process could be viewed as an attempt to \"oppose by force the authority\" of the United States government.\n\nOption A doesn't involve force or entering the building, so it's less likely to violate the statutes. Option B, while potentially inflammatory, doesn't explicitly advocate for force or violence. Option D, similarly, doesn't directly call for violent action, which is a key component of these sedition statutes.\n\nIt's important to note that actual prosecution would depend on specific evidence and interpretation by law enforcement, prosecutors, and ultimately, a jury."

The bad weather doesn't help.\n* Candace shows up and performs for a small audience, fulfilling her part of the contract.\n* Downtown League realizes they cannot both pay Candace and have a successful fundraiser.\n* Downtown League does not pay Candace.\n* Candace sues for breach of contract and Downtown League doesn't dispute the facts above.\n* Candace sues in the jurisdiction where Downtown League is headquartered and where the event was held, to resolve any questions about jurisdiction.\n* The jury finds Downtown League to be in breach of contract.\n* The jury awards Candace $4,900 in damages on that breach of contract.\n\n---\n\nIs the jury just allowed to do that, effectively changing the price agreed to? What would happen next, if anything? Are there clear precedents/sources that bear on this? \n\nAssume a trial court with no relevant cap (i.e. the jury could have awarded $10K or more if they wanted to).\n\nThe essence of the question is that Bob/Candace fulfilled his/her obligations under the contract, and Alice/DL did not. The juries appear to have changed what Alice/DL's obligations are under the contract (e.g. because they're sympathetic to defendants Alice/DL or because the defendants have painted plaintiffs as selfish for even trying to enforce the contract, etc.) and want to give defendants better deals than they originally signed. Can they do that, and arbitrarily change the terms of the contract after the fact? If they do, what happens next (if anything)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're missing some pretty important details in describing the facts of this case.\n\nThe most important of which is: **What were the agreed terms upon which Alice obtained possession of the car prior to paying?**\n\nYour description says:\n\n> Alice takes the car and doesn't pay.\n\nIf that's literally true, then this case is both criminal theft and the tort of ***conversion*** \u2014 not breach of contract. Since the remainder of your question references a breach of contract, then I have to conclude that the fact as you stated it is not literally correct and there is some important missing detail about the terms upon which Alice was in possession of the car when she crashed it.\n\nSo, I will have to invent some scenarios that would fit two other facts you describe:\n\n1. The jury awarded Bob $5,000\\.\n2. The jury found Alice to be in breach of contract.\n\nThe following are the scenarios I can think of that would match the facts (as I understand them and speculated where important details are missing from the question).\n\n1. Maybe this is a small claims court and the damages are capped at $5,000? I never heard of a jury trial in small claims court but I guess it could be possible. Or maybe it was actually a judge and use of the term ***jury*** was careless or otherwise inaccurate?\n2. Maybe the terms under which Alice was in possession of the car when she crashed it put the parties in position where they effectively shared liability or risk of damage to the car? Like maybe Bob (or both parties) was/were required to carry insurance on the car while Alice was \"test driving\" it. I only use the term \"test driving\" as a placeholder for whatever she was doing with the car prior to paying for it which is left unclear by the question.\n3. Maybe Bob was found to have contributed to the breach of contract by something he did or didn't do. Similar to the above speculation about insurance. All this would be much easier to analyze if we knew how and under what terms Alice came to possess the car.\n4. Maybe there was only $5k of damage done to the car? Or, alternatively, the car was only found to be worth $5k and, for whatever reason (again, which we can not fully analyze given only the partial set of facts presented) the liquidated value of the car was the basis for the damage award and not the contracted price. (Consistent with @jimsug's comment.)\n5. I can easily imagine a scenario where Bob and Alice are close friends or family so the entire transaction is handled very loosely and informally and Bob let's Alice drive the vehicle while she is gathering the money to pay him. In this case, the jury might decide Bob shares the liability with Alice since the terms of the sales contract did not transfer the risk of liability to Alice during the time she was driving prior to payment.",

Option B is unlikely as jury trials are not typical in small claims court. Option D is possible but speculative without more information about the contract terms. \n\nOption C is the most likely explanation based on the given information. In breach of contract cases involving goods, damages are often based on the fair market value of the goods at the time of breach or loss, not necessarily the contract price. If the jury determined the car was worth $5,000 when it was destroyed, this would explain the award amount, even if it differs from the original contract price. This aligns with the principle of putting the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed, without providing a windfall."

The study suggests that pro se defendants may have had a higher rate of charge dismissals (16.9% for pro se vs. 6.1% for represented cases). However, it also indicates that juries seemed to convict pro se defendants more often than represented defendants (90% vs. 77.9%).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the data shows that acquittal rates were similar (\"with acquittals it's a wash\").\n\nOption C is incorrect because while pro se defendants might have done better in some areas (like charge dismissals), they didn't consistently perform better across all measures. In fact, they appeared to fare worse in jury convictions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the study did find some notable differences in outcomes, particularly in charge dismissal rates and jury conviction rates.\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret complex statistical information and draw accurate conclusions from data comparisons."

Although there is no regulation defining the general term \"cheese\", by its regulatory inclusion with cottage cheese, cheddar and myriad other standard cheeses, one can argue that cream cheese is a kind of cheese (assuming there is no state regulation or contractual term that pins down what counts as \"cheese\"). By way of contrast, labne, often co\\-labeled \"kefir cheese\" (sometimes equated with \"Greek yogurt\"), is not included in any federal regulation, and at least one brand does not identify itself as a \"type of yogurt\", leaving the monolingual consumer with only \"kefir cheese\" to tell you what it is. Supplying labne as an instance of cheese would be in shaky legal ground, not so with cottage and cream cheese.\n\nIf a person is contracted to supply \"cheese\" with no further specification, they can rely on ordinary usage of the term, and the evidence of ordinary usage would include cream cheese as a kind of cheese.

The FDA regulates cream cheese under 21 CFR Part 133, which covers \"cheese and related products.\" While there is no general definition of \"cheese\" provided by the FDA, cream cheese is included in this section along with other standard cheeses like cheddar and cottage cheese. This regulatory classification suggests that cream cheese is legally considered a type of cheese.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the FDA does regulate cream cheese as part of its cheese regulations.

And as soon as the fine is paid and the time is done, the individual repeats distribution of the same copyrighted work again, and repeats this process multiple times.\n\nIt'd be clear that because this person can continue doing this practically indefinitely due to their obscene wealth and willingness to endure punishment, it'd on the surface seem infeasible to prevent this person from continuing distribution due to copyright infringement having a codified punishment ceiling (to my knowledge a maximum of both 10 years in prison and $250,000 per offense, [source](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1852-copyright-infringement-penalties-17-usc-506a-and-18-usc-2319)).\n\nIn such a hypothetical case, do the law and/or the copyright owner actually have any teeth to stop this person from continuing to distribute, or can they just ride out the punishments and continue in perpetuity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you have sufficient grounds to fear that someone is about to infringe on one of your rights, you can go to court to obtain an injunction against that person. This is a court order to refrain from some particular action. In many cases, the point of this is just to have the legal debate on whether the anticipated action is actually legal or not before it happens rather than after. However, the punishment for violating the injunction is set by the relevant judge based on how important it is to dissuade the target from actually doing the thing, and how extensive the punishment needs to be in order to achieve this.\n\nAfter a few rounds of your guy doing the copyright infringement, getting an injunction against him doing it again should be quite straight\\-forward. And if he violates that, it would be reasonable to ask for a significantly higher fine next time, and then more, and more.\n\nInjunctions could also involve preparatory actions, eg prohibit the guy to even approach a computer, if this is deemed necessary to prevent reoffending.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have plans to branch out into private consulting in the field I am currently employed in. Several exisiting clients have approached me expressing strong interest in working with me privately, based on the help I have been able to provide ... especially when concerned they have not received the same level of service from their assigned resources. As this area of consulting could (and often does) take place in the evenings and weekends, and to be open and fair, I previously approached the head of my division to discuss the option of providing this service to those dissatisfied clients \\- offering to do so after normal business hours. The response I received was that to do so would give my employers ammunition to fire me. I have worked here 12 years and have witnessed the evidence of the spiteful nature of my employers: black\\-listed in company and surrounding community; refusal to provide recommendations; delay or \"creative processing\" of exit pay, etc. However, there are several people at our company who have private businesses in the specific field they are working in.\n\nI've considered restricting my consulting practice to those clients who can show they have no active business with the company where I work. Again, this consulting would take place outside my current work hours. I see this as a way around the \"conflict of interest\" issue, but am fearful my employers would still use this against me. Is this a subjective matter that can be handled according to the discretion of employers, or is there a legal line drawn here? What legal standing do I have in this situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't think anyone can provide you with specific information without knowing your jurisdiction and, importantly, your employment contract.\n\nFrom what you have written, it would seem entirely reasonable for the company to fire you \\- As you describe it (although, I think, not as you see it) you could be seen as directly competing with them \\- ie biting the hand that feeds you. (The question of how hard it would be to fire you would be dependent on where you are). Also, you might or might not have issues with restraint of trade \\- if your contract talks about one \\- as you are targetting customers who are doing business with your current employer.\n\nIts probably a very long shot, but could you broach the possibility of switching from an employee at your current position to one of a contractor ? If your company is receptive to the concept, you could sell it to them by negotiating terms of who you will not work for, or maybe giving them a cut of the money you receive from there ex\\-clients ?",

Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal and professional implications of this decision?\n\nA) The employee has a clear legal right to start a consulting business as long as it's conducted outside of work hours, regardless of their current employment contract.\n\nB) The employee should only consult for clients who have no active business with their current employer to avoid conflict of interest, which would protect them from any legal repercussions.\n\nC) The employee's best course of action would be to negotiate becoming a contractor for their current employer, potentially allowing them to pursue outside consulting opportunities with agreed-upon terms.\n\nD) The employee has no legal standing to start a consulting business while employed, as it would always be considered direct competition with their current employer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate based on the information provided. The answer suggests that negotiating a change from employee to contractor status could be a potential solution, allowing the individual to pursue consulting opportunities while addressing the employer's concerns. This approach could involve negotiating terms about which clients they can work with and potentially sharing revenue from former clients of the company. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the employee's legal right to start a consulting business depends on their employment contract and jurisdiction, which are not specified. \n\nOption B is not necessarily true, as even working with non-active clients of the current employer could still be seen as competition and potentially violate employment terms. \n\nOption D is too extreme, as the legality of starting a consulting business while employed depends on various factors including the employment contract and local laws, which are not fully detailed in the given information."

This is true in pretty much every country. You would **not** be able to reuse them lawfully without permission, unless an ***exception to copyright*** applies. If no exception applies, and you have not obtained permission, this is **copyright infringement**. In most cases copyright infringement is treated as a tort (a civil matter), not as a crime. This means that law enforcement generally will take no action and have no interest in such a situation.\n\nThe copyright owner could sue for infringement, and possibly collect money damages. In the US, statutory damages can be as high as $30,000, or up to $150,000 for \"wilful\" infringement, or as low as $750 (per work infringed). Or actual damages can be collected instead. In other countries, actual damages plus costs of suit are more likely, but the rule can be different in each country.\n\nThe possible exceptions to copyright vary significantly in different countries. In the US the major exception is **Fair use**. See [Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use? What if I don't make any money off it?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) and [I have a question about copyright. What should I read before I ask it?](https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/541/i-have-a-question-about-copyright-what-should-i-read-before-i-ask-it) for more information In general short snippets of code can probably be used under fair use, but substantial parts of the code or the displayed site are less likely to qualify as fair use.\n\n> And if it is illegal then why are there so many legal open source or paid software and applications for cloning of website like httrack, cyotek, webcopy etc?\n\nMost of these tools have legitimate uses, including learning how a site is constructed without distributing copied content; and cloning or partial cloning of a site **with permission**. Even if the tools were mostly used for unlawful copying, that might well not be a high priority for law enforcement, and cross\\-border law enforcement (which this in many cases would involve) is often much harder for the police and other authorities.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this practice?\n\nA) As long as the website owner generates revenue from the copied content, it's considered fair use and therefore legal.\n\nB) Using iframes or JavaScript to display content from other websites is always legal, regardless of permission.\n\nC) Copying substantial parts of other websites' content without permission is likely copyright infringement, but law enforcement generally won't take action unless the copyright owner sues.\n\nD) Website cloning tools are widely available, so using them to copy entire websites is legally acceptable.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, both the displayed content and the code of websites are protected by copyright. Using substantial parts of this content without permission is considered copyright infringement. However, copyright infringement is usually treated as a civil matter, not a criminal one. This means that law enforcement typically doesn't get involved unless the copyright owner decides to sue for damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because generating revenue doesn't automatically make the use of copyrighted content fair use or legal. In fact, profiting from others' content without permission can make the infringement more serious.\n\nOption B is false because the method of displaying the content (iframes, JavaScript, etc.) doesn't determine its legality. Permission is still required for substantial use of copyrighted content.\n\nOption D is also incorrect. While website cloning tools exist and have legitimate uses (like copying with permission or for personal learning), their existence doesn't make it legal to copy entire websites without authorization."

The altitude and purpose of the flight remain relevant factors in determining potential violations of privacy or property rights."

Non-compete clauses, also known as restraint of trade clauses, are not automatically enforceable. Their validity depends on whether they protect a legitimate business interest and are reasonable in scope and duration.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently, Google was fined under the GDPR by France's CNIL data protection authority. The authority found Google's processing of personal data for ads personalization lacked transparency, was inadequately informed to users and did not obtain valid consent. Specifically, CNIL [said](https://cnil.hosting.augure.com/Augure_CNIL/default.ashx?WCI=EmailViewer&id=acbcae1a-7f3d-4d9a-b072-01a18c6ae979)\n\n> Users are not able to fully understand the extent of the processing operations carried out by GOOGLE. But the processing operations are particularly massive and intrusive because of the number of services offered (about twenty), the amount and the nature of the data processed and combined. The restricted committee observes in particular that the purposes of processing are described in a too generic and vague manner, and so are the categories of data processed for these various purposes. Similarly, the information communicated is not clear enough so that the user can understand that the **legal basis of processing operations for the ads personalization is the consent, and not the legitimate interest of the company**.\n\nArticle 6\\.1 of the GDPR lays out the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. It seems the subparagraphs most relevant to Google's processing of personal data for the purposes of ads personalization are:\n\n> 6\\.1\\.(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;\n> \n> \n> 6\\.1\\.(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n> \n> \n> 6\\.1\\.(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nIt seems that the satisfaction of 6\\.1\\.(b) or 6\\.1\\.(f) would preclude the need for Google to obtain consent to process personal data. The terms under which Google processes personal data for the use of ads is stated in their [Ads Data Processing Terms](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/), with the types of personal data in scope for those terms listed [here](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/). If a user registers to Google, personally identifying their searches, are they not also agreeing to these terms, thereby satisfying 6\\.1\\.(b)?\n\nAdditionally, I don't fully understand why it is not a legitimate interest for Google, an ads\\-serving company, to process personal data for the purpose of ads personalization?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a large question, so I'll only put a spotlight on some misconceptions.\n\nWhy can't Google use legitimate interest instead of consent to serve ads?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA data controller such as Google must choose an appropriate legal basis per Art 6(1\\). But if the legal basis is consent, and the data subject declines or retracts consent, you can't do the processing anyway under legitimate interest instead. It seems that the issue is not that consent was an inappropriate legal basis, but that they decided to use consent and did not collect it properly (see below).\n\nHowever, Google's analysis that they need consent is likely correct. There is an good argument that a website can show first\\-party ads under a legitimate interest. Google does so as well. But the consent in question is for *ad personalization*, i.e. on creating detailed profiles on users in order to show more \u201crelevant\u201d ads. For that purpose, Google's legitimate interest would likely not outweigh the data subject's rights and freedoms (compare Art 6(1\\)(f)).\n\nWhy might consent be invalid?\n-----------------------------\n\nThe GDPR defines consent in Art 4(11\\) and specifies further requirements in Art 7\\. The EDPB has issued guidelines 05/2020 and previously WP259 on consent.\n\nA core requirement, in addition to the general Art 5(1\\)(a) transparency principle, is that consent is *specific and informed*. The user must be informed about the specific purpose for which consent is being asked, and must be able to control consent individually for each purpose. Additionally, consent requires an affirmative action, consent is never the default.\n\nThe EDPB recommends a layered information approach: in the first information layer, at the point where consent is being asked, the proposed processing activities are summarized. Full details (including all information per Art 13\\) are provided in a second layer that can be reached via a link. Consent will not be informed if the data subject is required to read the entire privacy policy first.\n\nHow does the CNIL see Google's approach to consent and transparency?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CNIL asserts that Google failed at every step of a layered information design and failed to obtain valid consent:\n\n* consent controls were hidden by default, i.e. there was no first information layer\n* consent controls were pre\\-checked, thus requiring opt\\-out. That's not how you ask for consent (but might have been alright if Google had used legitimate interest instead).\n* consent is all\\-or\\-nothing and not sufficiently granular\n* Google's main information layer is its privacy policy, but it is very general and does not provide sufficiently specific information\n* Google only provides specific information spread across further documents, often 5 or 6 levels deep\n\nCould Google rely on Art 6(1\\)(b) necessity for performance of a contract?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf a data subject enters a contract about Google using their data for ads, yes. Otherwise, no. But in practice, necessity for a contract is very similar to consent because the data subject can freely decide whether or not to enter a contract.\n\nEven when the legal basis is a contract, the data controller still has an obligation to provide transparent information. Depending on the structure of the contract, a layered approach could be used as well. However, the purposes of processing are ultimately given by the contents of the contract.\n\nWhat about the Ads Data Processing Terms?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThese terms are not part of the terms of service or the privacy policy that end users agree to. The ads terms are instead part of their B2B offerings.",

Specifically:\n\n- Consent controls were hidden by default, violating the principle of transparent and easily accessible consent mechanisms.\n- The consent was not sufficiently granular, instead being presented as an all-or-nothing choice.\n- Google's main privacy policy was too general and did not provide sufficiently specific information about data processing.\n- Detailed information was spread across multiple documents, often several levels deep, making it difficult for users to access.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Google did not properly implement a layered information approach. Option B is incorrect because pre-checked boxes are not a valid way to obtain consent under GDPR. Option C is incorrect because the consent options were not sufficiently granular. Option D correctly summarizes key issues identified by the CNIL in Google's consent process."

That language is supposed to reflect the parties' *intent* at the time the contract was entered.\n\nIt is only in the event of language confusion (provided that the [doctrine of *contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) is inapplicable or futile) that *extrinsic evidence* would be assessed in order to identify the parties' intent, and consequently their duties and obligations under the contract.\n\nOnce a breach of contract has been identified, the next issue consists of assessing the losses the injured party incurred as a result of that breach. If no losses arise from the breach, pleading and proving a claim of breach of contract is inconsequential.\n\n> is there an explanation for such a difference of approach in relation to MNDAs? (US vs. Europe)\n\nIt is not that US and Europe mandate different approaches to NDAs or to contracts in general. The terms and scope of contracts are largely a matter of each party's purposes and the ensuing negotiations toward reaching a mutual agreement.\n\nYou might want to inquire of your counterparty whether encompassing \"future agreements\" in that clause truly serves any concrete purpose. If it does not, then keeping that boilerplate in the contract seems pointless.\n\nFurthermore, many contracts contain a clause stating that the contract at issue \"*supersedes any prior and contemporaneous agreements between the parties*\". Accordingly, there is no impediment for a subsequent contract to render null and void the constraints regarding \"*future agreement\\[s]*\" that your counterparty seeks in the contract you currently analyze.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a contract dispute between a US company and a European company regarding the scope of a Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (MNDA), which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) US contract law always requires MNDAs to cover all future interactions between parties.\nB) European legal standards prohibit MNDAs from covering future agreements.\nC) The wording of the contract is crucial in determining its scope and enforceability, regardless of the parties' locations.\nD) Extrinsic evidence is always the primary factor in resolving MNDA disputes between international parties.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As stated in the passage, \"The wording or language of the contract is decisive toward ascertaining whether it has been breached.\" This principle applies regardless of whether the parties are from the US or Europe. The difference in approach mentioned in the question is not due to legal requirements in either jurisdiction, but rather reflects different preferences or negotiating positions of the parties involved. \n\nOption A is incorrect because US law does not mandate that MNDAs cover all future interactions. Option B is also incorrect, as European law does not prohibit MNDAs from covering future agreements. Option D is incorrect because extrinsic evidence is only considered if the contract language is unclear, and it's not always the primary factor in resolving disputes."

The hat definitely keeps the heat off my neck and shoulders. This year the heat is worse with 40\\+ degrees Celsius.\n\nAre companies allowed to insist on their dress code in extreme weather conditions or can an employee make reasonable adjustments for basic comfort and safety?\n\nI would like to know the laws according to both Canada and the USA.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I limit my answer to U.S. law.\n\n**The Right To Quit And Its Impact On Unemployment Benefits**\n\nFirst, absent narrow exceptions (e.g. soldiers), any employee can quit at any time, from work with a bad employer.\n\nNormally quitting forfeits a right to unemployment insurance payments, but if the employee can convince the unemployment eligibility hearing office that the conditions the employer established were so bad that there was a \"constructive discharge\" the employee will be treated as having been fired for purposes of unemployment insurance.\n\nThe employee can't get an advisory opinion on constructive discharge, however. The employee must act first and argue that there was a constructive discharge afterwards at risk of not getting any unemployment benefits if the employee loses.\n\n**Occupational Safety and Health Laws**\n\nSecond, the employer is obligated to follow workplace safety law. Outside the mining industry (which does not include oil and gas work), workplace safety regulations are primarily promulgated by OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) which is a subdivision of the federal department of Labor. Many states have a parallel state agency. (The mining industry is governed by MHSA a parallel and much more powerful body.)\n\nViolating workplace safety rules established by OSHA can result in the employer being fined and being required to correct the situation going forward, although the amounts of the fine even taken together with worker's compensation packages, are often far less than the amount of liability that the employer would have in a third\\-party negligence lawsuit. The government and not the employee receives the fine paid if one is imposed.\n\nAlso, OSHA is vastly understaffed and routinely ignores worker complaints out of sheer lack of manpower, since it is responsible for all safety issues for 98%\\+ of all employees in the entire United States.\n\nOSHA has protocols related to requirements for employees working in extreme heat that are discussed [here](https://www.osha.gov/heat/heat-index). In particular, OSHA states that:\n\n> Washington, Minnesota, and California have specific laws governing\n> occupational heat exposure. Federal OSHA has a General Duty Clause\n> (Section 5[a](https://www.osha.gov/heat/heat-index) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970\\)\n> that requires employers to provide a place of employment that is \u201cfree\n> from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death\n> or serious physical harm to employees.\u201d The OSHA Technical Manual\n> Chapter on Heat Stress establishes that OSHA uses WBGT to determine if\n> a heat hazard was present.\n\nThus, outside those three states, rather than having detailed requirements in a regulation, OSHA has general suggestions and provides a framework for evaluating heat related safety and occupational illness issues that gets evaluated on a case by case basis if OSHA asserts that an employer has violated these general safety requirements, which will be resolved in a hearing, if necessary, if a citation issued by OSHA on this basis is issued by OSHA and disputed by the employer.\n\n**Worker's Compensation**\n\nThird, the employer has liability without regard to fault for all work related injuries, illness and deaths under worker's compensation law. The employer has liability even if the employer didn't violate any OSHA regulations or standards.\n\nBut, the recovery allowed is much more meager than it would be between strangers suing each other for negligence. It is largely limited to lost wages, medical expenses, and funeral expenses, although if a deceased worker has dependents, their dependent survivors are also entitled to worker's compensation lost income benefits.\n\nThe existence of worker's compensation coverage, however, bars an employee from bringing a lawsuit other than a worker's compensation claim against the employer, however.\n\n**Collective Bargaining Rights Of Unionized Workers**\n\nFourth, in a unionized workplace, the union could raise a grievance with the employer under the collective bargaining agreement governing the workplace which will universally require the employer to follow safety rules.\n\nIf there is a dispute, these disputes are typically referred to an arbitrator in union\\-management arbitration. The arbitrator has considerable freedom to fashion remedies if the arbitrator feels that the safety rules were not followed. Neither side can appeal the arbitrator's ruling.\n\nIf the employer does not follow an order from an arbitrator, this is converted to a court order at an ordinary court with jurisdiction over the employer and the court will make the arbitrator's order a court order which may be enforced under pain of contempt of court sanctions (including incarceration or punitive fines).",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their rights and options?\n\nA) The employee can file a complaint with OSHA, who will immediately inspect the workplace and issue fines if violations are found.\n\nB) The employee can refuse to work in these conditions without fear of losing unemployment benefits, as it would be considered constructive discharge.\n\nC) The employee can sue their employer directly for negligence if they suffer heat-related illness or injury on the job.\n\nD) The employee can quit their job and may be eligible for unemployment benefits if they can prove the working conditions were so severe as to constitute constructive discharge.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. An employee can quit their job at any time, and if they can convince the unemployment eligibility hearing office that the working conditions were so severe as to constitute a \"constructive discharge,\" they may be eligible for unemployment benefits. This is a risk, however, as the employee must quit first and argue for constructive discharge afterwards, with no guarantee of success.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while an employee can file a complaint with OSHA, the agency is understaffed and may not respond immediately or at all. OSHA does not automatically issue fines upon inspection.\n\nOption B is incorrect because refusing to work does not guarantee unemployment benefits. The employee must actually quit and then prove constructive discharge.\n\nOption C is incorrect because employees generally cannot sue their employers directly for negligence due to workplace injuries. Such incidents are typically covered under workers' compensation laws, which bar direct lawsuits against the employer in exchange for no-fault coverage of work-related injuries and illnesses."

What is the most likely legal situation regarding this reverse mortgage?\n\nA) The family can easily void the reverse mortgage due to the length of time since the father-in-law's death.\nB) The family has a strong case to nullify the reverse mortgage if they can prove they would have stopped him from taking it out.\nC) The reverse mortgage is likely legally binding, and the family's main option is to repay the loan.\nD) The family can automatically transfer the reverse mortgage to another family member to avoid repayment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

If the police officers are satisfied by the witness accounts, or have some reason to think viewing surveillance recording wouldn't be useful they don't have to, either by law or policy.\n\nNote that ordinarily, police won't consider a physical altercation between two grown men a serious enough crime to warrant charges. If there was no serious injury and there wasn't a large discrepancy between the strength of the two men, police will often decline to lay charges even when they believe the evidence would sustain them. In this case the police may have decided it wasn't worth investigating further because it wasn't worth wasting the time of an already overloaded court system.\n\nThe victim here still has legal options despite the lack action by the police.

Or it can be as easy as clicking a button and closing/pausing your \\[...] card.\n\nSource: <https://twitter.com/PrivacyHQ/status/1083048623678672900>\n\nSo the way this works is that you have one virtual card per merchant/transaction and you can easily disable the card from the application (e.g. you sign up for a Netflix free trial and disable the card straight away).\n\nMy understanding is that if you fail to pay the company they can sue you for failure to pay and still demand the money in question. The one thing I can imagine affecting this is whether the company continued to provide the service in question (e.g. in the case of Netflix they will block your account when the payment fails), but I can't think of any legal basis how that would make a difference (as you still have a legal agreement to pay).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You owe money if there is a contract obliging you to pay. Whether you receive what you pay for (e.g. services) only affects your stance when suing for non\\-performance/damages; your obligation to pay still stands until the court decides it does not (or there is a mutual agreement to discharge the contract).\n\nIt is irrelevant whether the original payment method still works or not. If it does not but you still owe money \u2014 you have to pay.\n\nThe ability to turn the credit card off is just a handy feature. It does not affect your contractual obligations in any way except for when the terms explicitly provide for it (like automatic cancelling subscription when payment method fails).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John signs up for a streaming service using a virtual credit card from a disposable credit card company. He immediately disables the card after signing up for a free trial. When the free trial ends, the streaming service attempts to charge John's disabled card but fails. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal obligations?\n\nA) John is not legally obligated to pay because he disabled the credit card, effectively canceling the service.\n\nB) John is only obligated to pay if the streaming service continues to provide access after the failed payment attempt.\n\nC) John is legally obligated to pay for the service based on the original agreement, regardless of the card's status.\n\nD) John's obligation to pay depends on whether the streaming service explicitly states that a failed payment results in automatic cancellation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. John's legal obligation to pay is based on the contract he entered into when signing up for the service, not on the status of his payment method. Disabling the virtual credit card does not automatically cancel his contractual obligations. The ability to turn off the credit card is merely a feature and does not affect the legal agreement between John and the streaming service. Even if the service stops providing access due to failed payment, John still owes money for the agreed-upon period unless the contract specifically states otherwise or both parties mutually agree to terminate the contract. The status of the payment method (in this case, the disabled virtual credit card) does not negate the underlying financial obligation created by the initial agreement."

For minor offenses where a fine is paid or a short suspended sentence is given, and if it's the person's only conviction, it typically won't appear on the Certificate of Good Conduct.

It's a complex, multi\\-faceted case, but at the heart of the indictment, is a bribery charge involving \"positive news coverage\" in exchange for lucrative regulatory concessions. \n\nThe indictment purports that Netanyahu offered Shaul Elovitch, a wealthy Israeli businessman, regulatory concessions for his telecom company worth 500 million dollars in exchange for \"positive news coverage\" from Elovitch's other media companies. \n\nHowever, members of Netanyahu's government blasted Israel's Attorney General for bringing forth bribery charges that they call \"impossible\" and \"unprecedented in the history of western democracy.\" They claim that \"positive news coverage\" can't be considered a \"thing of value\" and has never been brought forth as such in the US or other similar legal systems. Is that an accurate assessment? If the Israeli prosecution can show that said \"positive news coverage\" was systemic, far\\-reaching, and out of character for the media companies involved, can that constitute \"a thing of value\" even though no money was actually exchanged? The prosecution will claim as part of their case that Netanyahu is obsessed with his image in the media and that in 2020, \"positive media coverage\" can and does amount to a \"thing of value.\" \n\nHas such a case ever been prosecuted in the U.S. or any other western democracy? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can \u201cpositive news coverage\u201d be considered a \u201cthing of value\u201d in a bribery case?\n\nYes. Note that a narrow, specific holding that \"*positive news coverage*\" is a *thing of value* is unnecessary because it is implied by the general notion of *thing of value* as reflected in US case law. \n\nSeveral \\[U.S.] court opinions, such as [*U.S. v. Hernandez*, 795 F.3d 1159, 1164\\-5 (2015\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20150803063), cite the following from the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines from year 2010:\n\n> Thing of value means **anything of valuable consideration**. For example, in a case involving the bartering of child pornographic material, the thing of value is the child pornographic material received in exchange for other child pornographic material bartered in consideration for the material received.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nA subsequent version of the USSG incorporated the notion of \"*agreed \\[...] exchange \\[...] **for the specific purpose** of obtaining something of valuable consideration from that other person*\". See [*U.S. v. Hoppy*, (U.S. Dist., M.D. Pennsylvania, Mar. 2018\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20180330702) (emphasis added).\n\nApropos of your [remark](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49609/can-positive-news-coverage-be-considered-a-thing-of-value-in-a-bribery-case#comment97161_49609) (\"*My question is mainly focused on trying to understand how \"thing of value\" is defined in the US and other western democracies*\"), [*Mulhall v.

Roth, 333 F.2d 450, 453 (2d Cir.1964\\) \\[...]. It recommended that common sense should inform determinations of whether an improper benefit has been conferred.\n\n(quotation marks in original, emphasis added)\n\nIn the context of your question, Netanyahu's alleged offer to Elovitch reflects Netanhayu's *desire* to have the positive news coverage. That *desire* is precisely what gives that \"positive news coverage\" the status of *thing of value*, at least under the circumstances you describe. Consequently, in light of the *Mulhall* opinion, it seems inaccurate and unavailing for Netanyahu's government to portray as \"impossible\" that the positive news coverage be treated as *thing of value* in the alleged offer.\n\nAdditionally, see [*People v. Campos*, 351 P.3d 553, 556 (2016\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/incoco20150423066) (\"*The primary purpose of obtaining employment is to receive the financial benefit of payment for labor performed*\"). It is clear that a politician's purpose of positive news coverage is to be elected for, appointed to, or remain in, public office. Thus, the motive for procuring positive news coverage \\[in exchange for lucrative regulatory concessions] easily translates to that politician's pursuit of a financial benefit that results from being in public office.\n\nNetanyahu's alleged offer fits the meaning of *quid pro quo*, which in turn is material for a finding of bribery. [*U.S. v. Kemp*, 500 F.3d 257, 281 (2007\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/2007757500f3d2571753) reads:\n\n> The Supreme Court has explained, in interpreting the federal bribery and gratuity statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, that bribery requires a quid pro quo, which includes an \"intent `to influence' an official act or`to be influenced' in an official act.\"\n\nAnd the [*U.S. v.v Jennings*, 160 F.3d 1006, 1014 (4th. Cir. 1998\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19981166160f3d100611014) reads:\n\n> The quid pro quo requirement is satisfied so long as the evidence shows a \"course of conduct of favors and gifts flowing to a public official in exchange for a pattern of official actions favorable to the donor.\n\n(internal quotation omitted)\n\n> Has it ever been prosecuted in the US before?\n\nBriberies involving a *thing of value* have been prosecuted in the US, although there appear to be no rulings where the *thing of value* in a prosecution consisted of \\-\\-or was explicitly said to consist of\\-\\- \"positive news coverage\".\n\nThat being said, it seems unclear and doubtful how the accused party(\\-ies) in your question could legitimately overcome the notions from US case law and construe the alleged consideration (i.e., the sought coverage) as \"*not a thing of value*\".",

According to the U.S. case law cited, particularly in Mulhall v. Unite Here Local 355, the Second Circuit explained that \"Value is usually set by the desire to have the 'thing' and depends upon the individual and the circumstances.\" The court recommended that common sense should inform determinations of whether an improper benefit has been conferred. This interpretation allows for a broad understanding of \"thing of value\" that can include intangible benefits like positive news coverage, as long as it is desired by the recipient and makes sense in the context of the case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because monetary exchange is not required for something to be considered a \"thing of value\" in bribery cases. Option B is too restrictive and doesn't align with the broader interpretation provided in case law. Option D is also incorrect, as it unnecessarily limits the application of \"thing of value\" to only previously prosecuted scenarios, which would prevent the law from addressing new forms of bribery."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An educational website wants to include short clips of popular songs in their online lessons about music history. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding copyright and fair use in this scenario?\n\nA) It's permissible to use up to 30 seconds of any song for educational purposes without seeking permission.\n\nB) As long as the website is non-profit, they can use any length of song clips under fair use.\n\nC) The website would likely need to obtain licenses or permissions to use even short clips of copyrighted songs.\n\nD) If the website transforms the music by adding commentary, they can use any length of song without permission.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, even for educational purposes, using copyrighted music without permission is likely not protected under fair use. Several factors make this use problematic:\n\n1. While educational, if the website is for-profit, it doesn't meet the non-profit educational use criterion that might favor fair use.\n2. There's an existing market for licensing music rights, so using the music without permission could affect this market.\n3. Simply copying portions of songs without transformation fails the \"transformativeness\" test for fair use.\n4. Even short clips (possibly around 10 seconds) could be considered substantial copying in music.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no set \"safe\" duration for using copyrighted music without permission. Option B is wrong because non-profit status alone doesn't guarantee fair use protection. Option D is incorrect because while transformation (like adding commentary) can support a fair use argument, it doesn't automatically allow use of any length of copyrighted material without permission. The safest approach would be to obtain proper licenses or permissions for using the music clips."

They instruct university security to ban Billy. Henceforth, Billy is promptly escorted off premises every time he tries to attend a meeting. \n\nNow, my questions are very broad so please do not focus on the specifics of this example. \n\n(1\\) How exactly does the \"rubber meet the road\" when it comes to statutes, and laws more generally? The law is clear that all meetings are open, but how is the precise enforcement of these statutes determined? \n\nIt would make sense that a large townhall\\-esque meeting should be open, but is a meeting between two lower\\-level employees covered under the law? Sure, it can get definitional, but the broader question would be how are those definitions determined. \n\n(2\\) How could Billy determine the nuances of how the statute is enforced? A plain reading of the state statute is easily accessible online and clearly states that Billy is allowed to attend public meetings. How could Billy research how the statute is currently interpreted by the powers that be and know exactly what it means in practice? \n\n(3\\) Assuming some \"workable arrangement\" or \"agreed interpretation\" of the open meetings statute is in place (for example, let's say meetings are public if and only if they have more than three officially scheduled attendees including the organizer), under what circumstances and how could this be changed? Let's say Billy wants to re\\-define meetings as any scheduled conversation between two or people. Can Billy do this?\n\n(4\\) What if Billy is completely in the right and is technically allowed at any meeting he wishes to attend, but university officials have no respect for the law. They kick him out every time. What recourse does Billy have? Could Billy call police on security when they try to kick him out? What if the police are friendly with the security guys and laugh at Billy like everyone else? Who does Billy call then? \n\n(5\\) Let's say Billy is sharp, hard\\-working and has the loving support of family and friends. Does Billy have a fighting chance to have any real impact at his alma mater to change how things are done? Consider the cases in questions 3 and 4: one where he is in the right, and the other where he wants to change the law or how the law is interpreted. Broadly speaking, how effective could a \"one\\-man show\" be against a powerful institution with wide network of support in an area?\n\nI know these are broad and impractical so thank you to anyone who spends time answering them!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you believe that you have a right that someone else is infringing you go to court to seek an order for them to stop infringing it. If such an order is given then, if they continue to infringe it, they are in contempt of court and a warrant can be issued for their arrest.\n\nAs part of the process, they will be given an opportunity to argue that you don't have the right that you think you do and, even if you do, what they are doing doesn't infringe it or is reasonable in the circumstances. The court will look at your evidence and their evidence and the statute and the other judgements in this area of the law and decide who is right.",

What is the most appropriate first step for Billy to take to assert his perceived rights?\n\nA) Call the police every time he is removed from a meeting\nB) File a lawsuit against the university without any prior communication\nC) Seek a court order to stop the university from removing him from meetings\nD) Organize public protests outside the university buildings\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate first step for Billy is to seek a court order to stop the university from removing him from meetings. This aligns with the information provided that states, \"If you believe that you have a right that someone else is infringing you go to court to seek an order for them to stop infringing it.\" \n\nOption A (calling the police) is not the best first step, as it doesn't address the underlying legal issue and may not be effective if local law enforcement is unresponsive.\n\nOption B (filing a lawsuit without prior communication) is premature and doesn't follow the proper legal procedure outlined in the information.\n\nOption C is the correct answer because it follows the proper legal channel to assert Billy's perceived rights and allows for a formal legal interpretation of the open-meetings law.\n\nOption D (organizing protests) may raise awareness but doesn't directly address the legal issue or seek a formal resolution through the court system."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A student researcher, Sarah, is conducting a study on university domain registrations. She uses the `whois` command to look up information for several .edu domains, including mit.edu. After her first query, she notices the terms of service (ToS) stating that the information should not be used for unsolicited commercial advertising. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal implications of Sarah's actions?\n\nA) Sarah is legally bound by the ToS for all her queries, including the first one, because the information is considered part of a contract.\n\nB) Sarah is not legally bound by the ToS for any of her queries because she's using the information for academic research, not commercial purposes.\n\nC) Sarah is legally bound by the ToS only for her queries after the first one, as she had the opportunity to read the terms for subsequent queries.\n\nD) Sarah is legally bound by the ToS for all her queries because using the `whois` command implies acceptance of the terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, the terms of service cannot be binding on the first request because the user has not had a chance to read them yet. For subsequent requests, however, the user has had the opportunity to read the terms and is therefore bound by them. This aligns with the principle that one cannot agree to something they don't know about, but can be bound by terms once they've had the chance to review them.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the first query cannot be bound by terms the user hasn't seen yet. Option B is incorrect because the purpose of the queries (academic vs. commercial) doesn't affect the binding nature of the terms once they're known. Option D is incorrect because merely using the command doesn't imply acceptance of unknown terms.\n\nIt's worth noting that while the terms are binding for subsequent queries, the prohibition on using the information for unsolicited commercial advertising is generally illegal anyway, regardless of these specific terms."

According to the information provided, the ownership of a wrecked airplane doesn't automatically change due to the crash. The original owner (in this case, likely the airline) retains ownership of the wreckage, similar to how crashing a car doesn't change its ownership.

It was an article which was published by a news publication called The Poughkeepsie Journal, which is located in a town called Poughkeepsie New York. They published a name in an article back in 2011 talking about a list of people set to graduate from a high school that year. I never attended the graduation ceremony because I was the victim of bullying, abuse and harassment by several teachers I had as a result of my disability, and being that I wasn't sure I'd graduate I instead opted to pick up my diploma. Although this article was published some years ago, at times it comes back to haunt me, as at the time the article was published it was under a name I no longer use. I did not give consent for that name to be published, and since the publishing of that article I had experienced harassment and bullying. Consequently, I moved away shortly afterwards and changed my name. I had contacted the Poughkeepsie Journal and asked very politely to remove that name from that article and stated my case in a clear, kind and professional manner. The editor, however, was very rude and quite egotistical about the whole ordeal. It ended with him telling me to contact the school district responsible for sending that information to the Poughkeepsie Journal. Upon contacting the school district, they told me there was nothing they could do at this point and that it didn't matter if I'd given consent or not, as they send photos to the newspaper and those photos contain names of those who either graduated or were set to graduate, and that name is in the article with all the others. Is there anyone who could help me find a pro bono attorney to get that info removed from the internet? The article no longer appears on the original website of the poughkeepsie journal, instead it appears as an archived version on the website newspapers.com. That archived link is what is making the rounds on all the search engines and I'm trying to remove that link. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If a newspaper publishes an article that is actually defamatory (i.e. publishes false statements that cause you quantifiable harm), and you successfully sue the publisher, you might get a court order requiring them to retract the statements or remove them from their web page. An archive like newspapers.com isn't making false statements, it is making true statements about what the Poughkeepsie Journal published. At any rate, you name is not defamatory, it is (or was) a fact.",

This means the published statements must be false and cause quantifiable harm to the individual. Simply being uncomfortable with factual information or not having given explicit consent for publication are not sufficient grounds for removal. Additionally, archival websites that accurately reproduce previously published information are not typically liable for the content. The key factors are the falsity of the information and the demonstrable harm caused by its publication."

I am not a law expert but try to maintain a good level of understanding of laws related to technology. I think I have a good understanding of copyright in technology, but in this case there are a few things I can't figure out.\n\nI have been asked to build a content distribution platform, quite similar to how Spotify works, but on a business to business level. It is geared towards businesses opened to the public, typically stores. The company operates in various European countries.\n\nIt works like so: the company sources some audio content, mostly through online platforms like iTunes, buying the content, according to my understanding with a normal user account. Then they distribute the audio files to their customers premises (they can be stored locally on various platforms like a computer or a mobile phone). And then the customer plays that audio content on their premises, to the public. The service is very similar to a radio or Spotify being played in a store for the customers to enjoy.\n\nThe company assures me they are in their full right and have been operating like that for some time now. They argue that the store that is diffusing music is the one legally responsible before their respective country's copyright collection society.\n\nCan the company really put all the legal burden on the ones diffusing the copyrighted content?\nI thought the distribution was also subjected to licensing. For instance, I thought platforms like Spotify need to get the license from the record companies before they start distributing copyrighted content. I thought commercial radios also needed that. \n\nWhat makes me wonder is also the fact that the Apple store refuses to allow the application in their store due to legal issues. They assume that the company does not have the authorization from the third parties to let users download their content. I have no idea how Apple knows that Spotify has the rights from the third parties to allow the download of audio files and not the company since they did not ask to see the licenses first. But anyway, it makes me think some legal work must be done before distributing the content.\n\nI would like to understand the legal aspect of each step (getting the content, distributing it and diffusing it). \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, copyright includes the right to make copies of protected content, the right to distribute those copies, and also the right to publicly perform. Those rights are all initially vested in the creator of the copyrighted content, but may be contractually assigned, sold, or licensed separately. \n\nWhen physical copies, such as books or CDs or DVDs, are lawfully sold, the purchaser has the right to resell or rent those copies without further permission. This is know as the *First Sale Doctrine* that the copyright owner has the right to control the copies only until their first sale. \n\nHowever, electronic copies are generally not **sold** at all, but rather are licensed. This avoids the First sale rule, and allows the copyright owner to control the entire distribution sequence, usually though a chain of contracts each granting appropriate license rights. \n\nSo the publisher would be authorized by the copyright holder to create copies, and the publisher would license distributors, and the retail customers would be licensed in turn by the distributors, or perhaps directly by the copyright holder. \n\nI suspect that the companies you describe actually have some sort of license agreement with the copyright holder, possibly through the publisher. The retail stores license the right to perform through the performance societies (aka collection societies) or possibly directly with the copyright holders. If in fact the companies described in the question have no license agreement with the original copyright holder (or an authorized agent), then it seems to me that they would be infringing copyright. But given how much money is involved at that level of the distribution chain, I would think that a suit would already have been filed on such grounds if there was not a valid agreement. I cannot, however, know what agreements any particular company has or has not made.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal responsibilities in this scenario?\n\nA) The company distributing the music files bears no legal responsibility, as all copyright liability falls solely on the stores playing the music.\n\nB) The company needs licenses from copyright holders to distribute the music, while the stores need separate licenses to publicly perform the music.\n\nC) Purchasing music from platforms like iTunes gives the company full rights to redistribute and allow public performance without additional licenses.\n\nD) The stores playing the music are solely responsible for obtaining performance licenses, while the distributing company has no copyright obligations.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In copyright law, distribution and public performance are separate rights that typically require distinct licenses. The company distributing digital music files would need appropriate licenses from copyright holders or their representatives to legally distribute the content. Meanwhile, the stores playing the music publicly would need separate licenses (often obtained through performance rights organizations) to legally perform the music in their establishments. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the distributing company does have legal responsibilities regarding copyright. \n\nOption C is false because purchasing music from consumer platforms like iTunes does not grant redistribution or public performance rights. \n\nOption D is partially true regarding the stores' need for performance licenses, but incorrect in stating the distributing company has no obligations.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complexities of copyright law in digital distribution and public performance contexts."

Tenant signed 2 year lease and paid rent on time for 8 months.\n2. Tenant gave 60 day notice that they would be moving out to be closer with family, claiming that a member of their family had attempted suicide (but fortunately failed in that attempt).\n3. Landlord/Tenant later agreed to terms in a lease addendum stating that Landlord would keep security deposit and last month's rent, as well as an additional payment equal to 1 month's rent.\n4. Both parties signed addendum \\- agreed that all terms contained within addendum (\\#3 above) must be met **to be released from original lease agreement.**\n5. Tenant sent screen shot of final payment from their bank, but **payment was never received.**\n6. Tenant has moved out.\n\n**QUESTIONS**\n\n1. Is an eviction necessary?\n2. Is sending the screenshot FRAUD given that the payment was never received?\n3. What are the next steps available to a Landlord?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Eviction is the legal process of removing a tenant from a premise, which can be necessary because the landlord cannot legally throw the tenant out. (The sheriff does it, under orders from a court.) When the tenant has quit the premise, the landlord's remaining concern is (potentially) a lawsuit for breach of contract \u2013 if the landlord wants money, they will need to get a court order.\n\nThe landlord can sue for the entire amount, the remainder of 2 years' rent minus whatever has been paid, but obviously the tenant has available the option of paying less than that to be in compliance with their lease obligation. Still, unless the tenant simply had a technical glitch and did intend to pay the remaining month's rent, it may be necessary to take the matter to court. The tenant might be motivated by the fact that [\u00a783\\.48 of the landlord\\-tenant law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0083/0083.html) awards costs to the winner in the legal proceeding. \u00a783\\.56 states the formal process of terminating the agreement, in particular para 3 regarding non\\-payment and the notice that has to be given. This also reminds you of the obligation under \u00a783\\.49(3\\) regarding the return of the deposit.\n\nFinally, \u00a783\\.595 is specifically about how the landlord gets the rent owed. Theoretically, the added extra month rent could be subsumed under the concept of \"liquidated damages\", but there has to be certain wording in the agreement, so the landlord will have to go to court if he wants the full three months.",

The landlord can sue for the entire amount of the remaining rent for the 2-year lease period, minus what has already been paid. However, the tenant has the option to pay less to comply with their lease obligation. The court may consider the circumstances and the lease addendum when determining the final amount owed. Additionally, \u00a783.595 of Florida law specifically addresses how landlords can recover owed rent, which may impact the final judgment. Options A and D are incorrect as eviction is not necessary when the tenant has already moved out, and there's no mandatory mediation requirement mentioned. Option B is too limited, as the landlord can potentially sue for more than just the additional month's rent agreed upon in the addendum."

It seems to me that this could cause confusion. Does either company have grounds to sue the other for trademark infringement?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It wouldn't be frivolous, but I doubt either party could prevail in a trademark suit\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe test to use for trademark infringement is a set of factors known as the Lapp factors.\n\nPer [A\\&H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237 F.3d 198 (3rd Cir. 2000\\)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/237/198/564897/):\n\n> \\[L]ikelihood of confusion for both competing and noncompeting goods should be tested with reference to the following:\n> \n> \n> 1. the degree of similarity between the owner's mark and the alleged infringing mark;\n> 2. the strength of the owner's mark;\n> 3. the price of the goods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected of consumers when making a purchase;\n> 4. the length of time the defendant has used the mark without evidence of actual confusion arising;\n> 5. the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark;\n> 6. the evidence of actual confusion;\n> 7. whether the goods, competing or not competing, are marketed through the same channels of trade and advertised through the same media;\n> 8. the extent to which the targets of the parties' sales efforts are the same;\n> 9. the relationship of the goods in the minds of consumers, whether because of the near\\-identity of the products, the similarity of function, or other factors;\n> 10. other facts suggesting that the consuming public might expect the prior owner to manufacture both products, or expect the prior owner to manufacture a product in the defendant's market, or expect that the prior owner is likely to expand into the defendant's market.\n\nLet's take a few of these.\n\n> 1. the degree of similarity between the owner's mark and the alleged infringing mark\n\nLow, but non\\-zero. They're facially completely dissimilar: the words sound and look nothing alike, and their logos are completely different as well in both design and color. The only similarity is that they are both parts of Nikola Tesla's name. The USPTO gives as an [example](https://www.uspto.gov/trademark/additional-guidance-and-resources/possible-grounds-refusal-mark) \"LUPO\" and \"WOLF\" being similar, \"because, when the Italian word 'LUPO' is translated into English, it means 'WOLF.'\" However, in that example, the words have identical meaning in different languages. Overall, this seems to weigh against infringement, as neither company is associated with the actual person, and [Nikola is a common given name](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=nikola).\n\n> 2. the strength of the owner's mark\n\nTesla's is quite strong: they're quite prominent. Nikola probably less so. Would weigh in favor of Tesla in a suit.\n\n> 3. the price of the goods and other factors indicative of the care and attention expected of consumers when making a purchase\n\nExtremely high: the Tesla and Nikola trucks start at \\~$40k and $60k, respectively. This weighs against infringement, as consumers are unlikely to make such an expensive purchase hastily.\n\n> 5. the intent of the defendant in adopting the mark\n\nBoth chose the mark to pay homage to Nikola Tesla. Per the same case, \"defendant's intent will indicate a likelihood of confusion only if an intent to confuse consumers is demonstrated via purposeful manipulation of the junior mark to resemble the senior's.\" None appears clear here, which does not support infringment.\n\n> 6. the evidence of actual confusion\n\nI couldn't quickly find any. I'm sure a lawyer would search more thoroughly, but this seems to weigh against infringement.\n\n> 7. whether the goods, competing or not competing, are marketed through the same channels of trade and advertised through the same media\n> 8. the extent to which the targets of the parties' sales efforts are the same\n\nThese are probably pretty similar. Would weigh in favor of infringement.\n\n---\n\nAs with any balancing test, it's a bit of a guessing game how a court would weigh the factors, but given the low similarity, high price, and lack of evidence of actual confusion, I find it unlikely that a court would find either party has infringed the other's trademark.",

The strength of Tesla's brand would actually weigh in favor of Tesla in a potential infringement case, not against infringement.\n\nB) Incorrect. Similar marketing channels and advertising media would support a case for infringement, not weigh against it.\n\nC) Correct. The high price point of both Tesla and Nikola vehicles (starting at ~$40k and $60k respectively) would weigh against infringement. As stated in the passage, \"This weighs against infringement, as consumers are unlikely to make such an expensive purchase hastily.\" The price and consumer care factor is one of the Lapp factors used to determine likelihood of confusion in trademark cases.\n\nD) Incorrect. Overlap in target consumers would support a case for infringement, as it increases the likelihood of confusion. This would not weigh against infringement.\n\nThe high price point (C) stands out as a factor that would reduce the likelihood of consumer confusion, thus weighing against a finding of infringement in this hypothetical case."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the norm for big sports contracts? Does the player still get paid if he is injured, or otherwise cannot play?\n\nFor example, in 2001 Drew Bledsoe, quarterback for the Patriots had just signed a $100 million 10\\-year contract before he was sidelined by a life\\-threatening injury. Did he still receive the $100 million over the next 10 years, even though he never again served as starting quarterback?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I did some more research on this question. A contract that pays the player no matter what, whether they play or not, is called a *guaranteed contract*. Guaranteed contracts are rare in the NFL because injuries are so frequent. Only a small number of superstars get them.\n\nThe norm for NFL players are provisions that allow a team to cut a player at the beginning of the next year. So, the usual rule is that a player will always get paid for the current season, even if they do not play at all, but if they are unable to play due to an injury then the team can release them and terminate the contract the next year, as long as they decide to do so by a particular date, which is usually in March. Note that if a player cannot play due to injury, usually they get paid injury pay which is less than their full pay, but is still a substantial.\n\nFor star players, the amount of guaranteed pay is larger, often several years of the contract. So, for example, a $100 million contract might have $25 million guaranteed. Also, many star contracts have an \"injury bonus\" clause that pays additional money if the player suffers a career\\-ending injury. So, in that case, the player would receive the guaranteed money plus the injury bonus.\n\nLonger\\-term contracts for super stars are not usually fully guaranteed. Usually, the team has several options to extend the contract. So, for example, a contract may have a 3\\-year guaranteed phase, plus a 3\\-year option which allows the team to automatically retain the quarterback for another 3\\-years at the same rate if they pay an additional sum of money as a bonus.\n\nContracts are also affected by the collective bargaining agreement between the owners and the player union. This prevents certain types of contracts from being binding for long\\-periods of time. When the collective bargaining agreement lapses, then it resets many of the conditions of individual contracts.\n\nDrew Bledsoe's record $103 million dollar contract in 2001 featured an $8 million signing bonus and a $6 million injury guarantee. Only 3 years or so of Bledsoe's contract was guaranteed, so after he was traded to the Bills in 2002 (who assumed his contract), it was easy for the Bills to cut him in 2004, because relatively little guaranteed money remained on his contract. Bledsoe then signed a 3\\-year deal with the Cowboys, but it was an ordinary deal, only guaranteed for the current season, not a superstar deal. When his play became disappointing in the 2nd year, he was cut and he retired.",

According to the information provided, typical NFL contracts, even for star players, are not fully guaranteed for their entire duration. Instead, they often include partial guarantees for the first few years, team options for contract extensions, and potential injury bonuses. The structure allows teams flexibility while providing some security for players. \n\nOption A is incorrect because fully guaranteed contracts for the entire duration are rare in the NFL. \n\nOption C is incorrect because there are significant differences between contracts for star players and others, particularly in terms of guaranteed money and bonuses. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it's the opposite of the norm - most NFL contracts are not fully guaranteed, and teams often have the ability to cut players with limited financial penalties, especially after the guaranteed portions of the contracts expire."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under Australian Consumer Law, which of the following statements about false testimonials in advertising is most accurate?\n\nA) False testimonials are permitted as long as they are clearly marked as fictional.\nB) False testimonials are always allowed under the principle of puffery.\nC) False testimonials are illegal and explicitly prohibited as a form of misleading and deceptive conduct.\nD) False testimonials are only illegal if they cause direct financial harm to consumers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Australian Consumer Law and various state Trade Practices Acts, false testimonials are explicitly prohibited as a form of misleading and deceptive conduct. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) states that \"Using false testimonials or 'passing off' (impersonating another business) is also illegal.\" This was further reinforced in court cases such as Volunteer Eco Students Abroad Pty Limited v Reach Out Volunteers Pty Limited [2013] FCA 731, where publishing testimonials from people who had never used the service was found to contravene the Trade Practices Act.\n\nOption A is incorrect because false testimonials are not permitted even if marked as fictional. Option B is incorrect because while puffery is allowed, false testimonials go beyond puffery and are explicitly prohibited. Option D is incorrect because the law does not require direct financial harm for false testimonials to be illegal; the potential to mislead or deceive is sufficient."

At the time of writing this, it has 12 million views on imgur. This got me thinking, could a copyright holder *technically* sue over the uploading of this GIF? I'm guessing yes, because it's still barely legible. But at what point are they not allowed to do so? Surely they can't claim intellectual property over *one* pixel shifting to specific colors for 90 minutes, for example? How about 2x2? Etc.\n\nI read [What considerations determine copyright infringement?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/817/what-considerations-determine-copyright-infringement) which to me makes it seem like they COULD sue over the one pixel shifting colors for 90 minutes, because I did copy and modify the movie. Is that really true?\n\nI also read [How similar should a tune be to constitute theft of someone else's tune?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64255/how-similar-should-a-tune-be-to-constitute-theft-of-someone-elses-tune?noredirect=1&lq=1) which states that it depends a lot on the case since there are so many variables. Is that also true in this case? I imagine songs work very different from movies.\n\nLooking for both US or EU answers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A few years ago, there was a trial in the USA about some short sound on some music CD:\n\nOne party claimed that one piece of music on the CD contained a sound of less than one second length which is copied from another CD without the permission of the copyright owner of the other CD.\n\nIt could never be found out if this claim was really true.\n\nThe court's decision was:\n\nIf it is not possible to distinguish between a copy and a work that does not depend on the other work at all, it is not a copyright infringement \\- even if the sound has been copied from the other CD.\n\nFor this reason, I'd guess that a 4x3 image would not be a copyright infringement, yet, while 60x45 would definitely be one.\n\nJust for reference: The same image as 3x4 and as 45x60:\n\n[![\"Mona Lisa\" in different resolutions](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RxwNk.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RxwNk.jpg)",

The court ruled that if it's not possible to distinguish between a copy and a work that does not depend on the original at all, it's not considered copyright infringement. This principle applies regardless of the specific pixel dimensions or file format. While the text suggests that 4x3 might not be infringing and 60x45 likely would be, the underlying principle is about distinguishability, not exact dimensions. Options B, C, and D are too specific or not directly related to the legal principle described."

According to WTO regulations, aren't you supposed to treat all your trading partners equally? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: WTO has no direct effect on US law beyond what Congress enacts, namely the [Uruguay Round Agreements Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_Round_Agreements_Act). [\u00a7102(a) of the act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-108/pdf/STATUTE-108-Pg4809.pdf) affirms the supremacy of US law, meaning we can do what we want if Congress approves. [Title 19](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19) generally deals with customs duties, and import tariffs have been legal for a long time. The [Trade Expansion Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Expansion_Act), passed by Congress, allows the President to impose tariffs based on a recommendation from the U.S. Secretary of Commerce if \"an article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten or impair the national security\" ([19 USC 1862](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1862)). The [Trade Act of 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Act_of_1974), passed by Congress, also authorizes the president to implement tariffs, which (\u00a7301\\) Trump relied on in imposing tariffs on Chinese imports.",

The Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the President to impose tariffs based on national security concerns, as per 19 USC 1862. Additionally, the Trade Act of 1974 provides broader authority for the President to implement tariffs, which was used by President Trump to impose tariffs on Chinese imports under Section 301 of the Act.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because WTO regulations do not have direct effect on U.S. law beyond what Congress enacts through the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\n\nAnswer C is wrong because U.S. law maintains supremacy over WTO regulations, as affirmed by Section 102(a) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the Uruguay Round Agreements Act does address trade agreements, it does not give the President unlimited power to impose tariffs without Congressional approval. The President's authority comes from specific acts passed by Congress, such as the Trade Expansion Act and the Trade Act of 1974."

According to the information provided, a former President could potentially face both state and federal charges for actions taken while in office, including phone calls that may have violated election laws. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. Both state and federal prosecutors could potentially bring charges, depending on which laws may have been violated.\n2. The former President would be vulnerable to federal prosecution after leaving office if the facts support such a prosecution.\n3. There is no blanket immunity for former Presidents from prosecution for actions taken while in office.\n4. The proper venue for contesting election results is through the court system, not by pressuring election officials.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they suggest limitations on prosecution that don't exist. Option D is incorrect because it introduces a requirement for a special counsel that isn't necessary for potential prosecution of a former President."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of Sam's actions?\n\nA) Sam has not committed trespass because Alex never explicitly forbade entry to his room.\nB) Sam has committed trespass because a closed door implies a lack of permission to enter.\nC) Sam's actions are legal because roommates have implied permission to enter each other's spaces in a shared house.\nD) Sam has not committed trespass because borrowing a book is a reasonable purpose for entry.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, trespassing occurs when someone enters another's property without permission. While explicit verbal instructions can establish lack of permission, other forms of notice can also suffice. A closed door is specifically mentioned as a form of notice that implies a lack of permission to enter. Therefore, even though Alex never verbally told Sam to stay out, the closed door serves as a nonverbal indication that entry without permission is not allowed. Sam's act of entering the room despite this implied notice constitutes trespass. \n\nOption A is incorrect because explicit verbal instruction is not the only way to communicate lack of permission. \nOption C is incorrect because shared living arrangements do not automatically grant unrestricted access to private spaces within the house. \nOption D is incorrect because the purpose of entry does not negate the lack of permission; borrowing an item without permission does not justify unauthorized entry."
