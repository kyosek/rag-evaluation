FWIW I do not employ or hire people. If I did I'd be talking to my lawyer.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This law regulates employers, and New York City only has jurisdiction over employers in New York City, so this law would not protect residents of New York City seeking employment outside of New York City.\n\nGenerally speaking, the law of a jurisdiction can only apply to someone who has \"personally availed themselves\" of the benefits of operating in that jurisdiction such that it is foreseeable that they would be subject to the laws of that jurisdiction. An employer not operating in New York City seeking employees at large wouldn't meet that requirement. While this concept is usually applied in the context of the personal jurisdiction of a court, it is also not irrelevant to choice of law questions.\n\nAs with any law, there are edge cases that could be challenging in which the applicability of the law could be unclear. \n\nFor example, it isn't clear whether this rule would or would not apply to an employer looking for an employee in its Chicago office (e.g. working for the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Mercantile_Exchange)) that conducts interviews and makes hiring decisions for the job at a job fair intended for NYU Alumni that is conducted at its New York City campus, even though it doesn't have offices for the conduct of its primary business in New York City and the staff conducting the job fair are based in Chicago. It might. \n\nBut, suppose that the law did apply to the conduct of the employer at the job fair. Would it also apply to a follow up interview in Chicago, or to employees interviewing for the same job at a similar job fair on the Stanford University campus?

The normal maximum to hold someone is 18 months, so we are well past that.\n\nCan the courts hold someone indefinitely for contempt of court?\nWhen would this situation be considered 'cruel and unusual' punishment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can the courts hold someone indefinitely for contempt of court?\n\nYes. This is civil contempt which is imposed to compel compliance with a court order that the disobedient person has the ability to comply with, rather than criminal contempt which is limited to a set time period to punish disrespect for the Court in an instance that is over and complete.\n\nOften, it is eventually vacated on the grounds of futility (i.e. it is clear that further incarceration will not secure compliance) or mootness (e.g. when a witness refuses to testify in a trial and then the trial is completed). In the case of government officials who refuse to comply to an order directed to them in an official capacity, the government official can be released forthwith by resigning from their official post.\n\nLong periods of detention for civil contempt are most common for cases like this where someone refuses to provide the location of something of great value, or in asset protection trust type cases involving millions of dollars worth of assets where the detained person refuses to disclose hidden assets or to take the steps necessary to cause them to be turned over to a creditor or ex\\-spouse, and the Court has determined that the person detained is capable of doing so. Less often, it is done for quite a long time in cases involving national security secrets.\n\nPersons held in civil contempt also have fewer due process protections than persons charged with indirect criminal contempt which is just a procedurally unusual form of crime (direct criminal contempt is even more procedurally unusual and involves less due process, the person held in direct criminal contempt can be jailed or fined for a set period of time summarily by a judge without a hearing for disrespectful conduct in the judge's physical presence with only a brief few seconds opportunity to speak up for himself or herself without a right to counsel in response before being punished).\n\n> When would this situation be considered 'cruel and unusual'\n> punishment?\n\nNo. Cruel and unusual punishment applies to punishment for wrongdoing. Civil contempt isn't designed to punish wrongdoing. It is calculated to secure compliance going forward with a lawful court order with which the person incarcerated has the ability to comply.\n\nIn a case of civil contempt, a fundamental principle is that the person detained, who has refused to comply with a court order that the person has the ability to comply with and does so without lawful justification, \"holds the key to the jail\" and can be released forthwith upon complying with the Court's order at any time.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A federal court has ordered John Doe to disclose the location of $10 million in assets he allegedly hid from creditors. John refuses to comply and is held in civil contempt. After 3 years in jail, John's lawyer argues that his continued detention violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. How should the court rule?\n\nA) The court should release John immediately, as civil contempt detention cannot exceed 18 months.\nB) The court should release John, as 3 years of detention for civil contempt has become punitive and thus violates the Eighth Amendment.\nC) The court can continue to hold John in civil contempt indefinitely, as long as he has the ability to comply with the order.\nD) The court should convert the civil contempt to criminal contempt and impose a fixed sentence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The court can continue to hold John in civil contempt indefinitely, as long as he has the ability to comply with the order. Civil contempt is not considered punishment, but rather a coercive measure to compel compliance with a court order. The key principles are:\n\n1. There is no fixed time limit for civil contempt detention.\n2. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment does not apply to civil contempt, as it is not considered punishment for wrongdoing.\n3. The person held in contempt \"holds the key to the jail\" and can be released at any time by complying with the court order.\n4. Civil contempt can continue as long as the court believes the person has the ability to comply and that continued detention might lead to compliance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no 18-month limit for civil contempt. Option B is incorrect because the Eighth Amendment does not apply to civil contempt. Option D is incorrect because converting to criminal contempt would defeat the purpose of compelling compliance and would require a new proceeding with different due process requirements."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26983/what-did-flybe-actually-do-wrong", "docs_id": 26983, "title": "What did Flybe actually do wrong?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Read an article recently regarding FlyBe, and their attempt to find out (from a list of unknown user data) who wanted to be contacted in the future with promotions, etc.\n\nThey sent an email to this list of unknown users to determine just that, but they were later given a penalty for spamming (\u00a370K).

First off, does the \"Google's TOS\" actually mean it's for the Google company as a whole, or is this just for the search engine? They mention user accounts, which is part of their core to the ecosystem of Google Apps and such (Gmail, etc.), so what exactly is this TOS for? When do you agree to this?\n\nSecond, if the \"Google's TOS\" is all you need, why do you have the Chrome TOS? Do you need a TOS for every product you create? Or can one general one suffice?\n\nBasically, should a downloadable mobile/desktop app have a TOS called \"My Company TOS\", or \"My App TOS\"? Or should the \"My App TOS\" include a link to the \"My Company TOS\" as a prereq? Or does just having the \"My App TOS\" suffice?\n\n*I understand that Chrome is the browser we use for the web, a specific Google product. What I don't understand is (a) why they have a generic Company\\-wide TOS, and (b) how that relates to product\\-specific TOSes.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"company TOS\" specifically says that it applies to all of Google's Services. It also says:\n\n> Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or\n>  product requirements (including age requirements) may apply.\n>  Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and\n>  those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you\n>  use those Services.\n\nSo the terms in the \"company\" TOS apply to *all* their services, including Chrome, and the Chrome TOS adds *additional* terms that only apply to Chrome. If you use Chrome, you have to comply with all the terms in both documents, except where the Chrome TOS specifically overrides the company TOS.\n\nPresumably they found it inconvenient to have separate documents for all their many services, so they wrote a generic document that would be appropriate for most of them, and then they supplement this with specific documents when individual services need something special.\n\nFor your own apps, you'd have to decide, based on your business needs and in consultation with your lawyers, which of these two models makes the most sense for you.

This method allows TechInnovate to have a general TOS that covers common elements across all their services, while still maintaining the flexibility to add specific terms for individual products that may have unique requirements. This approach reduces redundancy, ensures consistency across services, and allows for necessary customization.

For example, an adult asthmatic may be fine 95% of the time, but if they were just visiting a friend's house where several cats and dogs live, they may have a brief, minor issue with \"shortness of breath\" or \"wheezing\".\n\nAnd it gets worse if they have OCD and are analytical. An individual like that might, for example, notice that their breathing is 99%, not 100%. (Of course, most people with OCD know and are perfectly able to just ignore the sign at that point, but it can make one flinch for half a second and be slightly unwelcoming.) So this not only affects people with common physical problems, but common psychological ones as well.\n\nThe bad thing is that these signs were practically everywhere during the pandemic \\- grocery stores certainly included \\- and things like the two conditions mentioned above are only example of a much larger list which affects a large swathe of the general population. But these conditions are ***not contagious***, and they are often genetic. On the other hand though, they are also ***chronic***.\n\nNow, I want to highlight this: Common sense is common sense, and normally these signs would be ignored. However, if we use the example above about the cats and dogs, the asthmatic might cough a couple of times, which would be noticeable; but in this case, it does not suggest COVID, and the problem is something that is ***chronic***. And while that's a temporary matter, they may be very *slightly* \"short of the breath\" all the time.\n\nDespite being practically everywhere, *were/are these signs and rules illegally discriminating against a large swath of the population with common, chronic, and non\\-contagious conditions?*\n\nTo the extent a specific country is required, let's use the US and regulations like the ADA, though I'd be interested to hear about other countries as well.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nThe currently accepted answer (as of 2021\\-7\\-23, at which point it was the only answer) was a little hard for me to follow at first, because I believe there was some context I didn't see initially. Without that context, the rationale and flow behind the answer didn't seem to follow logically. In particular, when it was mentioned that people are expected to know the law, usually I think of that as mainly applying to the offender, as opposed to the victim. An offender can always still say or do something illegally though, and a victim's knowledge or ignorance of the law doesn't grant the offender a free pass to impede their rights. However with the proper context, the answer does seem to follow.\n\nI could be misinterpreting something, but per a few comments back and forth, I think this is a rough paraphrase/summary, context included:\n\n> Basically the dividing line is a matter of how clearly the alleged offender is addressing the alleged victim. In the case of a typical COVID sign, there's typically supposed to be context that the sign doesn't apply to people who just have things like asthma, unless, for example, a store employee actually addresses the individuals directly. Therefore it is not clearly and unambiguously barring them for symptoms clearly attributable to asthma (or whatever the condition is). In this way, it is similar to how a \"DO NOT ENTER\" sign at the gate of a private property does not apply to friends and family who have previously been welcomed by the owner.\n>   \n>   \n> \n> Also, the precise manner in which the sign is worded can weigh against this, but it doesn't single\\-handedly decide the case. However a \"Please do not enter if you are \\<race/color/ethnicity X\\>\" sign, for example, is illegal, because even in the proper context, it is still quite clear it applies to the people literally mentioned.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have to start with the pertinent [ADA regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&SID=2ab2aab2d3d2fd0f544a5ce7aad8f04c&rgn=div5&view=text&node=28:1.0.1.1.37&idno=28), 28 CFR Part 36, and esp. subpart B which gets to the prohibition. Under \u00a736\\.201(a),\n\n> No individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of\n> disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of\n> public accommodation by any private entity who owns, leases (or leases\n> to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\n\nAfter that under activities, it is stated that\n\n> A public accommodation shall not subject an individual or class of\n> individuals on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such\n> individual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or\n> other arrangements, to a denial of the opportunity of the individual\n> or class to participate in or benefit from the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of a place of\n> public accommodation.\n\nand also\n\n> A public accommodation shall not afford an individual or class of\n> individuals, on the basis of a disability or disabilities of such\n> individual or class, directly, or through contractual, licensing, or\n> other arrangements, with the opportunity to participate in or benefit\n> from a good, service, facility, privilege, advantage, or accommodation\n> that is not equal to that afforded to other individuals.\n\nmoreover \"separate but equal\" is not allowed.\n\nThe sign does not articulate any denial of opportunity, so that should be the end of the discussion. OTOH I suspect that a sign saying \"Please do not enter this store if you are white\" would be held to be discriminatory, as an indirect denial of permission to enter based on race.\n\n\u00a736\\.208 introduces two important exceptions. First,\n\n> This part does not require a public accommodation to permit an\n> individual to participate in or benefit from the goods, services,\n> facilities, privileges, advantages and accommodations of that public\n> accommodation when that individual poses a direct threat to the health\n> or safety of others.\n\nThat means that (irrespective of the fact that covid is not a legal disability) it is legal to exclude direct threats to the health of others. And furthermore,\n\n> In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat to the\n> health or safety of others, a public accommodation must make an\n> individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on\n> current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence,\n> to ascertain: The nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the\n> probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether\n> reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures or the\n> provision of auxiliary aids or services will mitigate the risk.\n\nBased on reasonable medical judgment and innumerable official government proclamations, it is reasonable to believe that a person with covid symptoms pose a threat to public health. The law doesn't require you to be omniscient and actually know that customer A has covid and customer B has asthma. \u00a736\\.301 then says more about possible screening requirements.\n\nIt is generally expected that everybody knows the law and will follow the law: ignorance of the law is no excuse, nor is it a cause for a discrimination claim. It would not be legal to exclude a person from a public accommodation when they pose no threat to public health. The customer with asthma is expected to know this law, and is expected to not infer incorrectly that the sign implies that he is being illegally excluded. The customer with covid is also expected to know this law, and is expected to know that it refers to him \u2013 as is allowed under the law.\n\nPotentially illegal discrimination enters the picture once actual exclusion happens, getting you back to \"individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment\".

Maybe jurisdiction doesn't much matter here, let's consider a typical civil country).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nIn the US, the default rule is that your home is your castle. In general, nobody, not even the police, can enter your home without your permission. The main exception to this rule is that police do not need your permission if they have a search warrant to search your home. To get a warrant, the police must convince a magistrate that they have good reason (ie, \"probable cause\"), such as a gps track, to believe they will find evidence of a crime if they search the house.\n\nThe police in your hypothetical are in a similar situation to police who are tracking the gps signal from a \"[bait car](http://cdn.harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vol128_Joh.pdf)/bike/phone/tablet/package.\" (A bait car is a car/etc that has been fitted with a camera and gps tracker, and left out as bait for thieves.)\n\nAs long as the car is in public view, the police do not need a warrant to search it and arrest the person driving it. However, once the bait car is out of public view, where the police can no longer see it, they need a warrant to go in and recover it, even if they can see it on the tracker. (See, for example, the instructions for bait car programs from the [Eugene](https://www.eugene-or.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5186) and [Reno](http://www.renopd.com/content/gen_ord/S-270-09%20Bait%20Vehicle%20Operations.pdf) Police Departments.)\n\n(For phones, which may not be in \"plain view\" even if the thief is, the police use ring programs to make the phone ring. Hearing a phone respond to a ring program gives them probable cause under the \"hearing\" version of the \"plain view\" doctrine.)\n\nBottom line: In the US, the police need a search warrant. Since search warrants take time and effort, police may be unwilling to get a warrant for something as low valued as a phone.\n\nIf the police can't or won't help, there are various options for privately enforcing one's rights.

This is because:\n\n1. In most jurisdictions, including the United States, law enforcement needs a search warrant to enter a private property without the owner's consent, even if there's strong evidence of a crime.\n\n2. Taking matters into one's own hands by breaking in (option A) or hiring someone to do so (option D) would be illegal and could result in criminal charges against the victim.\n\n3. While confronting the suspect directly (option B) is not necessarily illegal, it could be dangerous and may prompt the suspect to dispose of the evidence.\n\n4.

You'll notice that I made it $875 this month. This is because we have not yet moved the cats into the apartment and don't think they'll be coming within the next month or so. We will let you know when we bring them and pay cat rent accordingly. Don't worry about the first 2 months' cat rent. Thanks, \"name\"\n\nTheir reply (text message. Apparently they didn't see the email):\n\n> Hi \"name\". I just wanted to let you know that I received $875 for rent payment, but there is another $40 due. To avoid late fees, please check to make sure this third payment is made. Have a good weekend.\n\nOur reply: mention email and repeat (basically copy\\-paste) what the email said.\n\nTheir reply:\n\n> Hello \"name\", thank you for you message. First, I did not receive an email yesterday about this, so I don't have the information contained in it, I'm not sure what happended to it, but feel free to send it again. Second, I can understand that there may be some confusion about this, but I hope you can understand that the pet rent is very much rent just like the main rental amount. There isn't really any flexibility in paying one month or another based on the pets being in the home or not. Just as you would be responsible for rent, even if you were out of town for a month or two, you are still responsible for the pet rent, even if they have not moved in yet. Again, I would be happy to review the email, if you would send it again, but the full rental amount is due today.\n\nThen, we paid the $40 so we didn't potentially get charged a late fee. It feels as though we're getting held hostage a little for this just because we're young (early 20's). We tried to be courteous by even allowing them to keep the previous unnecessary payments, hoping they'd show the same reasonable courtesy, but I suppose not.\n\nCan a landlord legally charge for pet rent even when no pets are present in the apartment? Should I take this to court and get a lawyer? The lease was signed with the impression that the $40 would only be necessary if we brought pets. It also sounds like if we never mentioned pets until, say, 6 months in, they would charge us pet rent for the previous 6 months even though the pets were not present.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can a landlord legally charge for pet rent even when no pets are\n>  present in the apartment?\n\nYes. Absent any indication in the lease that your cats would not move in immediately, the landlord is right.\n\nI assume that your lease reflects mutual knowledge of your intent to bring your cats over (via a marked checkbox or in \"*d) Pet1 Details: ... Pet 2 Details ...*\"). If so, according to the lease, you officially have pets in the apartment. To avoid being charged unnecessarily, you should have (1\\) ensured that the contract reflects the intended delay regarding your cats, or (2\\) asked the landlord to amend the lease once it is imminent that you will bring your pets over.\n\nOne or multiple administrative reasons justify a landlord to charge pet fees even if there are no pets in the apartment. For instance, the landlord might need to notify his insurer whenever an additional rental unit will host pets, thereby resulting in adjustments to a premium. Likewise, the number of pets might be a factor when a cleaning company bills the landlord.\n\n> The lease was signed with the impression that the $40 would only be\n>  necessary if we brought pets.\n\nHence the relevance of determining whether or not the lease objectively reflects that you notified the landlord of your intention to bring pets and, if so, *when* it would become effective. If the latter is not specified, it defaults to the start date of the lease.\n\n> It also sounds like if we never mentioned pets until, say, 6 months\n>  in, they would charge us pet rent for the previous 6 months even\n>  though the pets were not present.\n\nIt depends. If the landlord \"busted\" you, then he could sanction you in accordance with the terms of the lease. Instead, if you subsequently requested an amendment to the lease, then the landlord would only charge you from the date you officially bring the pets. But the *effective* date needs to be reflected in the lease/amendment.\n\n> Should I take this to court and get a lawyer?\n\nNo. First, for the reasons I mentioned above. Second, because lawyers want money, and they will detect right away that there is really not much to recover in a controversy like this one. Third, because complaining about a relatively small amount ($40/month) tells the lawyer that he or she won't get much money from you either (and lawyers want your money). And fourth, because the yearly total of pet fees indicates that the matter would have to be filed in Small Claims Court, where \\-\\-if I am not wrong\\-\\- parties are not allowed to be represented by counsel.\n\nGoing to court is not \"peanuts\". Even if your were allowed \\-\\-and you managed\\-\\- to retain a lawyer, you would end up paying so much in attorney fees to someone who might not be forthcoming, let alone diligent.

Pennsylvania has a law called the \"implied warranty of habitability\" that *ensures that tenants have safe and decent housing. This means that every landlord in Pennsylvania must make the repairs needed to keep the rental housing in a safe, sanitary and liveable condition.* See [PALawHELP.org \\- Your Online Guide to Legal Information and Legal Services in Pennsylvania](https://www.palawhelp.org/resource/deduct-repair-tenants-right-to-a-safe-and-dec?ref=YCeIM).\n\nBut don't schedule repairs until you read that site and talked to PALawHELP.

But, would it be reasonable to say that police powers are those powers of government reserved to the States by the 10th Amendment?\n\nTo what extent that police powers are permitted to Federal government agencies? Are they limited to executive branch agencies?

How does this statute fit within the concept of enumerated powers of the federal government?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think you're being confused by two separate definitions of \"police power.\" The police power under the 10th Amendment has nothing to do with \"the police,\" i.e. people with guns and badges and uniforms who make arrests. It refers to the authority of a *government* to make rules for the general welfare. Police power is almost always exercised by the legislature, and when the executive exercises it (e.g. by issuing regulations) it's typically operating under conditions set by the legislature.\n\nThe United States has police power in a few situations: DC, federal property and territories, US\\-flagged ships on the high seas, etc. Outside of those situations, the United States instead has enumerated powers. Congress has a power to tax and spend to promote the general welfare, but otherwise it can only legislate to achieve one of the enumerated powers in the Constitution. Now, courts have read Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce very broadly, but there does need to be *some* relation to enumerated powers.\n\n---\n\nYou're asking about the Capitol Police, but they don't have \"police power\" in the 10th Amendment sense. They have the power to carry guns and to arrest people for crimes committed against the United States. This power is limited based on geography and/or the nature of their task; for instance, they have nationwide arrest powers \"\\[i]n the performance of their protective duties,\" but not when they're traveling outside DC on other official duties (e.g. to attend training).\n\nWhile there's no litigation I can dig up that's *directly* on point, courts have repeatedly ruled that Congress has the power to do some not\\-entirely\\-legislative tasks in order to protect its own functions. For instance, in *Anderson v. Dunn* (1821\\), the Supreme Court upheld an inherent power of the House to hold private citizens in contempt of Congress for disobeying its subpoenas and for the Sergeant at Arms to arrest them and bring them before the House. It seems likely Congress would also have the authority to protect its own members from physical violence. The GAO [did an analysis](https://www.gao.gov/products/b-317742) when it was analyzing whether there was a constitutional problem with making Capitol Police IG personnel into special deputy US marshals, and it concluded that there was no issue with congressional employees exercising arrest powers in order to physically protect the legislative branch.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between \"police powers\" as referenced in the 10th Amendment and the authority of federal law enforcement agencies like the U.S. Capitol Police?\n\nA) The 10th Amendment's reference to \"police powers\" directly grants authority to federal law enforcement agencies to operate nationwide.\n\nB) \"Police powers\" in the 10th Amendment refer specifically to the authority of uniformed officers to make arrests and carry firearms.\n\nC) The U.S. Capitol Police's authority stems from Congress's power to protect its functions, not from the 10th Amendment's \"police powers.\"\n\nD) Federal law enforcement agencies like the Capitol Police derive their authority exclusively from the interstate commerce clause.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of the distinction between \"police powers\" as mentioned in the 10th Amendment and the actual authority of federal law enforcement agencies.

Therefore, the ethical response is to explain the legal ramifications of keeping the money (which would be illegal) and advise the client to return it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it involves assisting in illegal activity. Option B, while not directly assisting in a crime, could be seen as indirectly aiding the client in evading the law. Option D is clearly unethical and illegal, as it involves the lawyer directly participating in money laundering.\n\nIt's important to note that if a lawyer were to assist in such illegal activities, they could face severe consequences, including the loss of attorney-client privilege under the \"Crime-Fraud\" exception, potential disbarment, and legal consequences."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46242/can-i-sell-my-license-plate-tabs-to-someone-else-if-i-no-longer-need-them", "docs_id": 46242, "title": "Can I sell my license plate tabs to someone else if I no longer need them?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just moved from one state to a bordering state.

If any car is damaged or sold, ownership of that car transfers to Mr. Smith's car club.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most likely to be legally enforceable because it creates an antecedent condition that must be met before the gift is fully vested, and it doesn't attempt to control behavior after the gift is given. The condition is also reasonable and doesn't violate public policy.\n\nOption A is likely unenforceable as it attempts to restrain marriage, which is generally against public policy.\n\nOption B could be enforceable, but it may be challenged as it attempts to control behavior for an extended period after the gift is given.\n\nOption D is problematic because it attempts to create ongoing conditions after the gift is given, which is generally not enforceable in wills. Once a gift is given, you typically can't call it back based on future actions.\n\nThe key principle here is that conditions in wills must generally be antecedent to the gift, not ongoing restrictions after the gift is given.

Military bases, firehouses, and jails are owned by the public, but many of these have limited access to the public.\n\nIt may be open to the general public, but that does not mean restrictions cannot be put into place, either on times, or activities, or individuals. For example, public parks often have time and activity restrictions; schools have the power to restrict individuals from their premises, either specifically or by general category.\n\nAs a general point of law, the owner of any property, or their agent, can order anyone without the right to stay (e.g. not a co\\-owner or tenant), and that person must depart, otherwise that person is tresspassing. Assuming that the Senior Center is owned by the town, it is probable that the Administrator is empowered to act as the town's agent in this matter.\n\nNow, since this \"No Trespass order\" is specifically directed at you, there is a reason behind it. It may be something you've done. It may be that complaints have been received about your behavior. It may be an actual abuse by someone who doesn't like you. We have no way of knowing.

The documentation explains that even though a building is publicly owned, access can still be restricted. The town administrator, acting as an agent for the town, likely has the authority to issue a no-trespass order. However, since the order is specifically directed at an individual, there should be a reason behind it.

I didn't have a deposit so my dad told the landlord to keep his deposit. The landlord didn't bother inspecting the property when my dad moved out, instead he asked me to sign a contract stating that I would take liability for the state of the property \\- I signed this since it was my dad's deposit anyway and I needed to move out ASAP.\n\nOne of the first things I noticed about the property was that the carpets are in disrepair. There are stains, frays and matted areas all over. It is impossible to keep feet or socks clean and the dirt from the carpets is enough to permanently stain socks. I started wearing flip\\-flops indoors as a hygienic solution.\n\nSince the carpets are in disrepair, I sent an email to the landlord asking for him to replace the carpets. The landlord's response was that it must be a cleaning issue and therefore he will not be replacing the carpets.\n\nMy dad lived in the property for 5 years and did not once clean the carpets. I wouldn't be surprised if he barely used a vacuum cleaner in that time either. That being said, the landlord said that the carpets were \"like new\" when my dad moved in. I have been here for 8 months now. This means the carpets are likely around 6 years old.\n\nMy dad is disabled and was paying for rent with disabled benefits. My brother and his girlfriend lived with him for a few years and I lived with them all for about a year. This means there was probably substantial wear \\& tear to consider on the carpets (which span the entire house except for the bathroom, which is lino).\n\nIn addition to all of the above, when I mentioned the carpets to the landlord during an inspection, he said \"We have already noted the carpets. We will replace them after you've left.\" This to me says both that they were aware they needed replacing *before* I signed the contract to transfer liability, and that they recognise that they need replacing.\n\nMy questions are as follow:\n\n1. Should the landlord not replace the carpets regardless of the situation, since they are presumably at the end of their lifespan and they have practically admitted that they need replacing?\n2. Just how much liability have I taken over from my dad? Is it even possible for someone *without* a disability to take liability from someone *with* a disability?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm going to take different view to @DaleM and say you cannot take liability for damage caused by a previous tenant, notwithstanding that you purported to agree to that.\n\nI know you stated that you \"took over the tenancy\" but I'll start with the assumption that what you mean is that you signed a new tenancy agreement with the landlord (containing a clause agreeing to be liable for past damage), as this is by far the most common scenario in practice. I'll then examine the alternative scenario. I've asked in the comments for you to clarify how you entered into the tenancy agreement.\n\nNew tenancy agreement\n---------------------\n\nIn a new tenancy agreement, you *cannot* take liability from a previous tenant in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\"), due to the provisions of the [Tenant Fees Act 2019](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/4/contents). I'm open to being convinced otherwise if anyone has an alternative interpretation of those provisions.\n\nA landlord must not require a tenant to make a prohibited payment:\n\n> **Section 1(1\\)**: A landlord must not require a relevant person to make a prohibited payment to the landlord in connection with a tenancy\n> of housing in England.\n> \n> \n> **Section 1(9\\)**: In this Act \u201crelevant person\u201d means \u2014 (a) a tenant, \\[...]\n\nThe starting point is that *all* payments are prohibited. Exceptions to this are then listed in Schedule 1 of the Act. If it's in the Schedule, you can require payment; if it isn't, you can't.\n\n> **Section 3(1\\):** For the purposes of this Act a payment is a prohibited payment unless it is a permitted payment by virtue of\n> Schedule 1\\.\n\nPayment for damages relating to breach of contract is permitted:\n\n> **Schedule 1, Paragraph 5**: A payment of damages for breach of a tenancy agreement or an agreement between a letting agent and a\n> relevant person is a permitted payment.\n\nIn a typical tenancy agreement, failure to return the property in the condition you found it (allowing for fair wear and tear) is a breach of contract. Hence, it is not prohibited for landlords to require their tenants to pay for damage to property.\n\nThe issue here is that *your dad* committed the breach under *his* tenancy agreement. Under your tenancy agreement there has been no breach. Therefore, requiring payment from your dad is permitted; requiring payment from you is not. Any clause which purports to do so is unenforceable on the tenant:\n\n> **Section 4(1\\)**: A term of a tenancy agreement which breaches section 1 is not binding on a relevant person.\n\nNovated tenancy agreement\n-------------------------\n\nIt's possible that instead of signing a new tenancy agreement, you [novated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novation) the old one. This means that *all three* parties (the landlord, your dad, you) agreed to substitute you for your dad as a party. It is not possible for only you and the landlord to agree to a novation. That's because the outgoing party gives up their rights as well as obligations; hence their consent is required.\n\nAlthough this is commonly be described as \"stepping into the shoes\" of the outgoing party, strictly speaking this is not what happens. Rather, the old contract (between A and B) is extinguished and a new contract (between A and C) is formed on the same terms (or partially on the same terms, depending on what the novation states).\n\nUnder a novation, the default position is that pre\\-novation liabilities remain with the outgoing party. It's possible (and common) to expressly provide something different, which is what has purportedly happened in your case.\n\nThat raises an interesting question as to the effect of Schedule 1, Paragraph 5\\. In my view, while you can expressly provide that *liability* can transfer from B to C in a novated contract, you cannot provide that *breaches* can transfer. A breach is a factual occurance and it's nonsensical to rewrite history by saying that C committed a past breach which in fact B committed. Instead, what you can do is say that C agrees to be *liable* for that past breach. Saying otherwise would be incompatible with the principle that a novated contract is a new contract which extinguishes the old.\n\nAccordingly, my view with regards to Schedule 1, Paragraph 5 is the same as if you had signed a new tenancy agreement (which is effectively what you have done with a novated tenancy agreement). You did not commit the breach, therefore asking you to accept liability for it under the novated contract is prohibited.\n\nNote also that it is permitted to require payment of \u00a350 or the landlord's *costs* in relation to the novation, whichever is greater. However, in my view this applies to only to the outgoing party, being \"the tenant\" who makes the payment \"in consideration\" of the novation of \"the tenancy\" which is done \"at the tenant's request\" (all of which implies we're talking about the existing tenancy, not the new one).

Payment for damages is only permitted for breaches of the current tenancy agreement. Since the new tenant did not cause the damage, requiring them to pay for it would be a prohibited payment.

The contract says something like, \"a condition precedent for the investment of X is a demonstration of the company's technology to the investor's reasonable satisfaction.\" The company delays in doing the demo, but asks for the money. The investor says, \"no demo, no money.\" Is this what \"condition precedent\" is meant to say? \n\nIf there is no express time limit written into the contract, is there an implied, or \"reasonable\" time limit after which the investor is off the hook? For instance, if the demo took place six months later, can the investor reasonably say, \"your technology sounded interesting six months ago, but I fear that it has been made obsolete by now.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In contract law, a [condition precedent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/condition_precedent) is a specified event that must occur prior to a party having to perform a contract obligation.\n\nIn your example, the demonstration is the condition precedent, and funding is the obligation to be performed. So, yes, \"no demo, no money\" is another way to put it.\n\nThe \"investor's reasonable satisfaction\" is the standard used to determine whether the condition has been satisfied (and thus whether the obligation will be triggered). The reasonableness standard falls somewhere in the middle segment on a scale of investor\\-friendly to inventor\\-friendly contract language. For example, \"the investor's sole discretion\" is investor\\-friendly (though likely subject to a good faith duty); \"the investor's discretion\" is still investor\\-friendly and is limited by a good faith duty; \"the investor's reasonable discretion\" anchors the discretion not in what the investor would want to do but in what would be objectively reasonable. Removing investor discretion and replacing it with something like \"upon demonstration\" would be inventor\\-friendly.\n\nWhat is reasonable will vary widely based on the industry and product obsolescence timelines.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An angel investor agrees to invest $1 million in a startup for 10% equity, with the contract stating \"a condition precedent for the investment is a demonstration of the company's technology to the investor's reasonable satisfaction.\" The startup delays the demo by 3 months.

The investor's determination must be objectively reasonable, considering factors like industry standards and product obsolescence timelines. While there's no express time limit, an implied reasonable time limit exists. A 3-month delay could potentially affect the technology's relevance, but the investor's assessment must be reasonable, not arbitrary.

You can unilaterally bring criminal charges or take administrative action, but it is deemed to be unethical and against public policy to refrain from bringing criminal charges or taking administration action to gain civil advantages.\n\nAn NDA of the type described arguably violated the same public policy and might be invalidated as a result. \n\nPut another way, there is a privilege to make certain reports to public officials without legal consequences and such an NDA might violate that privilege. Some of these privileges found in what are called \"whistle blower\" statutes specifically prohibit this kind of agreement as to some specific kinds of illegal conduct, but not others. There isn't a general rule.\n\nThis said, it is not black and white. For example, a private NDA can't prevent someone from testifying under subpoena, but can prevent someone from voluntarily testifying in the absence of a legal compulsion to do so such as a subpoena.\n\n> Suppose a woman is sexually assaulted at work, and is given an NDA to\n>  sign. Can the company legally require her not to disclose the conduct\n>  of an illegal activity?\n\nI can imagine this example coming out different ways in different jurisdictions. \n\nFor example, some states have a legal duty (rarely enforced) that requires people to report felonies, and an NDA in this case would contradict that affirmative legal duty, while others do not.\n\nAnother source of gray in the analysis is that there is a difference between not reporting a sexual assault that actually happened, and, as part of a larger settlement, executing an affidavit stating under penalty of perjury and under oath that a sexual assault didn't happen. The first is potentially an NDA that is void as a matter of public policy. The other, in principle, is a settlement that the person signing the affidavit can only enter into if it is true. There is nothing, in general, wrong, about requiring someone to confirm that certain representations are true as part of a business transaction or contract and allowing the contract to go forwards only if certain facts are true.\n\nThe gray gets deeper, because whether a sexual assault happened or not is not always a subjectively black and white clear issue of pure fact. (It is subjective because an affidavit or affirmation is made to the best of the declarant or affiants' knowledge and belief, not as a matter of objective fact.)\n\nFor example, someone may not have perfect memory of what happened, or there could be doubt over the question of whether the perpetrators acted recklessly (the Model Penal Code intent requirement for sexual assault) or merely with criminal negligence (which would not be sexual assault under the Model Penal Code).\n\nA statement made under oath about whether a sexual assault happened to the best of your knowledge, thus, might be a mixture of factual issues (A penetrated B at a certain date and time) and legal or not perfectly factually known ones (A acted with X intent regarding consent during that act).\n\nSo, in a case where there was some room to argue either way about how to characterize what happened and about what actually did happen, there might be some room for a settling party to make a non\\-perjured statement consistent with the settlement and then to agree not to a true NDA, but instead to not make statements which, if the affidavit is true, would be false.\n\nIn a plea bargain in a criminal case, one can plead \"no contest\" without agreeing that the crime factually happened, but that isn't really possibly in the context of an affidavit about what really happened, with an NDA limited to not disclosing the incident since it was already agreed as a matter of sworn fact that there is nothing to disclose that rises the level of a crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company asks an employee to sign an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) regarding an alleged sexual assault incident at work.

As the document states, it's not a black and white issue. Some key points to consider:\n\n1. Some jurisdictions have laws requiring the reporting of felonies, which could conflict with an NDA.\n2. There are \"whistle-blower\" statutes that may prohibit such agreements for certain types of illegal conduct.\n3. The specific wording of the NDA matters - there's a difference between agreeing not to voluntarily disclose information and agreeing to lie or withhold information when legally compelled (e.g., by a subpoena).\n4.

If you stay there over the objections of the owner or the owner's agent, you are trespassing.\n\nThe law applicable to government property owners and private property owners is basically the same in this regard.\n\nRealistically, on government property, furthermore, the standard by which the government employee may legally terminate your license to be there and exclude you from the property is low.\n\nBasically, it must merely not violate any constitutional right you may have, and you do not have a constitutional right to be present on government owned property, except in a quite narrow subset of cases (e.g. the \"town square\").\n\nMore exactly, you do not have a right to be on government property *per se*, but you can't be excluded from it for a constitutionally impermissible reason. The government gets to decide what parts of property it owns are available to the general public and for what content\\-neutral purposes.\n\nThus, the right to be present on government owned \"public\" property (which doesn't include private areas of government owned property) can be subjected to reasonable and content\\-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions.\n\nFor example, a town could legally decide that the town square is closed from midnight to eight a.m. every day.\n\nThe quoted material from the case *Chicago v. Morales*, 527 U.S. 41, 53\\-54 (1999\\) cited in the [answer by bdb484](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/90245) is narrower than a plain reading out of context would suggest. In that quotation, the term \"public place\" is being used in a sense much more restrictive than in the broader sense of property that is merely government owned. It is referring to places where the government has expressly or implicitly allowed members of the general public to be present on land that it owns (as opposed, for example, to a government office area of a building, or a maintenance facility in a government owned park, or a conservation area in a government owned park). This narrow sense of the word resolves what would otherwise seem to be a contradiction in the law.\n\nBut, the government has the authority to make something that once was a public place into a non\\-public place going forward.\n\nFor example, historically, the Civic Center park in front of the capitol in Denver, Colorado has been a public place. But, the government can and did close it off to the public for many months for maintenance and out of public health concerns when heavy use of it by homeless people and drug dealers caused the premises to be seriously damaged and created a public health risk from it being used to dispose of dirty, used, injection\\-drug syringes, and for people to defecate.\n\n**A Hypothetical**\n\nSuppose that Chris is the sole librarian in one of the towns of [College Corner](http://www.lyndonirwin.com/ccorner.htm), which is on the Ohio\\-Indiana border, which are in different time zones. In that capacity, Chris has the authority to set library policies including the hours of the library and the rules for its use without the approval of anyone else.\n\nChris has a hot date at 5:30 p.m. But, at lunch time, Chris learned that the hot date was at 5:30 p.m. in Ohio and not an hour later at 5:30 p.m. in Indiana, but the library's official closing time is 5 p.m. in Indiana, because Ohio was observing daylight savings time, but Indian was not, at the time when this happened.\n\nChris, as the sole government official in charge of the library, decides to close the library before its posted closing time at 4:00 p.m. Indiana time (5 p.m. Ohio time) in order to be able to make it to the hot date.\n\nChris quietly asks everyone left in the library to leave at 4 p.m. Indiana time, and everyone but you does. But you, who are homeless, really want to stay the extra hour before getting out in the cold and finding a bridge to sleep under, so you refuse to leave saying that the library is still open until 5 p.m. Indiana time, as stated in its posted hours.\n\nChris orders you to leave and warns you that he is calling the police to remove you if you don't do so voluntarily. The police arrive and restate the complaint of Chris. The police arrest you for trespassing and you are charged with this crime in the appropriate court by the appropriate prosecuting attorney.\n\nYou had done nothing wrong whatsoever prior to being asked to leave and refusing to do so. But, Chris has not violated your constitutional rights by ordering you removed for some unconstitutional reason. Chris then goes on the hot date; it is love at first sight, and Chris gets married the next week. As an apology for putting you out for the sole convenience of Chris, Chris invites you to the wedding.\n\nDo you have a valid defense to the criminal trespassing charge on the grounds that the librarian's actions were unconstitutional? No. You might have a \"good faith claim of right\" defense, however, to the criminal charges.\n\nDo you have a valid claim for money damages for a violation of your constitutional rights? No.\n\nIndeed, ordering you removed for \"no reason\" that has anything to do with your conduct, as in this case, is probably more likely to be legal and constitutional, than having you removed for \"some reason\" other than just \"because I the librarian say so\" that doesn't involve wrongdoing on your part.\n\n*A Variation In The Hypothetical*\n\nIf instead, your were being ordered to leave the library because you were wearing an National Rifle Association cap (and the library didn't prohibit wearing caps), this affirmative reason, which is contrary to the First Amendment freedom of expression, would be a violation of your constitutional rights, which would definitely be a basis for a civil lawsuit against the librarian and police involved in you being arrested.\n\nI don't know the details of constitutional defenses in criminal law well enough to know if the violation of your constitutional rights would be a valid defense to the criminal trespassing charge (or a failure to obey a police officer's order to leave charge) resulting from you failing to leave in that circumstance, and I can see legitimate arguments both ways.

A prosecutor can't bring a case unless he knows who did it. And, the police may be wise not to try to investigate a crime that previous experience has proven to them is a dead end most of the time for a crime of modest economic value.\n\nMost cases of simple larceny are never solved. And, institutionally, the police have to balance the cost of investigating the crime against the seriousness of the crime. Murders and kidnappings are almost always going to take priority for police resources over stolen phones, particularly if investigating the phone theft may require international cooperation that makes the investigation more costly.\n\nA key point is that the mere fact that a phone is pawned doesn't mean that the person pawning it is necessarily committing a crime, so even if you find out where the phone is in some pawn shop (possibly in Albania or Turkey, by now), that doesn't mean that the job is over. That person could have bought it innocently and at fair market value from a flea market, from someone who could have gotten it from someone who received it innocently as a gift, from a friend of a criminal fence, who may have bought it not innocently from a true thief. In fact, because criminals respond to incentives like anyone else, it is far more likely that the phone was swiftly \"laundered\" along the lines I suggest in this example, than it is that it is still in the possession of someone close to the thief.\n\nBut, only the fence and the thief would have criminal liability. \n\nIt is a lot harder to solve the crime of a stolen cell phone than you would think, and the agency may simply not be able to justify the resources it would take to investigate that case properly to a situation where someone had a phone stole that was worth maybe 400 Euros in used condition.\n\nThe more you can do to solve the crime, the more likely it is that they will find that it is worth further investigating until a thief can be identified and apprehended.

In California, [Penal Code sect. 518](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=518-527) defines extortion:\n\n> Extortion is the obtaining of property from another, with his consent,\n>  or the obtaining of an official act of a public officer, induced by a\n>  wrongful use of force or fear, or under color of official right.\n\nThe statutes do not clarify what \"wrongfully\" means, and the Calcrim jury instructions are also no help. I presume that this distinguishes the case where you create fear in the perpetrator and solicit payment for silence, versus the perpetrator becomes fearful on his own and offers money to \"compensate\" you (which is legal). So then sect. 519, states what can induce fear: \n\n> Fear, such as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat of\n>  any of the following:\n> \n> \n> ...\n>  2\\. To accuse the individual threatened, or a relative of his or her, or a member of his or her family, of a crime.\n> \n> \n> 3. To expose, or to impute to him, her, or them a deformity, disgrace, or crime.\n\nYou would be threatening cause of fear number 2 (and 3\\). Then the question arises, were you successful? Note that extortion is defined in terms of *obtaining* property. If you actually obtain the property, that violates section 520:\n\n> Every person who extorts any money or other property from another,\n>  under circumstances not amounting to robbery or carjacking, by means\n>  of force, or any threat, such as is mentioned in Section 519, shall be\n>  punished by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170\n>  for two, three or four years.\n\nIf you only make the threat, and the threat is written, then per sect. 523, the same punishment results:\n\n> Every person who, with intent to extort any money or other property\n>  from another, sends or delivers to any person any letter or other\n>  writing, whether subscribed or not, expressing or implying, or adapted\n>  to imply, any threat such as is specified in Section 519, is\n>  punishable in the same manner as if such money or property were\n>  actually obtained by means of such threat.\n\nBut otherwise (if you do not obtain the property, and the threat is not written), per sect 524 there is a lesser penalty:\n\n> Every person who attempts, by means of any threat, such as is\n>  specified in Section 519 of this code, to extort money or other\n>  property from another is punishable by imprisonment in the county jail\n>  not longer than one year or in the state prison or by fine not\n>  exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000\\), or by both such fine and\n>  imprisonment.\n\nThere is no law prohibiting you from telling a person that they must return the money they scammed from you, and there is no law requiring you to report an attempt to scam. The line that you are not allowed to cross is creating a fear that you will report them to the police if they do not give you some amount of their property.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John was scammed out of $5,000 by a fraudulent online investment scheme.

He is attempting to obtain property (the $5,000) from another person through the wrongful use of fear, specifically by threatening to accuse the individual of a crime (theft by deception). Since the threat was made in writing (via email), it falls under Section 523 of the California Penal Code, which states that written threats of extortion are punishable in the same manner as if the money was actually obtained. This makes it a full act of extortion, not just attempted extortion, even if John doesn't receive the money.

Could it be because the job of interpreting laws is of the judiciary? And that is why the laws are purposedly left vague?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In countries with separation of powers, laws may be more vague in order to allow for flexibility and adaptability in their interpretation and application. This is because the judiciary, which is one of the branches of government with the power to interpret laws, plays a key role in determining the meaning and application of laws in practice.\n\nThe separation of powers doctrine aims to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful by dividing power among different branches. The judiciary, as an independent branch, has the power to interpret laws and ensure that they are consistent with the Constitution and other laws. This means that the judiciary has a degree of discretion in interpreting laws, and laws may be written in a more general and flexible way to allow for this.\n\nAdditionally, laws in these countries are often written to be applicable to a wide range of situations and cases. This is because it is difficult to predict all of the different ways that a law may be applied, and to anticipate all of the specific circumstances that may arise. Therefore, laws are often written in a more general way so that they can be applied in a variety of situations.\n\nIn short, laws in countries with separation of power may be more vague because they are written to allow for flexibility and adaptability in their interpretation and application, and to be applicable in a wide range of situations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why countries with separation of powers doctrines tend to have more vague laws?\n\nA) To prevent the executive branch from having too much control over law interpretation\nB) To allow for flexibility in judicial interpretation and adaptation to various situations\nC) To make it easier for legislators to pass laws without specific details\nD) To confuse citizens and make it harder for them to understand their rights\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Countries with separation of powers doctrines often have more vague laws to allow for flexibility in judicial interpretation and adaptation to various situations. This approach recognizes the judiciary's role in interpreting laws and ensures that laws can be applied to a wide range of circumstances that may not be foreseeable at the time of writing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the separation of powers does limit the executive branch's control, this is not the primary reason for vague laws.\n\nOption C is partially true in that vague laws might be easier to pass, but this is not the main intent behind their vagueness in systems with separation of powers.\n\nOption D is incorrect and goes against the principles of good governance.

That is, would the Republican have to nominate the new presidential candidate, or is the presidential candidacy constitutionally inherited by the corresponding VP candidate? Furthermore, would Pence have the standing to participate in debates as both the VP candidate against Harris and as the presidential candidate against Biden?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There isn't a single \"candidacy\". Each of the 50 states and DC holds an election for a slate of electors, and those electors later participate in the actual election for President and Vice President in the Electoral College.\n\nFor each state's election for electors, the ballot usually prints the name of the \"candidate\" for President and Vice President submitted by the party. The rules on under what circumstances the names on the ballot can be changed varies by state, and it may also depend on how close to election date it is, as it may be infeasible to change it once ballots have started being printed.\n\nHowever, even if a state's ballots print the name of certain candidates for President and VP in the election for the slate of electors, that does not necessarily mean that those electors, once chosen, will necessarily have to vote for those candidates. So if a party's candidate withdraws too close to the election for the ballots to be changed, or withdraws after the election but before the Electoral College votes, the party's leadership will probably instruct all of the electors of that party (i.e. electors in the states that that party's candidate for President won in) to vote for a new ticket of President and VP in the Electoral College.\n\nWhether the electors will or can follow those instructions is a little tricky. Some states have laws requiring electors to pledge to vote for the Presidential and VP candidates that won in that state, and I am not sure whether the parties can change the Presidential and VP candidates after the election. This would vary by state. In some states, the pledge requirement has no penalty for violation; in some states, there is a fine; and in some states, the state will replace an elector who does not vote for the pledged candidate. (And the Supreme Court ruled in *Chiafalo v. Washington* (2020\\) that it is legal for states to fine and/or replace faithless electors.) Again, you would need to look at the specific state's law to see if there is an exception for if the Presidential/VP candidate withdraws.\n\n---\n\nAs for debates, as a commenter noted, they are run by the Commission on Presidential Debates, a private corporation, so it would be completely up to that corporation to decide who would be invited to which debates.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: If a presidential candidate withdraws from the race after state ballots have been printed but before the Electoral College votes, what is most likely to happen?\n\nA) The vice presidential candidate automatically becomes the new presidential candidate in all states\nB) Each state independently decides whether to allow a replacement candidate on the ballot\nC) The party leadership instructs their electors to vote for a new ticket, but success depends on state laws\nD) The election is postponed until new ballots can be printed with a replacement candidate\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. If a presidential candidate withdraws late in the process, after ballots have been printed, the party leadership is likely to instruct their electors to vote for a new ticket of President and Vice President in the Electoral College.

This is called a \"work based on the Program\" on the GPLv2\\.\n\nIn this case, however, it seems that your own software does not include software covered by the GPLv2, but you want to put it onto an SD card together with software covered by the GPLv2\\. That would most likely fall under \"mere aggregation of another work\", as long as your software and the other software do not interact very closely (such as dynamic linking).\n\nTo quote the [GPLv2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html):\n\n> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n>  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n>  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n>  the scope of this License.\n\nSo in that case the GPLv2 does not cover your program. You will still have to supply the source code for the GPLv2 software on the SD card. This is covered by section 3 of the GPLv2\\. Basically, you have two options:\n\n* send along the complete source code for all the software (would be quite bothersome for a complete distro)\n* *or* provide a written offer to provide the source code on demand to anyone who asks (you may charge for this, but only to cover your cost)\n\nGPLv2 contains a third option, but that only applies to non\\-commercial distribution.\n\n---\n\nPractically speaking, it should be enough to include a README.txt or similar explaining that the SD card contains software covered by GPLv2, and that you will provide the source code on demand for a certain, reasonable fee (say $5 or $10 per CD).\n\nIn practice, it is unlikely that anyone would ask for this, as the source code can usually be downloaded for free elsewhere, but if someone does ask, you just charge them $5 and send a CD.\n\nOf course, to reduce legal risks it may be prudent to contact a lawyer for your jurisdiction, as this is only general advice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a product that includes their proprietary software along with a Linux distribution and other open-source software packages, all bundled on an SD card for Raspberry Pi.

According to the GPLv2 license, when distributing software covered by this license, the distributor must make the source code available. In this case, since the developer's proprietary software is likely considered \"mere aggregation\" with the GPLv2 components, they are not required to release their own source code. However, for the GPLv2-licensed parts (Linux distribution and other open-source packages), the developer must provide access to the source code.\n\nThe most practical way to fulfill this obligation, as mentioned in the documentation, is to include a written offer to provide the source code on demand.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal situation?\n\nA) The retailer is legally obligated to sell the laptop at $99 because the website listing constitutes a binding offer.\n\nB) The customer's order at $99 is considered the offer, which the retailer can choose to accept or reject.\n\nC) The website listing is an invitation to treat, and no contract exists until the retailer confirms the order at the stated price.\n\nD) The retailer must honor the $99 price unless they can prove it was a clear typographical error.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In US contract law, a product listing on a website is typically considered an invitation to treat (or invitation to bargain), not a binding offer. The customer's order at $99 would be considered the offer. The retailer has the right to accept or reject this offer before a contract is formed. No binding contract exists until the retailer confirms the order at the stated price. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the website listing is not typically considered a binding offer. \n\nOption B is partially correct in that the customer's order can be considered an offer, but it doesn't fully capture the concept of invitation to treat.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no general legal requirement to honor a clearly erroneous price, though some jurisdictions may have specific consumer protection laws that could affect this.\n\nThis question tests understanding of contract formation, offers, and invitations to treat in e-commerce contexts."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9472/the-limit-of-copyright-for-generics", "docs_id": 9472, "title": "The limit of copyright for &quot;generics&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If something is \"generic\" then there can be a copyright question.

All three of the possibilities that you suggest (and more) are the right answer in some circumstances.\n\n**Choice of law by agreement**\n\nUnless the choice of law for some reason violates public policy (e.g. because the law of country A does not make something illegal, but the law of country B where the contract is to be performed does make something illegal) a [choice of law made within a clause an international contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_of_law_clause) that has any connection to the parties or the contract will be honored (which is your possibility number 2\\).\n\n**General choice of law rules when there isn't a contractual choice of law**\n\nBefore you have a contract, the issues of contract formation, and other contract law issues to the extent that there is no choice of law clause in the contract that does not violate public policy, could be governed by the law of the place where the contract is signed, by the law of A or B since they are parties to the contract, or, for example, by the law of the place where the contract is to be performed.\n\nThe leading choice of law rule in the United States in these circumstances is to apply the law of the one of those options with the most significant relationship to the contract, which is a test that is just as fuzzy and indeterminate and open to case by case interpretation as it seems.\n\nAlso, there isn't necessarily only one set of laws that will apply to the contract. The legal term for applying different laws to different issues that arise in the same legal case is called [d\u00e9pe\u00e7age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9pe%C3%A7age).\n\nFor example, the law of the place where the contract is signed might govern the issue of contract formation, while the law of the place where the contract is to be performed might govern performance of the contract.\n\nConsumer protection laws are often applied to contracts with consumers based upon the place where the consumer is domiciled or is located when the contract is entered into by the parties.\n\nIt isn't unusual for a contract to be subject to the law of more than one place on issues other than issues of contract formation, and other than on issues of contract interpretation. But, any given legal issue related to a contract is ordinarily subject to only a single jurisdictions laws (unless it is a public policy regulation).\n\nUnless anyone argues in court that the law from another place should apply to an issue and that law is different from the legal rule in the place where the court is located, in a court case, a court will apply the law of the place where the court is located (called the \"law of the forum.\"\n\n**Exceptions to the general rule**\n\nThere are some international treaties which create exceptions to the general rule and instead provide that a contract will be governed by law established in an international treaty (which is your possibility three). There are at least two such treaties to which the United States is a party which are notable and come up with some frequency.\n\nOne of them is the CISG, which is the [Convention on the International Sale of Goods](https://uncitral.un.org/en/texts/salegoods) that governs international contracts for the sale of goods that are not expressly excepted from the treaty (mostly business to business sales of goods), when both the seller and the buyer are associated with a country that is a party to the treaty.\n\nAnother is the [New York Convention](https://player.siriusxm.com/#/main) a.k.a. the \"Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards\" a.k.a. the \"New York Arbitration Convention\" which governs governs contracts with arbitration clauses in them that involve parties from different countries that are both parties to the Convention.\n\nIn addition to these treaty provisions, some international contracts are governed in the United States by [admiralty law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_law), rather than by the federal and state laws that would otherwise apply to these contracts. Obviously, the affected contracts are contracts with a maritime dimension, either in international waters or in the \"navigable waters of the United States.\"\n\nI am certain that this list of exceptions governed by special laws is not complete (e.g. certain international treaties apply to contracts involving international airline travel), but the question doesn't identify anything about the contracts that make them stand out.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A German company and a Canadian company sign a contract for the sale of industrial equipment.

This test considers various factors, including the place of contracting, the place of negotiation, the place of performance, the location of the subject matter, and the domicile or place of business of the parties. While options A, B, and C all represent potential choices, they each focus on only one factor. Option D, which refers to the law of the country with the most significant relationship to the contract, is the most comprehensive and flexible approach. It allows for consideration of all relevant factors to determine which country's law has the closest connection to the contract and the parties' transaction.

This fee is not a consequence for any of my misbehavior, is not mentioned in my contract, and they are not allowing anyone to opt out of using the online system to avoid the fee. To me this seems unfair and possibly mildly illegal, since I did not consent to this in any way. **Is my landlord within their rights to do this?** \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am a landlord and not a lawyer. For this reason, I have not done any legal research, however, given my experience, I will answer with a short:\n\n**No. Your landlord likely cannot do this.**\n\nHere is my reasoning behind this.\n\nEach state law is different or course. I am answering as a licensed and bonded landlord and property manager in Pennsylvania and Maryland.\n\nWhether you have signed a lease with the landlord or not, you are under a lease provided by the state as state law where no lease was provided. This is for your protection. You will have to read the lease carefully. You will find your lease has terms which includes your monthly rent and any fees governing late fees and any other fee typically covering pets, additional persons not on the lease, parking, etc. No lease can contain an open clause that allows the landlord to simply add fees at will. This would not be enforceable under contract law.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, no additional burden can be added within the term of the lease and in many cases requires notice even for month to month leases. For example, if you have a 1 year lease, the terms of the lease cannot be changed until the lease term has expired 1 year after signing and even then may require 30 day notice under the law.\n\nIn other words, if it is not in the lease or in the law, the landlord cannot change the terms of the lease to create an additional burden. It is a contract and falls under contract law, landlord tenant law, and possibly other laws.\n\nWhile I understand the desire to have electronic payment, an additional fee is unnecessary and the requirement not likely legal. For example, not everyone is able to or can afford to make online payments. It requires a computer, computer skills, an Internet connection, etc. Even without these things, it could require making a payment using a computer at the library or at a payment center. Not everyone is able to travel at will such as the elderly or poor. Additionally, this likely requires a bank account. Many do not have bank accounts and make payments using a card such as one provided for social security or disability payments. Often, these folks have little options except to use cash, money orders, or cashiers check. Simply requiring an electronic payment, even if specified within the lease, can be a burden that is not enforceable or wise.\n\nAlso consider State and Federal Law. It may likely be illegal to refuse cash payments or payments via money orders or cashiers checks. While some businesses can require payments other than cash, many businesses cannot refuse cash payments. It has been a long while since I researched this, however, as an example, a retail business likely cannot refuse cash.\n\nAlso consider that electronic payments of one type may not be legal. For example, while it is wise to require a variety of electronic payment options, requiring only one payment method may require a burden that cannot be enforced. It is possible that some states require that if an electronic payment is to be required, then a variety of payment methods will be required. Some may require accepting payments from payment centers which can be a store or bank.\n\nOne last consideration. Some states define commercial rental businesses as being more than *X* units and have different laws that govern how they can operate. These are often significant. It is possible that if your landlord is a commercial rental business, they are required to take cash, checks, money orders, cashiers checks, etc., and require an office with standard office hours for such things.\n\nFurther research on this may be required and would be wise.\n\nAs a personal opinion, electronic payments are not always as easy to track or as convenient as your landlord thinks. I used to make and take electronic payments and have stopped simply because it is a pain. Each payment method has its rules and laws that are harder to keep track of. Personally, if a tenant wants to pay me in cash, my hand is out while I say \"Thank You.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A landlord in Utah informs tenants that they are switching to an online payment system and charging a $20 fee for its use.

Based on the information provided, the landlord likely cannot legally charge this fee or mandate online-only payments if these terms were not specified in the original lease agreement. The documentation emphasizes that landlords cannot unilaterally add new fees or change lease terms during the lease period unless explicitly allowed in the original agreement or by law. Additionally, mandating a single payment method may create undue burden on tenants and potentially violate laws requiring landlords to accept various forms of payment, including cash. The landlord's action appears to violate contract law and potentially state and federal regulations governing rental agreements and payment acceptance."}}
