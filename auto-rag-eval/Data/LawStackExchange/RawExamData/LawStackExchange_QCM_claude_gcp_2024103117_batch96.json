According to \u00a714-303 of Title 14 of the Maryland Code, after declaring a state of emergency, the Governor has the authority to \"promulgate reasonable orders, rules, or regulations\" necessary to protect life and property or to control and terminate the public emergency.

How common is it for parties in criminal trials to give notices like that and point judges to reliable sources of the facts referred to in the notices?\n\nIntuitively I would expect that *expert witnesses* are required to testify about \"facts capable of accurate and ready determination\"\n\u2014 so that they could be cross\\-examined. If notices like provided for in the cited law above are indeed allowed in criminal trial that may seem to be sort of circumvention to avoid cross\\-examination. Is it not?\n\nFor example, there is a case involving a Labrador retriever attacking domestic ducks. It is a well\\-known fact (at least among owners of this particular dog breed) that chasing and catching ducks is in their blood/nature: they normally will do it as soon as they *see* ducks \u2014 as opposed to having to be encouraged/commanded. Assuming a reliable published source of this fact exists, can it be given in notice pursuant to the cited section? Or can this knowledge only be put before the court by way of expert witness e.g. a Labrador retriever breeder?\n\n(Any common law jurisdiction)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is known as [Judicial notice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_notice) and is used in many jurisdictions. It is normally supposed to be used only for facts about which there could be no possible controversy. The Wikipedia article linked above mentions such examples as \"which day of the week corresponded to a particular calendar date or the approximate time at sunset.\" It can also be used to include the text of a law from another jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to the *Free Legal Encyclopedia* (FLE) [article](https://law.jrank.org/pages/7886/Judicial-Notice.html):\n\n> When a court takes judicial notice of a certain fact, it obviates the need for parties to prove the fact in court. Ordinarily, facts that relate to a case must be presented to the judge or jury through testimony or tangible evidence. However, if each fact in a case had to be proved through such presentation, the simplest case would take weeks to complete. To avoid burdening the judicial system, all legislatures have approved court rules that allow a court to recognize facts that constitute common knowledge without requiring proof from the parties.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The most common judicially noticed facts include the location of streets, buildings, and geographic areas; periods of time; business customs; historical events; and federal, state, and INTERNATIONAL LAW. Legislatures also maintain statutes that give courts the power to recognize certain facts in specific situations. For example, in Idaho any document affixed with the official seal of the state PUBLIC UTILITIES commission must be judicially noticed by all courts (Idaho Code \u00a7 61\\-209 \\[1996]). In Hawaii, when a commercial vehicle is cited for violating vehicle equipment regulations, a trial court must take judicial notice of the driver's subordinate position if the driver works for a company that owns the vehicle (Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 291\\-37 \\[1995]).\n\nIn the United States, [Rule 201 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE)](https://www.rulesofevidence.org/article-ii/rule-201/) covers this. It reads:\n\n> (a) Scope. This rule governs judicial notice of an adjudicative fact only, not a legislative fact.\n> \n> \n> (b) Kinds of Facts That May Be Judicially Noticed. The court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it:\n> \n> \n> (b) (1\\) is generally known within the trial court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction; or\n> \n> \n> (b) (2\\) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\n> \n> \n> (c) Taking Notice. The court:\n> \n> \n> (c) (1\\) may take judicial notice on its own; or\n> \n> \n> (c) (2\\) must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information.\n> \n> \n> (d) Timing. The court may take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.\n> \n> \n> (e) Opportunity to Be Heard. On timely request, a party is entitled to be heard on the propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed. If the court takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is still entitled to be heard.\n> \n> \n> (f) Instructing the Jury. In a civil case, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed fact as conclusive. In a criminal case, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.\n\nNote that subsection (e) preserves the rights of parties to be heard on whether taking notice is proper in a given case. None also that subsection (f) makes it clear that this procedure may be used in both civil and criminal cases.\n\nThe Wikipedia article (linked above) says that most US states closely follow FRE 201 in their rules of evidence. (So does the FLE article.) Note also that the NZ law quoted in the question is very similar even in wording to FRE 201\\. The article mentions similar practices in Canada and Australia.\n\nThe Wikipedia article also says:\n\n> Legal disputes about foreign affairs are generally settled by judicial notice by obtaining the information directly from the office of the Secretary of State (in the United States). For example, if a litigant in an extradition hearing attempted to argue that Israel was not a sovereign state, a statement from the Secretary of State that the U.S. recognized Israel as a sovereign state would settle the issue and no evidence could be led to the contrary. (In the United Kingdom, similar result could be had to information from the Foreign Secretary.)\n\nNote that under US FRE 201 no fact that enters the case under judicial notice is binding on a jury in a criminal case, and a defendant (or the defendant's lawyer) may be heard to offer contrary evidence. Thus the practice does not offer a way to evade cross\\-examination of a proper expert wittiness if used properly. Similar rules probably exist in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe FLE article linked above goes on to state:\n\n> The danger of judicial notice is that, if abused, it can deprive the fact finder of the opportunity to decide a contestable fact in a case. In *Walker v. Halliburton Services*, 654 So. 2d 365 (La. App. 1995\\), Johnny Walker fell from a tank truck approximately ten feet to a concrete floor. Walker sought WORKERS' COMPENSATION benefits for his injuries, and his claim was denied by the Office of Workers' Compensation.\n> \n> \n> At the application hearing, the hearing officer stated that it was her experience that a soft\\-tissue injury heals in six weeks. She then took judicial notice of the fact that a soft\\-tissue injury heals in six weeks\u2014preventing Walker from contesting that proposition\u2014and disallowed Walker's claim. On appeal the Louisiana Court of Appeal, Third Circuit, reversed the decision and ordered the payment of workers' compensation benefits. According to the court, it was a clear error of law for the hearing officer to take judicial notice of such intricate medical knowledge.\n\nConsidering the example in the question of a Labrador retriever attacking domestic ducks. I would think this would not be a proper subject for judicial notice, because it would be \"subject to reasonable dispute\". An expert might testify that this happens in many but not all dogs of the breed, or under certain conditions but not others. So it might be comparable to the soft tissue injury case where notice was improper. However, if all parties agreed that such notice might be taken, then perhaps there would be no issue, as no party had been deprived of a right to contest the alleged fact. In such a case this might be considered a *stipulation* rather than an example of judicial notice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal trial, the prosecution wants to introduce the fact that Labrador retrievers have a natural instinct to chase and catch ducks.

While judicial notice can be used in criminal trials, it's typically reserved for facts that are not subject to reasonable dispute. The behavior of Labrador retrievers might be considered contestable and not universally known. However, if the court does decide to take judicial notice:\n\n1.

In a criminal trial, the jury is not bound to accept a judicially noticed fact as conclusive (as per FRE 201(f) and similar rules).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the court is not obligated to take judicial notice even if a reliable source is provided, especially for potentially disputable facts.\n\nOption B is too absolute. While expert testimony might be more appropriate in this case, judicial notice is not categorically prohibited for this type of information.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in criminal trials, judicially noticed facts are not binding on the jury, unlike in civil trials."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3543/is-debt-a-publicly-tradeable-commodity", "docs_id": 3543, "title": "Is debt a publicly tradeable commodity?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I have debt \u2013 student loans or something.

Is the landlord simply allowed to to modify the contract for an incoming tenant?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is the landlord simply allowed to to modify the contract for an incoming tenant?\n\nNo. When you have a joint tenancy, an end of tenancy comes in effect for all tenants. It's a single tenancy, so it can't just end for one person and leave the rest unaffected. \n\nThe end of tenancy procedure takes a slightly different route:\nFor a fixed term tenancy ALL tenants and the landlord need to agree, if anyone wishes to move out, or if the landlord wants to change some of the terms of the agreement. \nFor a periodic tenancy either tenant can serve a months notice and end the tenancy. \n\nThe landlord is then free to draft a new, modified tenancy agreement with the rest of you and the new tenant that comes in. The landlord is free to introduce changes to the new tenancy agreement, like increased rent, and you have two options \\- sign it or move out.\n\nSigning a new tenancy means the review period will reset, however, the landlord can simply introduce an intermediary rent increase now, and then add the rest of the planned amount after 6 or 12 months, when the tenancy review date is.\n\nAnother option for all of you is to negotiate for the landlord to draft individual tenancy agreements for each of you (having their own room, I assume), which will make it unnecessary to re\\-draft the tenancy agreement each time a tenant wishes to move out. It's more hassle for them, but better for you individually. This will also make you not liable to pay for damages that other tenants have caused. \n\nHere is more information on [tenancy agreements](http://www.thetenantsvoice.co.uk/advice_from_us/tenancy-agreements-assured-shorthold-tenancy-ast/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a joint tenancy agreement with 4 tenants, one tenant is leaving and being replaced.

The landlord is not required to wait until the renewal date to make changes, but cannot make changes without agreement from all parties (ruling out option B). The landlord cannot unilaterally increase rent without a new agreement (ruling out option D).

If you patronize an in\\-network practicioner, it is fairly easy for them to be pretty accurate in that estimate, but there can be some small errors when it turns out the insurance company thinks one thing and the doctor thinks something else (the doctor generally loses). This is because an in\\-network provider has a contract with the insurance company that says what they can charge and what they will receive. They could charge the patient more than the maximum allowed by the insurance company, but that would be a violation of their contract with the insurance company. It is very common that a doctor bills for a large sum, accepts much less than that and passes on a specific amount to the patient as their responsibility.\n\nAn out\\-of\\-network provider doesn't have those limits on what they can charge, also they may be less accurate in estimating patient responsibility. Indeed, an out\\-of\\-network provider could simply hand the patient a bill and a receipt, leaving it to the patient to get reimbursed, especially if the insurance company is a known pain in the neck. Insurance companies encourage you to patronize in\\-network by (1\\) limiting what the doctor can charge, (2\\) paying a greater portion of the bill, (3\\) having separate in\\-network vs. out\\-of\\-network yearly maxima plus often higher out\\-of\\-network maxima.\n\nThe doctor can *charge* any amount he wants to the insurance company, in any event \u2013 the insurance company is responsible for deciding what they will pay (a doctor can symbolically overcharge and accept lower levels of payment, if he wants to).

Out-of-network providers are not bound by the same contractual limitations as in-network providers when it comes to billing insurance companies. They can legally charge higher amounts to insurance companies than what they quote to patients. This practice, while potentially frustrating for patients, is generally legal under contract law. The discrepancy between the quoted price and the billed amount is not necessarily fraud, but rather a result of the complex relationships between patients, providers, and insurance companies in out-of-network scenarios.

An example is [8 USC 1182(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182), which says\n\n> Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any\n>  class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the\n>  interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such\n>  period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or\n>  any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the\n>  entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nExplicit constitutional powers are not numerous, but include commanding the armed forces and overseeing execution of national law by appointing and removing executive officers. POTUS is constitutionally the federal official responsible for relations with foreign nations, so he can make treaties (subject to Senate approval) and [executive agreements](https://fam.state.gov/fam/11fam/11fam0720.html) (not subject to approval), can appoint US ambassadors and can receive foreign ambassadors. Executive agreements have the greatest potential for being an avenue for POTUS to act contrary to Congress, but they are limited to agreements pursuant to legislation, treaty and constitutional authority (and, as agreements, are not unilateral). \n\nCongress was able to somewhat limit presidential military authority by statutes such as the [War Powers Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33), and in the policy statement at [50 USC 1541](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1541), Congress declares\n\n> The constitutional powers of the President as Commander\\-in\\-Chief to\n>  introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into\n>  situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly\n>  indicated by the circumstances, are exercised only pursuant to (1\\) a\n>  declaration of war, (2\\) specific statutory authorization, or (3\\) *a\n>  national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its\n>  territories or possessions, or its armed forces*\n\nThe law limits the length of engagement of the military, without Congressional approval, but there is no toothful restriction on deploying the military for up to 60 days.\n\n[50 USC Ch. 34](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-34) more generally addressed \"national emergencies\", and started by declaring an end to all existing declared emergencies. Other sections of the law require Congress to be notified and emergencies to be published in the Federal Register. An emergency can be terminated by POTUS or by act of Congress, and after 6 months (and every 6 months thereafter), Congress shall meet to discuss the emergency. POTUS must also annually re\\-declare the emergency to keep it in force.\n\nThese are procedural requirements, not content requirements. In general, you wold have to go through Title 50 to check for particular powers granted by Congress\n\nThe [International Emergency Economic Powers Act](http://International%20Emergency%20Economic%20Powers%20Act) grants powers to POTUS, with the following limit:\n\n> (a) Any authority granted to the President by section 1702 of this\n>  title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary\n>  threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the\n>  United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of\n>  the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with\n>  respect to such threat.\n> \n> \n> (b) The authorities granted to the President by section 1702 of this\n>  title may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary\n>  threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared\n>  for purposes of this chapter and may not be exercised for any other\n>  purpose. Any exercise of such authorities to deal with any new threat\n>  shall be based on a new declaration of national emergency which must\n>  be with respect to such threat.\n\nwhich appears more limiting than the War Powers Act.

There are procedural requirements, such as notifying Congress and publishing declarations in the Federal Register. Some laws, like the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, also place content limitations on when and how these powers can be used.

Is this information intended to be accessible or inaccessible or neither per se?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a live political issue. Currently, the various datasets are incomplete and have known accuracy issues. Considering a particular parcel of land:\n\n* It might not be in the Land Registry at all. About 85% of land in England and Wales is registered, and less in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n* Scottish registered land might only appear on the paper \"Register of Sasines\", as opposed to the more recent electronic database, or potentially in even older county\\-specific sasine registers.\n* The owner might be a company, partnership, trust, etc., rather than a natural person.\n* The ownership and control of that company (etc.) can be hard to trace. Companies House data is not verified; companies can be incorporated overseas; the trusts register is not publicly searchable; things can be muddled. Raw data might not show that a dozen properties, each owned by a single company that owns nothing else, are in fact ultimately controlled by a particular person of interest.\n* Different people may own the freehold, or a leasehold, or have various other forms of ownership or control. Even a long\\-term tenancy may be of interest for database purposes.\n\nBecause of continuing interest in anti\\-money laundering, tax evasion, and general accumulation of wealth, there have been plans to have a new \"register of beneficial ownership\". Such a register would record, for each plot of land, the name of the human beings who actually own and control it in the end. In the anticipated structure, each of those people would have an identifying number, and so we would get your proposed reverse index where you could look up a person and see what they owned.\n\nThe register introduced by the [Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/10/contents) is the \"[Register of Overseas Entities](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-an-overseas-entity)\" (ROE). However, as the name suggests, it only covers companies/partnerships/etc. from outside the UK. It's operated by Companies House. Overseas entities who have dealt in UK land since 1999/2014/2022 (depending on which part of the UK the land was in) have to list their beneficial owners. Because this is new, it is also not very complete yet: it only went live on 1 August 2022 and no penalties apply until the deadline of 31 January 2023\\.\n\nIn Scotland, the \"[Register of Persons Holding a Controlled Interest in Land](https://rci.ros.gov.uk/)\" (RCI) is meant to do the same but not just for overseas entities. It is live since 1 April 2022 and the initial registration period ends on 1 April 2023, so again it may not be very complete just yet.\n\nThere will likely be more political tussle over potential creation of a more extensive UK\\-wide register.

Key points supporting this include:\n\n1. Not all land is registered (only about 85% in England and Wales).\n2. Different systems exist for different parts of the UK (e.g., Register of Sasines in Scotland).\n3. Ownership can be complex, involving companies, trusts, and overseas entities.\n4.

It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV.''\n\nHowever, in the 120\\+ years which followed Holmes' speech, it has been observed (see, for example, [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the\\-supreme\\-court\\-is\\-allergic\\-to\\-math/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-is-allergic-to-math/)) that the Supreme Court has not been very receptive to statistical/quantitative evidence.\n\nI would like to know of any counterexamples to that observation.\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is far from obvious what would qualify as a \u201cSupreme Court cases decided based on statistical evidence\u201d, actually, it is far from obvious what constitutes \u201cstatistical evidence\u201d. At the minimum, I expect that it is evidence which at least counts numbers of examples of something, and uses that number to reach a legal conclusion. For example \u201cOf the two candidates, Smith received 10,000 votes and Jones received 10,001 votes. The wording of the statute declares to be the winner that candidate who receives \u2018more than any other candidate\u2019, therefore we hold that Jones won\u201d. People often supplement raw counts with some measure of \u2018significance\u2019, which can be a significant (sorry about that) factor in discrimination cases, based on disparate impact theories; and also in evaluating forensic evidence (thus DNA evidence was poorly treated until the lawyers figured how to sell it).\n\nAny appeal to statistical hypothesis testing is highly unlikely to ever arise at the level of SCOTUS. That is because (generally\\-speaking, perhaps there are obscure uses baked into law) the law and the legislature do not mandate particular alphas for acceptance of a statistical hypothesis. Instead, admissibility of testimony is (federally, and for half of the states) determined by the [Daubert standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard), encoded as [FRE 702](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702) which requires that \u201cthe testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case\u201d, implicitly subsuming some domain\\-specific standards of hypothesis testing.\n\nTo the extent that DNA evidence is admissible in court and the expert can make a compelling, unrebutted argument for identity (\u201c1 chance in 70 billion\u201d as opposed to \u201c49 chances in 100\\), statistical evidence is routinely accepted (or excluded as inconclusive). SCOTUS does not commonly have [original jurisdiction](https://www.oyez.org/issues/392) so it is very unlikely that they would have ever been presented with trial\\-court level disputes involving words like \u201cBonferroni\u201d or \u201cPearson's chi\\-squared test\u201d.\n\n[This article](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/disparate-statistics) looks at the role of statistics in disparate impact cases in the US. The ruling in [Griggs v. Duke Power](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/401/424/)\ndoes not directly appeal to any statistical reasoning, it indicates simply that an pair of intelligence tests were used as a substitute for a requirement of a high school education, but the tests were not intended \u201cto measure the ability to learn to perform a particular job or category of jobs\u201d. A claim rejected by the lower court was that \u201cthese two requirements operated to render ineligible a **markedly disproportionate number** of Negroes, they were unlawful under Title VII unless shown to be job\\-related\u201d.\nThe dicta of Griggs provides numerous numeric statements such as\n\u201cwhile 34% of white males had completed high school, only 12% of Negro males had done so\u201d, \u201cuse of a battery of tests\u2026 resulted in 58% of whites passing the tests, as compared with only 6% of the blacks\u201d, \u201cthe percentage of white employees who were promoted but who were not high school graduates was nearly identical to the percentage of nongraduates in the entire white workforce\u201d.\n\nA striking mention of statistical concepts cited in Griggs is found in CFR \u00a7 1607, 35 Fed.Reg. 12333 (Aug. 1, 1970\\) which is a requirement that employers using tests have available \u201cdata demonstrating that the test is **predictive of or significantly correlated with** important elements of work behavior which comprise or are relevant to the job or jobs for which candidates are being evaluated\u201d. SCOTUS is absolutely silent on the question of actual numbers in this case, that is taken to be a matter of fact determined by the lower court, and SCOTUS\u2019s only job is to decide if employers can be required to show that a particular test is job\\-related. There is no discussion of what level of asymmetry in numbers is proof of discrimination.\n\nAnother relevant SCOTUS case is [Wards Cove Packing v. Antonio](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/490/642)\nwhich might be seen as a case of SCOTUS being \u201cunfriendly\u201d to statistics, but the ruling simply holds that proving statistical significant between variables is insufficient. In fact in the holding SCOTUS identifies the Court of Appeals error as being\n\n> a comparison of the percentage of cannery workers who are nonwhite and\n> the percentage of noncannery workers who are nonwhite makes out a\n> prima facie disparate\\-impact case. Rather, the proper comparison is\n> generally between the racial composition of the at\\-issue jobs and the\n> racial composition of the qualified population in the relevant labor\n> market\n\nIn the above statistical article, other cases are cited where the courts engaged in magnitude inquiries of practical significance. [29 CFR 1607\\.4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/1607.4) states a \u201crule\u201d known as the \u2018four\\-fifths\u201d rule that\n\n> A selection rate for any race, sex, or ethnic group which is less than\n> four\\-fifths (4/5\\) (or eighty percent) of the rate for the group with\n> the highest rate will generally be regarded by the Federal enforcement\n> agencies as evidence of adverse impact, while a greater than\n> four\\-fifths rate will generally not be regarded by Federal enforcement\n> agencies as evidence of adverse impact\n\nhowever the Supreme Court in [Watson v. Fort Worth Bank \\& Tr.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/977/), 487 U.S. 977 finds that this is no more that \u201ca rule of thumb\u201d. [Ricci v. Destefano](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/557/557/) finds that \u201c\\[A] prima facie case of disparate\\-impact liability \\[is] essentially, a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity . . . and nothing more . . . .\u201d, and a prima facie demonstration does not require a disparity of any particular magnitude.\n\nIn short, SCOTUS cases frequently have a \u201cstatistical\u201d underpinning, any time a scientific question arises. By the nature of expert testimony and the Daubert standard, the court does not rule on what constitutes a technically\\-correct statistical test, that is a matter for the trier of fact to decide. Disparate impact cases provide the best opportunity for higher courts to be confronted with statistical arguments. If some law were passed that specifically requires a particular p\\-value on some body of numbers and demographics, the court would have to discern the legislative intent of such a law, and not the majority opinion of some body of scientists as to what is \u201cstatistically correct\u201d.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the Supreme Court's approach to statistical evidence in disparate impact cases?\n\nA) The Supreme Court has consistently rejected all forms of statistical evidence in discrimination cases.\n\nB) The Supreme Court requires a specific p-value or confidence interval to establish disparate impact.\n\nC) The Supreme Court considers statistical disparities as one factor in establishing a prima facie case of disparate impact, but does not mandate a specific threshold or test.\n\nD) The Supreme Court strictly adheres to the \"four-fifths rule\" as the sole determinant of disparate impact.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Supreme Court's approach to statistical evidence in disparate impact cases is nuanced. While it recognizes the importance of statistical disparities, it does not mandate a specific statistical test or threshold. In cases like Griggs v. Duke Power and Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, the Court acknowledged statistical evidence but focused on its practical significance rather than strict numerical thresholds. The Court has referred to the \"four-fifths rule\" as a \"rule of thumb\" rather than a definitive standard. In Ricci v. Destefano, the Court described a prima facie case of disparate impact as requiring \"a threshold showing of a significant statistical disparity ... and nothing more,\" indicating that statistical evidence is relevant but not solely determinative.

This is usually the norm. Because things that obfuscate the code, they make it take longer for a human to figure out how to manipulate it; however, they don't actually prevent a human from doing it; also, once a human has figured it out, he can explain it to others without legal repercussions \\-\\- whether it is to correct a bug, or to cheat.

Therefore, if you must check to box agreeing not to modify the JavaScript code *before* you can download it, then it is protected by law. Otherwise, the author will have to prove that you were aware of his requirements, before he can legally prosecute you. (For example, if he can find a log that shows you read the ToS, and he can reasonably prove that it was you, e.g. by IP address, then he can prosecute you; however, in practice, such things are usually very hard to prove.)

However, if a website requires you to explicitly agree (usually through a \"clickwrap\" agreement where you must click \"I agree\") to terms that forbid code modification, then doing so could be legally binding. Simple statements on a website asking users not to modify code (without requiring explicit agreement) are typically not legally enforceable.

That would allow embedding Like buttons on any page at will and Facebook could only track the users that have already given consent for Facebook. Technically facebook would have been able to run their own JavaScript code on the host page so they could have implemented the consent query on any page if they really wanted to set cookies only after getting consent.\n\nThis would also immediately solve questions such as [Who's liable for GDPR compliance when embedding/hosting a self\\-contained 3rd\\-party website/service?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/50337/34270) and [Who needs to implement Cookie Consent for embedded content?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/55925/34270) because in both cases the host that wants to set non\\-necessary cookies would need to independantly verify they already have been given consent for those cookies. As GDPR doesn't define how such content must be acquired, there could be an UI on the host domain document and then the acquired consent must be explicitly transferred to 3rd party. In practice, the transfer cannot be just \"it's okay\" but \"user has given consent for trackingdomain.com via domain example.com at yyyy\\-mm\\-dd with log id abc123ef\" because GDPR requires that the user must be able to retract the consent later and entity doing the processing must be able to specify the origin for the consent.\n\nIs the current ruling just caused by the interpretation that embedding any content via URL is considered *implicit* consent for the whole domain?\n\nIn practice, this would practically prevent 3rd party cookies for any services the user hasn't expicitly visited previously.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The rulings you refer to are not primarily about cookies or consent. They are about pages who use Facebook services, and claim that Facebook would be the sole data controller. As the ECJ has ruled, this is not the case: causing or contributing to Facebook's processing of personal data can establish a joint controller role. Thus, the admin of a Facebook page ends up being co\\-responsible for the correct use of cookies on that page, and the embedder of a Facebook like button ends up being co\\-responsible for sending visitor data (such as IP addresses) to Facebook.\n\nYou are correct that joint controller situations are messy and potentially difficult to navigate. But the \u201cjoint controller\u201d concept reflects the reality of the legal situation that more than one person/entity can meet the definition of a \u201ccontroller\u201d for a particular processing activity.\n\nIt is possible to avoid joint controller situations, for example when processing activities are structured suitably, or when one party engages the others as data processors. Of course, it would be contrary to Facebook's interests to act as a data processor because FB wants to use the personal data for their own purposes, not solely for the other controller's purposes.\n\nSome detailed notes:\n\n* The Fashion ID case does not involve the *setting* of cookies, it applies more generally to any personal data a browser might send while making a request.\n* Both of these cases are not about Facebook's responsibilities, but about the responsibilities of data controllers that use Facebook's services. You can't just embed/use third party services and argue that you're not responsible for compliance.\n* GDPR does not require explicit records of consent to be stored. Doing so might even violate the data minimisation principle. The GDPR has the weaker requirement that \u201cthe controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data\u201d (Art 7(1\\)). This could perhaps be demonstrated indirectly, e.g. that it is not possible to trigger the processing activity without giving consent.\n* The controller of a page embedding content does not have influence over the use of cookies by that embedded content and would not typically collect consents for that content.\n* Instead, embedding pages typically collect consent for the *loading* of third party content, e.g. \u201cclick to show content from twitter.com\u201d or a greyed\\-out Facebook icon with a toggle next to it.

The website owner becomes co-responsible for the processing of personal data (such as IP addresses) that occurs as soon as the button is loaded, regardless of whether users interact with it. This reflects the reality that multiple entities can meet the definition of a \"controller\" for a particular processing activity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the concept of joint controllership established by the ECJ rulings.

Wikipedia has a [short list of jurisdictions with notable decisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming#Law.2C_regulation_and_taxation) on virtual sales; see the page's references for the official news stories or government documents. Most of the rulings have been positive for virtual\\-goods vendors, though China has banned the sale of *real items* for *virtual currency* (the opposite of your proposed plan) and South Korea has banned the sale of virtual goods for real money outright.\n\nSuch sales incur normal tax responsibilities, just as any other income does. I don't know if any jurisdictions have imposed special legislation that place income limits or special tax rates for income from the sale of virtual goods.\n\n---\n\nIn the case of Steam specifically, the sale of virtual goods is broadly disallowed in Section 2\\.G of the [Steam Subscriber Agreement](http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/), but narrowly allowed in Section 3\\.D. All virtual Steam goods remain the property of Steam, and you have a license to use them, which includes sale in limited circumstances.\n\nThe prohibition in Section 2\\.G reads:\n\n> G. Restrictions on Use of Content and Services\n> \n> \n> ...you are not entitled to: (i) sell, grant a security interest in or transfer reproductions of the Content and Services to other parties in any way, nor to rent, lease or license the Content and Services to others without the prior written consent of Valve, except to the extent expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement (including any Subscription Terms or Rules of Use); ...\n\nAnd the narrow permission to perform trades in the Community Marketplace in Section 3\\.D (per the above \"except to the extent expressly permitted elsewhere in this Agreement\" exception of 2\\.G):\n\n> D.

An example of a Subscription Marketplace is the Steam Community Market.\n\nYou can use the Steam Community Market to trade *items* for real money; this kind of real\\-money sale is explicitly allowed and facilitated by Steam. Separately, you can also trade *giftable games* (N.B.: game trading does *not* support real money) using Steam's trading system. Applying terms to a game\\-trade (like requiring payment external to Stream's trading system) appears to be disallowed by the broad prohibition in 2\\.G, but it's not very clear. The mechanical transfer of the game from one account to another is allowed, but the fact that it is actually a *sale* in a way that is not explicitly allowed seems to make it against the terms of service.

These are necessary conditions for criminal liability for which no corresponding mens rea is necessary. An example would be \u00a7 231 I StGB (\"participation in a brawl\"), which requires that the brawl resulted in grievous bodily harm or a death for it to be punishable. However, the participants need not have mens rea with regard to the grievous bodily harm/death.\n\nAre there crimes in US law (federal or any state) where the objective element contains conditions which don't have to be covered by mens rea? Is there a technical term for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If I'm reading your question properly, you're referring to strict liability. This tends to apply element\\-by\\-element and means you needn't prove *mens rea* with respect to that particular element.\n\nSince penal codes vary from state to state, it can be difficult to find consistent examples of strict liability crimes.

In US criminal law, strict liability refers to situations where certain elements of a crime do not require proof of mens rea (guilty mind). This is similar to the German legal concept of \"Tatbestandsannex\" or \"objektive Bedingung der Strafbarkeit\" mentioned in the question.\n\nA) Negligent liability is incorrect. While it involves a lower standard of mens rea, it still requires proof of a mental state (negligence), unlike strict liability.\n\nC) Vicarious liability is incorrect. This refers to holding one party responsible for the actions of another, which is not directly related to the concept of elements lacking mens rea requirements.\n\nD) Constructive liability is incorrect. This typically involves attributing liability based on legal fiction rather than actual intent, but it's not specifically about elements lacking mens rea requirements.\n\nThe question tests understanding of strict liability in US criminal law, its similarity to the German concept, and its distinction from other forms of liability.

And, it isn't obvious if you know enough to trigger civil forfeiture exposure based merely on uncorroborated statements from another tenant that observe only conduct often associated with drug dealing and not deals themselves. Still, the knowledge you do have might trigger a duty to inquire if you want to escape civil forfeiture liability.\n\nUnder [the statute](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-13/article-2/16-13-49/), to defeat a civil forfeiture action (assuming it has been used for drug dealing), you must show:\n\n> (e)(1\\) A property interest shall not be subject to forfeiture under\n> this Code section if the owner of such interest or interest holder\n> establishes that the owner or interest holder:\n> \n> \n> (A) Is not legally accountable for the conduct giving rise to its\n> forfeiture, did not consent to it, and **did not know and could not**\n> **reasonably have known of the conduct or that it was likely to occur**;\n> \n> \n> (B) Had not acquired and did not stand to acquire substantial proceeds\n> from the conduct giving rise to its forfeiture other than as an\n> interest holder in an arm's length commercial transaction;\n> \n> \n> (C) With respect to conveyances for transportation only, did not hold\n> the property jointly, in common, or in community with a person whose\n> conduct gave rise to its forfeiture;\n> \n> \n> (D) Does not hold the property for the benefit of or as nominee for\n> any person whose conduct gave rise to its forfeiture, and, if the\n> owner or interest holder acquired the interest through any such\n> person, the owner or interest holder acquired it as a bona fide\n> purchaser for value without knowingly taking part in an illegal\n> transaction; and\n> \n> \n> (E) Acquired the interest:\n> \n> \n> (i) Before the completion of the conduct giving rise to its\n> forfeiture, and the person whose conduct gave rise to its forfeiture\n> did not have the authority to convey the interest to a bona fide\n> purchaser for value at the time of the conduct; or\n> \n> \n> (ii) After the completion of the conduct giving rise to its\n> forfeiture:\n> \n> \n> (I) As a bona fide purchaser for value without knowingly taking part\n> in an illegal transaction;\n> \n> \n> (II) Before the filing of a lien on it and before the effective date\n> of a notice of pending forfeiture relating to it and without notice of\n> its seizure for forfeiture under this article; and\n> \n> \n> (III) At the time the interest was acquired, was reasonably without\n> cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture or likely\n> to become subject to forfeiture under this article.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) A property interest shall not be subject to forfeiture under this\n> Code section for a violation involving only one gram or less of a\n> mixture containing cocaine or four ounces or less of marijuana unless\n> said property was used to facilitate a transaction in or a purchase of\n> or sale of a controlled substance or marijuana.\n\nThe language in bold is the most threatening part that effectively establishes a duty of inquiry and a duty to take action if your inquiry establishes that drug dealing is going on.

What judge enabled them?\n\nThe name of the judge authorizing a search warrant or arrest warrant, and the court in which that judge serves, will always appears on the face of the warrant document.\n\nIt is possible to eventually get a copy of a search warrant or arrest warrant, once it has been served, but search warrants and arrest warrants are frequently issued \"under seal\" prior to the point in time at which they are served so that the law enforcement can have the element of surprise in executing those warrants.\n\nSearch warrants are usually served very shortly after they are issued, so there isn't much of a gap period for them to be under seal. Arrest warrants are frequently made public and widely publicized to law enforcement officers in cases that don't have an organized crime component or co\\-conspirators who have not yet been arrested, particularly if law enforcement doesn't know where to find the person named in the warrant.\n\nSearch warrants and arrest warrants which aren't under seal may be obtained by any member of the public from the clerk of the court that issued the warrant.\n\nOnce a search warrant or arrest warrant has been executed, the person searched or arrested and their lawyers are always entitled to a copy of it, and to a copy of the \"return\" of the warrant to the court, and to a copy of the police report, if any, prepared regarding the execution of the warrant. The \"return\" of the warrant to the court and the police report, if any, will generally disclose at least some of the officers who were involved in executing the warrant.\n\nSometimes a search warrant is handed to the person searched. Criminal case warrants and related documents are sometimes made available by law enforcement records departments, sometimes by the clerk of the relevant court, and sometimes by the prosecutor's office as part of \"discovery\" in a criminal case. Police reports are sometimes made available by the law enforcement records departments and sometimes by the prosecutor's office as part of \"discovery\" in a criminal case.\n\nBut, sometimes these documents remain sealed as to the general public if a criminal investigation is ongoing so that co\\-conspirators will not be tipped off and so that potential witnesses will not receive information not made available to the general public (allowing law enforcement to distinguish between reliable witnesses who know non\\-public factors and people just making things up based upon news reports) and so that juries will not be tainted by information which may not be admissible at trial.\n\nEventually, not later than after a jury has heard the case and all witnesses have testified at trial, the general public has a right to that information.\n\nOfficers Providing Probable Cause Affidavits\n============================================\n\nAnother kind of information that someone would often like to have regarding a search warrant is to know who supplied the probable cause statement for the warrant. Usually, there will be a named law enforcement officer's affidavit either attached to the warrant or including as part of that form, or filed under the same court case number even if it does not accompany the warrant itself.\n\nBut, while the law enforcement officer preparing the probable cause affidavit or declaration will be named, the law enforcement officer will not infrequently rely in part on unnamed anonymous informants who are described in more or less detail in the probable cause affidavit. The identity of the anonymous informant is not revealed unless the prosecution in the case chooses to do so. Instead, the practice of relying on anonymous informants is regulated with rules of law regarding when information from an anonymous informant can be sufficient, with or without other kinds of corroborating information, to establish probable cause to issue a search warrant or arrest warrant.\n\nIf after the search has been conducted, a court determines that the warrant was not supported by probable cause, this sometimes constitutes grounds to suppress the evidence obtained with the search warrant.\n\nIf a court later determines that an arrest warrant was not supported by probable cause, this could provide a basis for the suppression of evidence obtained incident to the arrest, for the release of the criminal defendant if no later evidence has established probable cause after the arrest from sources not tainted by the arrest without probable cause, or for a civil lawsuit for wrongful arrest brought by the person arrested.\n\nSo, failing to identify officers who are sources of information for an arrest warrant or search warrant is something only done if it serves some worthwhile purpose for law enforcement, because they don't want to have their evidence needlessly suppressed.\n\nAlso, while judges usually trust law enforcement officers and issue warrants rather freely based upon their statements, if a particular officer develops a pattern of seeking warrants based upon unreliable anonymous sources in cases that turn out to be baseless, eventually judges may start to view probable cause affidavits from the officers who do that with greater skepticism than probable cause affidavits from other law enforcement officers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A search warrant has been issued for a criminal investigation, but not yet executed.

Search warrants are often issued \"under seal\" prior to being served, which means the details are temporarily restricted from public access. This is done to allow law enforcement to maintain the element of surprise when executing the warrant.

Since the clause is in terms of \"*assigns*\", it purportedly refers to recovering *from the adversary* those fees and costs. It does not preclude recovery *from you*, though. The term \"*costs*\" refers to money a litigant has to pay for actions such as filing a motion in court, mailing documents to the adversary, obtaining deposition \\& court hearing transcripts, and so forth.\n\nThis clause altogether is so redundant and so sloppy I would hesitate retaining a lawyer with that \"quality\". For instance, in general the default presumption is that nobody performs services for free.

The lawyer is getting paid either way.\n\nNote that the statement refers to the outcome of *lease termination* (i.e., contingent to you prevailing in the legal dispute). Except for very specific scenarios, no prevailing litigant would volunteer to cover fees which are legally recoverable from his adversary. If anything, it would be easier for a lawyer to bill his client than going to court again to litigate against the adversary the matter of attorney fees. Thus, the statement is tantamount to saying \"*you the client will allow me to take the longer path as to attorney fees if we win the underlying case*\".\n\nIt is also pointless for the clause to have the exact same statement at the beginning and at the end of that paragraph.

Comments and explanations in answers talked about what it means to have a \"legitimate educational interest\" in a student's grades. This question posed to law.StackExchange is about **what constitutes \"legitimate educational interest\"?**\n\n> Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions (34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.31\\):\n> \n> \n> * School officials with legitimate educational interest;\n\nThe majority opinion on Academia seems to be that a teacher wanting to know their student's pervious grades in a different class \\- a class which was a prerequisite for the current class \\- is a legitimate educational interest. The only reason provided as for why is that the teacher can use it to deny access to the class to some students or to adjust the class speed and/or content to better accommodate the students' level of understanding.\n\nI suggested that teachers can get this information in other, better ways, and have no true need or interest in previous grades. For example, when I want to get a feel for the level of the class up front, I have given an anonymous quiz on the first day of class. Since it's anonymous, it is obviously not graded. Others still insist that teachers in this situation have a legitimate educational interest in the student grades.\n\nOne person went so far as to suggest that FERPA only denies the teacher in cases of idle curiosity. That seems wholly ineffective to me at that point, as any teacher could always get out of a reprimand by claiming \"I heard this student was concerned about their standing and I wanted to see if there was anything I could do to help.\" You cannot easily prove that a teacher had only idle curiosity.\n\nSo the question is, in a nutshell: **Legally, what has FERPA's \"legitimate educational interest\" been interpreted as meaning, strictly?** If this has ever been tested in court for any grey areas like this (ie: not cases of negligence or idle curiosity), that would be great.\n\nMy personal interest in this is to get a better idea of when FERPA denies access to student records and when it does not. I am concerned, as the interpretation of some people of \"legitimate educational interest\" makes me wonder if FERPA does not really protect our privacy in practice, since negligence and idle curiosity should already have been grounds for workplace discipline for school officials in any competent school.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The exact text of [34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.31](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/99.31) makes it clear that the determination of who has \"legitimate educational interest\" is left up to each educational institution to establish:\n\n> (a) An educational agency or institution may disclose personally identifiable information from an education record of a student without the consent required by \u00a7 99\\.30 if the disclosure meets one or more of the following conditions:\n> \n> \n> (1\\)\n> \n> \n> (i)\n> \n> \n> (A) The disclosure is to other school officials, including teachers, within the agency or institution **whom the agency or institution has determined to have legitimate educational interests.**\n\nMoreover, [34 CFR \u00a7 99\\.7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/34/99.7) requires each institution to notify students of their particular definition of \"legitimate educational interest\":\n\n> (a)\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Each educational agency or institution shall annually notify parents of students currently in attendance, or eligible students currently in attendance, of their rights under the Act and this part.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (3\\) **The notice must include all of the following:**\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (iii) If the educational agency or institution has a policy of disclosing education records under \u00a7 99\\.31(a)(1\\), **a specification of criteria for determining** who constitutes a school official and **what constitutes a legitimate educational interest.**\n\n(bolding mine)\n\nAs far as whether this has ever been tested at law, I'm not sure. There are a few cases mentioned in [this legal review article from 2003,](http://scholarship.law.unc.edu/nclr/vol81/iss3/12/) though the author calls the existing case law at the time \"meager\":\n\n> Not surprisingly, schools' interpretations of the legitimate educational interests exception have been at issue in some FERPA controversies. In *Krebs v. Rutgers*, for example, a university attempted to characterize its disclosure of students' Social Security numbers to campus post office personnel as a \"legitimate educational interest.\" The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey enjoined the practice, noting that \"the regulations do not suggest, and it is far from clear, that distribution of social security numbers ... serves a 'legitimate educational interest.' \" In contrast, in *Achman v. Chicago Lakes Independent School District No. 2144*, a Minnesota federal district court held that the supervisor of the school's detention room had a legitimate educational interest in accessing the disciplinary records of a student she monitored. In another FERPA case from 1987, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals found that a school official who requested students' education records to defend against her pending criminal charges did not have a legitimate educational interest in the records.\" Finally, in another instance that some commentators have deemed \"an egregious example of when disclosure serves no legitimate educational interest,\" a substitute teacher told her class that a student had HIV and classmates should not share lip balm with him.\n\nEarlier in the article, the author makes basically the same point you make in your question:\n\n> Thus, if a professor, campus employer, or other school official can contrive a colorable \"legitimate educational interest\" for accessing a student's education records, the official may obtain the data without the\n> student's knowledge or consent. ...

According to 34 CFR \u00a7 99.31, the determination of who has \"legitimate educational interest\" is left up to each educational institution to establish.

I understand that this isn't entirely reliable in European civil law. The preferred alternative is to license it to the public. However, you have to decide how \"free\" you want the work to be made. The normal state of affairs, where you do nothing and just rely on copyright law, is that you have the sole right to allow copies to be made and derivative works to be created. Thus if someone were to make a derivative work based on your composition, they would need your permission: but then they would have the right what they created (such as a translation).

But in law, that's irrelevant.\n\nThe **legal** situation is that clearly, unauthorised damage to third party property occurred, clearly there was ample evidence these people either did it, or aided and abetted it, or knew or should have known it was likely if they roped the statue or brought rope and gave it to others, or were reckless to the fact.\n\nRight or wrongly, the CPS decided that prosecution was in the public interest and I don't recall that being specifically the angle it was defended upon.\n\nIn such a situation, I'm intrigued, short of jury nullification, how a trial could end in acquittal (however deservedly). What legal arguments were made, that mattered at all, and that a judge wouldn't rightly direct to be irrelevant and should be ignored?\n\nI've read the blow\\-by\\-blow account of trial proceedings, and I'm still at a loss to understand what happened.\n\nWe can never know what went on in a jury room, but perhaps someone can shed light on what legal premises and theories could even be relevant to acquittal (as opposed to mitigation), in this very specific controversial case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In order to prove [criminal damage](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/criminal-damage), the prosecutors had to show that the four individuals\n\n1. Destroyed or damaged property \\[\\= the statue]\n2. The property belonged to another \\[\\= Bristol City Council]\n3. They intended to do so, or were reckless as to whether that would happen\n4. They had no lawful excuse\n\nThey evidently failed to convince the jury of the combination of these facts. (Some members of the jury may have thought differently about different ones, or they may have applied their own idiosyncratic reasoning.) For their part, the defence contested (1\\) and (4\\) by specific arguments.\n\nAgainst damage to the statue, they argued that it had increased in value by virtue of its participation in a historic event. They also advanced some novel arguments that they were attempting to prevent a crime \\- either the [public display of indecent matter](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/42) or of a [visible representation which is threatening or abusive](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64). For this defence, it doesn't matter whether that was actually a crime, just whether the defendants honestly held the belief that it was, and that they were using what they believed to be reasonable force to prevent the crime. They also invoked a specific lawful excuse mentioned in [the relevant Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/section/5), that each of them\n\n> believed that the person or persons whom he believed to be entitled to consent to the destruction of or damage to the property in question had so consented, or would have so consented to it if he or they had known of the destruction or damage and its circumstances.\n\nThe argument was that they honestly believed that the statue belonged to the people of Bristol as a collective, and that the people of Bristol would generally be in favour of their actions.\n\nFinally, the defence made a human rights claim on the basis of free expression, saying that their conviction would be a disproportionate interference with those rights. This is about weighing up the public interest in property rights and public safety on the one hand, and the defendants' right to act in accordance with their conscience on a matter important to them.\n\nThe judge allowed all these defences to be made, and it was the prosecution's job to make the jury sure that the elements of the offence were proved, despite whatever the defence made out. There was some specific guidance given to the jury to help them understand the nature of the arguments and what had to be proved, and ultimately it was up to them to consider everything privately and come up with their answer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of the Colston Four, which of the following was NOT a defense argument used by the defendants?\n\nA) The statue had increased in value due to its involvement in a historic event, challenging the notion of \"damage.\"\n\nB) The defendants were attempting to prevent a crime by removing a statue that could be considered threatening or abusive.\n\nC) The defendants believed they had implicit consent from the people of Bristol to remove the statue.\n\nD) The defendants argued that they were not present at the scene when the statue was toppled.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Options A, B, and C were all defense arguments used in the Colston Four case.

Also, a threat is generally made by the person who would take the action (or their agent), rather than a disinterested third\\-party.\n\nIncidentally, a threat to bring a lawsuit, since a proper purposes of a lawsuit is to secure money from someone, is not improper to connect to a demand to pay money.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A property owner posts a sign that reads \"Trespassers will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal nature of this sign?\n\nA) This sign constitutes an illegal threat because it implies potential harm to trespassers.\nB) The sign is a lawful warning because it only indicates legal consequences for trespassing.\nC) This sign is neither a warning nor a threat, but merely an informational statement.\nD) The sign is both a warning and a threat, as these terms are legally synonymous.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

Some notable examples:\n\n* [Infinion acquires International Rectifier](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2015/INFXX201501-020.html). Both companies specialized in advanced MOSFET circuits with barely any other competitors existing in the whole world. They now have close to monopoly on these kind of circuits. You find these circuits in every modern car.\n* [Microchip acquires Atmel](http://www.microchip.com/announcements/microchip-technology-inc-acquires-atmel). Both companies were direct and fierce competitors in the market of cheap, small microcontrollers. They were the only two companies in the world that profiled themselves as having beginner\\-friendly, easy to use microcontrollers and so they have been competing over the very same kind of customers for the past 30 years or so. There is barely any competition left at all on that market now.\n* [NXP acquires Freescale](http://investors.nxp.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=209114&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2120581). The companies had many overlaps and were competitors in many areas, particularly in microcontrollers and automotive electronics. These two companies branched out from Phillips and Motorola respectively, roughly at the same time, some 15 years ago. Since then they had the same owners. NXP now got a different owner Qualcomm, at the same time as the merger. Qualcomm being another of these huge companies, but with a focus on telecom electronics, where they in turn have close to monopoly. So essentially this is 3 companies merging into 1\\.\n\nThere are many more examples. ON Semi acquires Fairchild, Analog Devices acquires Linear Technology and so on. All in the past 1\\-2 years. It is the same story over and over, two huge multi\\-national companies that are direct competitors, with little or no other competition, merge into one. Imagine Microsoft and Google merging and you get the idea. \n\nThe nature of their products \\- advanced electronic components \\- is such that barely anyone can start up a competing company, as they would need to do massive investments in R\\&D, head\\-hunt all staff from the existing companies and possibly also make massive investments in production lines. Because of this steep threshold to enter the market, there has traditionally only been around 20 companies like this in the world, making 99% of the world's advanced electronic components. \n\nI take it that these mergers must have been approved by authorities in USA and Europe etc. Are there no laws regulating this? If there are, how do these companies manage to repeatedly dodge such laws world\\-wide? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are no laws directly regulating merger of two companies. Instead, there are laws against \"monopolizing\" (and similar expressions). In the US, the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act and the FTC Act providing the legal underpinning for the Department of Justice to prosecute a merger, or for a judge to prohibit a merger. The typical logical flow is that it is illegal to unfairly reduce competition, which might mean lowering prices when you have a substantial share of the market, privately agreeing on technical innovations with a competitor, or simply gaining a substantial share of the market via a merger.\n\n[Section 7](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/mergers) of the Clayton Act (also Sect 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, Sect. 5 of the FTC Act) forbid a merger or acquisition when the effect would be \"substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly\".

Under common law in the United States, police officers are allowed to cross state lines while in hot pursuit of a suspect. This situation is considered an exigent circumstance, which grants officers temporary expanded powers. The doctrine of hot pursuit allows the officer to continue the chase across state lines without needing to stop at borders or seek explicit permission from other states' authorities. Options A and B are incorrect because they mistakenly limit the officer's authority at state borders. Option D is incorrect because while inter-state agreements may exist, they are not necessary for hot pursuit across state lines."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59614/mathematical-models-for-money-lending-and-antidiscrimination-laws-in-the-us", "docs_id": 59614, "title": "Mathematical models for money lending and antidiscrimination laws in the US", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are there any federal or state laws in the US regulating which models can banks and money lenders use to decide for/against lending money to an individual?

However, subcontractors do not have a direct contractual relationship with the property owner. As per 44A-18(a), a first tier subcontractor has a \"lien upon funds\" owed to the contractor they dealt with, not on the property itself.

The bank decides on the merits of your claim, and they usually favour the consumer.

In some jurisdictions (e.g. [Ontario](https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/guides/What_is_Small_Claims_Court_EN.html)), a mediation\\-like settlement conference, led by a deputy judge, is mandatory before going to trial.

Too often, however, the word has been used by whites as a tool to belittle, oppress, or dehumanize African Americans.

Title VII was enacted to counter social norms that supported widespread discrimination against African Americans. To conclude that the Station may act in accordance with the social norm that it is permissible for African Americans to use the word but not whites would require a determination that this is a \"good\" race\\-based social norm that justifies a departure from the text of Title VII. **Neither the text of Title VII, the legislative history, nor the caselaw permits such a departure from Title VII's command that employers refrain from \"discriminat\\[ing] against any individual...because of such individual's race.\"**\n\n**Added: Why *Bostock* is Irrelevant for Your Friend\u2019s Case:**\n\nAs you say, if we substitute the word \u201crace\u201d for \u201csex\u201d in those sentences from *Bostock,* it seems obvious your friend would have a case under Title VII.

The 22% withholding rate is not unusually high; it's a standard estimated tax withholding rate for supplemental wages.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the main issue presented in the scenario: the employee is required to pay taxes on stock that they cannot easily sell, which is an unusual and potentially problematic situation for RSU grants in private companies."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70304/what-defines-the-extent-to-which-a-business-can-voluntarily-lie-to-its-customers", "docs_id": 70304, "title": "What defines the extent to which a business can voluntarily lie to its customers?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Businesses' communication is a constant stream of lies:\n\n* on the phone:\n\n\t+ our menu options have changed\n\t+ we're experiencing a higher than normal call volume\n\t+ your call is important to us\n* when advertising:\n\n\t+ the best pizza in town\n\t+ scientifically proven\n\t+ lose x pounds in y hours\n\t+ all natural\n* when talking to you:\n\n\t+ I'll get on it right away\n\t+ we'll call you right back\n\t+ we charged you this fee for your convenience\n\t+ we take x very seriously\n\non the internet it's also endless...\n\nMy question is not about the dangerous lies that can have consequences (eat a lemon and you won't get covid), but rather the continuous stream of lies that have been accepted as business as usual.\n\nI can see them used to either:\n\n* steer a customer in a direction and / or state of mind. For example buy this, be patient with us, etc\n* or to make interactions smoother and avoid confrontation by pretending to care for example.\n\nSo what would be the threshold for a lie to be actionable where you could claim a damage? Does it always have to be material damage? or would a waste of time also be valid for example?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> what would be the threshold for a lie to be actionable where you could claim a damage?\n\nThere is no award for \"lies\" which clearly are inconsequential.\n\nA customer will never make decisions based on whether \"*menu options have changed*\" or whether the business is honest on the statement \"*your call is important to us*\". The impact that the duration of these statements have on the customer is negligible at best, since omitting these statements does not improve the company's response time anyway.\n\nThe statement \"*your call is important to us*\" might not even be a lie. Many companies know that it is in their best interest to gather information from their customers on what to improve, lest customers switch to a competitor or file suit.\n\nThe lack of objective standards renders statements such as \"*best pizza in town*\" unascertainable. Accordingly, it would be unreasonable for a customer to rely on criteria that are subjective, undefined, unclear, and/or palpably fictitious.\n\nOnly statements like \"*scientifically proven*\" and \"*lose x pounds in y hours*\" might be within scope of consumer protection laws (see also *unfair and misleading practices*). The assessment of those scenarios requires more detail, including disclaimers and other \"small letters\" that are \\-\\-or ought to be\\-\\- disclosed no later than the formation of the contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements made by a business would most likely be considered an actionable lie under consumer protection laws?\n\nA) \"Our menu options have recently changed.\"\nB) \"We're experiencing higher than normal call volume.\"\nC) \"Lose 20 pounds in 2 days, guaranteed!\"\nD) \"We have the best customer service in town.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) This statement is generally considered inconsequential and doesn't impact customer decisions. It's not likely to be actionable.\n\nB) This claim, even if untrue, is unlikely to cause material damage to a customer and would be difficult to prove false. It's not typically actionable.\n\nC) This specific claim about weight loss results is quantifiable and, if false, could be considered misleading under consumer protection laws. It makes a concrete promise that can be tested and potentially disproven, making it the most likely to be an actionable lie.\n\nD) This is a subjective claim that lacks objective standards. It's considered puffery in advertising and is not typically actionable as it's understood to be opinion rather than fact.\n\nThe key distinction is that actionable lies typically involve specific, measurable claims that can cause material damage if false, rather than vague or inconsequential statements that are common in business communication."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48651/is-there-an-official-time-in-the-eu-and-if-so-which-is-it", "docs_id": 48651, "title": "Is there an &quot;official time&quot; in the EU, and if so, which is it?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: With regard to the Brexit today, I was asking myself when exactly it goes into effect.

(Some even extend over multiple time zones, but none of the current EU states do). When it is important and not obvious, you specify the time zone. \n\nBrexit is at 11pm in the U.K., midnight in Germany, France, Netherlands and many others, and probably 1am on Feb 1st in Greece. \n\nFor local situations, it will be the local time zone. If there\u2019s a contract between a company and a customer in New York to do something at 3pm, with nothing else specified, nobody will get away with saying they meant Pacific Time.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A multinational contract between companies in London, Paris, and Athens specifies that it will come into effect \"on February 1st, 2023 at 00:00\". Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the timing of the contract's activation?\n\nA) The contract will come into effect simultaneously for all parties at 00:00 GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).\n\nB) The contract will come into effect at different times for each party, based on their local time zones.\n\nC) The contract's timing is ambiguous and legally unenforceable without specifying a time zone.\n\nD) The contract will come into effect at 00:00 Central European Time for all parties, as this is the default time zone for EU contracts.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. As the documentation suggests, when dealing with multiple time zones and no specific time zone is mentioned in the contract, the default interpretation is typically based on local time zones. This means the contract would come into effect at 00:00 local time for each party: midnight in London (GMT), midnight in Paris (CET, 1 hour ahead of London), and midnight in Athens (EET, 2 hours ahead of London). \n\nOption A is incorrect because GMT is not specified, and there's no universal default to GMT.\nOption C is incorrect because while the contract could be more precise, it's not necessarily unenforceable. Local time zones would likely be applied.\nOption D is incorrect because there is no default EU time zone for contracts, especially considering that London (post-Brexit) is not in the EU.\n\nThis question tests understanding of time zone implications in international contracts and the importance of specificity in legal documents spanning multiple jurisdictions."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80786/what-is-a-vested-interest", "docs_id": 80786, "title": "What is a vested interest?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We hear this phrase used a lot in political ranting, to describe various purportedly corrupt forces that are determined to do or maintain something due to an identifiable incentive.\n\nBut it's just occurred to me that this is probably originally a legal term. What does it mean for an interested to be vested or unvested?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A vested interest is a type of property interest. Black's Law Dictionary provides this definition:\n\n> Accrued; fixed; settled; absolute ; having the character or giving the rights of absolute ownership; not contingent; not subject to be defeated by a condition precedent.\n\nIn other words, a holder's interest in property is vested when he does not need to satisfy any further conditions before claiming his property. This is in contrast to a *contingent* interest which does not become vested until some condition is satisfied.\n\nIn the United States, the most familiar example may be in the retirement context. An employer may offer to match your contributions to your 401(k) plan, with the match vesting after one year.\n\nIn that case, your employer should deposit matching funds into an account in your name as soon as you begin work, but for the first 12 months, you do not actually have the right to access or use those funds. Once a year has passed, though, you are not required to do anything else to take control of the matching funds, so you are said to have a vested interest in those funds \\-\\- you may withdraw them if you please, and the employer no longer has any claim to them.\n\nThe colloquial sense of vested interest is therefore inconsistent with the legal definition. For instance, in reporting on San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin's reelection campaign, Fox News described writer Shaun King as having  [\"a vested interest in the controversial DA,\"](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/shaun-king-group-involved-save-san-francisco-da-boudin-recall-election) based on their mutual involvement in a nonprofit organization. But absent the repeal of the Thirteenth Amendment, it is not possible to have a vested interest in another person.\n\nLikewise, reports that [a politician has a vested interest in some policy](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/05/29/i-was-a-texas-gop-legislator-we-couldnt-stand-up-to-gun-violence/), that an [international organization has a vested interest in global economic development](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/23/russia-ukraine-war-naftogaz-says-opec-is-on-the-wrong-side-of-history.html) or that [a coach has a vested interest in his players' health](https://www.si.com/nba/2022/05/10/monty-williams-safety-suggestion-incident-involving-chris-paul-family) make no sense when applying the legal definition. None of these things are property to begin with, let alone property that these people could actually be said to hold an interest in with no preconditions.\n\nIt is likely that in the vast majority of cases, references to a \"vested interest\" should simply say \"interest.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In legal terms, which of the following best describes a \"vested interest\"?\n\nA) An emotional or personal stake in a particular outcome or situation\nB) A property interest that is fixed, settled, and not subject to any further conditions\nC) A contingent interest that becomes valid only after certain conditions are met\nD) A political or financial motivation to maintain the status quo\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. In legal terminology, a vested interest refers to a property interest that is fixed, settled, and not subject to any further conditions. This is in contrast to the colloquial use of the term, which often incorrectly applies it to personal, political, or emotional stakes in various situations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes the common misuse of the term in everyday language, not its legal definition.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it describes a contingent interest, which is the opposite of a vested interest. A contingent interest requires certain conditions to be met before it becomes vested.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it reflects the colloquial misuse of the term in political contexts, not its legal meaning.\n\nThe key to remember is that a vested interest, in legal terms, specifically relates to property rights that are fully established and not dependent on any future events or conditions."}}
