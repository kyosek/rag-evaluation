The case is serious, she lost about ten kg in the last weeks.\n2. She is very agressive, (unfairly) critical about everything.\n3.

The pediatrician in particular should have contacts to support groups, etc. The doctor may also decide that she needs to go on medication. \n\nIf she's breastfeeding, ask her to stop and go to formula. Either of you can prep the overnight bottles in the evening so it's faster. You take the middle of night feedings for a while. \n\nIf she doesn't want to stop, see if she can pump extra during the day so that you can bottle feed overnight.

This approach allows for professional medical assessment of the situation without immediately escalating to government intervention. The doctor can provide guidance, potentially prescribe medication if necessary, and offer referrals to support groups or specialists. This option also avoids potentially harmful actions like forcing a change in feeding methods or taking legal action, which could exacerbate the situation.

Could it be challenged on constitutional grounds?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an open question in Colorado, where there's an ongoing challenge to the state's supermajority requirement in [*Kerr v. Hickenlooper*](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20170505a91). The state requires a supermajority for tax or spending increases, and several lawmakers challenged the law as violating the Guarantee Clause, which guarantees each state a republican form of government.\n\nThe case has been going on for a long time. It's about seven years old now, and they're still arguing about who has standing to bring the lawsuit. The latest development is that [no one had standing](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20170505a91), but that decision is currently being appealed in the Tenth Circuit. \n\nA bigger problem than standing, though, may be justiciability. In [*Huddleston v. Sawyer*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/or-supreme-court/1485393.html), the Supreme Court of Oregon, rejected a challenge to supermajority requirements for reducing citizen\\-approved sentences for crimes, and in [*Lefkovits v. State Board of Elections*](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/400/1005/1367220/), the Northern District of Illinois did the same with respect to judicial retention votes. Both courts concluded that supermajority requirements were a political issue, not a legal one. \n\nThe justiciability concerns should be tempered by two considerations. First, there's an argument in Kerr that because taxes and spending are such core legislative functions, that it should be harder to uphold restrictions on the legislature's ability to vote on them. Second, there's U.S. Supreme Court precedent in [*New York v. U.S.*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-543.ZO.html) suggesting \\-\\- but not deciding \\-\\- that the questions about justiciability are overblown:\n\n> The view that the Guarantee Clause implicates only nonjusticiable\n>  political questions has its origin in *Luther v.

The investor does not need to be a dishonest person to decide that you might need to be demoted from CEO at some point, for example. You may differ on the need for future investments or the need to both accept dilution to bring in the investment. If you are the CEO they could legitimately worry that you will spend their money in an wasteful manner. \n\nUsually an angel is a minority shareholder and they need to protect themselves from you diluting or otherwise screwing them. They would insist on a shareholder agreement that protected them, usually worked out with the help of their attorney and yours. If the angel has a good reputation in the local start\\-up community you may be able to find an attorney to work for the company who will get paid by the company after the investment comes in.\n\nA note \\- an investor has a duty to themselves to protect their money. If they become a board member they also have a fiduciary duty to the company but not to you personally. In their fiduciary duty to the company they could honestly think the best course of action is to bring in an investor or a new CEO in a way that is detrimental to you.

Or rich people, who also are the ones in power, despairing over the recreational activities of working\\-class people.\n\nIt\u2019s probable that there was gambling involved \\- people will bet on anything, and this was a game of skill and chance, a perfect vehicle for gambling.

Eventually, the moral panic declined, and the laws were repealed. However, times had changed, and the 10\\-pin form of the game is what came back backed by larger commercial interests rather than the artisan style of 9\\-pins. 10\\-pin bowling uses much bigger alleys with gutters and is suitable for mechanisation. a 9\\-pin alley can fit in a relatively small room, and standing the pins back up again is not much more demanding than pulling pool balls out of pockets.\n\nIt's not unusual that after government suppression is lifted, things come back different to the way they were before the suppression started.

Consumer protection laws in different countries may override such policies, especially for defective or unusable products.

Under Wisconsin law, how does John's illegal possession of the firearm affect his claim of self-defense?\n\nA) John cannot claim self-defense at all because he was engaged in illegal activity by possessing the firearm.\n\nB) John can claim self-defense without any additional burden, as his illegal possession is unrelated to the attack.\n\nC) John can claim self-defense, but he must prove he exhausted every other reasonable means to escape or avoid great bodily harm before using deadly force.\n\nD) John can claim self-defense only if he can prove he did not intentionally provoke the attack to use it as an excuse to harm his attackers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Wisconsin law 939.48(2)(a), when a person engages in unlawful conduct likely to provoke others to attack (such as illegally possessing a firearm), they can still claim self-defense if they reasonably believe they are in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm.

The witness is concerned that their testimony might inadvertently reveal information about a minor infraction they may have committed in the past, though they are not certain if it was actually illegal. Under what circumstances can this witness invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination?\n\nA) The witness can only invoke the Fifth Amendment if they are certain they have committed a crime related to the current trial.\nB) The witness must first explain to the judge, in private, what specific information they fear might be incriminating.\nC) The witness can invoke the Fifth Amendment, but the prosecution can challenge this by proving that the witness has not committed any crimes.\nD) The witness can invoke the Fifth Amendment without providing any specific reason, based on the possibility that their testimony might be self-incriminating.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, a witness can invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination without having to specify the exact reason or reveal any potentially incriminating information to the judge. This protection extends to innocent individuals who may be concerned about potential self-incrimination, even if they are unsure whether they have actually broken any laws. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the Fifth Amendment \"protects the innocent as well as the guilty\" and guards against the possibility of being \"ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\" Additionally, it is not necessary for a witness to prove they have committed a crime to invoke this right, nor can the prosecution remove this protection by trying to prove the witness's innocence."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16857/abuse-of-power-official-capacity-misuse-of-authority-etc-financial-damage-mi", "docs_id": 16857, "title": "Abuse of power / official capacity / misuse of authority etc financial damage minimum?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A bit of context: Recently the Romanian Justice Ministry signed a executive order to change the penal code decriminalizing \"abuse of power\" if the damage is less than 200000 RON (Aprox: 50\\.000 USD / 45000 EURO) everything less than that is subject of labor law.\n\nIs it normal to have minimum financial damage value for such an act to become felony ?\n\nOnly thing I could find is Texas code where it becomes a state felony above 2\\.500 USD (and I'm not sure about that even, because it says \"value of thing misused\" which for me doesn't equate with damage)\n\nI'm not sure if abuse of power is the correct term (it's a literal translation from Romanian) so here is the definition: \nThe act of civil servant, who, in the exercise of his duties, knowingly, does not act or acts incorrectly and thereby causing harm legal interests of a person\n\nSome examples:\n\nPoliceman giving you I fine without real cause because he doesn't like you, your race or gender\n\nCity council member preferentially selecting streets to be repaired based on his own house location \n\nMayor hiring his own nephew and allowing him not work at all for the job he was hired to do\n\nTaking or giving bribe is another infraction, different from this one, at least in Romanian Penal Code. \n\nI appreciate any references to similar articles in any penal code, or even suggestions for google keywords.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Colorado has what is called a \"[gift ban](http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/info_center/laws/ArticleXXIX.html)\" which is a prohibition against giving anything of value to any state or local public official as a gift, whether or not there is any attempt to influence the official in his official capacity (subject to certain exceptions, for example, for family members giving normal family gifts). \n\nThe threshold for a gift to qualify under the gift ban is $50 (which makes $49\\.99 a popular price at expensive restaurants near the capital).

The complaining witness in recanting may face charges as well \\- for example, for making a false police report.\n\nIf the prosecutor presses the case and your husband is convicted then, yes, it will be on his record.\n\nSeeking the advice of a New York attorney who specializes in these matters is the best course of action.\n\n**EDIT:** Here is additional information regarding New York Criminal History Records:\n\nNew York State law does specify that, unless the court orders otherwise, arrest records are sealed when criminal actions are terminated in favor of the accused \\- dismissed, found not guilty, etc. This is spelled out in [Criminal Procedure Law 160\\.50](http://law.onecle.com/new-york/criminal-procedure/CPL0160.50_160.50.html).\n\nArrest records are part of the public record until disposition of the case is completed.\n\nAt [New York State's Court web site](http://www.nycourts.gov/APPS/chrs/index.shtml), you can read about how to get criminal records of anyone \\- they are public record so anyone can make a request about anyone. There is a fee of $65\\. Records can be ordered online and the results can be emailed to you. Searches are processed by an exact match of name and date of birth.\n\nFrom their web site you will see that criminal cases transferred or removed to Family Court are not reported. Neither are records for people who had a single misdemeanor conviction over ten years ago or pending criminal cases categorized as Youthful Offender Eligible.\n\nGenerally speaking, New York criminal cases are part of the public record and are available to anyone unless they meet certain criteria or have been sealed under New York State law.\n\nNote that sealing records doesn't mean the record goes away. It just means that the record is not available to the general public without a court order unsealing the record.\n\nHere is the link to on\\-line direct access to records requests: <http://www.nycourts.gov/APPS/chrs/onlinedirectaccess.shtml>", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Sarah called the police on her husband John for domestic violence.

According to the information provided, it is up to the prosecutor, not the victim, to determine whether charges are brought against the arrested individual in domestic violence cases. The victim (Sarah in this case) is considered the complaining witness, but her decision not to press charges does not automatically end the case. The prosecutor may choose to continue with the charges even if Sarah recants her statement. If John is convicted, the incident will appear on his criminal record. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the case doesn't automatically get dropped when the victim doesn't press charges. \n\nOption C is partially correct in that Sarah could potentially face charges for making a false report if she recants, but it's incorrect that John's record would be automatically sealed. \n\nOption D is incorrect because there's no automatic 10-year expungement rule mentioned in the provided information.

The question tests understanding of the distinction between furloughing and the Job Retention Scheme. Furloughing refers to temporarily sending employees home due to lack of work, while the Job Retention Scheme is a government program to help employers pay furloughed workers.

Some laws are based on what some courts and legislatures think are moral obligations.\n\nWe think cannibals have a moral obligation not to eat people; cannibals think non\\-cannibals are fools for passing up a good BBQ.

High crimes or misdemeanor are *legal* definitions, not moral, and depend on previous cases of what a crime or misdemeanor is.\n\nInsobriety can be illegal; there are laws on the books concerning public drunkenness. But in the contest of POTUS (one who is hopefully not passed out on the sidewalk in front of the WH), it remains to be seen if insobriety is a high crime or misdemeanor. That would be up to the House Judiciary Committee and US House of Representatives, which by Constitutional powers handles impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe Twenty\\-fifth Amendment outlines who succeeds the president due to \"Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office,\" but it does not state who has the power to declare a President incapacitated.\n\nIt's possible that a POTUS who incapacitates himself with alcohol is guilty of a \"high crime or misdemeanor.\" But how drunk do you have to be to be incapacitated? Drunk enough to think a Game Boy is the nuclear football? Again, that's up to the House.\n\nSome past presidents have arguably been functional alcoholics (or functional recovered alcoholics.)

Option C is incorrect because the text indicates that insobriety's classification as a \"high crime or misdemeanor\" is not automatic but would be up to the House Judiciary Committee and Representatives to determine.

That question has additional aspects that are not relevant to my question. Specifically, I am interested in faculty position at a university and not edge conditions like female sports players. For comparison, in Australia there have been [women\\-only faculty positions](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/19/university-of-melbourne-mathematics-school-advertises-women-only-positions).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, no: Sex is a protected characteristic and discriminating between applicants based on a protected characteristic is prohibited so an employer is not free to hire only men or women simply because they would prefer to. But there are exceptions, like \u201coccupational requirements\u201d (which is probably what your athlete example is getting at).\n\nAnd, looking at the example you provided, it might \\- with a caveat \\- fall under an exception called \u201cpositive action\u201d, as provided in section 158 and 159 of the Equality Act. However, the conditions under which this is allowed are tightly regulated and it would come down to the specifics (e.g. whether the number of women in that activity is \u201cdisproportionately low\u201d).\n\nThe caveat is that the Equality Act specifies that the protected characteristic (i.e. sex/gender in this case) can only be taken into account when choosing between two equally qualified candidates. I don't know whether this was ever tested in court but this would probably preclude advertising a position as \u201cwomen\\-only\u201d (as opposed to soliciting applications from both men and women and then selecting a woman with the explicit goal of increasing the number of women in your department).\n\nThe Government Equalities Office [guide on positive action](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/85014/positive-action-recruitment.pdf) also contains language strongly suggesting that limiting the search to women from the get go might not pass muster: \n\n> Positive action can be used at any time in the recruitment or promotion process. \n> \n> \n> \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> However, it is expected that, in the vast majority of cases, any use of positive action as a \u2018tie\\-breaker\u2019 between candidates who are of equal merit for a particular post will be at the end of the recruitment \n>  process, at the actual point of appointment.\n> \n> \n> \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> In order to use positive action provisions in a tie\\-breaker situation, the employer must first establish that the candidates are of equal merit.\n\nNote that there is no such \u201cequally qualified\u201d clause in section 158, which deals with everything else than recruitment and promotion. Thus, it is perfectly fine to create a training programme that would be only open to women, if the goal is to increase the proportion of women in an activity where it is disproportionately low (an example provided by the same guide is a development programme \u201cto help female staff compete for management positions\u201d).\n\nIncidentally, all this is allowed under EU law (articles 5 and 7 of [Directive 2000/78/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32000L0078)).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A prestigious British university wants to increase gender diversity in its mathematics department, where women are significantly underrepresented.

However, this doesn't directly address hiring for a faculty position.\nOption C would be illegal as it discriminates against male applicants during the selection process.\nOption D is the most compliant with the Equality Act. It allows for positive action in recruitment under Section 159, which permits considering a protected characteristic (in this case, gender) as a tiebreaker between equally qualified candidates. This approach doesn't exclude any applicants based on gender and only uses gender as a factor in the final selection between equally qualified candidates, which is explicitly allowed by the Act."}}
