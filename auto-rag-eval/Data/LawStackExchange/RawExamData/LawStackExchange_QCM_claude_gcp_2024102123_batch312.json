I may have missed some out and may edit those in later.\n\nCommon law refers to the judgments of courts. So here we come to your question:\n\nSeveral legal principles and precedents were established by this judgment, and you may consider this new \"law\":\n\n1. The court held that prerogative powers are justiciable \\- courts can limit the scope of these powers\n2. The prerogative power in question had limits. It can be limited when its use has an extreme detrimental effect on the democracy of the UK and parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nWhat is important with point one is that the court *recognised* that this power has *always* existed, stemming as far back as the bill of rights in the 17th century. As such, the court is implying that it is creating nothing new, but recognising a law that has always existed. You will see a LOT of this when studying constitutional law."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the Supreme Court's ruling on prorogation and its implications for the creation of new law in the UK legal system?\n\nA) The Supreme Court created entirely new law by ruling that prorogation was justiciable and that Boris Johnson's advice to the Queen was unlawful.\n\nB) The Supreme Court's ruling did not create new law, as it merely interpreted existing constitutional principles and recognized powers that have always existed.\n\nC) The Supreme Court's ruling created new law by establishing that prerogative powers are justiciable, but did not create new law regarding the limits of these powers.\n\nD) The Supreme Court's ruling can be considered both an interpretation of existing law and a creation of new legal precedent, depending on one's perspective on the role of judicial decisions in the UK legal system.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate reflection of the complex nature of the Supreme Court's ruling. While British courts generally regard themselves as interpreting existing law rather than creating new law, any legal precedent established by a court can technically be interpreted as \"creation of new law.\" The ruling recognized that the power to limit prerogative powers has always existed (interpreting existing law), but it also established new precedents regarding the justiciability of these powers and their limits (potentially creating new law). This dual nature of the ruling - both interpreting existing principles and establishing new precedents - makes it a matter of perspective whether new law was created, encompassing the nuanced reality of how judicial decisions function in the UK legal system."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36898/can-we-identify-the-main-source-of-new-law-in-the-uk", "docs_id": 36898, "title": "Can we identify the main source of new law in the UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: IIUC the primary sources of law in the UK are:\n\n* statute (acts of Parliament)\n* delegated legislation (statutory instruments)\n* case law\n* EU law\n\nBut can we pick one of those as being the main source of new laws?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By volume, it's almost certainly Statutory Instruments (SIs).\n\nFrom the [relevant page on legislation.gov.uk](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi), we can see that the number since 2010 has ranged from 1241 to 3485 per year.

The question asks for the \"main source of new laws,\" and SIs significantly outnumber other sources, with 1,241 to 3,485 issued annually. They are directly applicable in the UK legal system and often serve to implement EU Directives, making them a crucial link between EU and UK law. \n\nWhile Acts of Parliament are foundational, they are far fewer in number (23 to 41 per year). EU Regulations, though directly applicable, are less numerous (430 legislative acts in 2018) and do not account for the majority of new UK laws.

Under the common law of the time, a person who owns the soil also owns the space indefinitely upward, \"ad coelum or to the heavens\". There had previously been successful lawsuits for trespass and/or nuisance for, among other things, bullets that passed over land without touching it.\n\nAviation in the early 20th century was largely unregulated in the United States, partially due to the issue of Federalism but primarily due to the question of if private citizens would be able to claim compensation for the government seizing their airspace. Neither state nor Federal governments wanted anything to do with it. The question *was* resolved in Europe before the First World War because national governments there were (largely) not federal, did not have the same sanctity of private property rights as the US and could see enormous national security issues in foreigners flying over your military installations, gathering intelligence about them and \\- as events ultimately showed \\- dropping bombs on them.\n\nWhen the US finally decided that aviation needed regulation it passed the [Air Commerce Act of 1926](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_role_in_civil_aviation#Air_Commerce_Act). There was never any issue about its constitutionality as the Federal government can rely on the [Necessary and Proper Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_and_Proper_Clause) of Article 1, Section 8 which the Supreme Court has interpreted permissively since [*McCulloch v Maryland* 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland):\n\n> Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.\n\nBasically, the Constitution is permissive in the powers it gives Congress \\- they have the power unless it says they don't.\n\nThe validity of the law with respect of the private property issue was settled in [United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Causby) which overturned the common law that landholders owned airspace \"to the heavens\" but rejected that the government could seize it all down to ground level without compensation \\- in that particular case the government had to pay compensation for flights between 83 feet (the lowest that was made) and 365 feet (where the owner's property was deemed not affected by the flights). \n\nThe current state of the law is that you own as much airspace as is necessary for your current usage \\- this is higher in an office building in Manhatten than it is over a cornfield in Idaho."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the legal basis for the federal government's authority to regulate aviation over state territory in the United States?\n\nA) The Constitution explicitly grants the federal government power over aviation in an amendment\nB) The interstate commerce clause alone provides sufficient authority for all aviation regulation\nC) The Necessary and Proper Clause, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, allows Congress to regulate aviation as a legitimate end within the scope of the Constitution\nD) The Air Commerce Act of 1926 superseded state authority over airspace without constitutional basis\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

I'd like to be informed before I go so I know what to do with my family.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legally, they cannot just nab you. The usual (?) option is that authorities in the US request extradition pursuant to the [US\\-Mexico extradition treaty](http://www.oas.org/juridico/MLA/en/traites/en_traites-ext-usa-mex.pdf) via the Department of Justice, and if the paperwork is in order, this can result in a Provisional Arrest Warrant (and arrest) in Mexico, which will be carried out by the Mexican federal police. This is true whether or not you go to the US consulate. After a hearing in the Mexican courts you might be extradited (or not, but DoJ presumably doesn't proceed with cases that they will lose). Extradition is not possible for every offense, so you would have to look at the offenses listed in the treaty, and whatever the Arizona warrant is about. You can't be extradited for parking tickets, you can be extradited for murder: whatever it is, it has to be a crime in both places, and has to be subject to a minimum one year imprisonment. Also, if you are a Mexican citizen as well, you cannot be extradited unless the Mexican authorities agree to (whereas there is no choice if you are only a US citizen). An alternative is deportation, which would overcome limitations related to extradition, but it's not clear what the requirements for deportation from Mexico are (typically illegal presence, unclear whether Mexican authorities can or would try an end\\-run around official extradition procedure).\n\nAlthough consulates enjoy a degree of immunity from local law, a consulate in Mexico is still Mexican territory, subject to Mexican law. If you are *in* the consulate, Mexican authorities cannot enter without permission to arrest you. They also cannot arrest you without a warrant (see Art. 16 of the [Mexican constitution](https://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/mex/en_mex-int-text-const.pdf)). Consular staff also cannot arrest you (if you are not caught *flagrante delicto*). Nor are they authorized to execute a US warrant in Mexico (thus they have to go through the process of judicial review to send you back to the US, and why a *Mexican* warrant is required). See this [Q\\&A](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/13197/4501), relevant to the status of embassies: what is relevant to us is that both the US and Mexico operate under the rule of law, so the issues surrounding Syrian refugees in the Syrian embassy do not arise here."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An American citizen living in Mexico has an outstanding warrant for their arrest in Arizona.

The individual cannot be arrested at the U.S. consulate by consular staff or Mexican authorities without following proper legal procedures. U.S. authorities would need to request extradition through the Department of Justice, following the U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty.

Giuseppe Verdi was repeatedly warned by his publisher not to bring any of his scores to Naples for that was tantamount to having them spread across the world. Needless to say, when the first international copyright treaty was adopted between Austria and Sardinia (in 1840\\) and they invited the rest of Italy to join, the Two Sicilies were the only state to refuse.\n\nLater on, the industrial heavyweights of the world have of course made sure this doesn't happen. The Berne Convention today has roughly 180 member states and there are several other copyright\\-related treaties in place as well (WCT, WPPT, TRIPS ...). Simply put, the strategy consists of two elements: First, no one gets a trade agreement without ensuring and properly enforcing the IP rights of foreigners. Second, if you don't protect our authors in your country, we don't protect your authors in our country. This has led to a fairly high standard of protection across the world.\n\n> In other words, if a country did this and a citizen of this country built a server filled with recent Hollywood movies, would users in that country legally be allowed to download those movies, and would the US have any right to seize and shut down that server (as they have done with torrent sites in the past)?\n\nIn purely legal terms, you cannot simply seize property in foreign countries. You always need a country that cooperates (is required to cooperate) with you, be it based on international law or as a \"courtesy\". If, hypothetically, there were some super\\-rogue country that for some reason is completely autarch and doesn't want to do business with the rest of the world, you couldn't force them to let you seize anything. (The military surely could ...)\n\nHowever, even then, the operator of the server in your example would have some trouble of his own. Because if you operate a server in country X and offer Hollywood movies, without permission, you would expect that the rest of the world can download these movies as well, either directly or through a VPN service. In many countries, that would be enough to bring the action (the communication to the public of the content, see eg WCT, art 8\\) within the purview of their own jurisdiction. Which, in turn, means that the site operator should better not leave his country any time soon."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small island nation, Zephyria, decides to set its copyright expiration period to just one day.

The website operator could be considered in violation of copyright laws in countries where users can access the content, even through VPNs. This means they could face legal action if they travel to these countries. The US cannot unilaterally seize foreign servers without cooperation, and Zephyria's laws wouldn't be recognized globally.

Who is responsible for making this decision? What if there is disagreement among the Justices as to which interpretation is, in fact, the \"narrowest\" interpretation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### When *Marks* is relevant\n\nThe *Marks* rule is direction from the Supreme Court to lower court judges as to how to deduce the controlling position when the Court itself can't come to a majority position. When a majority of justices agree in the outcome of a case, but not on the law that gets them there, the *Marks* rule comes into play to determine what *reasoning* should be followed by lower courts.\n\n### An example\n\nI'll explain with an example that was at the center of the appeal in *[Hughes v. United States](https://casetext.com/case/hughes-v-united-states-105)* (2018\\).\n\nThe issue arose in *Hughes* because lower courts did not know how to deal with the 4\\-1\\-4 split in [*Freeman* (2013\\)](https://casetext.com/case/freeman-v-united-states-13). The *Marks* rule says to look at the positions of the members that concurred in the outcome. In *Freeman*, there were two positions that together accounted for the outcome: that of four justices (written by Justice Kennedy) and that of Justice Sotomayor, in a solo concurrence. Her position was arguably decided on a \"narrower\" ground. However, neither the Kennedy plurality nor the Sotomayor concurrence was a logical subset of the other. Justice Sotomayor was not merely agreeing with some but not all of the plurality's reasoning. She came to the same conclusion, but based on a different understanding of the law. Yet some circuits were treating Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in *Freeman* (with which no other justice had agreed) as the controlling opinion. This is apparently what *Marks* required.\n\n### *Marks* has always been confusing\n\nThe *Marks* rule has been a source of confusion in the jurisprudence and academia ever since it was announced. It was not reasoned nor explained by the Court when it was announced. It hasn't been reasoned or explained by the Court since. To the extent that the *Marks* rule has arguably clear application, it is in cases where the various reasons for judgment of the Court form a \"logical subset\" or \"common denominator\" structure. But many times, the reasons don't relate to each other that way (e.g. *Freeman*). There is sometimes no identifiable \"narrowest ground\" in that sense, and even where there is, it reflects a minority position of the court: one that none of the other justices agreed with.\n\n### The *Re* brief in *Hughes*\n\nProfessor [Richard M. Re](https://www.law.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/rmr6w/2914854) filed an [*amicus* brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) in *[Hughes v. United States](https://casetext.com/case/hughes-v-united-states-105)* (2018\\) on the topic of the *Marks* rule arguing that the *Marks* rule should be abandoned and replaced with the following:\n\n> A precedent of this Court should form only when most Justices expressly agree on a rule of decision.\n\nRe notes that the *Marks* rule \"applies precisely when this Court issues a decision that lacks any majority agreement on a rationale.\" He argues that \"there is no persuasive reason to treat views that lack majority support as binding, nationwide precedents.\"\n\nThe Court itself has said the *Marks* rule is \"easier stated than applied.\" And the Court has never attempted to explain the rule since. Re cites his own paper, \"[Beyond the Marks Rule](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090620)\" which he says further shows the rule has \"defined consistent application by lower courts.\" At [page 16 of the brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf), he describes [circuit splits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_split) that have developed over an attempt to apply the *Marks* rule to the reasons of the Court.\n\n### *Hughes* gave us no answer\n\nBoth parties in *Hughes* presented alternatives to the *Marks* rule. It was discussed extensively at [oral argument](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/17-155_2co3.pdf). Counsel for the petitioner acknowledged that, \"Whatever guidance Marks may have provided, it's probably caused more confusion than \\-\\- than guidance.\" The arguments contained analogies to Venn diagrams and Russian nesting dolls. Ultimately, the Court in *Hughes* found it unnecessary to resolve the \"proper application of *Marks*.\" Despite granting certiori to address those questions, they were able to resolve the case by skipping directly to the the merits of the substantive question about sentencing.\n\n### *Ramos* did not clarify things\n\nIn [*Ramos v. Louisiana*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-5924_n6io.pdf), 590 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2020\\) some members of the Court commented on what *Marks* might mean. Ironically, the Court in *Ramos* itself was split without a majority on the meaning of *Marks*. Justice Gorsuch, writing for three on this issue, said that *Marks* in fact does *not* ever result in a single justice's opinion becoming the controlling position. He presented this example:\n\n> Suppose we face a question of first impression under the Fourth Amendment: whether a State must obtain a warrant before reading a citizen's email in the hands of an Internet provider and using that email as evidence in a criminal trial. Imagine this question splits the Court, with four Justices finding the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant and four Justices finding no such requirement. The ninth Justice agrees that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, but takes an idiosyncratic view of the consequences of violating that right. In her view, the exclusionary rule has gone too far, and should only apply when the defendant is prosecuted for a felony. Because the case before her happens to involve only a misdemeanor, she provides the ninth vote to affirm a conviction based on evidence secured by a warrantless search.\n\nThis is a 4\\-1\\-4 split, in which the solo Justice holds the arguably narrowest grounds of decision, one which would be overruling precedent in this hypothetical. Justice Gorsuch says though that *Marks* \"never sought to offer or defend\" a rule that \"a single Justice's opinion can overrule prior precedents.\"\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, writing in concurrence, but not agreeing with Justice Gorsuch on his *Marks* point, said that the *Marks* rule is \"ordinarily commonsensical to apply and usually means that courts in essence heed the opinion that occupies the middle\\-ground position between (i) the broadest opinion among the Justices in the majority and (ii) the dissenting opinion.\" He noted that the members of the Court in *Ramos* had notably differing opinions about how to apply *Marks* to *Apodaca*: \"six Justices treat the result in *Apodaca* as precedent for purposes of *stare decisis* analysis. A different group of six Justices concludes that *Apodaca* should be and is overruled.\"\n\nThe dissent in *Ramos*, written by Justice Alito, was of the view the *Marks* applied to the ruling in *Apodaca* and that it produced precedential value that the Justice Gorsuch majority was ignoring. The dissent said that *Marks* clearly stands for the proposition that \"the position taken by a single Justice in the majority can constitute the binding rule for which the decision stands.\"\n\n### Further reading\n\nIf you're really interested in this, I suggest reading Richard Re's [brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) and his [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090620), read the parties' briefs in *Hughes* ([petitioner's](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/28738/20180122155818808_Hughes%20Merits%20Brief.pdf), [respondent's](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/36187/20180221203622477_17-155bs%20UnitedStates.pdf), [petitioner's reply](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/38841/20180313194715620_Hughes%20Merits%20Reply.pdf)), and listen to the [oral argument](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/17-155)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Supreme Court case with a 4-1-4 split decision, where the solo concurring justice's opinion is arguably on the \"narrowest grounds\" but is not a logical subset of the plurality opinion, how should lower courts apply the Marks rule according to recent Supreme Court discussions?\n\nA) They should always treat the solo concurrence as the controlling opinion.\nB) They should disregard the Marks rule entirely and wait for a majority opinion.\nC) They should apply the reasoning that occupies the middle-ground position between the broadest majority opinion and the dissent.\nD) There is no clear consensus, as different justices have expressed conflicting interpretations of how Marks should apply in such situations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The question addresses a complex scenario involving the application of the Marks rule in cases with fragmented Supreme Court decisions. Based on the information provided, particularly the discussions in Hughes v. United States (2018) and Ramos v. Louisiana (2020), there is no clear consensus on how to apply Marks in such situations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while some lower courts have treated solo concurrences as controlling under Marks (as in the Freeman case), this approach has been criticized and is not universally accepted.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, despite its criticisms, the Marks rule has not been abandoned by the Supreme Court, and lower courts are still expected to apply it in some form.\n\nOption C reflects Justice Kavanaugh's interpretation in Ramos, but it's not the only view expressed by the Court and doesn't fully address the scenario described in the question.\n\nOption D is correct because it accurately reflects the current state of uncertainty regarding the application of Marks. In Ramos, different justices expressed conflicting views on how to apply Marks. Justice Gorsuch argued that Marks should not allow a single justice's opinion to become controlling, while Justice Alito's dissent argued that Marks clearly allows for such an outcome. Justice Kavanaugh offered a third interpretation. This lack of consensus among the justices themselves demonstrates that there is no clear, agreed-upon approach for lower courts to follow in such complex scenarios."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14208/how-is-a-shareholder-allowed-to-sue-the-company", "docs_id": 14208, "title": "How is a shareholder allowed to sue the company?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are news about shareholders suing VW due to the losses that happened by the emissions fraud (lots of examples in the news, [this is just one of them](https://www.ft.com/content/185c4086-bb9f-11e5-bf7e-8a339b6f2164)).\n\nNow, I understand customers suing VW, and I would understand shareholders suing the CEO, the CTO, the entire board or any combination of them, and other managers implicated in the issue.

I'd like to exclude that, unless it's pivotal to the answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Water law is complicated and detail intense, but the basic principle is \"prior appropriation\".\n\nIn other words, you gain a water right by taking water from a river or other body of water and appropriating it for your use on a particular date, and then continuing to do so going forward. The older the date at which you first started using water in a river basin, the higher priority your water right will be.\n\nState officials (including a corps of civil engineers) and the courts with judges trained in water law, engage in the complicated matter of determining who has water rights from particular dates in particular river basins, in determining which prior appropriation date will provide the cutoff date for a particular snowmelt season, and in punishing people who use water from a river basin that their priority is insufficient to allow them to use.\n\nOnce established, water rights may be purchased and sold like property. So, for example, if a farming has water rights to X units of water dating with a 1891 appropriation date, and a developer wants to build a new subdivision whose residents need water in the same river basins, the developer can purchase the X units of water with an 1891 appropriate date from the farmer (who goes out of business without these water rights) and can give it to an HOA or water district for the developer's new subdivision.\n\nThere are special rules that tweak this general principle. The Western states have interstate compacts, which are basically treaties between U.S. states, that govern how much water upstream states must allow to pass to downstream states. These are not infrequently litigated in the original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThere are also special rules governing when and how much precipitation one can store in a cistern or rain barrel, treaties with Indian tribes regarding water rights, rules on storage of water you are allowed to use with your water rights, rules about wasting water, and rules about how groundwater aquifers are handled."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided water rights information:\n\nQuestion: In a Western U.S. state experiencing severe drought, a new housing development is being planned.

According to the principle of prior appropriation in Western water law, water rights are based on the date of first use and can be bought and sold like property. When the developer purchased the farmer's water rights dating back to 1891, they acquired the same priority for those rights. This means the new development will have the same high-priority standing for water use as the original farm did, based on the 1891 appropriation date. This is a common practice where developers buy older water rights to ensure water access for new constructions.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the priority is based on the appropriation date of the water rights, not the age of the homes. \nAnswer B is wrong because the date of home construction doesn't determine water rights priority when existing rights are purchased.\nAnswer D is incorrect as water rights are not determined by property taxes, but by the principle of prior appropriation."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59434/are-midi-files-copyrighted", "docs_id": 59434, "title": "Are Midi files copyrighted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I have a midi file of a public domain work, it the midi file copyrighted?

Or if some person or group perform a work and captures the performance with a digital recorder and saves it to a MIDI file, again that MIDI file will be protected by copyright as soon as it is recorded.\n\nHowever, if an existing recording is converted into a MIDI format, the MIDI will have the same copyright as the source recording, if any. No new copyright is generated, just as there is no new copyright for making a photocopy of a book.

If the score is PD, so is the MIDI. But often the publisher of a score will claim a copyright on that version, even if the composition is PD. Sometimes such a claim is valid, sometimes not. It depends on how much original content the publisher added.\n\nIf a work that is under copyright is recorded in a MIDI file, the file will be subject to two copyrights, the one on the composition, and the one on the recording. And if permission is not obtained from whoever holds the copyright on the composition, this will be copyright infringement. (There are, however, some cases where the law grants an automatic license to a performer for a \"cover\" version of a copyrighted work.)\n\nIf a work that is PD is recorded in a MIDI file, the file will be subject to only one copyright, the one on the recording.

How is an affirmative defense different from a defense (sans any adjective modifier)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally an affirmative defense raises some ground other than an element of the offense or civil claim, such as justification (e.g. self\\-defense), privilege (I'm a soldier acting under lawful orders so I'm immune from liability), the invalidity of a law, statute of limitations, insanity, a pardon, bankruptcy, a settlement agreement, or payment of the amount owed in full. In a civil case, an affirmative defense has to be raised in the answer to the complaint failed by the plaintiff or a timely amendment to that answer.\n\nThe prosecution/plaintiff has to overcome an affirmative defense **only if the defendant raises it**, and in a civil case, at least, the burden of proof for an affirmative defense is on the defendant. The **requirement that a defendant raise the defense** going to something beyond the elements of the crime or civil claim **is what makes it an \"affirmative\" defense**. **Affirmative defenses are conclusively presumed to be unavailable to the defendant if not raised**.\n\nUsually, it is possible to prevail in a civil or criminal case by establishing a complete affirmative defense, even if the defendant admits all of the elements of the crime or civil claim against the defendant have been proven.\n\nAlso, many affirmative defenses (e.g. failure to mitigate damages, or heat of passion) are incomplete affirmative defenses that reduce the consequences that a defendant will face if the prosecution/plaintiff establishes a prima facie case (i.e. proves all the elements of the crime or civil claim), but will not completely eliminate all consequences of the prosecution/plaintiffs' proof of all elements of the crime or civil claim for the defendant.\n\nBut the prosecution/plaintiff must always prove each and every element of a crime or civil claim (beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases, and by preponderance of the evidence or by clear and convincing evidence in most non\\-criminal claims) even if the defendant fails to present any evidence or make any arguments related to the element of the crime or civil claim to prevail on the merits.\n\nSomething that undermines an element of the crime or civil claim is a mere regular defense, because it doesn't have to be raised affirmatively, although in civil cases, facts that are alleged in a plaintiff's complaint are deemed admitted if they are not affirmatively denied, making the distinction between affirmative defenses and ordinary defenses in civil cases rather subtle.\n\nOf course, the term \"defense\" can be used to encompass both affirmative defenses, and other defenses which are not affirmative defenses (such as defenses that disprove an element of the crime or civil claim).\n\nJust to complicate matters further, there are a small number of ordinary defenses that still have to be raised affirmatively in advance in a criminal case despite the fact that it disproves an element of the crime, rather than advancing some other matter.

But that doesn't mean that a state couldn't enact a law that stated that birth occurs at conception (indeed, something close to that concept is the law in South Korea where historically you have been counted as one year old at birth and you get one year older for legal purposes each New Year's Day, regardless of when you were actually born, a law it is thinking of reforming in the near future to the global norm).\n\nBut, even if a state did this, it wouldn't matter.

There are a lot of anti\\-discrimination laws: numerous types at the federal, state and municipal level and different domains of discrimination (employment, public accommodation, education, voting...). Anti\\-discrimination laws generally describe civil consequences resulting from impermissible discrimination, not criminal penalties. [52 USC\u202f10308a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/10308), part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, provides criminal penalties for anyone who (attempts to)\ndeprive any person of any right secured by section 10301\\-10304 or 10306\\. 10301 is the provision that people cannot be denied the right to vote on the basis of race of color.

We can, however, address the question of legality. Federal regulations apply to \"public water systems\". In the salient definitions, [42 USC 300f(4\\)(A)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300f) says that\n\n> The term \u201cpublic water system\u201d means a system for the provision to the\n>  public of water for human consumption through pipes or other\n>  constructed conveyances, if such system has at least fifteen service\n>  connections or regularly serves at least twenty\\-five individuals.\n\nAssuming that there are at least 25 individuals being so served, it must be determined whether the water is being \"provided to the public\", and that isn't obvious. However, [42 USC 300g](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300g) says that the regulations do not apply to a system\n\n> (1\\) which consists only of distribution and storage facilities (and\n>  does not have any collection and treatment facilities); (2\\) which\n>  obtains all of its water from, but is not owned or operated by, a\n>  public water system to which such regulations apply; (3\\) which does\n>  not sell water to any person; and (4\\) which is not a carrier which\n>  conveys passengers in interstate commerce.\n\nIt is most likely that all of these conditions are true, so federal testing requirements do not apply. This does not preclude there being state regulations, which may well be more stringent (though they tend to copy the federal rules), but we'd need to know the state. \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nNew Jersey adopted the federal regulations unchanged. The issue over lead in the water is that corrosive water can leach lead from the plumbing into the water. There is a testing procedure and a threshold of acceptable lead where the town doesn't have to do anything, and above that they are supposed to treat the water (and if they don't, you have the Flint problem). The testing involves sampling at the tap, and if there is more that 0\\.015 mg/L lead in more than 10% of samples, the supplier is supposed to take corrosion\\-control steps. There are also lead service line regulations. There being regulations which put the onus of the problem on the water supplier, and no rules which obligate owners of buildings to rip out existing lead plumbing, the public has not generally been aware of the potential hazard, and it is unlikely that a university could be sued because / if it has some lead in its plumbing that leached into the water (assuming that the lead comes from the university, and not the city supply lines).

The university is not considered a \"public water system\" under federal law, as it meets the exemption criteria outlined in 42 USC 300g. Therefore, it is not subject to the same testing requirements as public water suppliers. However, as the owner of the building and responsible for its plumbing, the university could potentially be held liable if it's determined that its plumbing contributed to the elevated lead levels.

Yet they have been applied over people causing them problems and harm in their lives. Usually graduated psychologists/ psychiatrists are ignorant which is the supposed proof of these theories. They've been told they have been proven sometimes, sometimes they've been given some details, and they don't know they don't have a real basis behind them until it's massively accepted they are wrong. Personally, I see little to no responsibilities in them. In the other hand, governments and states promote these theories in secondary schools, they teach them and form professionals in national universities, and they hold the power to treat people in trials and to internate someone for being ill under these theories. Some other organizations, which I'm not very aware who they are, but I assume they might be colleges or agrupations of psychiatrists/psychologists regulate their professional's activities, and I assume they might be the ones giving the content to national universities for the formation of professionals under these theories.

The court found that the US did not provide an adequate level of data protection, in particular due to national security / surveillance laws like FISA 702 and EO 12333\\. While European countries also have surveillance laws, the US laws are fundamentally different because the affected (non\\-US) persons have no real recourse: they can't really sue against overbroad or illegal surveillance.\n\nAdequacy decisions are only one of many \u201ctransfer tools\u201d that can allow international data transfers. Other tools include Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), \u201ccodes of conduct\u201d, \u201ccertification mechanisms\u201d, or as a last resort Art 49 derogations.\n\nSCCs are a pre\\-formulated contract template provided by the EU that sort out responsibilities between the data exporter in Europe and the data importer in the non\\-European country. In essence, SCCs translate enough of the GDPR into contract law.\n\nBut SCCs are not necessarily valid, and this was also discussed as part of the Schrems II judgement. In [their opinion on the new 2021 SCCs, the EDPB\\+EDPS](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/edpbedps-joint-opinion/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-22021-standard_en) summarize the post\\-Schrems challenges to SCCs (edited to add bullet points):\n\n> In order to be valid, SCCs must incorporate effective mechanisms\n> \n> \n> * that make it possible, in practice, to ensure compliance with the level of protection required by EU law\n> * and that transfers of personal data pursuant to these clauses are suspended or prohibited in the event of the breach of such clauses or if\n> it is impossible to honour them.\n\nIn essence, a company can't sign SCCs if they are also subject to laws (such as US spy laws) that are incompatible with these SCCs.\n\nWhether SCCs are valid in a particular context is not for the EU to decide, but for the data controller to determine.\n\n* In particular, it is possible that SCCs alone are not sufficient. They are just a contract and cannot bind the authorities in the host country of the data importer. Thus, it may be necessary to implement supplemental measures to protect the transfer that makes the personal data worthless if it falls into the wrong hands. After Schrems II, the [EDPB published recommendations on such supplemental measures](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en), for example end to end encryption where the data importer never gets access to the keys. But this prevents use of nearly all SaaS/cloud services, perhaps with the exception of dumb backup storage.\n* In a different direction, industry has focused on a \u201crisk based approach\u201d to data transfers. For example, the IAPP has a [transfer impact assessment template](https://iapp.org/resources/article/transfer-impact-assessment-templates/). While this departs from the CJEU/EDPB interpretation, it might be a valid approach for EU\u2013US transfers if and ony if you believe that US laws have since changed, so that Schrems II would be outdated.\n\nIn all of this, the new 2021 SCC templates do not quite help. I think the new SCCs are very good since they address many issues with the previous (pre\\-GDPR) templates, but they do not magically negate Schrems II issues. Nothing the EU commission can do by itself can help here, whether this is new SCCs or negotiations for a new Privacy Shield treaty. The Schrems II issues can only be resolved (a) by amending the GDPR to drastically lower the protections for international transfers, or (b) by an act of the US Congress introducing stronger checks and balances into relevant spy laws, in particular providing real legal recourse for affected non\\-US persons.\n\nSo yes, you can absolutely use the US\\-based Google Firebase Auth service, if one of the following holds:\n\n* Your analysis has determined that Google is not subject to problematic surveillance laws.\n* The EU or US legal environment have significantly changed since Schrems II.\n* You believe that you and Google have implemented sufficiently strong supplemental measures so that the US couldn't get their hands on your user's data even if it wanted to.\n* You subscribe to the \u201ctransfer risk assessment\u201d school of thought and, as a result of such an assessment, believe that Google is unlikely to receive problematic requests from US intelligence agencies regarding your user's data.\n* (unethical: considering how unlikely it is to get sued or fined, do the transfer anyway)\n\nGiven all of this trouble, it might end up being easier using a different authentication service.

The correct answer, C, reflects this complexity. \n\nA thorough transfer impact assessment is necessary to evaluate the risks associated with data transfer to the US, particularly in light of the Schrems II decision which invalidated the EU-US Privacy Shield.

However, F3 visas are classified exclusively as immigrant visas according to the U.S. Department of State. The proclamation's language in \u00a72 clearly states that it applies to \"any alien seeking entry pursuant to any of the following nonimmigrant visas.\" Since F3 is an immigrant visa category, it falls outside the scope of this proclamation's suspension and limitations.

Or something like that.\n\nThe context I'm dealing with is hypothetical/fictional and involves a few more parties than the simple case, so inexact or related terms would also be of interest. Also any (English speaking?) legal system's terminology would work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You\u2019ve presented a number of different scenarios, without a lot of specifics, so I\u2019ll start from the top, and from a US perspective.\n\nA *very* generic term that would come up in this situation is material misstatement. one might say that an account or line item is overstated or understated, or a misstatement could arise from the omission of a necessary note, because notes are an integral part of the financial statements. Financial statements are said to be materially misstated if the misstatement would affect the choice of a typical decisionmaker. There\u2019s no explicit standard for what is or isn\u2019t material, but in practice, auditors often choose some small fraction of net income as the threshold. Materiality can also be caused by positive vs. negative earnings, or other thresholds, like financing agreements which might oblige the company to keep its current ratio above a certain level, for example. In the US, the rules to which the statements have to be materially correct are known as GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and they are codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC).\n\nDepending on how the scheme is arranged, issues in the realm of \u201cbuying stuff as a \u201ccustomer\u201d to make the business look good\u201d include:\n\nSubstance over form: it may not be appropriate to recognize as a sale at all. If the net effect is a transfer of cash from the owner or manager to the business, while the goods find their way back into the company warehouse, that could be considered as paid\\-in\\-capital, or even a liability, rather than a sale. Owner bought some product to inject cash, and put the goods back in the inventory? That\u2019s cash from the stockholder, not a customer sale. Somebody in management moved a truckload of product to his storage unit, only to return it after year end? That might be more accurately characterized as a loan, not a sale. I don\u2019t know of any specific terms for this exclusively, but there have certainly been cases where companies moved inventory to undisclosed warehouses in an effort to hide fictitious sales from their independent auditors. **Edit**: Another term for certain sales without commercial substance is a \u201c**roundtrip transaction**\u201d or \u201c**roundtripping**.\u201d\n\nDisclosure notes: even if there is commercial substance to the transaction, it may require disclosure notes, such as those for related party transactions, as required by ASC 850\\. Transactions with related parties must be disclosed even if they are not given accounting recognition (ASC 850\\-05\\-5\\). Examples of related parties are given in ASC 850\\-05\\-3, including \u201can entity and its principal owners, management, or members of their immediate families,\u201d among others. Under the relevant definition, a person does not need a formal title to be considered a member of management (ASC 850\\-10\\-20\\). The related party disclosure is not required in consolidated financial statements, for transactions that are eliminated in the consolidation process (ASC 850\\-10\\-50\\-1\\). For sales from a public company to a bona\\-fide external customer, there\u2019s also the major customers disclosure, but the threshold for that is 10% of revenue, which is much more than enough to materially impact the bottom line.\n\nGenerally, transactions between a parent company and a subsidiary will be eliminated in the preparation of the parent\u2019s (consolidated) financial statements (ASC 810\\). This means if the parent company A sells goods with a carrying value of $30 to its subsidiary, B, at a price of $50, A doesn\u2019t recognize that $20 gross profit until B sells the goods to an outside party. Internally, B might carry the goods at $50 on B\u2019s books, but A would have to cancel it out so that only $30 of that appears on A\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The consolidation method is applied when one business has a controlling interest in another, and in summary it means that the parent company reports A\\+B\u2019s financials as if it was all a single entity. That means B\u2019s assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, are all reported as part of A. It also means any transactions between B and A are transactions within the entity; you wouldn\u2019t recognize a gain or loss (nor revenue and GP) if your marketing department sold office equipment to your engineering department, and you don\u2019t get to with subsidiaries either. Consolidation requires not only eliminating revenues, cost of goods sold, and excess carrying value of inventories on intra\\-entity transactions; it's also gains and losses on things like equipment, meaning the same transaction could require a consolidation adjustment twenty years later to eliminate excess depreciation expense. Long story short, ASC 810 deals with consolidation, and those rules apply when you create or purchase a subsidiary to buy your stuff, or use a subsidiary to pass the same $200,000 back and forth.\n\nWhen the parent entity does not have a controlling interest in the investee (the basic threshold is 50% of voting shares, or by some other agreement) but does have significant influence (representation on the board or other factors in ASC 323\\-10\\-15\\-6\\), then it will be treated as an equity method investment. Instead of adding the line items together, it's a single asset and A's portion of B's earnings are a single line item on the income statement, but the adjustments are similar to those in a consolidation.\n\nAnother kind of revenue recognition game which companies used to play involved bill\\-and\\-hold arrangements, wherein the customer (or the \u201ccustomer,\u201d or a salesperson without any real input from the supposed customer) would place an order, and the company would send (or at least, prepare and book) an invoice (revenue), but not ship the goods until the customer actually asked for them. These days, the rules on revenue recognition are fairly guarded against these kinds of things, but some other examples of \u201csales\u201d that aren\u2019t really sales include consignment arrangements, repurchase agreements (could be a sale with right of return, or depending on terms could be effectively a lease or a financing arrangement), and the gross vs net revenue issue for principle/agent situations (airline and hotel booking sites are a popular example. If they\u2019re an agent they\u2019re required to report their commission on a net basis but would likely prefer to look bigger by calling it a $110 sale and $100 cost of goods sold, instead of just $10 revenue).\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in management schemes to mislead the users of financial statements, check out the SEC\u2019s online archive of Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) [here](http://sec.gov/divisions/enforce/friaction.htm). Some of them just deal with individual professionals who should know better, but they can be pretty interesting, whether they involve poor ICFR, or intentional deception on the part of upper management (it's on management either way)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company is engaging in transactions where it sells products to a subsidiary at an inflated price, and the subsidiary then sells these products back to the parent company.

However, in consolidated financial statements, transactions between a parent company and its subsidiary are eliminated during the consolidation process, as per ASC 810. This follows the principle of \"substance over form,\" where the economic reality of the transaction (no actual external sale) is prioritized over its legal form.\n\nThe practice won't increase reported revenue or profits in consolidated statements (eliminating option A) because intra-entity transactions are removed. It's not just a material misstatement issue (B) or only a disclosure matter (C), as the consolidation process actively eliminates these transactions.\n\nOption D is correct because it accurately describes both the principle at play (substance over form) and the outcome (elimination in consolidation with no effect on reported revenue or profits)."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13113/what-if-my-roommate-doesnt-pay-his-rent", "docs_id": 13113, "title": "What if my roommate doesn&#39;t pay his rent", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a student and I've co\\-leased an apartment with another person.

Some cities have passed laws that deem trash to be city's property as soon as it is placed in a city\\-supplied trash bin, because the city (or a private contractor) hauls to and owns the landfill. Other cities claim legal ownership of recyclables when placed on the curb, for the obvious reason that they are worth money. The law can be not settled if objects are in alleys and not in trash bins, or simply placed on the curb.\n\nFor the sake of discussion, there are numerous examples of cities looking the other way with scavengers and pickers; it all depends on the location and the enforcement. (And, there are examples of the police being able to legally pull evidence from trash; but that's not the question here.)\n\n> Go to the landfill, load some trash into my truck, then drive away?\n\nThink about it: you're obviously not going to be able to do this in a location with a managed landfill with employees that check you in and take your tipping fee. If it's a private trash contractor, it's private property; for a city, it's probably against the contract you signed when you paid to dump and probably against city law to salvage from the landfill, for liability reasons.
