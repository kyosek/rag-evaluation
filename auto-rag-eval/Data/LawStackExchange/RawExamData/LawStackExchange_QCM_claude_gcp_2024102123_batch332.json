The fact that you have licensed your work under a CC license to one group does not prevent you from licensing it to someone else under a different license with different terms. This is true even if the CC license could apply to this other person. The CC license doesn't restrict what you can do with your own work. It only restricts what other people can do when they choose to use your work under the terms of the CC license.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author publishes a book online under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license (CC BY-SA 3.0). Later, a filmmaker approaches the author to create a film adaptation with exclusive rights. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the author's ability to grant such rights?\n\nA) The author cannot grant exclusive rights for a film adaptation because the CC BY-SA 3.0 license requires all adaptations to be shared under the same license.\n\nB) The author can grant exclusive rights for a film adaptation, but only if they first revoke the CC BY-SA 3.0 license from the online version of the book.\n\nC) The author can grant exclusive rights for a film adaptation, as the original copyright holder retains the ability to license their work under different terms to different parties.\n\nD) The author can grant exclusive rights for a film adaptation, but only for the version of the book stored on their personal computer, not the online version.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As the original copyright holder, the author retains the right to license their work under different terms to different parties, regardless of previously granted licenses. The CC BY-SA 3.0 license does not restrict the author's rights to their own work; it only defines how others can use the work under that specific license. The author can therefore enter into a separate agreement with the filmmaker, granting exclusive rights for a film adaptation, without affecting the CC BY-SA 3.0 license already in place for the online version of the book. This flexibility allows copyright holders to maintain control over their work while also sharing it under open licenses."

This is because the original company may cease to exist and cannot legally continue to pay the employee. However, the new contract must not disadvantage the employee in any way. All terms should remain the same, and importantly, the time worked at the previous company must be recognized as continuous employment.

It requires several steps, including a valid arrest warrant from the demanding state (Colorado in this case), a formal request from the Executive Authority (typically the Governor) of Colorado, and a judicial hearing in the state where the person is located (Arizona).

That evidence is later used by prosecution against the person who provided the evidence in a separate, unrelated case.\n\nOne can easily imagine instances where this occurs:\n\n1. This question is inspired by the [recent revelation](https://abc7news.com/sf-rape-kits-dna-database-sfpd-sexual-assaults-evidence-chesa-boudin-san-francisco-police-data/11567095/) of some police precincts of archiving DNA evidence collected in one investigation for use in later investigations. The policy in question allowed police to use DNA samples obtained during investigation of rape victims to archive the victim's DNA evidence in databases which were later searched and used to implicate the victims in unrelated crimes. This particular issue has been explored on this site [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77907/can-a-rape-victims-dna-be-used-against-them-in-criminal-proceedingshttps:/). \u200b\n2. A person surrenders dashcam footage to a police officer because it contains evidence of a hit and run accident. The footage is later used as evidence against the person because it shows that he or she was speeding earlier that day.\n3. Police solicit tips/evidence in the search for a suspect in a violent crime. A person gives an eyewitness account of the crime in a good\\-faith attempt to aid in the investigation. The eyewitness account implies that the person was in a location and time in violation of their parole, which is later used against them in a separate trial. (edit: I understand that the Exclusionary Rule doesn't generally apply to parole revocation hearings, but the sentiment is the same and one could easily modify the scenario to be about a different secondary crime).\n\nWhat policies or statutes govern the use of evidence past its original intended use? Does consent to surrender evidence in once case amount to surrendering that evidence for all uses, forever? My prima facie assumption would be that the Exclusionary Rule would apply here because the evidence was obtained in a somewhat disingenuous / coercive manner (good\\-faith assumption that the evidence was only being provided to aid in investigation of a particular crime) and that such a bait\\-and\\-switch collection of evidence amounts to a violation of the 5th Amendment.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are essentially no such limits on the use of such evidence.\n\nThe police are free to use evidence from one case in whatever other cases it may be helpful, and criminals have no right to turn over evidence to the police on the condition that it not be used against them.\n\nThe Exclusionary Rule has no application here, because it only governs evidence that was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Because the defendant here consented to producing the evidence, the Fourth Amendment does not apply.\n\nNor does the Fifth Amendment prohibit the use of this evidence.

Based on the information provided, there are essentially no limits on the use of evidence voluntarily provided to law enforcement, even if it was originally given for a different purpose. The police are free to use evidence from one case in other cases where it may be helpful. The Exclusionary Rule does not apply here because the evidence was obtained with consent, not in violation of the Fourth Amendment.

This interpretation allows the solicitor to first deduct their base fees from the settlement offer, then apply the 50-50 split to the remaining amount, and finally subtract the success fee from the client's portion. While this interpretation may be controversial, it provides a logical explanation for the solicitor's calculations without assuming misconduct or ignoring the CCL's terms.

There is a massive banking catastrophe and most banks fail.\n\nCompanies do not cease to exist because they are in bankruptcy. Typically a caretaker management is set in place (elected either by the borrowers or the judge overseeing the bankruptcy) to avoid the loss of value during those proceedings.\n\nUsually a company in bankruptcy has to reduce its operations because it will find it difficult to get resources to continue its usual operations. But it could continue those operations that are still expected to provide a profit. It would not be unusual for the caretaker manager to ask more funds from the borrowers in order to ensure that they do not lose even more of the value of the company.\n\nI would say that debt collection is profitable enough to keep it running, at very least to cover the minimal legal requirements so that the debt does not expire.\n\nAnd at the very least, **the debt can be sold** to a debt collection agency or another bank, outside of the bankruptcy proceedings (then the net value of this sell is what will be passed on to the borrowers). It will give a small profit for the original company, but at almost no cost or risk for them.\n\n> Also, the debt holder would have no incentive to collect if it was in bankruptcy proceedings and didnt own anything.\n\nYou are confusing managers with owners. The people deciding what to do are the managers, and even in bankruptcy managers still owe fiduciary duty to their business. In fact, in general there is no need for the manager of the company to \"own anything\" of the company they manage, yet they have to work to improve its situation.\n\nIf a manager negligently caused the company to cause value, he could be sued for it. Even if he is not sued, it would look very bad for him when looking for a new job.\n\nIn any case, this is not different than the shop across the street going out of business. Have you seen any of them putting a sign telling \"We no longer own anything, so come here and help yourself whatever you want for free\"? No? A credit card company would not do that, either.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: When a bank holding consumer debt fails and enters bankruptcy proceedings, what is most likely to happen to the outstanding debts?\n\nA) The debts are automatically forgiven and consumers no longer have to pay\nB) The debts expire after 18 months due to the average bankruptcy timeframe\nC) The debts are sold or transferred to other financial institutions or collection agencies\nD) The debts become uncollectible as the bankrupt institution has no incentive to pursue them\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a bank fails and enters bankruptcy, outstanding debts don't simply disappear. Instead, they are typically sold or transferred to other financial institutions or debt collection agencies. This allows the bankrupt institution to recover some value from these assets.\n\nOption A is incorrect because debts are not automatically forgiven when a bank fails. Consumers are still obligated to pay their debts.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the length of bankruptcy proceedings doesn't determine the expiration of debts. The statute of limitations on debt is separate from bankruptcy timelines.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even during bankruptcy, there is still incentive to collect on debts or sell them to recover value. Managers have a fiduciary duty to maximize the value of the company's assets, including outstanding debts.\n\nThe key point is that debts are valuable assets that can be sold or transferred, ensuring they continue to exist and remain collectible even if the original creditor fails."

A SAFE is not a loan (and for that matter isn't even a share in the company) and doesn't create an enforceable contractual right to get your money back. If you make an equity investment and the company loses money and goes out of business, you lose everything you invested.\n\nIf the promoter made false representations that induced you to invest, or actively concealed material facts about the investment, you might be able to sue the promoter for securities fraud under federal regulation 10b\\-5, or under a state securities law, or under a common law fraud theory.\n\nYou could also sue to issuer of the investment (i.e. the company) but that would usually be futile because the company is broke and hence judgment proof.\n\nState or federal securities regulators or a local district attorney or state attorney\\-general might pursue the case in lieu of a private civil action by you, but getting them to take action is often quite difficult.\n\nBut, if your investment wasn't induced by fraud and instead the management of the company simply made bad decisions that caused the company to fail, you have no remedy.\n\n> The investment was for a SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity).

Then the stock appreciates a little, I buy more and I end up with 50% ownership.\n\nDo I now own the company? Can I vote myself CEO, sleep in the parking lot and do whatever I want with the company property?\n\nNormally, when private security removes people for trespassing, they're acting on the authority of the owner. But if I pay a small, token amount to become the owner can I still be removed as a tresspasser?\n\nIt seems awfully cheaper to just buy stake in a company than to buy a house or whatever.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The company's property is controlled by the company's management **on behalf of** the stockholders, not by the stockholders directly. Simply being a stockholder \\-\\- even a major one \\-\\- gives a person no rights of access, nor rights to do anything with company property.\n\nThe management of a company could permit a person access to that company's property. The company's board of directors could instruct management to grant such access. Stockholders normally select board members.\n\nIn practice if a major stockholder asked management for access it would quite likely be granted.\n\nHowever, one should note that companies with a stock value under $2 million are unlikely to **own** a building with a parking lot. Such a company is much more likely to **lease** space in such a building, and that lease will have conditions. It is likely that one condition is that the property is not to be used for residential purposes.\n\nEven if the company owns the building and the land, zoning rules or other local laws may well make it unlawful for anyone to live on the premises or sleep in the parking lot. Whether and how such laws will be enforced depends on many details and the local situation. But even an \"owner\" will not have the kind of lawful entitlement that a homeowner or renter has to a house or apartment.\n\nAlso, you can't invest $50k and get a margin loan for another $200k. You would have to invest at least $125k to make a purchase of $250k, and quite possibly more, depending on your credit status:\n\nAccording to [this SEC page](https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsmarginhtm.html):\n\n> According to Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, you may borrow up to 50 percent of the purchase price of securities that can be purchased on margin. This is known as the \"initial margin.\" Some firms require you to deposit more than 50 percent of the purchase price. Also be aware that not all securities can be purchased on margin.\n\nWith a down payment of $125k and reasonable credit, one can probably purchase a house worth $500k or more, depending on the local market.",

This is typically a function of the board of directors.\n\nC is incorrect because shareholders don't have direct control over company assets. The company's management controls assets on behalf of shareholders.\n\nD is correct because as a majority shareholder, the investor would have significant voting power in electing board members.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My extended family is rather large, and I would like to make a family tree. Given the nature of the data I'll have a lot of peoples personal data. Preferably their immediate family relations, name, a picture, DOB, phone number, email address, Facebook link. And potentially more.\n\nSome of this information I know just because they're my family, I wouldn't have been given GDPR consent when I was a child first meeting them. This would be things like their name and who they're related to. After this I know some DOBs for similar reasons. I can get phone numbers from our family chat. I can get a picture and some additional information from Facebook. Etc.\n\n---\n\nGiven that all of this information is almost definitely protected by GDPR could I legally make a family tree?\n\nWhat if:\n\n* The family tree is strictly for myself.\n* The family tree can only be seen by people in that tree. And they can only see people they're blood/adopted relatives of, and people married into the tree.\n\nTo be clear my fathers side could see my mother, but not her side of the family. I can see both sides, as I'm blood related to both.\n* What if I want to be able to include more than just the two families?\n\nSay one of my cousins are in a similar situation and wants to include both their sides of the family.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR has an exemption for *purely personal or household activity*. Creating a family tree seems purely personal as long as you don't publish it. You're also allowed to freely share the tree as long as it stays within that purely personal scope. Your proposed restriction of only showing data of blood relatives seems excessively strict.\n\nBut assuming that this exemption wouldn't apply, there'd probably still be no problem. The GDPR does not require you to always obtain consent. It requires that the purposes for which you process personal data are covered by some legal basis. Consent is one such legal basis, but *legitimate interest* is another.\n\n* You can likely argue that you have a legitimate interest to create a tree of your (extended) family.\n* The legitimate interest must be weighed against the rights and freedoms of the affected persons. For example, contact information could be used for stalking.\n* The balance of the legitimate interest check can be changed if you adopt suitable safeguards. Your idea of only sharing data with close relatives would be such a safeguard, but it might not be necessary.\n* When you rely on legitimate interest, the affected person can object to further processing, furthermore they can request to be erased from your records.\n\t+ A request for erasure can be denied if there are overriding grounds to keep the data. E.g maybe only contact information has to be deleted but names, dates, and relations might be kept.\n* You should notify persons when they are included into your records.\n* It is your obligation as the data controller to make these decisions. If someone disagrees they can sue you or lodge a complaint with a supervision authority.\n\nNote that dead persons are not natural persons in the sense of the GDPR, and have no privacy. However, national laws may provide such protections.",

The personal use exemption likely applies to creating a family tree for purely personal purposes. Even if this exemption doesn't apply, the creation of a family tree could potentially be justified under the \"legitimate interest\" basis. Sharing within the family is possible, but implementing safeguards (like restricting access) is advisable. Options A and B are too restrictive and don't account for the personal use exemption or legitimate interest basis. Option D is incorrect because GDPR does apply to living individuals' data, regardless of blood relation, and the exemptions are based on use rather than relation."

This in turn could place an employee in a category where their job is at risk as they are judged as being an underperformer, and similary if this voluntary work is not completed it can prevent an employee reaching a higher grade.\n\nThe performance grade also has a direct link to salary increases and bonus.\n\nThe voluntary work is with children, and although I have children myself I do not feel comfortable in a school setting. In short, I do not want to do this.\n\nYes, it is admirable that our company has paired up with this charity, but as you can probably infer I am not happy being forced to take part, or that my overall work performance is judged on whether I do this 'voluntary' work.\n\nSo to my question. Is what they are doing legal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As you state in comments that this is to be carried out during working hours I think the answer is most likely that yes they can use this to affect your performance scoring. Most UK employment contracts will have a \"flexibility clause\" that says something about being required to carry out \"other duties as assigned\" there's a certain amount of \"reasonableness\" that has to be considered which will depend on how different the duties are from your \"actual\" job but that would be determined by a judge/tribunal (if it got that far).\n\nIf your contract has got no such clause they would have a tough time making you do this or firing you for non\\-compliance.\n\nThat said since (if I'm reading your post correctly) not doing this voluntary work is not in of itself enough to put your job at risk \\- instead it merely prevents you reaching higher grades and receiving bonuses etc. then they are well within their legal rights to do this. It doesn't sound as if you are being singled out (which could be considered \"cruel and unusual\") either.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An employee at a UK company is concerned about the legality of their employer's policy regarding voluntary work. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation described in the documentation?\n\nA) The employer's policy of including voluntary work in performance objectives is illegal if it affects an employee's job security.\n\nB) The employer cannot legally use participation in voluntary work as a factor in determining bonuses or salary increases.\n\nC) The employer's policy is likely legal if the voluntary work is conducted during working hours and doesn't single out specific employees.\n\nD) The employer can only legally require voluntary work if it's explicitly stated in the employee's contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The documentation suggests that the employer's policy of including voluntary work in performance objectives is likely legal, especially if conducted during working hours. Key points supporting this:\n\n1. Most UK employment contracts have a \"flexibility clause\" allowing for \"other duties as assigned.\"\n2. The policy doesn't appear to single out specific employees, which could be considered discriminatory.\n3. The voluntary work alone isn't enough to put jobs at risk, but rather affects higher grades and bonuses.\n4. The policy applies to all employees equally, making it part of the overall performance evaluation.\n\nWhile options A and B are incorrect because the policy can legally affect job performance evaluations and rewards, option D is too restrictive. Even without an explicit contract clause, the employer can likely assign such duties under a general flexibility clause."

There is also generally a requirement to affirmatively state in adoption proceeding if the father is, or might be, a member of a Native American tribe, as that goes to the jurisdictional issue of the applicability of the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, which requires notice, at a minimum, to the father's Indian tribe, even if notice cannot be given to the father.\n\nThere is a presumption that a child born to a woman married to a husband is the child of the husband and after a certain number of years, for certain purposes (such as child support). This presumption is usually conclusive and cannot be rebutted even by DNA evidence to the contrary, on the theory that the husband is the psychological parent of the child and has assumed that responsibility, and in order to discourage after the fact denials of paternity simply to avoid child support when paternity was never disputed.\n\nThere is also a presumption that a birth certificate's statement of paternity is correct, although this is in often not a conclusive presumption. And, birth certificates are a matter of public record, so a man can search the vital statistics records of a state to see if anyone has identified him as a father even if he has not been told of that fact, arguably giving him constructive knowledge of his paternity in that case.\n\nBut, the identity of the person who is the child's father, or of persons who could be the child's father, is not privileged (other than under the 5th Amendment right against self\\-incrimination where applicable), and so, a woman can generally be legally compelled to disclose this information by subpoena or in response to discovery in litigation. \n\nFor example, a woman under the age of consent at the time her child was conceived can be incarcerated for contempt of court for failing to disclose the name of the father in connection with a criminal prosecution of a suspected father of the child for statutory rape.",

However, there are a few exceptions to this rule. One of these exceptions is when applying for certain kinds of welfare benefits, where identification of a father is required for some programs. \n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no legal requirement to inform the father when the child reaches adulthood. \n\nOption C is incorrect as the mother's marital status does not create an obligation to inform the biological father. \n\nOption D is incorrect because a change of address does not trigger a legal requirement to inform the biological father.\n\nIt's important to note that while option A is correct in this context, the other main exceptions mentioned in the text are in cases of adoption proceedings and potentially in wrongful death lawsuits involving the child.

If all incomes are distributed to Founders, (rather than being held by the company *per se*,) how is the company to maintain its own bank accounts for the purpose of paying expenses, just for starters? And if that's not what it literally means, as the words \"as if\" seem to suggest, what exactly *does* this clause mean and why is it a desirable thing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nThis is almost certainly a company subject to U.S. tax law because the language is language tailored to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. the question is answered with this in mind.\n\n**In General**\n\nThe \"allocation\" referenced (a term distinct from \"distributions\" of property or management of property) is only for tax purposes and capital accounts in the books and records and tax returns of the company.\n\nThe company has its own income, bank accounts, etc. But, for tax and accounting purposes, income, revenue, expenses and tax credits are allocated to particular owners of the company each year.\n\nEvery company taxed as a partnership needs to have allocation language in its governing documents (although default terms can be supplied by statute in very simple degenerate cases when the governing documents fail to do so).\n\n**Background Re Types Of Entities And Taxation Of Them**\n\nIn U.S. income tax law, most companies with more than one owner are taxed as partnerships under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code (including most limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, limited partnerships, limited liability limited partnerships, and limited partnership associations, and most comparable foreign entities that active elect this treatment, collectively called \"eligible entities\"). This is a \"flow though regime\".\n\nThe main exceptions for business companies are corporations taxed as \"C\\-corporations\" which are taxed as separate entities, corporations which are S\\-corporations which have a modified and more rigid partnership tax regime that is likewise a flow through regimes, eligible entities that elect to be taxed as C\\-corporations or S\\-corporations, and eligible entities with a single member that a disregarded as separate from their owner for income tax purposes.\n\nIn a flow though partnership tax regime, all items of income, revenue, and expense, and all tax credits of the company are allocated to the owners of the company, and the company itself doesn't actually pay taxes even though it fills out an information tax return on Form 1065 that reports income, revenue, expense and tax credits and then allocates 100% of these items to owners of the company on a Schedule K\\-1 for each owner to whom any tax item is allocated in that year.\n\n**The Novelty Or Lack Thereof Of The Clause Itself**\n\nIt isn't that unusual an approach, although it is a minority approach. The purpose of having that term is to make sure that the allocation is legally valid because it has \"substantial economic effect\" which means that there are circumstances in which the allocation of tax items related to real world distributions from the company in some circumstance or other.\n\nThe most unusual part of the referenced language is that is uses \"assets sold at their fair market value\" rather than [book value](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-are-book-value-and-market-value-different/), which is called a \"mark to market\" system.\n\nThis is almost unheard of outside the financial industry, and is uncommon even in the commercial banking part of the financial industry. Instead, using book value for assets in accounting and tax allocations is much more common. Normally, this would only be found in a company invested in marketable securities with readily quotable fair market value prices.\n\nBook value is more common than mark to market systems in most cases because otherwise the assets of the company have to be appraised each year in order to complete the company's tax returns and this can be a costly and inexact way to value assets, contrary to the certainty, clarity and much lower cost associated with using book value for assets that don't have a readily determined market value because they are fungible and frequently traded.",

This is important for companies taxed as partnerships under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code. The clause doesn't actually require liquidation or immediate distribution of income, but rather sets up a hypothetical scenario for tax allocation purposes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the clause doesn't require actual distribution of income to founders. It's about allocation for tax purposes.\n\nOption B is incorrect as this clause doesn't address day-to-day management of company finances.\n\nOption D, while related to the fair market value mention, is not the primary purpose of the clause. The \"mark to market\" approach is noted as unusual in most industries outside of finance.\n\nThe correct answer, C, reflects the main goal of ensuring the tax allocation method is legally valid by having \"substantial economic effect\" as required by U.S. tax regulations for partnerships."

Indeed it must, otherwise there would be no copyright protection for ebooks and for downloadable music. Thus, I would take 17 U.S. Code \u00a7121 to apply. The word \"material\" in copyright law has been held to include \"stored in electronic form on any storage device\" so that the key requirement for an initial copyright, that the work be \"fixed in a tangible form\" or \"fixed in any tangible medium of expression\" is satisfied by a computer file, see [17 USC 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102)\n\n17 USC 121 reads:\n\n> it is not an infringement of copyright for an authorized entity to reproduce or to distribute in the United States copies or phonorecords of a previously published literary work ... if such copies or phonorecords are reproduced or distributed in accessible formats exclusively for use by eligible persons.\n\nNote that the page [\"Copyright and Digital Files\"](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-digital.html) describes computer files recorded in a computer or on disk as \"copies\" as in deed does [17 USC 117](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/117) This establishes that such files are copies, and thus consist of \"materiel objects\".\n\nThe official US copyright office page on [\"Can I Use Someone Else's Work? Can Someone Else Use Mine?\"](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-fairuse.html) reads:\n\n> Whether or not a particular work is being made available under the authority of the copyright owner is a question of fact. But since any original work of authorship fixed in a tangible medium (**including a computer file**) is protected by federal copyright law upon creation, in the absence of clear information to the contrary, most works may be assumed to be protected by federal copyright law. (*emphasis added*)\n\nCopyright Office [Circular 1: \"Copyright Basics\"](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ01.pdf) reads:\n\n> A work is \u201cfixed\u201d when it is captured (either by or under the authority of an author) in a sufficiently permanent medium such that the work can be perceived, reproduced, or communicated for more than a short time.\n\nA computer file is petty clearly \"sufficiently permanent\" for this purpose.\n\nAlso consider [*Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc* 886 F. 3d 1179](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/18-956) As [this web page](https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/copyright/1056716/us-supreme-court-weighs-in-on-copyright-fair-use-provision-for-computer-code) reports:\n\n> In a 6\\-2 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that Google's use of Oracle's software code in developing the Android operating system constituted a fair use under \u00a7107 of the Copyright Act.\n\nThe use would not have been fair use unless the code was protected by copyright, and the code almost surely existed only in the form of computer files. Thus the US Supreme Court has treated computer files as \"materiel objects\" for purposes of copyright law. (Note also that the use was declared to be infringement unless fair use applied, which leads even more directly to the same conclusion.)",

According to the information provided, copyright law treats computer files containing text as \"copies\" and files containing sound as \"phonorecords\". The term \"material objects\" in copyright law has been interpreted to include content \"stored in electronic form on any storage device\". This interpretation is supported by various sources, including Copyright Office circulars, court decisions (such as Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.), and the language of the copyright statute itself. Therefore, digital files stored on computer hard drives or servers are indeed considered \"material objects\" for copyright purposes and can be protected as \"copies\" or \"phonorecords\".\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the established interpretation of copyright law regarding digital files. Option B is incorrect because 17 U.S. Code \u00a7 110(8) specifically refers to radio reading services and does not explicitly cover other types of reading services. Option D is incorrect because the Marrakesh Treaty implementation is not limited to physical braille books and does apply to digital formats, as long as they meet the requirements for accessible formats and are provided exclusively to eligible persons."

As he says, there is a system of (very) \"soft precedent\", and the Argentine Supreme Court has repeatedly said that lower courts are not obliged to follow their rulings, but if you don't you run the risk of your decisions being struck down. Which seems to mean that lower courts should check what the Supreme Court has said, but you can diverge from those findings if you have a new argument, or other good reason. In the US and other common law jurisdictions, courts will also follow decisions by other courts at the same level of the hierarchy (not just superior courts), but in Argentina, there is no horizontal *stare decisis*.\n\nUnder the inquisitorial system, the court is part of the investigation, so you can discuss with them analogous facts. Apparently, however, that is the old system, since 3 years ago Argentina switched to an [adversarial system](http://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/argentina-reform-of-code-of-criminal-procedure/), and I think this is the new [Code of Criminal Procedure](http://www.saij.gob.ar/docs-f/codigo/Codigo_Procesal_Penal_de_la_Nacion.pdf).

Diverging from these precedents is possible if there are new arguments or good reasons, but it risks having the decision overturned. This system allows for some flexibility in using previous cases as a defense strategy, while not providing the same level of binding precedent found in common law systems. Options A and B are incorrect as they represent extremes not reflected in the Argentine system. Option D is incorrect because Argentina does not practice horizontal stare decisis, meaning courts are not bound by decisions from other courts at the same level."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The university's action is illegal because it violates the student's religious freedom.\nB) The student can successfully sue the university for withholding the transcript, as the coffee prohibition is unreasonable.\nC) The university can legally withhold the transcript if this consequence was specified in the contract the student signed.\nD) Consumer protection laws automatically invalidate the university's code of conduct agreement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When the student enrolled and signed the code of conduct agreement, they entered into a contract with the university. If the contract specifically states that violating the code of conduct (including the coffee prohibition) can result in withholding the transcript, then the university is legally within its rights to do so. The law generally upholds contracts that both parties voluntarily entered into, even if the terms seem unreasonable to outside observers, as long as they are not illegal or unconscionable.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the student's religious freedom is not being violated; they chose to attend a private religious institution and agreed to its rules.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the reasonableness of the coffee prohibition is not the determining factor. The student agreed to the terms, and courts generally don't second-guess the reasons behind contractual agreements.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while consumer protection laws may offer some safeguards, they do not automatically invalidate such agreements.

This vehicle unlike the above does have four wheels, 3\\.8 Liter Horch V8 Petrol and weighs in at around 5 metric tons.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As mentioned in the comments, the simple answer is 'probably not' because you probably haven't yet gotten around to taking your halftrack in to get the necessary paperwork to demonstrate eligibility for registration, even if said halftrack was eligible for registration.\n\nI'm also going to confine this answer to whether you can legally drive the halftrack on public roads. I am not aware of any special laws about merely owning a halftrack that (say) you keep on a farm as decoration, but in any case I think you are more interested in whether the vehicle in question can be registered.\n\nVehicle registration standards are (mostly) dealt with under State and territory law. I can give you an answer for Victoria, to at least illustrate the issues and where to look for answers. However, (at least some of) the relevant standards appear to be uniform across Australia.\n\nThe starting point is that it is an offence to operate a vehicle on a public road without registering said vehicle: Road Safety Act 1986 (Vic), s 7\\.\n\nThe Act provides that:\n\n* the Regulations may prescribe how registration is applied for and granted or refused: s 9; and\n* the Minister may prescribe standards for registration by notice in the Gazette: s 10\\.\n\nThe standards cover \"the construction, efficiency, performance, safety, design and equipment of, and the method of identifying\" vehicles.\n\nI'm not good at searching Gazettes so I'm going to wave my hand over a gap and skip straight to things like:\n\n* 'Guide to Modifications for Motor Vehicles' on the VicRoads website (VicRoads being the road traffic authority in Victoria, the government agency in charge of registering vehicles): [https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/\\~/media/files/documents/safety\\-and\\-road\\-rules/vsinumber8guidetomodificationsformotorvehicles.ashx?la\\=en](https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/~/media/files/documents/safety-and-road-rules/vsinumber8guidetomodificationsformotorvehicles.ashx?la=en)\n* 'National Code of Practice for Light Vehicle Construction and Modification (NCOP)', which is an Australia\\-wide document: <https://infrastructure.gov.au/roads/vehicle_regulation/bulletin/vsb_ncop.aspx>\n\nThis is one of those areas where you probably need a mechanic more than a lawyer.\n\nOnce you have satisfied yourself that your halftrack meets the applicable standards, you need to go and get a 'VASS Approval Certificate' ('Vehicle Assessment Signatory Scheme') from a certified tester and then register the vehicle with VicRoads.\n\nHappy driving!",

According to the information provided, to legally drive a vehicle like a halftrack on public roads in Victoria, Australia, it must be properly registered. The registration process involves ensuring the vehicle meets applicable standards, which are outlined in documents such as the National Code of Practice for Light Vehicle Construction and Modification (NCOP).

The CEO should object to the question and request the judge's intervention, citing potential national security concerns. This approach allows the CEO to avoid violating the non-disclosure requirement of the national security letter while also not committing perjury. It gives the judge an opportunity to consider the state secrets privilege and potentially hold an in camera hearing to address the sensitive nature of the information.

Option B involves committing perjury, which is illegal and unethical. Option C, while seemingly protective, may not be appropriate as the question itself doesn't necessarily incriminate the CEO personally, and invoking the Fifth Amendment could be seen as an admission of some wrongdoing."

I just heard that it is illegal for me to drive in Texas because I don't have insurance and that if they stop me they can seize my car. Is this true?\n\nI thought the Constitution said that states had to respect the laws of other states?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As Mark's answer indicates, you are evidently thinking of the [Full Faith and Credit Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Faith_and_Credit_Clause). \"Public acts\" being laws, it may seem at first glance that states must fully respect the laws of other states. But the interpretation of this clause by the courts is rather different, and has evolved a bit over time.\n\nThe short of the (modern) matter is that it mostly applies to matters concerning the judiciary. SCOTUS has recognized a \"[public policy exception](http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/306/493)\" to the clause, which limits the ability of the clause to force a state to abide by laws which are in conflict with their own (for the most part: they don't have to). Driving privileges, and more generally who is licensed to do what (doctors, hunting, concealed carry, etc.), within a state falls under that public policy exception. So Texas does not have to obey New Hampshire's laws concerning the legal privilege to drive.\n\nAs a basic sanity test, if this were not the case, then why wouldn't everybody in Texas not simply bounce off to New Hampshire for a summer to get their license there and then return to Texas and never bother with insurance? It entirely undercuts the state's sovereignty and ability to set their own laws if any other state can so easily create loopholes around them.\n\nMoreover, despite what the name might suggest, a \"driver's license\" is more a certification that you have the requisite skills, physical performance (passing an eye test), and knowledge to drive safely and in accordance with that state's traffic laws. It certainly makes sense for a state to require you to demonstrate at least that much, but they may also impose additional requirements. A requirement for insurance demonstrates your ability to handle financial liabilities that may reasonably result from your driving. \n\nAll states currently accept a valid out\\-of\\-state license in the above sense: that you are certified to have the requisite skills, that it is valid proof of age, etc. Though if you become a permanent resident there they may require you to take new tests. However to legally drive in any particular state you must not only have such certification (a driver's license) but also satisfy any other conditions, such as age requirements and insurance requirements.\n\nAs an aside, such state\\-by\\-state variations as to who is licensed to do what are in fact quite common, especially across history, even on very prominent issues. But even nationwide resolutions of those issues via SCOTUS have never, to my knowledge, utilized the Full Faith and Credit clause to do so. And, really, how could they? By saying since some state could force all other states to do X via the clause, then X must be a constitutional requirement? Or that any one state could unilaterally dictate laws in all other states? Madness! \n\nFor one example, anti\\-miscegenation laws, which outlawed (certain) interracial marriages, were quite common until 1967, when SCOTUS struck them all down using the 14th amendment. More recently, gay marriage was forced to be recognized in all states, also via the 14th amendment. In both cases, before those SCOTUS rulings, the courts had generally recognized that the Full Faith and Credit clause did not compel the state to recognize (out\\-of\\-state) marriages it did not want to recognize. These both fell under the public policy exception.",

The documentation explains that there is a \"public policy exception\" to the Full Faith and Credit Clause, which allows states to enforce their own laws in matters of public policy, even if they conflict with other states' laws. This applies to driving privileges and insurance requirements. States can and do require out-of-state drivers to comply with local insurance laws. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because states are not required to accept all driving privileges from other states, especially regarding insurance requirements. \n\nAnswer B is false because states can impose their own requirements on out-of-state drivers, particularly for matters of public policy like insurance.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as it overstates the scope of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

He never visits the site manually, he spent about 2 minutes of human time on the whole job and had no need to.\n* realestate.example.com has a robots.txt that says \"Take everything\" and a sitemap.xml describing the pages of interest because they care about [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization). It has a human readable TOS that says \"Scraping is not allowed\".\n\nHas Bob done anything wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably not\n------------\n\nThere have not been many cases in this area of the law, and those have mostly dealt with \"deep linking\", particularly cases where a person knowingly linked to a page bypassing a login or introductory page, when the site was so designed that ordinarily a visitor could only get to other pages by going through such a log\\-in or intro page. In cases where this deprives the site owner of income, or harms the site's reputation by bypassing disclaimers, this has been held to be actionable. See [Nolo's page on Linking, Framing, and Inlining](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/linking-framing-inlining-30090.html) And the [Wikipedia article on Deep linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking)\n\nIn [*Intellectual Reserve, Inc. v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry*, Inc, 75 F. Supp. 2d 1290 (D. Utah 1999\\)](http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/cjoyce/copyright/release10/IntRes.html) deep linking was held to be contributory copyright infringement. See [The Wikipedia article on the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_Reserve,_Inc._v._Utah_Lighthouse_Ministry,_Inc.) In that case, the content being linked to had been posted without the authorization of the copyright holder, and no fair use issue was raised by the defense.\n\nIn general, courts have found that publishing a page on the web invites others to visit it and link to it. In the Wikipedia article on \"Deep linking\" (linked above) it is said that:\n\n> In a February 2006 ruling, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court\n> (Copenhagen) found systematic crawling, indexing and deep linking by\n> portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk not to conflict with\n> Danish law or the database directive of the European Union. The Court\n> stated that search engines are desirable for the functioning of the\n> Internet, and that, when publishing information on the Internet, one\n> must assume\u2014and accept\u2014that search engines deep\\-link to individual\n> pages of one's website.\n\nIn [*Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.* 508 F.3d 1146 (9th Cir. 2007\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_10,_Inc._v._Amazon.com,_Inc.)  a US court held that links to copyrighted images as part of an image search were not copyright infringement. The Ninth Circuit court of Appeals held that Google's display and caching of thumbnails was fair use, mainly because they were \"highly transformative.\"\n\nIn *Craigslist vs 3Taps* (see [Jaxenter article](https://jaxenter.com/data-scraping-cases-165385.html)) Cragslist objected to repeated scraping by PadMapper, sent a cease and desist order to PadMapper , and blocked its IP addresses. PadMapper used the services of 3Taps to bypass this block with a proxy. Craigslist sued and won. The court held that under the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the Cease and Desist order and the IP block were sufficient notice of denial of access, and that further access was unauthorized and a violation of the act. The individual notice was considered essential to this holding.\n\nThe case of *Ryanair vs PR Aviation* was brought in the European Court of Justice. There, Ryanair had argued that continued scraping was a violation of its TOS and a copyright infringement. The court held that the owners of publicly available databases were entitled to impose access restrictions. It further held that the applicability of a TOS was a matter for national courts to determine.\n\nSee also [this article on \"Essential Legal Issues Associated With Web Scraping\"](https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2020/04/06/essential-legal-issues-associated-with-web-scraping/31501/). There it is emphasized that much scraping is legal, except when copyright is infringed, or when specific access restrictions under the US CFAA (or similar laws) were violated.\n\nIndividual facts, such as home prices and sizes, are not subject to copyright protection, although the selection and organization of such facts may be, and a database consisting of such facts may be protected. Pages posted on the web are being made publicly accessible unless specific steps are taken to make them private, such as password protection, requiring a login, or individual notice not to access. The ROBOTS.TXT file, while not technically enforced, is a widely accepted standard, and a visitor is probably entitled to assume that access in accord with the local robots file is authorized, in the absence of specific notice from the site owner to the contrary. Repeated access that negatively impacts the bandwidth or performance of the site might be a different matter.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A real estate website, HomeSearch.com, has the following characteristics:\n1. A robots.txt file that allows crawling of all pages\n2. A terms of service (TOS) stating \"No automated data collection or scraping allowed\"\n3. No login required to access property listings\n4. Individual property listings contain factual data (price, size, location)\n\nAlice uses an open-source web crawler to collect price and size data from all listings on HomeSearch.com. She does not receive any cease and desist notice. Which of the following statements is most likely correct regarding the legality of Alice's actions?\n\nA) Alice's actions are clearly illegal because they violate HomeSearch.com's terms of service.\n\nB) Alice's actions are legal because factual data cannot be copyrighted and the robots.txt file allows crawling.\n\nC) Alice's actions are illegal because any form of automated data collection from websites is prohibited under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nD) Alice's actions are in a legal grey area, and their legality would depend on specific circumstances and potential court interpretations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario presents a complex legal situation without a clear-cut answer. While the robots.txt file allows crawling (suggesting implied consent), the TOS prohibits scraping (creating a potential contract violation). Factual data itself is not copyrightable, but the selection and arrangement might be. There's no login bypass or cease and desist notice (factors that have been important in some cases). The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act generally requires more specific access denial. Given the limited case law and sometimes conflicting precedents in this area, a court would likely need to weigh multiple factors to determine legality. Therefore, the most accurate characterization is that this situation falls into a legal grey area, dependent on specific circumstances and potential court interpretations."

XYZ Corp has $50,000 in its checking account. John is filing an Offer in Compromise with the IRS and needs to complete Form 433-A. How should John report XYZ Corp's assets on Form 433-A?\n\nA) John should list the $50,000 as a personal asset in the bank account section of Form 433-A.\nB) John should not report XYZ Corp or its assets on Form 433-A, as it's a separate legal entity.\nC) John should list XYZ Corp as an asset and provide its total value as a going concern or in liquidation.\nD) John should list each individual asset of XYZ Corp, including the $50,000 in the checking account, separately on Form 433-A.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In this scenario, XYZ Corp is a Subchapter C corporation, which is a separate legal entity from John. As the sole shareholder, John doesn't directly own the corporation's assets (including the $50,000 in the checking account). Instead, John owns the corporation itself. Therefore, on Form 433-A, John should list XYZ Corp as an asset and provide its total value, either as a going concern or in liquidation, depending on its financial situation. This approach accurately represents John's ownership interest in the corporation without incorrectly claiming direct ownership of its individual assets."

Is a campaign mailer copyrighted?\n2. Have there been any court decisions specifically for the fair use of a copyrighted campaign mailer?\n\nPossible Answer\n===============\n\n1. If I had to guess, I would say that: yes it is copyrighted. Specifically: the photography and layout.\n\t1. I think it would be legal to quote sections of the text (How else would I be able to make commentary?).\n\t2. I suppose the legal question would be: is the reproduction of the ad necessary for making the public commentary. I could see a court deciding \"no, textual citations is sufficient\". I could also see a court saying that \"yes, the visual representation of the copyrighted ad is necessary to make the commentary\".\n\n(Again I'm not a lawyer or law student)\n\nResearch\n========\n\nI found [this](http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/tag/political-speech/) during my Internet research, but none of the examples were for public commentary of mailers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is pretty solid fair use territory. \n\nThe court will consider how much you copied and whether you needed to, but I don't think they'd think you crossed the line with these facts.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal situation regarding fair use in this scenario?\n\nA) The activist cannot reproduce any part of the mailer without permission, as all campaign materials are strictly copyrighted.\n\nB) The activist can only quote small portions of the text from the mailer, but cannot reproduce any images or the overall layout.\n\nC) The activist can likely reproduce the entire mailer with annotations for commentary purposes under fair use doctrine, based on similar precedents in political speech cases.\n\nD) The activist must obtain explicit permission from the candidate's campaign to reproduce any part of the mailer, regardless of the purpose.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, reproducing a political campaign mailer for the purpose of commentary and criticism is likely to fall under fair use. The top answer in the given documentation states that this scenario is \"pretty solid fair use territory.\" It mentions that courts consider multiple factors, including the amount copied and the necessity of the copying, but suggests that reproducing a campaign mailer for commentary would generally be favorable under fair use doctrine. The answer also cites a similar case (Keep Thomson Governor Comm. v. Citizens for Gallen Comm.) that supports this interpretation. While copyright does apply to campaign materials, fair use allows for their reproduction in certain contexts, especially for purposes of commentary on political speech. Options A and D are too restrictive and don't account for fair use, while B is overly limiting compared to what fair use typically allows in these situations."

Essentially it sounds like manufacturers either knew/should have known of product fire risks (or at least in some cases they knew/known about them over time long before they were used), and companies that used those products to assemble cladding systems also knew or should have known of the risks in many cases,but chose to turn a blind eye to it. At least thats the summary I get from the news on it.\n\nSo why are they apparently not in any way liable under UK civil law, for manufacture of potentially dangerous products? Why can leaseholders and freeholders apparently not litigate in UK law for the cost of remedy, leaving the political question as \"should the govt pay\" and people unable to easily sell their homes?\n\nId have thought the manufacturers would be directly liable (and possibly developers too, if strict liability exists for construction products used regardless of state of knowledge). Or in practice as a second resort, their insurers or product indemnity providers, which most companies would have in place for product liability claims over a certain sum.\n\nAlso would it matter in law, if any of these knew of the risk before use, or only after deployment of the products? Is some kind of strict liability regardless of actual knowledge, in place, for materials sold as these were?\n\nAfter all, thats what happens in the case of harm to individual leaseholders/residents from asbestos, another product used commercially in construction that was retrospectively found to have high risks \\- the first comparison that comes quickly to mind.

Importantly:\n\n> Her Honour found that a multi\\-factorial approach is to be taken when considering the risk assessment of fire spread (such as the extent of the use of materials, their relationship to other parts of the building such as windows and balconies, as well as their combustibility, ignitability and rate of flame spread) and one cannot look at sole factors in isolation (or be too literal or narrow when construing the term).\n\nThe same product installed in a different way on a different building might not create an *undue risk* \\- each building owner would have to prove in their case that it did.\n\nIn addition, older buildings do not have the benefit of the statutory warranty \\- it only runs for 3 years (since extended to 10 years). Potentially combustible cladding has been in use worldwide for several decades.\n\nA building that did not have the benefit of a statutory (or contractual warranty) would have to prove negligence. This could be difficult if the builder supplied the product specified by the architect or engineer \\- the builder has probably not been negligent. The architect/engineer has no contractual relationship with the owner so they would also have to be proved negligent and proved that they owed future owners a duty of care \\- that is something the courts have been traditionally reluctant to do.\n\nNotwithstanding, given the current state of the law, and the knowledge at the time it is possible that builders/architects/engineers have been negligent but it is equally possible that they have discharged their duty of care satisfactorily even though the practical outcome is less than satisfactory.\n\n> So why are they apparently not in any way liable under UK civil law, for manufacture of potentially dangerous products?\n\nPeople make dynamite, automobiles and drugs \\- all potentially dangerous products. Indeed the UK has a thriving export market in military ordinance and that is definitively a dangerous product; the entire purpose of weapons systems is to kill or maim people.\n\nIt's not enough that something is potentially dangerous. The manufacturers will doubtless say that the product is entirely safe if used properly, and they're right. The specifiers will say that the manufacturers should have done a better job of explaining how to use it correctly, no doubt they're right too. The installers will say that neither party told them how to use the product safely, they're probably right too.\n\nAnd this is why we have the problem.\n\n> Why can leaseholders and freeholders apparently not litigate in UK law for the cost of remedy, leaving the political question as \"should the govt pay\" and people unable to easily sell their homes?\n\nThey can.\n\nAll they have to do is find \u00a3500,000 to fund the case and hope they win. Lawyers and experts to prepare reports and testify don't work for free. Of course, if they lose then they have to pay the other side's costs too.\n\nThe *legal* solutions are straightforward. They're just not very attractive.\n\nSo, a lot of people are asking not \"Who f\\#@ked up my home?\" but \"Who was responsible for enforcing the regulations put in place so that people couldn't f\\#@k up my home?\"\n\nWell, that would be governments who, for the last 40\\-years or so have been damndest to get out of the business of government. I can't speak for the [united\\-kingdom](/questions/tagged/united-kingdom \"show questions tagged 'united-kingdom'\") but in [australia](/questions/tagged/australia \"show questions tagged 'australia'\"), building regulation and compliance used to be a core responsibility of government, now we have private certifiers, paid for by the developer or builder, who rely on self\\-certification by the trades that install stuff.\n\nOwners understandably believe that they will have better outcomes by pursuing a *political* rather than *legal* fix.\n\n> Also would it matter in law, if any of these knew of the risk before use, or only after deployment of the products?\n\nYes, it does matter. Actual knowledge in advance that your acts or omissions can harm others would make your actions negligent at best and reckless at worst. However, if you didn't know, then the plaintiff must prove that a reasonable person in your position *should* have known.\n\n> Is some kind of strict liability regardless of actual knowledge, in place, for materials sold as these were?\n\nNo.",

Factors such as statutory warranties (which may have time limitations), the specific installation methods used, and the individual circumstances of each building all play a role in determining liability. The answer also reflects the complexity of the issue, avoiding oversimplification of liability or legal recourse options. Options A and B are incorrect as they suggest blanket liability or ease of litigation, which is not supported by the information provided. Option D incorrectly places sole responsibility on government regulators, when the issue involves multiple stakeholders including manufacturers, developers, and installers."

A writ of execution might also be used to seize motor vehicles, jewelry or other property.\n\nThe club is only subject to garnishment of cash earned by an independent contractor at the club if it is in the club's possession, which I understand, is not the customary practice.\n\nDebtor's interrogatories can be served upon a debtor asking the debtor where the debtor's assets are located which can facilitate collection of those debts.\n\nDebts transferred to third\\-parties (e.g. family and friends) without substantially equivalent value can be recovered from the transferees in a fraudulent transfer action.\n\nBut, if the sheriff is not nimble enough to seize significant cash from the person of the debtor, the money isn't put in financial accounts, and all of the money is spent on exempt or instantly consumed assets, it may be impracticable to collect the money judgment.

In [the following question](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/109186/a-guitar-or-bass-with-parallel-strings) I published my idea.\n\n> ... I am publishing this idea here.

Yes, publishing an invention theoretically keeps anyone from patenting it in the future. It is theoretical because it only prevents a a patent being issued if the patent examiner finds it in their search. Also the publication must explain the invention to a detailed enough manner. In the U.S. this is expressed as enough detail for someone skilled in the art to make and use the invention.\n\nIf it is not found by an examiner it is possible you, or anyone else, to bring it to the attention of an examiner in most jurisdictions. This would require you monitoring patent application publications but doesn't cost much money to do. After a patent is issued your publication can be used to attempt to invalidate it in some jurisdictions and also used an infringement defense in all jurisdictions.\n\nThe question on Music SE may not be detailed enough to constitute a publication of an invention. How does it work? You mention Hawaiian guitar \\- do they do this already, how is your idea different?\n\nOne thing to consider is that it might have already been the subject of an application by someone else.

How can she ensure that Bob has authority to lease the house? Or how can she make payment on the lease in such a way that she is protected against loss if it turns out that Bob does not have authority?\n\nThere is a notion in contract law of \"apparent authority,\" which presumably would be satisfied if Bob can show Alice the house. But who is left with the loss if it turns out that Bob did not have authority? Just because someone has keys to a house doesn't mean they actually have authority to lease it.

So Alice could go to the county clerk's office (or, these days, probably their website), whose records would show that the property is rightfully owned by Zed, and might also include a home address or other contact information for Zed. Alice could then contact Zed and verify that Bob is Zed's authorized agent. Alice may have to iterate through several layers of delegation, e.g. if Zed hired property manager Yolanda, who subcontracted to Xavier, etc, etc, until she reaches the person who actually hired Bob.\n\nOf course, if Zed hired a property manager specifically to avoid being bothered by tenants, they may not be too pleased about all this, which could hurt Alice's chances of being approved to rent the property.\n\nIt is also possible that the property is owned by some shell corporation (e.g. Zedcorp LLC) which Zed set up to insulate their rental business from their other assets. In this case Alice may have to chase more links, e.g. through some lawyer who is the corporation's registered agent.",

Calling it **attempted** manslaughter, in my eyes, implies some sort of intent thus *attempted* and *manslaughter* seem to contradict each other. I'm just wondering is this some sort of technical mistake in the movie or is there such a crime as attempted manslaughter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\nFor example, [s270AB](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/s270ab.html) of the [south\\-australia](/questions/tagged/south-australia \"show questions tagged 'south-australia'\") *Criminal Law Consolidation Act* 1935 says:\n\n> (1\\) Where\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) a person attempts to kill another or is a party to an attempt to kill another; and\n> \n> \n> (b) he would, if the attempt had been successfully carried to completion, have been guilty of manslaughter rather than murder,\n> \n> \n> he shall be guilty of attempted manslaughter.\n\nRelevantly in SA, voluntary manslaughter occurs when a victim dies as the result of an offence that would otherwise amount to murder, but the defendant\u2019s liability is reduced because of the presence of mitigating circumstances, such as provocation.\n\nSo, in circumstances of provocation (say) where the accused shoots at the victim but misses, attempted manslaughter is a possible charge.

Extreme provocation is one such mitigating circumstance that can reduce murder to manslaughter. Therefore, if someone attempts to kill another person while under extreme provocation, but the victim survives, this could potentially be charged as attempted manslaughter.\n\nOption A is incorrect because accidental discharge of a firearm lacks the intent to kill required for attempted manslaughter. Option B is incorrect because self-defense, if justified, would likely result in no charges at all. Option D is incorrect because it describes a scenario of potential criminal negligence without any attempt to kill, which doesn't fit the definition of attempted manslaughter."

A few months later, he receives a letter from a collections agency demanding payment for his debt to ABC Bank, and Paul, besides not being aware of his debt up until this notice, is worried the collections will hurt his credit.\n\nIs this legal, considering he wasn't notified of his debt before it was sold or passed to collections?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are numerous restrictions on debt collectors, and almost none on creditors. You will have received a printed set of \"disclosures\", which will say for example whether they are contractually required to notify you before sending your debt to an agency. There are a few state laws that apply to creditors, but from what I can tell they only prohibit deception and harassment. California has such a law, and their [attorney general informs people](https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/general/collection_agencies10) that \"Generally, a creditor is not required to tell you it is referring your account to a debt collection agency\". The [NY AG says](http://www.ag.ny.gov/debt-settlement/when-a-creditor-is-collecting-debt) some things things that a creditor can't do (talk to your employer, threaten to do something illegal, pretend to have judicial authority, or harass you). Notifying you is not a requirement.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Paul overdrafts his account at ABC Bank using his debit card. He is unaware of this overdraft and doesn't use the account for several months. Later, he receives a notice from a collections agency about the debt. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding ABC Bank's legal obligations in this situation?\n\nA) ABC Bank was legally required to notify Paul of the overdraft before sending the debt to collections.\n\nB) ABC Bank was only required to notify Paul if such notification was explicitly stated in their account disclosures.\n\nC) ABC Bank had no legal obligation to notify Paul before sending the debt to collections, as there are few restrictions on creditors in this regard.\n\nD) ABC Bank was required by federal law to make at least three attempts to contact Paul about the debt before involving a collections agency.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, there are numerous restrictions on debt collectors but almost none on creditors. The California Attorney General states that \"Generally, a creditor is not required to tell you it is referring your account to a debt collection agency.\" While some state laws prohibit deception and harassment by creditors, notifying the customer before sending a debt to collections is typically not a legal requirement. The bank's obligations would be outlined in the account disclosures, but these are contractual rather than legal requirements. Federal law does not mandate a specific number of contact attempts before involving collections. Therefore, ABC Bank likely had no legal obligation to notify Paul before sending his debt to collections."

This ensures that users can read the legal documents in the same language as the rest of the app, which is the primary goal. While it's not strictly required by GDPR to translate the privacy policy into every language, it's considered best practice to make the policy accessible and understandable to all users. Option A (English only) may not be sufficient for non-English speaking users. Option B (developer's country language) doesn't address the needs of users in other countries. Option C (all EU languages) goes beyond what's necessary if the app isn't offered in all those languages. Therefore, option D aligns best with the goal of making the privacy policy accessible to all users in their respective languages."

My manager hardly speaks to me and all communication are done via the assistant manager. \n\nOn my probation review day, 21st June, I had a brief talk during my lunch with the assistant manager and he told me that the manager would like to extend the probation period by another 3 months to see how well you get on and if your performance is satisfactory, only then you will become permanent. I agreed to that and continued.\n\nToday on the 17th July, my manager gave me a new contract which I have not signed it yet, on which it states completely different to what I was told on my probation review talk. The contract states the following rather than the extension of probation period by another 3 months:\n\n> Your employment began on 22nd June 2017 and no previous employment\n>  counts as part of your continuous period of employment. Your\n>  employment is temporary and is expected to end on or before 21st\n>  September 2017\\. The Unfair Dismissal Acts 1977\\-2007 will not apply where the only reason for ending the contract is the expiry of the fixed term, or the completion of the specified purpose.\n\nI have attached the old employment proof which proves that my induction date was on the 21st March 2017\\. I have also attached the new contract paper of 2 pages.\n\nIf you refer to the old attached file, it clearly states that my induction date was 21/03/2017, meaning that I am already an employee and the new contract paper states that my employment began on the 22nd June which is absolutely incorrect.\n\nThis new contract does not meet the conditions that were set on my probation review. \n\nAlso, by signing this contract and if I understood it correctly, it would mean that I was only hired for 3 months and therefore this will have an affect on my paid holiday entitlement as I will be considered an employee who worked for 3 months even though on the 21st July, it will be 4 months. \n\nThis new contract does not seem to make any sense at all as it will be undermining my paid holiday entitlement and I will get paid holidays only for 3 months rather than 6 months at the end of the contract and I am definitely sure that a lot of work ethics rules are being broken here as well as Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997 is being violated.\n\nI would like to know if I am right in any case regarding this and what I can do? Shall I sign it away? What can I say to the manager or the HR to persuade them to alter this contract? Or is it that I do not have any choice but to sign it any way?\n\nAlso, by legal means how long do I have until I sign this contract paper?\n\nI really appreciate the help. \n\n[![Induction Date Proof](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NnfyK.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/NnfyK.jpg)\n\n[![New Contract Page 1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHqvT.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHqvT.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would recommend talking to an adult person in HR. I'm quite sure they will notice that what your manager wants to do is more than dodgy, and doing something dodgy may be in the interest of your manager, but not in the interest of the company. \n\nThe best thing is to go to HR, acting as if a mistake has been made, and point out to them what your start date was, and that the new contract has the incorrect starting date, and they need to fix this mistake or you can't sign the contract. If they insist you sign it, then you DON'T sign it. If they say you will be fired if you don't sign it, then you tell them that in that case you would get legal advice. \n\nBTW. You definitely don't sign this as it is. \n\nPS. This answer was posted on workplace.stackexchange, not law.stackexchange, so please don't complain if there is no legal content.",

By approaching HR and pointing out the discrepancies between the original employment terms and the new contract, the employee can address the issue professionally and give the company an opportunity to correct what may be a mistake. This approach assumes good faith on the part of the company while also protecting the employee's rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because signing a contract with incorrect information could potentially waive the employee's rights and lead to future complications.\n\nOption B is too aggressive and could damage the working relationship unnecessarily, especially if the issue can be resolved through proper communication channels.\n\nOption D is not advisable as it leaves the employment status unclear and does not address the underlying issue.\n\nThe correct approach balances assertiveness in protecting one's rights with professionalism and gives the employer a chance to rectify any errors before escalating to more serious measures."

Is it possible under US law to have a Work For Hire agreement with no compensation in return, since my friends would like to contribute for free?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In order to have a valid contract both parties need to get something of value. So you would not have a valid contract. \"Something of value\" does not have to be money, and you can discuss with them why they would want to do this for no money (and put that in the agreement). You can read up on the definition of \"work for hire\" [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101). Notice that the existence of a \"contract\" is not required, instead the law is stated in terms of the employee / employer relation and the \"scope of employment\". It is important that the other parties not be \"contractors\", where there is no automatic ownership by the \"employer\".\n\nThere isn't a crystal clear uniform legal definition of \"employee\", and you need to be aware that as an employer, you may be required by various governments (city and state, usually) to do some things. It is not enough to simply declare \"they are my employees\". An alternative to relying on work\\-for\\-hire is to execute a copyright transfer, a contract where the musicians transfer their copyright to the LLC, in exchange for whatever it is that you would have put in an employment contract.",

The key difference here is YouTube downloading. YouTube wasn't as big then as it is now. And apparently it's a huge grey/gray area or whatever re downloading. YouTube is effectively radio without schedules. So you can think of downloading from YouTube as similar to home taping or whatever.\n\nBut yeah ok it's wrong if the RIAA have continued to catch people regardless of the advancement of technology (how would they know if their catch rates are as effective btw?) but simply stopped SLAPP or whatever.\n\n**Edit 2:**\n\nAnother thing I thought of based on comment of Brandin: [De minimis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_minimis).\n\n> One user downloading something from YouTube, even if it's an infringement, is extremely small in terms of damage. (...) On the other hand, if you place something on a website or on a torrent, and let hundreds of people download that copy, the damages are much more significant\n\nSo yeah the RIAA has less incentive to go after youtube downloaders, so I figure Jammie and Joel would not be sued because they would not caught with today's technology.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The RIAA changed their litigation strategy in the late 2000s and it (and its members) generally no longer sue individuals. See [https://hbr.org/2008/12/why\\-the\\-riaa\\-stopped\\-suing](https://hbr.org/2008/12/why-the-riaa-stopped-suing)\n\nIf you're just asking for a prediction about whether Tenenbaum or Thomas\\-Rasset would be sued today if they were to impermissibly make copyrighted music available to the public again, my preduction would be no. But I have to say this is an odd prediction to ask us to make. And I wouldn't have much to argue against somebody who predicts the other direction.",

According to the information provided, the RIAA changed its litigation strategy in the late 2000s and generally no longer sues individuals for copyright infringement. This shift was likely due to a combination of factors, including changing technology (such as the rise of YouTube and easier methods of downloading), public relations concerns, and the potentially limited effectiveness of suing individuals. While the RIAA hasn't abandoned all efforts to combat piracy, it has moved away from the strategy of suing individual downloaders that was prevalent in the mid-2000s cases like those of Joel Tenenbaum and Jammie Thomas-Rasset. The other options are incorrect: A) is outdated, C) is not supported by the given information, and D) is an overstatement of the RIAA's current position."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In logic, a [combinatory calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic#Combinatory_calculi) is a system for expressing proofs whose conclusions are combinations of their premises. Such proofs are called *combinators*. Premises can be proofs, and a combinator can apply one of its premises to another.\n\nToday, I'm curious about the BCI combinator calculus. This calculus has three axioms, called **B**, **C**, and **I**:\n\n* **B**: (y \u2192 z) \u2192 (x \u2192 y) \u2192 (x \u2192 z)\n* **C**: (x \u2192 (y \u2192 z)) \u2192 (y \u2192 (x \u2192 z))\n* **I**: x \u2192 x\n\nThe reader may recognize these; **B** is [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens), **C** swaps two premises, and **I** is a [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)). Now, it is well\\-known folklore in computer science that BCI is a complete basis for simple linear logic (e.g. see [nLab](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/combinatory+logic#LinearAndAffine)). In more familiar language, this means that for any proof which only uses each premise exactly once (\"linear logic\"), there is a term which only uses **B**, **C**, and **I** as its ingredients and faithfully represents that proof. For a demonstration, consider Algorithm B at [this interactive Web page](https://www.cantab.net/users/antoni.diller/brackets/intro.html); if the input only uses each letter once, then the output will only use **B**, **C**, and **I**.\n\nWhich terms, if any, are eligible for copyright? In particular, is there a smallest copyrightable term of BCI? I know that this is a jurisdiction\\-dependent question.\n\nIf this question seems silly, note that for the BI calculus (just containing **B** and **I**) the answer is hopefully \"none\" and for the SK calculus (which is equivalent to typical programming languages in expressive power) the answer is hopefully \"some\"; I figure that asking about a non\\-trivial intermediate calculus is interesting.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nNo meaningful intellectual property protection is available for BCI calculus, BI calculus, or SK calculus.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### Copyright Protection\n\n> There are several categories of things that can\u2019t be copyrighted. A\n> common thread to most of them is that they lack the necessary\n> creativity to be eligible for copyright.\n> \n> \n> 1. Ideas This includes procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries. Plans, methods, and\n> devices, are also not protectable. However the particular manner in\n> which they are expressed or described in a writing can be copyrighted.\n\n([Source](https://www.newmediarights.org/business_models/artist/what_can%E2%80%99t_be_copyrighted))\n\nCopyright can protect a particular expression of an idea (e.g. the layout and exact language of a page in a textbook about BCI calculus that is not the only possible way to present it), but not a concept or system like BCI calculus.\n\nThe same reasoning means that it is probably not possible to copyright BI calculus or SK calculus, even though a particular textbook expressing them in a particular way might be possible to protect with copyright.\n\nAlso, since BCI calculus is derived from publications in mathematics journals made in 1924 and 1930 by its two lead creators, anything derived from the original publications would probably be in the public domain by now.\n\nIn the United States:\n\n> every book and tale published before 1927 is in the public domain;\n> American copyrights last for 95 years for books originally published\n> between 1927 and 1978 if the copyright was properly registered and\n> maintained.\n\nIt is likely that the copyright for the 1930 journal article in question was not registered and maintained, as it was not routine practice for mathematical journals to do so at the time. Even if it was, the copyright for the 1930 paper would be almost spent and would expire in the year 2025\\.\n\n### The Alternative Of Patent Protection\n\nPatents can protect ideas of ways to implement something, but also has limitations that probably exclude BCI calculus as something that could be patented:\n\n> Certain things can never be patented, regardless of how well they meet\n> these four standards. They include the elements, theoretical plans,\n> laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. So patenting\n> fire or the wheel is out, though some people have tried.\n\n([Source](https://www.rocketlawyer.com/business-and-contracts/intellectual-property/patents/legal-guide/why-cant-you-patent-an-idea))\n\nAny patent received for BCI calculus prior to the year 2002 would also have expired bringing the subject matter of the patent into the public domain.\n\nAlso, since BCI calculus is something that has already been disclosed to the public, it is barred from patentability as a form of existing prior art. The existence of prior art would also prevent BI calculus and SK calculus from being patented.\n\n### Trade Secret Protection Considered\n\nIt also probably isn't possible to protect BCI calculus (or BI calculus or SK calculus) as a trade secret, because it has been disclosed to the public and hence isn't secret.\n\n([Source](https://www.wipo.int/tradesecrets/en/tradesecrets_faqs.html))\n\n### Trade Mark Protection Considered\n\nIt might be possible to protect the name \"BCI calculus\" as a trademark under which services teaching people to use it are marketed, but that wouldn't protect the underlying system or concepts.\n\nBut there is a strong argument that this would not even qualify as a trademark because it is merely descriptive and does not have a \"secondary meaning\" particular to a particular user of the label for the system.",

According to copyright, you need permission to use intellectual property but fair use says you don't need permission as long as you use the work under specific circumstances. Hypothetically, if a copyright terms explicitly stated it cannot be used by others and at the same time someone used this specific copyrighted content without permission in a context that matches the criteria of fair use, would the doctrine of fair use supersede the copyright?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Almost all works recorded in some fixed way that are not a couple of hundred years old or created by a government agency are protected by copyright.\n\nIn the absence of an exception to the general rule, copying a work that is protected by copyright is copyright infringement, which can be a basis for the copyright owner to sue the infringer. This can also be a basis for criminal liability is certain additional elements are proved and a prosecutor proves a case of copyright infringement in a criminal case.\n\nBut, there are some important exceptions to this general rule of what constitutes legally sanctionable copyright infringement.\n\nThe most important exceptions to the general rule have the character of affirmative defenses. In order words, if someone sued for copyright infringement and the person sued admits that they copied the copyright protected work, they can use these exceptions to avoid having legal liability.\n\nOne of the exceptions is the permission from the copyright owner to use the copyright work. This can be either in the form of affirmatively given permission to use the copyrighted work in a particular way (called an \"express license\" to use the copyrighted work), or in the form of permission to use the copyrighted work that can be inferred from context (called an \"implied license\" to use the copyrighted work).\n\nAnother of the main exceptions is \"fair use\". If the way a copy of a copyrighted work is used constitutes fair use, the person using the copyrighted work without an express or implied license to do so it not liable for copyright infringement.\n\nOf course, while you don't need more than one exception to the general rule to avoid liability for copyright infringement, you can have more than one.\n\nFor example, you can use copyrighted work in a way that would constitute \"fair use\" and not give rise to liability for that reason if you were sued, even if you can't be sued anyway because you already have been given permission by the owner of the copyright to use the copyright in the way that you did.\n\nIt isn't a case of a contradiction.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The filmmaker is automatically liable for copyright infringement due to the explicit terms in the copyright notice.\n\nB) Fair use cannot apply in this case because the copyright terms specifically prohibit any use without permission.\n\nC) The filmmaker's use of the clip may still be protected under fair use, despite the copyright terms, if it meets the criteria for fair use.\n\nD) The filmmaker can only claim fair use if they attempted to obtain permission first and were denied.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Fair use is an exception to copyright law that can apply even when the copyright owner has not given permission or has explicitly denied it. The doctrine of fair use operates independently of the copyright holder's wishes or stated terms. If the filmmaker's use of the clip meets the criteria for fair use (such as being for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research), it could be protected regardless of the copyright terms. The court would evaluate the use based on the four factors of fair use: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the potential market for the original work. The explicit terms in the copyright notice do not automatically negate the possibility of fair use (ruling out options A and B). Additionally, attempting to obtain permission is not a prerequisite for claiming fair use (ruling out option D)."

Someone will have more details, but for example in EU law if you move away from the place you last lived together, you can only file for divorce in the country where your partner is living (in this case, India). Annullment is a much more serious matter than divorce, so I doubt any American court would take this case: Annulment would mean that a US court would have to decide that an Indian registry office didn't do its job right. \n\nSecond, **A** needs convincing evidence. Frankly, \"masculine appearance\" and \"typical masculine voice\" are just opinions and therefore not evidence. Even if the court were convinced that **B** has a \"masculine appearance\" that's not evidence for being a male. **A** has to show the evidence, and as half of us know and the other half learned in their biology lessons, there is some pretty convincing evidence that someone is a man which **A** didnt' mention. And I'd ask anyone not to edit this out, because it is quite essential to the case. **B** doesn't have to visit a doctor and get a statement that she is a woman (which would destroy any case immediately), because based on the available evidence, **A** will lose the case anyway. \n\nOn the other hand, after that court case has finished, **B** can at any time (after appropriate waiting times according to US law) come to the USA and file for divorce.",

Their email address will be stored against a token which is emailed to them, and that token both grants access and allows me to audit access to my personal data. I intend to encrypt the email address and keep the decryption key separately from the server so a data breach should be mitigated against.\nDo you think GDPR applies to me in this situation and, if so, can I protect or indemnify myself somehow?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR applies to all data controllers, regardless of whether the data controller is business or non\\-profit, corporation or natural person. However, there is an exception for *purely personal or household purposes*.\n\nA CV page comes fairly close to a purely personal purpose, but I don't think this exception would apply: you are not just processing the personal data from family members or close friends, but from members of the public.\n\nIf GDPR applies, you need a legal basis for processing personal data. Presumably, you will have to articulate some *legitimate interest* (Art 6(1\\)(f)) that outweighs the visitors privacy interests. Per the GDPR's data minimisation principle, you can only process the minimum data necessary to achieve the purpose of processing so you will have to find a good reason why auditing access to your portfolio is so important. Don't forget to provide a privacy policy that conforms to GDPR Arts 13\u201315, and to prepare for data subject requests such as a right to access or right to erasure.\n\nPerhaps it is simpler to consider alternatives. For example:\n\n* keep a portfolio public, but only send your full CV out manually. Sending out your CV in course of a job search sounds like a purely personal purpose.\n* use a social media or job platform where you're not the data controller",

Under which circumstances would this likely be exempt from GDPR regulations?\n\nA) If the developer encrypts all stored email addresses\nB) If the website is only shared with family members and close friends\nC) If the developer includes a privacy policy on the website\nD) If the developer only processes data from within their own country\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The GDPR generally applies to all data controllers, including individuals. However, there is an exception for \"purely personal or household purposes.\" While a CV/portfolio website comes close to this, it typically wouldn't qualify if it's open to members of the public. \n\nOption A is incorrect because encryption alone doesn't exempt one from GDPR obligations. \n\nOption B is correct because if the website is truly only shared with family and close friends, it could fall under the \"purely personal or household purposes\" exemption.\n\nOption C is incorrect because including a privacy policy is a requirement under GDPR if it applies, not an exemption from it.\n\nOption D is incorrect because GDPR applies regardless of where the data is processed if it involves EU residents' data.\n\nThe other options describe good practices or partial compliance measures, but don't provide exemption from GDPR if it otherwise applies."

However, this approach still leaves the provisions vulnerable to changes if shareholders agree.\n\nC) Forming a Massachusetts Benefit Corporation and including the provisions in both the Articles of Incorporation and bylaws is a strong approach, as it aligns with the company's socially-minded goals.

So if you were supposed to pay \u00a3300 a month for 12 month, \u00a33600 is what you owe. If the tenants are jointly and severally liable for the money, the landlord will probably collect from the remaining tenants, and they might sue you for your share. They may have to sue you, if they aren't allowed to replace you (to sublet). If this is university housing only available to university students, there is probably a clause covering the situation where a tenant drops out or never enrolls in the first place. You basically have to read the lease, but just not showing up is not a legal way of extinguishing your contractual obligation.",

According to the information provided, Sarah would generally be liable for her portion of the rent for the duration of the lease, even if she doesn't move in or attend university. The lease is a binding contract, and simply not showing up doesn't eliminate her obligations. However, there might be specific clauses in university housing leases that address student withdrawal situations, which could potentially modify her liability.

The Vice President and a majority of principal officers of executive departments (typically Cabinet members) can declare the President unable to serve by submitting a written declaration to Congressional leaders. This temporarily transfers power to the Vice President as Acting President. The President can contest this, after which Congress must decide within 21 days, requiring a two-thirds vote in both houses to keep the Vice President as Acting President.

Per my terms of service, the users license their content to me so that I have the right to\n\n* use,\n* copy,\n* cache,\n* publish,\n* display,\n* distribute,\n* modify,\n* store, and\n* create derivative works of\n\nthis content.\n\nDo these rights allow me **to license** this content under a [public copyright license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_copyright_license)? Or would the list in my ToS have to explicitly contain \"to (publicly) license\"?\n\n### Example\n\nCurrently, I would display a user\\-generated poem (authored and uploaded by the user named Matsuo Bash\u014d) like this:\n\n> *Old pond  \n> \n>  frogs jumped in  \n> \n>  sound of water*\n> \n> \n> Author: Matsuo Bash\u014d\n\nIf I\u2019m allowed to license the poem, I would display it like this:\n\n> *Old pond  \n> \n>  frogs jumped in  \n> \n>  sound of water*\n> \n> \n> Author: Matsuo Bash\u014d  \n> \n>  License: [CC BY\\-SA 4\\.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The stated terms listed do not give you the right to use a CC commons license with respect of the work. \n\nMore broadly nothing therein gives you the right to let others make copies or redistribute the work. Copyright vests in the creator and the creator has not been required to give you the right to put the work into the public domain.\n\nTo the extent these are \"boilerplate\" terms and conditions they appear to me to be designed to protect the website operator from liability with respect of publishing the work rather then give them any rights to ownership \\- specifically **they do not give you ownership rights \\- which are required for setting a license.**",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner has Terms of Service (ToS) that grant them the right to use, copy, cache, publish, display, distribute, modify, store, and create derivative works of user-generated content. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the website owner's ability to license this content under a public copyright license (e.g., Creative Commons)?\n\nA) The website owner can freely license the content under any public copyright license without additional permissions.\n\nB) The website owner needs explicit permission to \"license\" in their ToS before they can apply a public copyright license.\n\nC) The website owner cannot license the content under a public copyright license because they don't have ownership rights.\n\nD) The website owner can license the content under a public copyright license as long as they credit the original author.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The website owner cannot license the content under a public copyright license because they don't have ownership rights. The ToS as described only grant the website owner certain usage rights, but do not transfer copyright ownership. To set a license, one must have ownership rights. The ToS appear to be designed to protect the website operator from liability rather than grant them full ownership of the content. Without explicit permission to license the content or transfer of copyright ownership, the website owner cannot apply a public copyright license to user-generated content.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ToS do not grant the website owner the right to license the content to others. Option B is partially correct in recognizing the need for explicit permission, but simply adding \"license\" to the ToS wouldn't be sufficient without transferring ownership rights. Option D is incorrect because crediting the original author doesn't change the fact that the website owner lacks the necessary ownership rights to apply a license."
