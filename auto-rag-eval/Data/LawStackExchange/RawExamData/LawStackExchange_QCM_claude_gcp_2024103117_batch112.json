This applies both to broadcasting and to other public use.\n\nThe basis for this appears to come from \u00a7\u00a045b of the [Copyright Act](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=248181)\\*:\n\n> Sound fixations of the performances of performing artists can, within the period of time specified in section 45, against remuneration, be made available to the pubic \\[sic] through public performance. \\[...] Both the producer of the fixation and the performing artists whose performances are\n>  reproduced are entitled to remuneration. \\[...] For public performance of sound fixations that are not protected under the copyright act, the [Act No. 4 of 14 December 1956](http://app.uio.no/ub/ujur/oversatte-lover/data/lov-19561214-004-eng.pdf) relating to a levy on the public performance of performing artists\u2019 performances, etc. applies.\n\nExplanation\n===========\n\nFFUK is a fund *for* performing artists, not one that takes from performing artists. In this situation, it is not the performing artist that pays the levy, but rather those who make use of a \"sound fixation\" (recording) of a performance of the performing artist.\n\nAn example would be a TV network that wishes to broadcast a pre\\-recorded orchestra performance. If this performance is a song under copyright, then that TV network must pay remuneration to Gramo so that the songwriters, producers, performers etc. can receive compensation. \n\nHowever, if that song is in the public domain then Gramo has no claim to any remuneration. This is where FFUK is involved. The Act No 4\\. of 14 December 1956 authorizes levies for these performances of public domain songs, and it is under this act that FFUK operates. The TV network must pay them a levy so that the performers may still be compensated as they still have rights over the performance of a public domain song.\n\nWhile all this explains the first link you cite, I realize that I'm not directly addressing the claims in the second link. I simply can't find a legal basis for those claims, and still think it's more likely that it's confusing levies for the performance of public domain works (non\\-existant as far as I can tell) with levies for *using* performances of public domain works. I would be happy to be corrected if I'm wrong though.\n\n---\n\n\\*Linked are unofficial translations of the law because I do not speak Norwegian.

The documentation clarifies that users of recordings (such as TV networks) must pay remuneration to Gramo for the use of copyright-protected recordings, and a levy to the Fund for Performing Artists (FFUK) for the use of non-protected (public domain) recordings.

For example, a search warrant allows law enforcement to seize personal property. A garnishment requires an employer to transfer a worker's wages to someone else. A judgment can affirm that property was stolen and thereby invalidate what was previously good title to the property.\n\nLike any judicial order, such judgments can be found to be invalid and/or illegal. But unless and until they are modified, a judicial order is presumed to be lawful. In fact, it has the force of law.

Any party adversely affected by a judgment can usually find grounds to appeal it to a higher court.\n\n---\n\nOf course, things can get messy for affected parties in scenarios like you describe.

My gut tells me it is just another way of referring to the reasonable/prudent person test but I am not sure. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Case to look at:**\n\nThe case you want to look at is [*MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.*, 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916\\)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPherson_v._Buick_Motor_Co). Prior to this case, privity of contract was required to impose duty on a defendant. This case held that a carmaker's liability for a defective product reached beyond the immediate purchaser of that car.\n\nJudge Cardozo eliminated that privity barrier to recovery and stated:\n\n> If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequence to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. That is as far as we need to go for the decision of this case. ... If he is negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow.\n\n**What does the duty of care refer to?**\n\nThe [duty of care](https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/introduction-to-negligence) requires you to act as a reasonable person, acting under similar circumstances, would act. This is the *general* duty applicable in all negligence cases. Sometimes, however, there is a *special* duty imposed on a defendant by case law or statute in place of or in addition to the general duty (one simple example is a law requiring all residents of a city to shovel the snow on the sidewalk in front of their house after snowfall). Other variations to the level of care a duty imposes may include common carriers, doctors, etc.\n\nTo find a duty of care, a few states simply consider whether harming the plaintiff was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions. Many more use some sort of multi\\-factor test to determine this. A California case, *Rowland v Christian*, 69 Cal. 2d 108 (1968\\) laid out this set of factors:\n\n* the foreseeability of harm to the injured party;\n* the degree of certainty he or she suffered injury;\n* the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered;\n* the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct;\n* the policy of preventing future harm;\n* the extent of the burden to the defendant and the consequences to the community of imposing a duty of care with resulting liability for breach;\n* and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved\n\n[As of about 8 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care), \"43 states used a multifactor analysis in 23 various incarnations.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of common law duty of care, which of the following best describes the impact of the MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. case?\n\nA) It established that all manufacturers are strictly liable for any defects in their products\nB) It introduced the concept of reasonable person standard in negligence cases\nC) It eliminated the requirement of privity of contract for imposing duty on a defendant in product liability cases\nD) It created a multi-factor test for determining duty of care in all negligence cases\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. case (1916) was a landmark decision that eliminated the privity barrier to recovery in product liability cases. Before this case, privity of contract was required to impose a duty on a defendant. Judge Cardozo's ruling extended a carmaker's liability for a defective product beyond the immediate purchaser, stating that if a product is likely to be dangerous if negligently made, and the manufacturer knows it will be used by persons other than the purchaser without new tests, then the manufacturer has a duty to make it carefully, regardless of contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the case didn't establish strict liability for all manufacturers. \nOption B is incorrect because the reasonable person standard existed before this case. \nOption D is incorrect because while multi-factor tests for duty of care exist, they weren't created by this specific case."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46867/cybersquatter-posted-my-domain-for-sale-after-i-queried-it-can-i-still-file-a", "docs_id": 46867, "title": "Cybersquatter posted my domain for sale after I queried it - can I still file a UDRP?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm in a situation where a cybersquatter holds a domain name that I have trademarked.\n\nMy company \"Example Ltd\" is based in the UK, and we've been established under our brand name for over 30 years.

The fact that the domain is listed for sale does not prevent Example Ltd from filing a claim. In fact, listing the domain for sale at a high price could be seen as evidence of bad faith on the part of the current owner, strengthening Example Ltd's case.

Thank you in advance!\n\nNow back to the main topic, which I will start with a brief introduction just so you can get familiar with my case. The backstory of my current situation is that back in 2016 when I was choosing between different web hosting providers I found one, which was offering (and I quote) \"Free Domain For Life\" if you sign up for their most expensive shared hosting plan, which at that time was priced at roughly $13\\.00 per month.\n\nI never had any problems or complaints with the company, even in times when they would slightly rise their prices. Therefore, even dough now I am paying roughly $21\\.00 per month I am still using the same shared web hosting plan, which I signed up for in 2016\\. \n\nDuring the years, I have never paid a single penny for my domain name, which was renewed for free on yearly basis by the company until two weeks when I noticed a strange invoice from them. After opening it, I saw that I need to pay $12\\.00 dollars for my domain name if I want to renew it for another year.\n\nI was deeply consufed and thought it is some sort of a technical error. That is why I immediatelly decided to contact their sale team, but they responded that they had cancled this practice a few months back and according to their terms and services, the company has the right to change their conditions of the services they offer. In order for the employee to end on a more positive note, he started explaining improvements and features added that I was getting for free. \n\nI am curios to see what a more experience person than me thinks about this case and if he or she share their thought on the following quesitons I would be really grateful.\n\n1\\) Do you think that this can be considered as false advertisement?\n\n2\\) Due to the fact that I live in Europe and the company is based in the US, would that make it more complicate it for me to search for my legal rights?\n\n3\\) If I actually decide to search for my legal rights, go through the whole process and end up winning, what compensation possibly I could get from it?\n\n4\\) In this case, what kind of a laywer would represent my case the best? Should I contact a lawyer in my home country or search for one who practice law in the state of the company?\n\nPS: I would like to end this topic by saying that I am not planning to sue the company. I am just curious to hear your opinions about who is right and who is wrong. I am happy with the quality of services that I am getting in exchange for my money and I do not mind paying $12\\.00 per year for a domain.

For a competent internet company the contract will usually specify which law applies, if not, the court must decide where the contract was entered into \\- this may be where you are or where they are.\n\nWhile clauses allowing unilateral changes are legal, the power must be used either reasonably or in good faith depending on which law applies. It is certainly arguable that imposing a charge on something for which there was a promise that there would never be a charge is not reasonable and almost certainly not in good faith.\n\n**Consumer protection law**\n\nMost country\u2019s consumer protection laws cannot be excluded by contract and apply based on where the consumer is, as well as where the business is. So, if the service is offered in the UK and a UK consumer buys it, then UK consumer protection law applies irrespective of the nationality of the business.\n\nAlmost all such laws prohibit deceptive and misleading conduct \\- offering something for \u201cfree\u201d when bundled with something else and then reneging is clearly that. \n\nThere is usually a statutory body responsible for dealing with complaints so you might get you issue resolved without needing to go to a court.\n\nTry doing a little research in your country.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the scenario described, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of the web hosting company's actions?\n\nA) The company's change in policy is legally justified because their terms of service allow them to modify conditions at any time.\n\nB) The case would be straightforward to pursue legally because \"Free Domain For Life\" is an unambiguous promise that cannot be revoked.\n\nC) The legal situation is complex and depends on factors such as applicable contract law, consumer protection laws, and the specific jurisdiction involved.\n\nD) The customer has no legal recourse because they continued to use the service after price increases, implying acceptance of potential changes to all terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legal situation is indeed complex and depends on multiple factors. As the documentation explains, the applicable law could be contract law or consumer protection law, depending on the specifics of the agreement and the jurisdictions involved.

Its first sentence identifies the parties, and there are only two.

As explained in the documentation, a contract remains valid even if it sometimes uses the wrong name, as long as the contract as a whole allows for clear identification of the parties and their roles. The interchangeable use of \"Contractor\" and \"Consultant\" may be sloppy, but it doesn't alter or invalidate the meaning of the contract. The context and overall structure of the agreement make it clear who the parties are and what their responsibilities entail.\n\nOption A is incorrect because minor inconsistencies in terminology do not automatically invalidate a contract.

Buckley](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/271/323/), \"the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment 'have reference to state action exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals'\". Therefore, a private agreement to exclude blacks does not run afoul of the 14th Amendment. The Shelley court also noted:\n\n> But here there was more.

This was established in Corrigan v. Buckley, which stated that the 14th Amendment's prohibitions \"have reference to state action exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals.\"\n\nHowever, state laws that explicitly restricted property ownership or residence based on race, such as Oregon's laws prohibiting blacks from living in the territory, would have been considered unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.

Identical twins are rare to start with, and few women have sex with more than one identical twin in the several day period when she could have conceived or didn't know which twin she had sex with. It has happened at least once in history (post\\-DNA testing), but you can probably count the number of times that it has ever happened on one hand.\n\nFor example, presumptions from cohabitation, marriage, and claims of paternity often resolve paternity disputes without DNA evidence.\n\nFurther, to the extent that there is good faith uncertainty (perhaps everyone agrees that the mother has sex with both twins on the only possible day of conception and nobody really knows), the downsides to a mistake in the larger cosmic sense of the overall paternity law system are minimal, as identical twins very rarely become deeply alienated from each other and instead tend to be close and intensely cooperative once they discover each other, and tend to be similar to each other in almost every respect depriving the child of little if the court gets it wrong.

I'm curious what the official legal rules are for escorting individuals into different rest rooms. Have laws explicitly spelled out that children under a certain age are allowed into any restroom, or is this one of those cases were it's technically illegal but no one cares enough to argue against it?\n\nIf I (a male) was caring for a special needs individual who is older but at a young child's mental level of development and/or unable to use the restroom without assistance would It be legal for me to bring the individual into the male restroom in order for me to assist her in using it?\n\nI'm more interested in Federal law, but if these laws are usually state level then I'd be interested in my home state of Maryland.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There appears to be no general federal statute addressing the legality of a male entering a female\\-labeled bathroom, or vice versa, within federal jurisdiction. There are various regulations that touch on bathrooms, for example the [OSHA regulations pertaining to sanitation](https://www.govregs.com/regulations/expand/title29_chapterXVII_part1910_subpartJ_section1910.141#title29_chapterXVII_part1910_subpartJ_section1910.141) require that \"toilet facilities, in toilet rooms separate for each sex, shall be provided in all places of employment in accordance with table J\\-1 of this section\", but \"Where toilet facilities will not be used by women, urinals may be provided instead of water closets\". These are regulations imposed on employers, and there is no provision for enforcement *by employers*, for instance no clause saying that the employer must call the police, or in any way intervene or sanction an employee, if a person enters a bathroom of \"the wrong sex\".\n\nIt is apparently not a crime, as reflected anywhere in the US Code, for a male to enter or remain in a female bathroom, or vice versa. Building managers have some discretion regarding the operation of federal facilities, for example courthouses, which could extend to requesting a male to not enter a female bathroom or vice versa, but there isn't a practical way to determine what departmental regulations exist that would allow eviction of a bathroom\\-cross\\-user. Federal law does not protect against sex/gender discrimination in public accommodations.\n\nAs for Maryland law, the owner of private property has the right to control his property up to the point that state law take that control from him, and therefore in principle he could call the police to remove a person trespassing in a bathroom ([this article](https://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/is-it-illegal-for-a-man-to-use-the-ladies-room/) addresses the trespass angle in North Carolina). Maryland does not appear to have any case law or statutory exception to trespass laws related to labeling of bathrooms, so enforcement actions would be at the discretion of the owner.\nAt the lower end of the political hierarchy, Baltimore has an ordinance requiring single\\-use bathrooms to be gender neutral, and a [proposal exists](https://legiscan.com/MD/text/SB401/2020) to enact a state law with this effect.\n\nIn other words, there does not appear to be any direct, enforceable legal requirement regarding bathroom entry and sex. Trespass laws could be used, but are at the discretion of the property owner (who might be civilly sued for his actions, but the police don't decide the merits of a discrimination suit before evicting a trespasser).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a male caregiver, is assisting Sarah, an adult woman with special needs who functions at a young child's mental level.

In those circumstances, sometimes the judge is shown the document itself which is not made available to the plaintiff, in order to allow the judge to make that determination, especially in a case headed to a jury trial.

But, the non\\-disclosure to the other party in these circumstances usually wouldn't be a permanent matter.\n\nIt is much more common for this to happen in a case where the defendant is not allowed to see something filed by a plaintiff than the other way around.\n\nNational Security\n=================\n\nDocuments implicating national security can also sometimes be filed by the other party with the court \"under seal\", typically in support of a motion to have the plaintiff's case or part of the plaintiff's case dismissed on the grounds that this would risk a revelation of state secrets.\n\nSometimes, when the attorney, but not the client, has a security clearance, these documents can be made available to the attorney, but not to the client, on an \"attorney's eyes only\" basis.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit, under which circumstances might a plaintiff be legally prevented from seeing certain documents related to their own case?\n\nA) When the documents contain trade secrets of a competitor, subject to a protective order\nB) When the documents are being reviewed by a judge in camera to determine privilege\nC) When the documents are part of an ex parte motion for tactical reasons\nD) All of the above\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of various situations where a plaintiff might be legally prevented from accessing certain case-related documents.

Imagine it being the same thing as the real one, but with different words.\n\n---\n\n\"My new furnace doesn't use coal like most furnaces, instead, it uses chemical X. Moreover, chemical x is bonded with arsenic and turned into a molten fluid, which allows me to burn up the mixture 50% more efficiently. While molten fluid furnaces have been proposed, they've never used chemical x in them before.\n\nOnce the chemical x is burnt, helium is bubbled through at pressures around 5,000 psi to get the waste to become a gas, that way it bubbles out. It can react with magnesium to make a solid substance for disposal. Helium is known to react with way with most substances, however, I am the first to apply it to a liquid chemical x\\-arsenic waste mixture for the purpose of removing it from the furnace.\n\nThe heat produced by the furnace is taken to a ultra\\-pressurized sodium gas and sent to a vanadium turbine system. After this turbine system, it immediately goes to whatever needs to be heated up. This process for exchanging heat from the furnace to the target has been used before and is well known, but never when used with a molten fluid furnace before.\"\n\n---\n\nWhile most of this was not in legalese, it does give the general idea of how much detail I currently have about the design/concept as well as how original the concept is.\n\nThe thing I would be protecting is how all of these different parts would be used to make chemical x into a usable furnace fuel, not all of the little parts.

The second is harder\n\nVery generally \\- The NDA can just say that they will keep confidential certain information you would like them to know for purposes of evaluating your ideas for purposes of deciding to enter into a business relationship with you, for example. The NDA itself can just mention the topic \\- A system of using a molten fluid furnace to drive a turbine and to also provide heat.\n\nSeparate is what you then tell them and what you provide in writing, if anything.

The documentation suggests that professional venture capitalists typically expect to hear enough non-proprietary information about an invention to gauge their interest level without signing an NDA.

But comments have suggested it's broader, so let's examine if S.B. 8 \"officially or legally prohibits abortions\". It certainly prohibits them *without the doctor checking for a fetal heartbeat*, which scares me less, but it's not conclusive, it is a complex law setting standards applicable to a doctor, not on a mother.

In California, secretly recording a conversation without all parties' consent is both a criminal offense and grounds for civil action.

So is this sufficient for them to qualify as valid legal abbreviations for their respective full form disclaimers of \"*I am not a lawyer*\" and \"*this is not legal advice*\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Stating \"This is not blue\" or \"TINB\" on something that is self\\-evidently blue is of no legal effect\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Legal advice](https://hirealawyer.findlaw.com/do-you-need-a-lawyer/what-is-legal-advice.html) has the following characteristics:\n\n> * Requires legal knowledge, skill, education and judgment\n> * Applies specific law to a particular set of circumstances\n> * Affects someone's legal rights or responsibilities\n> * Creates rights and responsibilities in the advice\\-giver\n\nIf the advice you give meets these criteria then it is legal advice.\n\nHowever, if you are clear that you are not a lawyer and that you are not giving legal advice then this undermines the characteristics above. That is, what would be legal advice without such a disclaimer *may* lose that characteristic if the disclaimer is genuinely given in the particular circumstances. Context matters: \"this is not legal advice (wink, wink)\" is not a disclaimer and doesn't turn legal advice into not legal advice.\n\nSimilarly, the disclaimer must be genuinely understood by the recipient so that they are adequately warned to do their own research or seek actual legal advice before taking the course of action outlined. Using an abbreviation is more likely to be misunderstood but, again, context matters. In the context of this particular site (see various [meta](https://law.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=legal%20advice) questions), which goes out of its way to explain that this is not legal advice the disclaimer is hardly necessary and the abbreviation would be fine.\n\n---\n\nMore generally\n--------------\n\nCommunication is always under tension between clarity and brevity.

Depending on the context and the target audience an abbreviation may or may not need to be spelled out in full. \n\nIn formal writing, it is good practice to spell them out when first used and put the abbreviated form in parenthesis immediately afterward.

The abbreviation must be genuinely understood by the recipient, and the overall context should make it clear that the information is not intended as legal advice.

This happens so often that as he approaches nobody even needs to say a word: They hand him their camera, and then step back so he can take their picture with it.\n\nBut in this hypothetical scenario something extraordinary happens: As he takes their picture a commercial airplane doing an emergency landing hits the river *in the frame of the photo*. So he happens to have pressed the shutter button on what turned out to be a very valuable picture. Let us supposed that a media buyer offers $10k to license the photo. Who owns the copyright to that photo?\n\nOn the one hand, the camera owners could argue that the photographer exercised no more \"creative expression\" than does a tripod or selfie stick. They just didn't have one handy, so they composed the photo and the photographer was just a mechanism to hold the camera and release the shutter. Therefore, they must own the copyright.\n\nOn the other hand, the photographer could argue that he \"fixed the expression\" of the creative work. As an experienced photographer he made subtle decisions regarding framing and timing of the photo that were outside of the control of the couple. Alternatively, if he hadn't been volunteering to photograph the couple with their camera, he could have instead been holding his own camera and captured the valuable element of the photo, which was the serendipitous emergency landing.\n\nDoes any law or jurisprudence inform who owns the copyright in this scenario?\n\nIf the aforementioned facts suggest it is the couple (and owners of the camera), then let us change one fact: After taking the couple's desired photo, the photographer sees the airplane out of the corner of his eye and, with no time to spare, shifts the camera to capture a separate spectacular photo of the water landing. Does he now have firm claim on the copyright to that photo?\n\nAnd if so, can the photographer enforce his property rights in the photo, given that it was captured and is stored on equipment he does not own and cannot legitimately possess? I.e., can't the camera owner say, \"OK, you own the photo copyright, but I own the medium where you put its only copy, and I will not sell or grant you access to that medium except for the full value of the photo.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What a lovely question!\n\nUS Copyright law is clear: the author of a creative work owns the copyright unless it is work for hire. In this instance, the photographer is not doing work for hire so they own the copyright.\n\nHowever, the photographer does not own a copy of the photograph \u2013 that is owned by the owner of the camera. The photographer cannot demand that they give him a copy but the parties can agree on such a transfer on whatever terms they like.\n\nAs the owner of a \u201cphysical\u201d copy they can do what they like with that copy but they cannot duplicate it except as fair use or as licensed. They could sell the memory card to whomever they like but the new owner couldn\u2019t copy it either so it would seriously limit publication. Similarly they could move the file provided there was only one copy. Arguably, they could make a print of it providing they deleted the electronic version without copyright violation.\n\nWhich brings us to who owns the copyright *now*. The camera owner can argue that the photographer has gifted the copyright to them. This is quite a strong argument as the parties' intentions at the time of arranging the taking of the photograph is that the photographer would have no further interest in it \u2013 after all he probably doesn\u2019t want to hang a photo of some strangers on his wall. However, in many jurisdictions, including the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), copyright transfers must be in writing.\n\nAs a fallback position the camera owner can argue there is an *implicit* license given even if copyright was not transferred. The scope of the license then becomes an issue. It is probably indisputable that the license is perpetual and royalty free. What is arguable is if the license allows commercial exploitation or only personal use. This is where the battle lines would be drawn and I don\u2019t know how it would play out.\n\nOther jurisdictions are different\n---------------------------------\n\nFor example, in Australia, copyright in a photo commissioned \u201cfor valuable consideration\u201d for a \u201cprivate or domestic purpose\u201d vests in the commissioning party, not the photographer; even though this is not work for hire by an employee.\n\nFor the circumstances you describe, the purpose is \u201cprivate or domestic\u201d but there is no \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d so the photographer owns the copyright in this case.

Doctors can pretty much bill a patient whatever they want for their service, similar to how a grocery store can charge whatever they want for their fresh deli cheese. Generally, they charge every single person the same amount. It just gets *discounted* depending on the insurance you have and how much they're willing to pay.\n\nOne of the huge benefits of having medical insurance (outside of them paying for your medical expenses) is that they build contracts with service providers, known as their network. Those contracts specify prices (both preset and algorithmic) for certain services that you receive through those providers \\- the insurance provider will only pay that much and the doctor cannot charge the patient more than what is paid.\n\nIf a claim was processed through a different insurance provider, the price will likely be different since each provider will have a separately negotiated contract with different price points for different services. It's not a system of \"this is the insured price and this is the uninsured price\" but rather a system of \"this is the contract you established saying you'd accept this much from us for this service.\"\n\nFor an uninsured person, though, you have no insurance provider and more importantly no provider contract backing you up. So you'd have to face the full force of the non\\-discounted price of those services. You'll face the same problem even with insurance if you go out\\-of\\-network, where the provider does not have contracts and therefore will only cover up to a certain amount that they would normally pay out for a similar service, requiring you to cover the rest of the amount of whatever the doctor decided to bill for that particular service. Without that insurance contract preventing the doctor from billing you the remainder of what they'd normally charge, you'll likely be slapped with a bill for that remainder.\n\nDirecting back at your original question: there is no reason that a medical provider would ever legitimately bill someone a different amount because they are insured or not, thus there are no laws preventing it. It's that they already agreed to accept this certain amount from patients covered under this specific insurance. Again, they bill every patient the same amount \\- the insurance company is just saying \"we're giving you this much and the rest of this, yeah that needs to go away.\"\n\nIf you've ever looked at an EOB (Explanation of Benefits) from your insurance company, you'll see that the actual billed amount from the doctor is almost always much, **much** higher than what is actually paid out by you or the insurance, often known as the insurance discount.

What typically happens in this scenario?\n\nA) The patient pays $1000, and the insurance company reimburses them $600 later.\nB) The medical provider charges the patient $400, and the insurance company pays $600.\nC) The medical provider accepts $600 from the insurance company as payment in full, and the patient owes nothing.\nD) The patient pays $1000, but can negotiate with the insurance company for a partial refund.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In this scenario, the medical provider has a contract with the insurance company (Company X) that specifies agreed-upon prices for services. When a patient with this insurance receives treatment, the provider bills the full amount ($1000 in this case), but due to the contractual agreement, they accept the agreed price ($600) as payment in full from the insurance company. This is often referred to as the \"allowed amount\" or \"negotiated rate.\" The difference between the billed amount and the allowed amount ($400 in this case) is typically written off by the provider and cannot be billed to the patient. This process, known as the \"insurance discount,\" is one of the key benefits of having health insurance, as it protects patients from paying the full, non-discounted price for medical services."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50225/what-happens-if-a-vehicle-is-reported-sold-and-never-registered-again", "docs_id": 50225, "title": "What happens if a vehicle is reported sold and never registered again?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand the registration is suspended after x days if the buyer fails to register.

The FTT said that it was, since either the Duchy or the Duke were carrying out certain functions of public administration (as the harbour authority for [St Mary's Harbour](https://www.stmarys-harbour.co.uk/) on the Isles of Scilly), and whichever one it was, the Duke was in charge of the Duchy; and meanwhile, the Duchy appeared to have some elements of legal personality, as cited in the question above. This decision was appealed to the Upper Tribunal, [*The A\\-G for the Prince of Wales v the IC and Mr Michael Bruton* \\[2016] UKUT 0154 (AAC)](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5784f4b7ed915d622c000119/GIA_0158_2012-00.pdf), which disagreed as to the Duchy being a body with its own separate identity \\- see paragraphs 71\\-102 \\- and reversed the ruling below.\n\nThe basic issue is that the Duchy of Cornwall was brought into being by a royal charter of 1337\\. It predates modern common\\-law or statutory developments about bodies corporate, income tax, corporation tax, and so on. It also precedes the not\\-exactly\\-modern developments of the limited scope of royal authority and the prerogative, norms of statutory construction, the Crown as separate from the royal person, and other apparatus of *constitutional* monarchy. It is true that it sits uncomfortably in the modern world, as a *sui generis* feudal creation that is not something we would create today. However, as a matter of law, the UT said that what counts is what the Duchy is, not what it ought to be. Figuring out the law means looking at the actual law as opposed to ancillary indications, such as what Duchy officers have said from time to time, or administrative actions of the Health and Safety Executive. Parliament has had the opportunity to consider the position of the Duchy several times and has so far declined to change it.\n\nThe [charter of 1337](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw3/11/0), which was deemed to be an Act of Parliament by a court case in 1606 (!), grants land and privileges to the Duke of Cornwall, whoever that might be from time to time, and with a reverter to the Crown when there is no Duke. The UT found that this \"creates something that has similarities to a trust, but without trustees\" (there was a nascent body of law relating to trusts in 1337, but it was nowhere near its modern flourishing). Unlike with the creation of the Duchy of Lancaster, this charter does not incorporate the Duchy as an entity in its own right \\- the \"Duchy\" is just a word used to describe the possessions of the Duke or King held under the charter. If it *is* a separate entity then that is not because of the charter.\n\nThe UT examined various of the claims made in the FTT but rejected them, saying that \"such examples cannot create such an entity or body and each investigation of the submissions based on them that took place before me showed such statements or implications to be wrong (e.g. that the Duchy owns Highgrove was shown to be wrong by the\nproduction of the Land Certificate).\" It also rejected the idea that the people who administer the Duchy could be regarded as some form of partnership or unincorporated association, finding that they had not come together in that fashion. It said that therefore, the only remaining route to the Duchy being a corporation would be if the other primary legislation dealing with its management had created it as such by \"necessary implication\".\n\nThose Acts, of [1844](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/7-8/65/contents), [1863](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/26-27/49/contents) and [1982](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1982/47/contents), deal with accounting and management for the Duchy of Cornwall. From their context and content, the UT said that they seem to envisage the property in question as belonging to the Duke (not the Duchy) as \"the legal owner of the assets etc. comprising the Duchy estate\", and that \"the relevant officers and employees work for the Duke, or the Duke\u2019s guardian when he is a minor, or the Sovereign when there is no Duke, and not for an entity or corporation called the Duchy.\" Therefore:\n\n> \\[T]he Duchy of Cornwall or the Duchy is no more than a name that has been used correctly to describe the possessions of the Duke of Cornwall (the Duchy estate), or to the Duke (or his title), or collectively and conveniently to describe the officers and persons who from time to time act for and on behalf of the Duke as the owner of the Duchy estate.\n> \n> \n> Save to the extent that it is a reference to the Duke as a natural person the Duchy of Cornwall has no legal personality and is not a person, body or entity that has its own functions and powers or a separate identity of its own.\n\nAlthough this was not before the UT, it would seem to follow for tax purposes that if the Duchy is not a body corporate, then it is not liable for corporation tax under the [Corporation Tax Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/4/contents) \\- see section 1121, which defines \"company\" for that and the companion Corporation Tax Act 2009\\. It also does not fall within section 443, \"Companies controlled by or on behalf of Crown\", firstly because if it's not a company, then that section fails immediately, and secondly because \"Crown\" here refers to the Crown in the sense of governmental public functions, not the Queen (or her family members) personally.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal status of the Duchy of Cornwall according to the Upper Tribunal's ruling in 2016?\n\nA) The Duchy of Cornwall is a separate legal entity with its own corporate identity, subject to corporation tax.\n\nB) The Duchy of Cornwall is a trust-like entity created by the 1337 charter, with trustees managing its assets.\n\nC) The Duchy of Cornwall is merely a name describing the possessions of the Duke of Cornwall, without its own legal personality.\n\nD) The Duchy of Cornwall is an unincorporated association formed by the people who administer its assets.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Upper Tribunal ruled that the Duchy of Cornwall is not a separate legal entity, but rather a name used to describe the possessions of the Duke of Cornwall. It rejected claims that the Duchy had its own legal personality or corporate identity. The Tribunal found that the charter of 1337 did not incorporate the Duchy as an entity in its own right, and subsequent legislation did not create it as a corporation by necessary implication. The Duchy was deemed to have no separate identity, with its assets belonging to the Duke and its officers working for the Duke, not for an entity called the Duchy.
