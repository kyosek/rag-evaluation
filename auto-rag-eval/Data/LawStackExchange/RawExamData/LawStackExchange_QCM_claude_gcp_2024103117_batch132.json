The plaintiff requested discovery of \"all emails sent by defendant pertaining to subject *X*\"\n2. The plaintiff actually has an authenticated copy of at least one of the defendant's emails pertaining to subject *X*\n3. The defendant did not include that email in discovery\n\nIn this scenario the plaintiff has evidence (\\#2\\) that the defendant failed to provide complete discovery.\n\nIf the plaintiff raises the missing evidence in court then the defendant could say, \"Sorry, that was an honest oversight. We reviewed our material and believe that's the only thing missing from our discovery.\" (An astute plaintiff might have held another relevant document in reserve, and could now produce that one, and the defendant could respond, \"Oops, I did it again. Honest mistake.\" Etc.) I don't see any way for a tribunal to distinguish between honest mistakes and intentional withholding of adverse evidence.\n\nThe plaintiff could argue based on a single relevant omission, \"The defendant concealed material evidence. *Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.*\" Does that apply? For example: Does the plaintiff then get a presumption that all facts that *could have been* supported in discovery *are* sustained?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer depends on the jurisdiction, as always. But under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which are the model for most American courts, there are all kinds of potential sanctions for discovery violations.\n\n[Rule 37(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_37):\n\n> If a party or a party's officer, director, or managing agent\u2014or a witness designated under Rule 30(b)(6\\) or 31(a)(4\\)\u2014fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order under Rule 26(f), 35, or 37(a), the court where the action is pending may issue further just orders. They may include the following:\n> \n> \n> (i) directing that the matters embraced in the order or other designated facts be taken as established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing party claims;\n> \n> \n> (ii) prohibiting the disobedient party from supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from introducing designated matters in evidence;\n> \n> \n> (iii) striking pleadings in whole or in part;\n> \n> \n> (iv) staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed;\n> \n> \n> (v) dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in part;\n> \n> \n> (vi) rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party; or\n> \n> \n> (vii) treating as contempt of court the failure to obey any order except an order to submit to a physical or mental examination.\n\nBut the court will not move directly to imposing sanctions against the offending party. Instead, the rules require the aggrieved party to raise the issue privately and attempt to resolve it without court intervention. If that is unsuccessful, the court may issue an order compelling discovery. Rule 37 sanctions are generally only available if the offending party then fails to comply with that order.\n\nSeparate from Rule 37, though, the court also has inherent authority to impose sanctions for litigation misconduct, but you can usually expect it to limit itself to Rule 37 protocols. Most judges don't want to hear about discovery, so they are happy to force people through the informal resolution process first.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A plaintiff in a civil case discovers that the defendant failed to provide a crucial email during discovery, despite the plaintiff's request for \"all emails pertaining to subject X.\" The plaintiff has an authenticated copy of this email. After unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue privately, the court issues an order compelling discovery, which the defendant still fails to comply with. According to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, what is the MOST severe sanction the court could impose in this situation?\n\nA) Issuing a verbal warning to the defendant's legal team\nB) Requiring the defendant to pay a small fine\nC) Rendering a default judgment against the defendant\nD) Allowing the plaintiff to introduce additional evidence not previously disclosed\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Rule 37(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, when a party fails to obey a court order to provide or permit discovery, the court has the authority to impose various sanctions. The most severe of these, as listed in the options, is \"rendering a default judgment against the disobedient party\" (Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(vi)). This is considered one of the harshest penalties as it essentially decides the case in favor of the plaintiff without a full trial.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a verbal warning is not listed among the sanctions in Rule 37(b) and would be an unusually mild response to failing to comply with a court order.\n\nOption B is also incorrect. While the court can impose monetary sanctions, a small fine would be an inadequate response to failing to comply with a court order, especially given the more severe options available.\n\nOption D is incorrect because allowing the plaintiff to introduce additional evidence is not listed as a specific sanction in Rule 37(b). Moreover, this would not be an appropriate remedy for the defendant's failure to provide discovery.\n\nIt's important to note that while rendering a default judgment is the most severe option presented, the court would likely consider less drastic sanctions first, depending on the severity of the violation and any pattern of misconduct."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41865/is-making-a-public-comment-about-a-girls-breasts-illegal", "docs_id": 41865, "title": "Is making a public comment about a girl&#39;s breasts illegal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From a Washington Post's article about Columbine HS:\n\n> A similar event happened at a Columbine wrestling match at Arvada High\n>  School.

While the single comment itself might not be illegal, the information provided suggests that it was part of a pattern of behavior that could be considered harassment under local ordinances. The Arvada ordinance defines harassment as repeatedly insulting, taunting, or making communications in offensively coarse language with the intent to annoy, and in a manner likely to provoke a violent or disorderly response. The article mentions that this was not an isolated incident, indicating a potential pattern of harassment. Additionally, the involvement of local police and the reported fine suggest that local laws, rather than federal or state laws, were likely applied.

Why was this principle not available for Julian? (Or was it?)\n\nFurthermore, why was the first iteration of his extradition proceedings (I gather based on the original indictment) at Woolwich crown court, when the proceedings related to the superseding and second superseding indictments were undertaken seemingly all at the old Bailey? Does this not imply that these \u201csubstantive\u201d rather than \u201cceremonial\u201d parts of the proceedings actually were at crown courts in both cases, including at the old Bailey / central criminal court? Even if so, why was the first iteration at Woolwich and the second in central London?\n\nAnd finally, if it was in fact at a crown court in both cases, does that imply that there was a jury involved? (I assume not because then they would have been mentioned in many of the countless media reports on the proceedings. )\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Extradition is a special procedure that is tightly governed by statute \\- currently the [Extradition Act 2003](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/41/contents). That Act provides that, for extradition from England (as opposed to Scotland, etc.) to the United States (an example of a Category 2 Territory), an initial hearing is to take place before \"the appropriate judge\". This is, per [s.139(1\\)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/41/section/139), a designated \"District Judge (Magistrates' Courts)\". A DJMC sits in a magistrates' court, and is a professional judge as opposed to a layperson like an ordinary Justice of the Peace. The hearing is meant to resemble summary proceedings in the magistrates' court, but it has its own special rules. Those include a special appeals procedure which is different from the ordinary way that criminal cases can be appealed. Some things that could normally happen in a magistrates' court cannot happen here, such as varying an order at a later date (see R (Mann) v Westminster Magistrates Court \\[2010] EWHC 48 (Admin)).\n\nThe way that this is phrased means that the jurisdiction is not conferred *on the magistrates' court* (which happens to have a DJ sitting in it), but *on the DJMC* themselves. The [Criminal Procedure Rules 2014, Rule 17\\.2(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1610) are careful to say that when they say \"magistrates' court\" in this context, they are talking about the court that the judge has convened for the purposes of the Extradition Act. These rules are only applicable because the Act specifically provides for them in its s.210; they don't come in automatically as they would for criminal proceedings in a magistrates' court, because this is a special process with its own law, as expounded in the Explanatory Notes to the rules.\n\nIn the Assange case, the DJMC was Vanessa Baraitser, including at Woolwich and the Old Bailey. The proceedings were under the Extradition Act as explained above.\n\nThe court chose to sit in various buildings, other than Westminster Magistrates Court, for practical reasons due to the high level of public interest in the case, and related security considerations. The hearing was booked to last four weeks, which is *very* unusually long. Proceedings were live\\-streamed to other court buildings to allow members of the public and media to follow along.\n\nAll of that does not mean that the proceedings were in a Crown Court or County Court. They were in buildings used by those courts, but took place before the designated DJMC according to the special procedure of the Extradition Act. That procedure, among other things, means that the extradition hearing cannot take place as a hearing of some other court, and there is no jury no matter how much the defendant wants one.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the extradition proceedings of Julian Assange, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal process and venue?\n\nA) The proceedings took place in various Crown Courts, including Woolwich Crown Court and the Old Bailey, with a jury present due to the high-profile nature of the case.\n\nB) The hearings were conducted in magistrates' courts only, with no option for Crown Court proceedings, as is standard for all extradition cases in England and Wales.\n\nC) The extradition process followed special statutory procedures under the Extradition Act 2003, with hearings presided over by a designated District Judge (Magistrates' Courts) in various locations for practical reasons, without involving a jury.\n\nD) Assange had the option to elect for a Crown Court trial with a jury, as is common in most criminal cases, but chose to have his case heard in magistrates' courts for expediency.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the extradition proceedings for Julian Assange followed the specific procedures outlined in the Extradition Act 2003.

The Article IV privileges and immunities clause applies to rights specific to state citizenship to prevent those rights from being denied to out of state U.S. citizens.

The world is full of dangerous stuff and all of it is for sale.\n\nCertain governments may regulate the sale of certain products. Such regulations may cover packaging, storage, quantities, reporting and limits on who can be a buyer or seller. For example, who can be a buyer of Uranium is pretty strictly limited.\n\nThe decision about what and how to regulate is a political one, not a legal one. In general, governments apply a cost/benefit approach (including political costs/benefits). The fact that one (or a small number) of people use something inappropriately must be balanced with the cost that regulation imposed on government and legitimate users.\n\nAlso, in most parts of the developed world people are *allowed* to take risks with their own bodies \\- climbing mountains, surfing, parachuting and, yes, injecting themselves with foreign substances.

This is a somewhat murky area of the law, but in many cases, a majority shareholder has a *fiduciary duty* to do what is best for the corporation as a whole (not just the majority shareholder, but all shareholders), an obligation that logically parallels the obligation of the board of directors (which controls a corporation with much the same effect as a majority shareholder). \n\nIn Delaware, where [most large corporations are incorporated](https://corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency/), a major shareholder or group of shareholders can have less than 50% of the vote can still be considered *de facto* majority shareholder if they have influence over the rest of the shareholders.

If a majority shareholder takes actions directly, it has the burden of proof in court to show that any actions taken accord with the \"entire fairness\" standard.

This avoids the constitutional restrictions on banning abortions.\n\nAnother controversial topic in the US is gun control. There are similar constitutional bars on laws that restrict the ownership of guns.\n\nCould a state pass a similar law to the Texas law to allow citizens to sue anyone who sells a gun, buys a gun, possesses a gun or similar?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's back up.\n\nIt's premature to say that SB 8 \"avoids the constitutional restrictions on banning abortions\". The constitutionality of SB 8 has not been resolved; the Supreme Court [said so explicitly](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/21a24_8759.pdf) (page 2\\). In fact there is good reason to think that is unconstitutional under existing interpretation of the Constitution per *Roe v. Wade* and the like. (Whether the court will actually follow existing interpretation is another question, of course.)\n\nBut the courts do not determine the constitutionality of laws just because someone asks them; they only do so when it needs to be decided to resolve a particular case. For instance, if a person is charged with a crime, they can challenge the constitutionality of the law under which they are charged, and courts will address that question unless the case is resolved some other way. There are also ways that a person who *wants* to violate the law can pre\\-emptively sue the government to prevent them from enforcing the law, if they can show such enforcement is likely to affect them.\n\nThe issue in SB 8 is that since it wouldn't be the government enforcing the law, it's unclear who an abortion provider can pre\\-emptively sue. In *Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson*, they tried to sue the State of Texas, its courts, and a private party who they thought might be likely to sue them. The SCOTUS majority found that none of those defendants were relevant. However, if and when an abortion provider actually does get sued, there'll be a clear case which has proper parties and is [ripe](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ripe), and courts then will have to consider whether SB 8 is constitutional or not.\n\nSo if your hypothetical gun control statute were treated similarly, the law might avoid pre\\-emptive challenges, with a chilling effect on gun sales. But sooner or later, someone would probably violate the law (maybe deliberately as a test case), and the courts would consider whether it was constitutional or not. Under prevailing interpretations of the Second Amendment, they'd probably find that it wasn't.\n\nA key difference, of course, is that abortions are much more time\\-sensitive than gun purchases; being temporarily blocked from having an abortion is much more consequential in most cases than being temporarily blocked from buying a gun.\n\nThe other subtext is that, although SCOTUS said their decision in *Whole Woman's Health* is not based on the constitutionality of SB 8, it's widely suspected that several of the justices are not all that keen on the constitutional right to abortion found in Roe v. Wade, and might look to overturn Roe when it comes up. As such, they may not be very motivated to look for procedural avenues to block SB 8 in the short term, since they might be inclined to uphold it in the long term. The dissenters in *Whole Woman's Health* certainly thought those avenues were available.

The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of SB 8, explicitly stating that this issue remains unresolved.

It's a concept that's been around a long time in the English legal system (predating the US), to encourage people to help the government enforce its laws. The more contemporary system is to give private parties the right to sue on their own behalf for some wrong (known as a \"private attorney general\" system), which is how things like civil rights claims tend to work; the difference with qui tam is that the government *is* the plaintiff ([source](http://www.jstor.org/stable/796589?seq=9#page_scan_tab_contents))\n\nIt's possible when the law says that a claim under some section may be filed by a private person on behalf of the government; at the time the article was written, the false marking statute ([35 USC 292](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/292)) stated that \"Any person may sue for the penalty, in which event one\\-half shall go to the person suing and the other to the use of the United States.\" In a qui tam action, the government *is* the plaintiff; it's just that instead of a public attorney handling the case, it's handled by a private party. \n\nThere were three active qui tam statutes in US federal law as of 2009 (source: [CRS](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40786.pdf)): the False Claims Act ([31 USC 3730](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3730)), the patent marking claim, and an Indian protection statute ([25 USC 201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/201)). The patent marking qui tam provision has been repealed, leaving just the two. For the Indian protection statute, I can't find any reference to any special procedure; for the False Claims Act, there is a special procedure included in the law.\n\nIn the False Claims Act, when an action is submitted, the government is notified and the complaint kept sealed for 60 days while the US government decides what to do. If the government wants to take over the case itself, it can do that; if it wants the private party to run the case, it can do that too; if it wants to dismiss or settle the case it can do that as well. It can also ask for the time to be extended, or for discovery to be delayed to gather evidence or prosecute a separate criminal or civil case. If the government lets the private party run the case, they can still intervene later if they have a good reason.\n\nAfter the case finishes, the private party gets 15\\-25% of the judgment or settlement (if the government took over the case) or 25\\-30% (if the private party ran the case), plus attorney fees. If the facts the case was brought under were publicly known when it was filed, the amount shrinks to 0\\-10% if the person supplied information to the government that wasn't publicly known when it was supplied, and the case is dismissed if the person just learned about it from public sources.\n\nFor the false marking statute, a district court actually [found it unconstitutional](http://ia700409.us.archive.org/4/items/gov.uscourts.ohnd.168384/gov.uscourts.ohnd.168384.18.0.pdf) in part *because* of the lack of the extensive procedure found in the False Claims Act. There, the procedure was just to file the case like normal; the clerk had to tell the Patent Office that a claim had been filed within a month, but one issue was that a settlement could have happened in that time and bound the government. It's possible higher courts would have ruled had that section not been repealed later that year.\n\nAs for other countries, the idea came to the US from England, but the [Common Informers Act 1951](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/14-15/39) eliminated it there. However, private prosecutions (which *do* exist in England) are similar in that the case is on behalf of the Crown, but handled by a private party; they're different in that the private party doesn't get any part of the judgment.

In particular BGB \u00a7 862 appears to allow for both money damages and prospective injunctive relief to prevent future violations.\n\nI've looked around quite a bit and have not located any statute other than \u00a7 123 of the Germany Criminal Code that applies (incidentally, it is a section of the German Criminal Code for which [private criminal prosecutions are authorized](https://www.fh-kiel.de/fileadmin/data/sug/pdf-Dokument/Nahrwold/Legal_protection_of_victims_in_Germany.pdf)), although the law prohibiting poaching could prevent hunting on private lands without permission. And, the translation of that section as burglary, rather than trespassing, is really a poor translation choice because in American and English legal language, burglary is trespassing with an intent to commit some other crime, while a violation of \u00a7 123 does not require such a showing. I wonder, however, if \"enclosed\" may be a term of art that could include a sign that says \"stay out\".\n\nIt could be that trespassing in open spaces might have been encompassed within the [former section 361 of the German Criminal Code](http://www.housingrightswatch.org/sites/default/files/2012-12-11_RPT_GERMANY_anti_soc_laws_en.pdf), which criminalized vagrancy and begging as misdemeanors under threat of a fine of up to 500 German Marks or up to six weeks\u2019 imprisonment. It was abolished in 1974\\.\n\nSome conduct that would be barred by criminal trespassing laws in the U.S. would be barred by the [Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_owig/englisch_owig.html#p0702) (Regulatory Offenses Act) such as \u00a7 113 (failure to disperse from an unlawful gathering), \u00a7 114 (trespassing on military property), \u00a7 117 (noise violations) and \u00a7 118 (public nuisance), or a local police bylaw which would be offenses roughly comparable to municipal ordinance violations in the U.S. and might ban, for example, sleeping in a public park. \n\nBut, none of those offenses correspond to simple trespassing in Anglo\\-American law and it appears that the default rule is that entering onto an open meadow or forest or unenclosed space that is owned by another, by itself, is not a crime in Germany. Given that many Germanic language speaking countries and other countries in the region recognize a \"[freedom to roam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam)\", this may well be an intended result.

That seems a rather week preventative measure, since the two legal teams merely have to keep their communication secret. \n\nIs there anything else that prevents this from happening?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would approach the question from a different direction.\n\nAs an empirical matter, there are very few places in the United States were it is even remotely conceivable that this would happen, despite the fact that opposing counsel in legal matters have to cooperate with each other all time and are very good at cooperation and at keeping secrets.\n\nPsychologist Stanley Milgram noted in [psychology experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) that even slight steps to make someone identify with a particular role powerfully influences their behavior. People are extremely responsively to even slight whiffs of authority and respond to that role. The [Stanford Prison Experiment](http://People%20are%20extremely%20responsively%20to%20even%20slight%20whiffs%20of%20authority%20and%20respond%20to%20that%20role.) reached a similar conclusion. People told they are prison guards act like brutes. People told they are prisoners act like victims. This is true even when everyone knows it is just an act and people get very caught up in their roles. This instinct is at work in lawyers too, who, of course, aren't acting.\n\nOne can ask why, but the question has to be rooted in the knowledge that not colluding really is what happens not just 99% of the time, but 99\\.999999999% of the time.\n\nLawyers as a matter of psychology want to help their clients and identify very strongly with their clients. Yes, they could be punished for colluding with opposing counsel and would probably be disbarred at a minimum and might even go to prison for doing so, but that happens perhaps 100 times less frequently than, for example, simply stealing money held in trust for a client that actually belongs to a client.\n\nLawyers are much more likely to collude with their clients to illegally take advantage of an opposing party than they are to collude with opposing counsel to the disadvantage of their client for their own benefit.\n\nNow, often lawyers do have to do things that their clients don't like. For example, in a civil case, if a lawyer knows that his client has a damaging document, the lawyer will often have to get the client to hand it over to the other side as part of the disclosure and discovery process in order to play by the rules. \n\nAnd, often, lawyers will push their clients to accept a settlement because the lawyers believe that it is in their client's best interest, but that their client is an idiot who is too emotional to realize this fact (and this is not gender specific \\- lawyers have lots of male clients who act like idiots for emotional reasons and have to be talked at length into sanity).\n\nThis probably isn't globally universal. I'm sure that there are one or two remote corners of this kind of lawyer corruption in the United States (probably in the rural Deep South, or Appalachia), and I'm sure that there are some countries where this happens somewhere in the world.

The answer draws from the discussion of role identification and the Milgram experiment, highlighting that lawyers strongly identify with their clients' interests. This psychological alignment is presented as more influential than potential punishments (A), practical difficulties (C), or alternative unethical behaviors (D).

The policy of not making it generally available in the U.S. was hardened into law in the [Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1972](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-86/pdf/STATUTE-86-Pg489.pdf), saying\n\n> Any such information (other than \"Problems of Communism\" which may continue to be sold by the Government Printing Office) shall not be disseminated within the United States, its territories, or possessions, but, on request, shall be available in the English language at the Department of State, at all reasonable times following its release as information abroad, for examination only by representatives of United States press associations, newspapers, magazines, radio systems, and stations, and by research students and scholars, and, on request, shall be made available for examination only to Members of Congress.\n\nSubsequent tweaks carved out many exceptions for other specific content, and arranged for deposition of material in the National Archives. In 1985, [a new provision](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-99/pdf/STATUTE-99-Pg405.pdf#page=27) was inserted to say that apart from certain enumerated exceptions,\n\n> no funds authorized to be appropriated to the United States\n> Information Agency shall be used to influence public opinion in the\n> United States, and no program material prepared by the United\n> States Information Agency shall be distributed within the United\n> States.\n\nThe developing statute law reflects a balance of concerns; it was felt that Americans *should know* what their government is saying to foreign audiences, but *should not be the target* of that official messaging. These additional provisions are not a departure from the position of 1948, so much as they are trying to set out the boundaries more clearly in the light of experience.\n\nThe 2013 law, codified within [22 U.S.C. \u00a71461\\-1464b](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-18/subchapter-V), made some changes to the domestic regime. It authorizes post\\-2013 material to be made generally available to the U.S. public *on request*, potentially subject to a fee: there is no longer a requirement that the requestor has to be a scholar/journalist/etc. It also amends the \"no domestic distribution\" section to account for that change. The bar on influencing domestic political opinion remains, as can be seen from the current codification.\n\nThe present situation is that much post\\-2013 material is available online (which is \"on request\", in that you have to go to the appropriate website). There is [a system](https://www.insidevoa.com/p/5719.html) for requesting permission to reuse this material, including within the U.S.; for example, you might do this if you were making a documentary and wanted to show some VoA footage. Per [policy](https://www.usagm.gov/wp-content/media/2013/11/2-160-Domestic-Distribution-of-Program-Materials.pdf), there is a possibility for providing\n\n> program materials, prepared for dissemination abroad, to domestic broadcasters aimed at foreign diaspora communities as part of the Agency's foreign policy mission.\n\nSubject to various criteria, this allows broadcasting material within the U.S., not by the federal government itself but by some commercial organization \\- if that is still compliant with the prohibition on influencing domestic political opinion, based on the way the material is used. The broadcaster is also obliged to credit the producing agency, so it should be reasonably clear when a video segment (for example) has this origin.\n\nIn answer to the question \"Does H.R. 4310 allow the US government to use propaganda against citizens?\", the situation is something like: it makes it possible for a third party to rebroadcast existing foreign\\-targeted propaganda for a domestic audience, in certain circumstances.

Or in other words, could identifying myself as Single as opposed to a divorcee incur any type of liability of which I should be aware?\n\n### Since you specified the financial and medical contexts, yes, sometimes it is mandatory to disclose that you are divorced.\n\n*Any time your signature is involved, be as accurate as the form allows.* The worst consequence I can think of is actually pretty bad (\"penalty of perjury\" is no joke, and whether or not it *should*, divorce *does* impact a surprising number of especially financial considerations.) If possible, it would be better to simply not answer at all than to sign off on something other than the most accurate option available.\n\nIn these contexts, the designation as having been divorced is often an archaic throwback predating no\\-fault.\n\nFor example, divorce adversely impacts your credit (more than the loss of a partner's presumed earning power, the reasoning here is basically that marriage was a long\\-term commitment you entered into willingly that was not fulfilled.) Jobs or employment opportunities demanding a very high degree of personal integrity may be negatively impacted by having, or having had a divorce, by the same reasoning (the examples that pop to mind are officers the military, depending on the career field.) Divorce can be interpreted as an indication that the individual in question is currently not as stable in their personal life and affairs (moving, figuring out joint custody, jealous/vindictive ex, etc.) as a prospective lender or employer requires.\n\nAs far as healthcare is concerned, it can have an impact on health care services and how providers interact with you, your ex, etc. (for example, your child's pediatrician.) Having had a divorce can be a flag to health care provider to screen for depression, anxiety, blood pressure, and so forth; likewise, insurance companies consider divorce a \"major life event\" that qualifies you to change your coverage out\\-of\\-season (I don't know, but wouldn't be surprised if divorce somehow impacted your rates because of statistical increased risk of specific ailments.)\n\nFurthermore, there can be far\\-reaching implications for others \\- how long you were married determines whether or not social security benefits are conferred to a surviving spouse, for example, or calculating your kid's FAFSA in five or ten or fifteen years.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, in which of the following situations would it be most crucial for a divorced individual to accurately disclose their marital status as \"divorced\" rather than \"single\"?\n\nA) When signing up for a gym membership\nB) When creating a social media account\nC) When applying for a new job that requires a high level of personal integrity\nD) When filling out a form to join a local community group\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the information states that \"Jobs or employment opportunities demanding a very high degree of personal integrity may be negatively impacted by having, or having had a divorce.\" This implies that accurately disclosing one's divorced status is particularly important in such job applications. \n\nOption A is incorrect because gym memberships are mentioned as an example where precise marital status is less crucial.

[This circular](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ61.pdf) describes the process (it's tailored to registering computer programs). You submit the source code in an accepted format (PDF, and others are said to be listed \"online\"). There is a list of conditions relevant to how much you must provide (for example if the code contains trade secrets. [This document](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap1500/ch1500-deposits.pdf) covers deposits, i.e. the copies of the work, and \u00a71509\\.1(C) is specific to computer programs. Read that section to determine what you have to submit. Look at \u00a71507\\.2 for specification of electronic deposit copies. At some point you will wonder about accepted formats: [this](https://www.copyright.gov/eco/help-file-types.html) is the currently accepted format list.\n\nIf you cannot figure it out given this, you do really need a lawyer: but it's not legally required that the application be submitted by a lawyer. There is an increased risk that you will mess up the application if you do it yourself, but the same is also true of paying your income tax, and people do manage on their own. For example, you do need to exploit the \"Limitation of Claim\" field, so that you do not attempt to claim copyright ownership of third party code.\n\nThe situation where two parties A and B both claim copyright ownership is a very complicated matter, briefly summarized [here](https://scottandscottllp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Litigating-Copyright-Infringement-Claims.pdf). Most typically, competing claims of ownership involve collaboration and get resolved in court (or by negotiation) after the fact. For example, A may think he owns the copyright because he wrote the code, but he was hired as an employee by B to write that code, and as a work for hire, B may actually own the copyright. But maybe A was an independent contractor who agreed to write some code and license it to B, and A is the copyright holder. If you are just talking about a case of code\\-poaching (B stole your thumb drive, saw the code, and registered it), when you litigate for infringement, you would present (in court) whatever evidence you have that *you* are the rightful copyright holder. Registration is a requirement for litigation and provides prima facie evidence \u2013 not irrefutable proof \u2013 of copyright ownership. The law does not specify a practical means of balancing the evidence in your favor, but surely there are technical ways of permanently encoding your name in the source code.\n\nIf I want to sue a person for infringement, I must register the copyright first. [17 USC 411](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411) says that\n\n> no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States\n>  work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the\n>  copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title\n\n\"United States work\" is defined [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101) \u2013 as a US citizen, anything I create is a US work.

The correct answer is C because in New York, unlike most other states, the Supreme Court is not the highest court but rather the system of trial courts for serious cases. The Court of Appeals is actually the highest court in New York, serving the role that a Supreme Court does in many other states. This arrangement can be confusing because it's contrary to the federal system and most state systems.

Most notably the Supreme Court of the United states at times has made rulings that were completely contrary to the existing laws and the constitution.

During negotiations the parties will take and express many different positions and put forward and receive, verbally and in writing, many offers and counter offers.

Prior negotiations are typically not admissible as evidence to contradict or supplement the terms of a signed, complete contract. The tenant would be bound by the terms of the document they signed, even if it differs from earlier negotiations, unless they can prove fraud in the execution (e.g., believing they were signing an entirely different document).

The court doesn't have to actually believe you. The court merely has to assume for sake of argument that the things said are true for the narrow purpose of evaluating whether they describe a legal wrong in a formal sense.\n\nAlso, under modern federal pleading rules in the U.S., the judge doesn't have to believe you and can dismiss your complaint if it is not \"plausible.\"\n\nYour attorney has a duty to not merely assume that everything that a client tells the lawyer is true. In federal court, the governing rule is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which states that when an attorney files and signs a document in court that the attorney:\n\n> certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and\n> belief, **formed after an inquiry reasonable under the\n> circumstances**:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) **it is not being presented for any improper purpose**, such as to\n> harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of\n> litigation;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by\n> existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying,\n> or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) **the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if\n> specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after\n> a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery**; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) **the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence\n> or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a\n> lack of information**.\n\nThe California state law obligations is more or less identical in substance, although the procedural rules of California are codified differently than the federal rules.\n\nSo, a lawyer is required to reasonably inquire into whether the client is telling the lawyer the truth about the client's motives and about the facts.

They must ensure that \"the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\" This means that attorneys cannot simply accept their clients' statements at face value without any critical evaluation or investigation. Option A is incorrect because blindly assuming all client statements are true violates the attorney's duty to the court.

The Freedom of Information Act provisions were initially part of a larger government reorganization bill in 1966 (80 Stat 383, PL 89-554) that created Title 5 of the U.S. Code.

Almost every state has a specific description of when this is permitted as part of their criminal code, usually in a general principles section at the beginning, or in the sections pertaining to crimes of violence.\n\nSome details vary from one state to another, but none of the facts presented in this hypothetical really push the envelope in terms of distinctions between one state's law and another. \n\nMost of the differences involve situations when the use of deadly force is allowed. For example, states differ regarding when deadly force allowed to prevent a burglary of your home or business which is in progress, particularly if it is possible to avoid a use of deadly force at all by retreating in a manner that puts you at no one at any significant risk of bodily injury. But, the scenario presented does not appear to involve the use of deadly force (although the definition of \"deadly force\" can be slippery and lead to some subtle variations in what is permitted from state to state).\n\nAnother common nuance of variation between states involves the circumstances under which physical force or deadly physical force is authorized to make a citizens arrest, but this situation is also not implicated by your hypothetical. Once Thug is beat up, the scenario ends without any effort to detain Thug until the police arrive.\n\nGenerally speaking, a defense of others defense that justifies a use of force under criminal law will also not give rise to civil liability in a lawsuit for assault and battery as opposed to a criminal prosecution for it.\n\n**A Sample Defense Of Others Statute**\n\nThe pertinent section of the Colorado Revised Statutes (2016\\), strongly influenced by the language of the Model Penal Code (which never adopted in full by any state but highly influential stylistically in how U.S. criminal codes are drafted) is very typical of the majority rule regarding the defense of others and reads as follows (emphasizing the language relevant to the scenario in the question):\n\n> \u00a7 18\\-1\\-704\\. Use of physical force in defense of a person\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Except as provided in subsections (2\\) and (3\\) of this section, **a\n>  person is justified in using physical force upon another person in\n>  order to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably\n>  believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by\n>  that other person, and he may use a degree of force which he\n>  reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose.**\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Deadly physical force may be used only if a person reasonably\n>  believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate and: (a) The actor has\n>  reasonable ground to believe, and does believe, that he or another\n>  person is in imminent danger of being killed or of receiving great\n>  bodily injury; or (b) The other person is using or reasonably appears\n>  about to use physical force against an occupant of a dwelling or\n>  business establishment while committing or attempting to commit\n>  burglary as defined in sections 18\\-4\\-202 to 18\\-4\\-204 ; or (c) The\n>  other person is committing or reasonably appears about to commit\n>  kidnapping as defined in section 18\\-3\\-301 or 18\\-3\\-302, robbery as\n>  defined in section 18\\-4\\-301 or 18\\-4\\-302, sexual assault as set forth\n>  in section 18\\-3\\-402, or in section 18\\-3\\-403 as it existed prior to\n>  July 1, 2000, or assault as defined in sections 18\\-3\\-202 and 18\\-3\\-203\\.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1\\) of this section,\n>  **a person is not justified in using physical force if: (a) With intent\n>  to cause bodily injury or death to another person, he provokes the use\n>  of unlawful physical force by that other person; or (b) He is the\n>  initial aggressor; except that his use of physical force upon another\n>  person under the circumstances is justifiable if he withdraws from the\n>  encounter and effectively communicates to the other person his intent\n>  to do so, but the latter nevertheless continues or threatens the use\n>  of unlawful physical force;** or (c) The physical force involved is the\n>  product of a combat by agreement not specifically authorized by law.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) In a case in which the defendant is not entitled to a jury\n>  instruction regarding self\\-defense as an affirmative defense, the\n>  court shall allow the defendant to present evidence, when relevant,\n>  that he or she was acting in self\\-defense.

However, the self\\-defense law instruction\n>  shall not be an affirmative defense instruction and the prosecuting\n>  attorney shall not have the burden of disproving self\\-defense. This\n>  section shall not apply to strict liability crimes.\n\n**Analysis of the Hypothetical Facts**\n\n> Is Paul guilty of assault and battery for attacking Thug, or would\n>  self\\-defense or some other standard defense apply?\n\nPaul is probably not guilty of assault and battery for attacking Thug because a defense of others defense justifies his actions.\n\nPaul is using physical force to defend a third person (and presumably himself as well once once he is involved in the fray) from what he reasonably believes to be the use of unlawful physical force by Thug, and generally, under those circumstances Paul may use a degree of force which Paul reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose. \n\nPaul is most vulnerable in this scenario on the question of whether he reasonably believed that the degree of force he used was reasonably necessary for the purpose of defending Emily and himself from Thug's unlawful use of physical force, or whether he went further than what was reasonably necessary for a few minutes that left Thug \"incapacitated and thoroughly bloodied\".\n\nFor example, suppose that Paul had already caused Thug to try to flee the scene after the first minute at which point Thug was slightly bruised and afraid of Paul, but was not at all incapacitated. But, suppose that despite this fact that Paul, awash with adrenaline from the fight, continued to pummel Thug for a couple more minutes as Thug repeatedly tried to flee the scene only to be dragged back by Paul. Suppose that Paul continued the fight after it was no longer necessary because Paul wanted to punish Thug for his mistreatment of Emily and to discourage other people from trying to attack Emily in the future, even after Paul knew that there was already no real risk that Thug himself would continue to use unlawful physical force against Emily no or in the near future. \n\nUnder these circumstances, which aren't inconsistent with the hypothetical facts, if this extra couple of minutes caused Thug to be much more badly injured than he otherwise would have been if Thug had been allowed to flee after the first minute, then Paul could still be guilty of assault and battery, even though his actions were legally justified for the first minute of the fight.\n\nThere is no indication that either Paul or Emily provoked the attack on Emily, or that either Paul or Emily was the initial aggressor, or that this was actually a pre\\-agreed dueling situation. So each of these circumstances which would be exceptions to the general rule that the defense of others is justified do not apply to this case.\n\nThere is likewise no indication that Paul used \"deadly force\" as opposed to mere \"physical force\" in handling the situation. It is likely that Paul would have committed a crime if he had shot and killed Thug instead of beating him up, if Paul knew perfectly well at the time that he was capable of beating up Thug and making Thug go away for good as a result without resorting to a firearm, unless the attack on Emily was severe enough for Paul to reasonably believe that the attack was putting Emily at a real risk of serious bodily injury.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Paul intervenes to defend Emily from an assault by Thug. Which of the following scenarios is LEAST likely to be protected under the \"defense of others\" justification?\n\nA) Paul uses physical force against Thug, causing minor injuries, until Thug stops attacking Emily and retreats.\n\nB) Paul continues to beat Thug for several minutes after Thug has stopped attacking Emily and is trying to flee, causing severe injuries.\n\nC) Paul uses a degree of force he reasonably believes is necessary to stop Thug's attack on Emily, resulting in Thug being incapacitated.\n\nD) Paul intervenes immediately upon seeing Thug attack Emily, using physical force to pull Thug away and restrain him until police arrive.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is least likely to be protected under the \"defense of others\" justification because it involves Paul continuing to use force after the threat to Emily has ended and Thug is attempting to flee. This goes beyond what is reasonably necessary for defense and could be seen as retaliatory or excessive force. Options A, C, and D all describe scenarios where Paul's use of force is more proportionate to the threat and ends when the threat does, making them more likely to be justified under the defense of others doctrine."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48067/is-statement-of-objectives-of-a-bill-considered-part-of-the-law", "docs_id": 48067, "title": "Is statement of objectives of a bill considered part of the law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want know if the law is just the clauses and sections of the constitution or does it also expand to the statement of objectives of a bill as well. \nI am asking this with regard to the recent unrest caused after the introduction of Citizenship Amendment Bill of India which has now turned into an Act. \nThe government has said that this bill is supposed to grant citizenship to illegal immigrants who have been persecuted and belong to certain minority communities of their original country.

How much paperwork does he have to fill out?\n\nIf the person is on the autopsy table, while he may have technically been legally dead, the person's death certificate has probably not even been issued yet, since normally an autopsy is done, in part, to determine a cause of death for purposes of preparing a death certificate.\n\nNormally, an autopsy is only prepared when the cause of death is uncertain or needs to be documented for legal reasons (e.g. an accidental or potentially criminal death or one that is just unexplained), and the need for one postpones the preparation of a death certificate. If the cause of death is self\\-evident and there is no indication of foul play, an autopsy isn't done and the preparation of a death certificate proceeds more quickly.\n\nIn other words, while he may be \"legally\" dead (defined as discontinuation of the function of certain bodily processes like brain activity and heartbeat and breathing), he very likely isn't yet \"bureaucratically\" dead.\n\nYou can be \"legally\" dead days before anyone even discovers that you have died, with the time of your death determined only retroactively, but that doesn't have any practical effect until someone discovers it and it makes its way through the bureaucratic and court process.\n\nIt takes a few days after a death for a probate proceeding to establish death, heirship and the validity of any will (many states have a 120 hour minimum waiting period after a date of death and most autopsies are within 72 hours). Even if a probate proceeding had been commenced, a simple affidavit or notice that someone was not, in fact, dead would cause the case to be summarily dismissed and it is unlikely that much would have happened in the court process since then.\n\nWith older people, one of the fastest agencies to act is the Social Security Administration discontinuing benefits. But a younger person wouldn't have gotten those to start with, so that wouldn't be a factor.\n\nLife insurance companies normally won't pay until a final post\\-autopsy death certificate with cause of death is in place (so they can look for fraud in the life insurance application relative to the cause of death stated).\n\nIt would be very usual for a landlord to take action sooner than the month after learning of the death, and often the estate will keep in a lease in force much longer. Next of kin may have removed some valuables prior to any official declaration, and while most people would promptly return them upon learning of the \"mistake\", a few items might not be recovered.\n\nThe final death certificate would probably never be prepared. A preliminary death certificate might be quashed as erroneous and not filed with the Vital Statistics Department of the State Department of Health, by the preparing party, through a simple, oral, in office instruction to the person in the coroner's office who handles those filings.\n\nSince there isn't a formal judicial declaration of death or a final death certificate, simply informing an agency or person that received a preliminary notice that it was in error, perhaps by letter or email, would suffice.

Within 72 hours of apparent death, it's unlikely that a final death certificate has been issued, especially if an autopsy was planned. The coroner's office typically has the ability to quash a preliminary death certificate before it's officially filed if they discover an error. Options A and B are incorrect because these processes usually take longer than 72 hours, especially for a young person without a will.

He touched on the things that we were told to leave at home. I asked whether a paperback novel was allowed or not, and he said that there isn't enough spare time in six months of boot camp to finish a book. It may seem, from the outside, that disallowing a novel is an unreasonable abridgement of your rights, but the actual effect on you is minimal.

The Secretary of DHS has authority to establish rules, and has recently done so [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/23/2019-15710/designating-aliens-for-expedited-removal). The current regulations pertaining to expedited removal are at [8 CFR 253\\.3](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c57508ef4cccfe5bb518ac20feef57e1&node=8:1.0.1.2.28.0.1.3&rgn=div8). There is no exemption for people being medically treated, for covid\\-19 or any other reason, but \"parole\" is available (at the discretion of the attorney general) to \"parole\" an immigrant if it is \"is required to meet a medical emergency\".

According to the information provided, ICE does have the authority to arrest and potentially deport illegal immigrants, even those who have received medical care for COVID-19. However, the Attorney General has the discretion to grant \"parole\" in cases of medical emergencies.

This is a change to [Federal Law 5/2012](http://ejustice.gov.ae/downloads/latest_laws/cybercrimes_5_2012_en.pdf), replacing Article 9 (the translation into English is odd because the verb phrase goes first). The level of the penalty has increased (minimum 150K \u2192 minimum 500K; maximum 500K \u2192 2M). Incarceration is changed from \"imprisonment\" to \"temporary imprisonment\", which might mean that previously the term was life. In either case, they have an \"and\" problem that the punishment is \"(temporary) imprisonment **and** a fine ... **or either** of these two penalties\". Presumably the Arabic version is dispositive.\n\nApart from that, the new version of the law identifies the offender as\n\n> Whoever uses a fraudulent computer network protocol address (IP\n>  address) by using a false address or a third\\-party address by any\n>  other means for the purpose of committing a crime or preventing its\n>  discovery\n\nwhereas the old law only said\n\n> whoever uses a fraudulent computer network protocol address by using a\n>  false address or a third\\-party address by any other means for the\n>  purpose of committing a crime or preventing its discovery.\n\nThus the meaning of \"computer network protocol address\" is defined as being equivalent to \"IP address\".\n\nIn other words, there is no substantive change beyond the stiffer penalty.

One for each family member. Once referred to the Refugee Status Branch, you will need to submit a written statement explaining the experiences and circumstances that form the basis of your refugee status claim. About 4 weeks later, youll be invited to an interview with the Refugee and Protection Officer.

Examples of useful documents to bring include: passport, ID cards, birth certficates, marriage certificates, school and military ID cards. If documents are in another language, you will need certified translations of them. Within 3 weeks of this interview, youll be issued the Interview Report, written by the officer, and you will have three weeks to comment on that and submit more documentation, if necessary. The officer assesses whether your statemtents are truthful and credible and whether your claim meets the criteria contained in Article 1A(2\\) of the Refugee Convention or if you are eligible for protected person status (see below).

It does note that one will not be considered \u201clacking protection of the country of nationality if, without any valid reason based on well0founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national.\u201d\n\nFinally, should your circumstances not be fit for asylum, you may consider seeking protection uner the United Nations Convention Against Torture ([http://www.nolo.com/legal\\-encyclopedia/how\\-apply\\-convention\\-against\\-torture\\-protection.html](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-apply-convention-against-torture-protection.html)). The requirements to meet are higher than for asylum and the relief is more limited, but if you qualify, the country must admit you and certain things that would bar you from being granted asylum, wont bar you from being granted protected status. One example of a bar to refugee status is being \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in another country, for example. To quality for CAT protection, you have to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that you would be subjected to torture if returned to the country you are fleeing.

Thus the statement in the question that:\n\n> subsection (4\\) of the bill purports to criminalize transporting a minor out of state (to neighboring Oregon, say) for the provision of such treatment.\n\nis incorrect.\n\nNotice that section 4 is not new, nor is it modified (except by changing th4e section number) by the current bill. My understanding is that the travel ban was, when it was passed, aimed at families who took female children outside the US, to African or Middle\\-eastern countries, for traditional rites that include FGM. This was done by a significant number of people with ethnic origins in such countries, and a number of US states passed laws banning such travel. This law, before the house bill, was one such law. The recent bill added \"gender affirming care\" into the law, by calling it another form of genital mutilation.\n\nHowever, for purposes of discussion, let us assume that subsection (4\\) is changed to refer to subsections (1\\) **or** (2\\), thus making the question correct.\n\nRight to Travel\n---------------\n\nThe right to travel from one state to another is a basic right under the US constitution.\n\nThe LII page on [\"Interstate Travel\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/interstate-travel) refers to it as: \"a right venerable for its longevity, but still lacking a clear doctrinal basis.\"\n\nSee the Wikipedia article [Freedom of movement under United States law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law)\n\nThe right to travel was recognized early on, in the case of [*Corfield v.

This case was decided by Justice Bushrod Washington, a member of the US Supreme Court, but it was decided while he was acting in his role as circuit judge, not by the Supreme Court as a whole.\n\nIn that decision, Justice Washington included \"The right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to reside in any other state, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise;\" as one of the \"privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states\" which are guaranteed to all citizens. This passage has been influential, although not undisputed, in interpreting the \"privileges and immunities clause\" of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn [*Crandall v. Nevada*, 73 U.S. 35 (1868\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crandall_v._Nevada) The Supreme Court held that the right to travel between states was fundamental, and that a state could not impede it by taxing the exit of people from one state to travel into another.\n\nSubsequent cases have deemed the right to travel protected against state restrictions both under the privileges and immunities clause, and under the commerce clause. In [*United States v. Guest*, 383 U.S. 745 (1966\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/745/) at 383 U.S. 757 the Court wrote:\n\n> The constitutional right to travel from one State to another, and necessarily to use the highways and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce in doing so, occupies a position fundamental to the concept of our Federal Union. It is a right that has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized.\n\nThe *Guest* court goes on to cite *Crandall v. Nevada*, 6 Wall. 35, (the case in which a tax on those leaving the state was overturned) and the *Passenger Cases*, 7 How. 283, 48 U. S. 492 in which Chief Justice Taney wrote:\n\n> We are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States.\"\n\nAll this would mean that a law prohibiting travel would need strong justification, and is probably subject to ***strict scrutiny***, a standard of review requiring a \"compelling governmental interest\" and a \"narrowly drawn\" law.\n\nMedical Judgement\n-----------------\n\nThe bill declares that procedures to \"change or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex\" are \"never necessary\", any medical opinion to the contrary notwithstanding. Such an override of qualified medical opinion might be hard to justify in a criminal law.\n\nCivil Rights\n------------\n\nIn [*BOSTOCK v. CLAYTON COUNTY, GEORGIA* 590 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020\\) \\#17\u20131618](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf) the Subreme court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\. prohibits **employment** discrimination against homosexual or transgender individuals, writing:\n\n> Because discrimination on the basis of homosexuality or transgender\n> status requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex, an employer who intentionally penalizes an employee for being homosexual or transgender also violates\n> Title VII.\n\nThis rule may well carry over to other areas of the law.\n\nEqual Protection Clause\n-----------------------\n\nThe [Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause#Sex,_disability,_and_sexual_orientation) reads\n\n> nor \\[shall any state] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nTreating members groups differently because of group membership is often, but not always, an equal protection violation.

Clayton County\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) While the Commerce Clause could potentially be relevant, it's not the strongest argument here. The law primarily deals with individual rights rather than interstate commerce.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. The right to travel between states is a fundamental right recognized by the Supreme Court in multiple cases, including Crandall v. Nevada and United States v. Guest. Laws restricting interstate travel are subject to strict scrutiny and require a compelling government interest to be upheld.\n\nC) While the Equal Protection Clause could be relevant, especially regarding discrimination against transgender individuals, it's not as directly applicable as the right to interstate travel in this scenario.\n\nD) The Bostock v.

The company's notification to the user that they are investigating their account for potential legal action is similar to how law enforcement might handle potential criminal activity. This serves as a warning to the user about their behavior and allows them to be aware of possible consequences.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company's action does not necessarily constitute illegal intimidation. They are within their rights to investigate suspicious activity on their platform.\n\nOption B is false because investigations often precede any determination of guilt. In fact, investigations are typically conducted to determine if there is evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nOption D is incorrect because companies have a responsibility to monitor and investigate potentially illegal or policy-violating activities on their platforms, even if these activities don't directly harm the company itself.\n\nThe analogy provided in the documentation, comparing this situation to a shop warning a potential shoplifter, supports the idea that the company's action is a reasonable and legal way to address potential misconduct."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1841/are-pictures-that-dont-have-model-releases-protected-under-the-dmca", "docs_id": 1841, "title": "Are pictures that don&#39;t have model releases protected under the DMCA?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say a user of my website posted a picture.

Copyright belongs to the photographer, not the subject of the photo. However, right of publicity is a separate issue, typically governed by state laws, and is not covered by DMCA protections. Therefore, while the website owner is likely protected from copyright claims under the DMCA (assuming they comply with its requirements), they may still be vulnerable to a right of publicity claim from the celebrity. Option A is incorrect because DMCA doesn't cover right of publicity. Option C is wrong because DMCA protection doesn't depend on who makes the claim.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll answer the following questions, which hopefully give you a good idea of your situation:\n\n1. If you use vtd\\-xml (which uses a GPL license), must your product also use gpl?\n\nYes. You can still sell your product, but it will automatically use gpl.\n\n2. What does it mean if your product uses gpl?\n\nIf your product is being publicly distributed (sold, offered to the public as a free download, etc) then you must make it open source. This doesn't mean you have to have a link to your product's source code available on your website, but if it is requested by someone you must be able to send them a copy of your source code\n\nIf your product isn't being publicly distributed (e.g only used by yourself or inside your own company) then you don't have to make your code open source. But obviously you can't sell your code if you don't distribute it.\n\nNote that this is what the current court battle described in [https://opensource.com/law/14/7/lawsuit\\-threatens\\-break\\-new\\-ground\\-gpl\\-and\\-software\\-licensing\\-issues](https://opensource.com/law/14/7/lawsuit-threatens-break-new-ground-gpl-and-software-licensing-issues) is about. Ximpleware argues that ameriprise are distributing a product, and therefore needs to make their code open source due to the copyleft requirement of the gpl\n\n3. You want to sell your product, but not make it open source. What do you do?\n\nYou need to contact ximpleware and buy a commercial license to use their code. (their homepage has contact details for this). After that, you are free to use their code and not have to make your application open source\n\n4. You want to sell your product, not make it open source, but also not buy a commercial license from Ximpleware. What do you do?\n\nYou can theoretically make a piece of independant code, sell it, and give instructions for your users to download Ximpleware's code and incorporate it into your program. This is quite a roundabout way, and potentially a legal grey area (since I can see Ximpleware arguing that people would do this to avoid making their programs open source or paying for a commercial license, but this is probably a problem that you won't have to face unless Ximpleware finds it financially worth it to sue your company for, and even then it's a difficult case)\n\nOverall, buying a commercial license from ximplewar would be the most \"cleanest way\" to go about things, but as it stands I don't think there is anything illegal with selling your software and requiring clients to download vtd\\-xml separately", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company wants to use vtd-xml, which is licensed under GPL, in their commercial product.

Using GPL-licensed software in a commercial product requires the entire product to be open-source under GPL terms.\nB) Correct. Purchasing a commercial license from Ximpleware allows the company to use vtd-xml in their product without the GPL restrictions, enabling them to keep their source code closed.\nC) Incorrect. While this would comply with GPL terms, it doesn't meet the requirement of keeping the source code closed.\nD) Incorrect. This would violate the GPL license and could lead to legal issues.\n\nThe best approach for a company wanting to use vtd-xml in a commercial product while keeping their source code closed is to purchase a commercial license from Ximpleware.
