There are various limits on in kind payments around the world, including the US. Very generally, in kind payments are only allowed for particular industries and occupations, only allowed up to a certain dollar value, and only allowed as a certain fraction of the employee's wages. Furthermore, the value of the benefit can't exceed the actual cost to the employer \\- a meal that's priced at $7\\.25 on the menu is sold at a profit, and would be worth less than the menu price as in kind remuneration.\n\nSo, given the scenario described, a restaurant employer could not replace 100% of their employee's wages with food sold for the same amount. It's too high a percentage of the wage paid as in kind payment, and the menu price equivalent of the wage would not have sufficient in kind value.\n\nA more detailed description of in kind payment laws can be found [here](https://www.globallivingwage.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/in-kind-payment-laws-peri.pdf). It's a rather long document that's not particularly well\\-organized, and is structured by describing various aspects of law in different geographic locations, rather than describing all aspects of the law in a location\\-specific manner.

This arrangement violates U.S. labor laws as it exceeds the allowed percentage for in-kind payments and uses menu prices instead of cost prices.\nB) Incorrect. While this uses cost pricing, 25% is likely still too high a percentage for in-kind payments in most U.S. jurisdictions.\nC) Incorrect. Paying 100% of wages in goods is not permitted under U.S. labor laws.\nD) Correct. This option provides in-kind benefits as a bonus on top of full cash wages, which is generally permissible under U.S. labor laws. It doesn't replace any portion of the required cash wages and is a relatively small amount, making it the most likely to be legal."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5707/are-juries-able-to-ask-questions-during-a-trial", "docs_id": 5707, "title": "Are juries able to ask questions during a trial?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One thing I keep seeing on TV crime dramas like *Law and Order* is that the defense and prosecution ask questions of those at the bench for the sake of the jury, at times trying to trigger emotional responses to sway a jury's opinion (i.e. trying to get an accused to lose their temper). However, I have never really seen a juror ask someone at the bench a question.\n\nIn a recent Australian case in which the convicted murder's appeal was granted for a lighter sentence the judge commented that\n\n> the jury could not properly have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the element of intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm had been proved.\n\nGiven this case was about a man who killed his wife (and I have also forgotten some of the facts about the case), when I heard about this I thought \"did the jury not think that when you pick up any weapon you have to be fully aware you can take a person's life or do grievous bodily harm with it?\"\n\nBut then I remembered that in the crime dramas I have seen (probably not a good idea to assume this is how trials work in the real world), the defense and prosecution may not have revealed to the jury when the murder weapon was picked up and the state of mind of the accused moments before said weapon was picked up, tiny facts which on the surface may not mean a lot.\n\nSo I am wondering: are juries able to ask questions of those on the bench during a trial? If not, why aren't they, considering that it's the jury who ends up deciding if the accused is innocent or guilty?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, while Law and Order should not be taken as an accurate depiction of a New York trial, it *especially* should not be taken as an accurate depiction of an Australian trial. Australian law, while it has some major similarities with US law (both ultimately derive from the law of England), is not US law. With procedural matters (such as \"may jurors ask questions of witnesses\"), it can potentially differ from court to court.\n\nIn general, jurors may not simply ask a witness a question. The jury's job is not to investigate and figure out if the defendant was guilty or not; it's to evaluate the cases presented by each side. US (and Australian, as far as I know) courts use what's known as the adversarial model, where the prosecution and the defense both present the best cases they can and a neutral third party decides which case was stronger. In a US criminal trial, the state is expected to justify why someone should be in jail; the jury shouldn't be helping them justify it. This isn't how all jurisdictions around the world work, but it's how the US does.\n\nOne concern with juror questions is that it has the risk that the juror will not be impartial. Jurors are not supposed to get into arguments with witnesses, or to go after them to try to prove a point. In your case, the juror might be introducing an entirely different line of reasoning from the one either side is presenting, and that's simply not their job. People have raised the concern that a juror thinking up questions might be deciding the case before they hear all the evidence, and might give too much weight to the answers to their own questions (or read a lot into it if a question is denied).\n\nThere are also rules on what questions may be legally asked; lawyers know these and jurors generally don't, which is why jurors may almost never directly ask a question to a witness. Where they can ask questions, it's virtually always *written* questions, which the judge reviews, gives to both sides to see if anyone objects, and then reads to the witness in a neutral tone.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of jury procedures in adversarial legal systems like those in the US and Australia, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding jurors asking questions during a trial?\n\nA) Jurors are encouraged to ask questions directly to witnesses to help them better understand the case.\nB) Jurors may ask questions at any time, but only to the judge, who will then decide whether to relay the question to a witness.\nC) Jurors are generally not allowed to ask questions, as their role is to evaluate the cases presented by the prosecution and defense, not to investigate.\nD) Jurors must submit written questions to the bailiff, who will then ask the witness on their behalf.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In adversarial legal systems like those in the US and Australia, jurors are generally not allowed to ask questions during a trial. This is because:\n\n1. The jury's role is to evaluate the cases presented by each side, not to investigate or gather additional information.\n2. Allowing jurors to ask questions could risk their impartiality, as they might become argumentative or biased based on their own line of questioning.\n3. Jurors typically lack knowledge of legal rules regarding admissible questions, which could lead to procedural issues.\n4. There's a concern that jurors might give too much weight to answers to their own questions or decide the case prematurely.\n\nWhile some jurisdictions may allow written questions from jurors in certain circumstances, these are usually filtered through the judge and lawyers before potentially being asked. Options A and B are incorrect as they suggest a more active questioning role for jurors than is typically allowed. Option D, while closer to some allowed practices, is not the standard procedure and oversimplifies the process of juror questions in the few instances where they might be permitted."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61261/uk-what-information-are-the-police-legally-required-to-collect-when-going-door", "docs_id": 61261, "title": "UK: What information are the police legally required to collect when going door-to-door, and why?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A few days ago, a police officer knocked on my door in the evening and asked whether I had noticed any disturbances in my street earlier in the day \\- he said it was in relation to reports that they'd had, and were investigating.\n\nI informed him that I hadn't noticed anything, and he then asked whether I had been at home at the time of the disturbance, and what I was doing at that time, as well as taking my name and date of birth.\n\nWhat are the reasons/ legal requirements that the police might need my personal information, given that I had not been able to provide any further information/ witness testimony to the incident that they were investigating?\n\nI would understand the need to collect it had I been able to provide any further information regarding the incident, or been asked to provide a witness statement, but given I hadn't been able to, what would the legal reasons be for them to collect/ hold this information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **What are the reasons/ legal requirements that the police might need my personal information, given that I had not been able to provide any further information/ witness testimony to the incident that they were investigating?**\n\nThe police in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") have a duty to undertake reasonable lines of enquiry and to carry out a proportionate investigation in to allegations of crime.\n\nNo\\-one is legally obliged to answer [house to house](https://www.app.college.police.uk/app-content/investigations/investigative-strategies/house-to-house-enquiries/#providing-reassurance)\u00a0questions but, notwithstanding the honesty and integrity of the majority of members of the public, any information held by the police may need to be corroborated to identify or eliminate suspects, witnesses, evidential opportunities or other lines of enquiry.\n\nAlso, if it is established that someone has no information that may assist the investigation this is recorded to prevent duplication of effort thus enabling the police to focus their resources accordingly.\n\nAll the while complying with the relevant privacy and data retention legislation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A police officer is conducting a house-to-house inquiry regarding a reported disturbance.

If the obligation is imposed by contract rather than by a statute or regulation, the term \"frustration of purpose\" is also frequently used. Even more generally, a situation like this is called a \"dilemma.\"\n\nMore obscurely, sometimes this gets litigated in the frame of whether non\\-compliance with the law was a voluntary act, i.e. the *[actus reus](https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/criminal-law/actus-reus/#:%7E:text=Actus%20reus%20is%20the%20Latin%20term%20used%20to%20describe%20a%20criminal%20act.&text=Actus%20reus%20is%20commonly%20defined,result%20of%20voluntary%20bodily%20movement.)* necessary to establish a prima facie case of a violation of a law imposing a criminal or quasi\\-criminal penalty. The \"choice of evils\" doctrine could also apply although this is a much narrower doctrine excusing liability than many people believe it to be.\n\nThere are also a couple of other possible outcomes.\n\nSometimes a court would treat this situations as an implied ambiguity or inconsistency in the law that calls for the court to interpret the true meaning of the statute or regulation. For example, in this circumstance, it is implausible that the statute or regulation was intended to put good faith vaccine distributors in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation where they would be fined no matter what they did because conforming to the law was impossible. So a court might conclude that the requirement that \"If you don't use up your vaccine doses, you're getting a huge fine\" contains an implied condition that this only applies if there are sufficient people who eligible to obtain the vaccination to use all of your vaccine doses (which as as matter of practicality is very likely to be true, so it is something of a false conflict as applied in most cases).\n\nBut it isn't at all uncommon for people to put themselves in situations where their on ill advised or wrongful conduct puts them in a position in which now, after their prior bad acts, anything they do will be a crime or a civil offense, and they are indeed damned if they do and damned if they don't.\n\nFor example, if you start to attempt to steal a car and see a baby in the back, you can either continue, and face kidnapping charges and car theft charges, or you can stop after you have already done enough to make you guilty of attempted car theft even if you abandon the crime at that point to prevent yourself for kidnapping the child. No matter what you do, you are stuck committing one crime or another. But you actions will determine which crime you will be guilty of committing. The fact that at the final moment of decision that determines which crime you will be guilty of, any choice you make will expose you to criminal liability, doesn't make these laws invalid, because this [Hobson's choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice#:%7E:text=A%20Hobson%27s%20choice%20is%20a,take%20it%20or%20leave%20it%22.)

According to contract law, the terms of a contract can only be changed if the contract itself provides for variation of its terms or if both parties agree to vary the contract. In this case, the original Kickstarter campaign outlined specific warranty terms that did not include processing fees. The company cannot unilaterally change these terms after the purchase has been made, as it constitutes a breach of the original agreement.

The standard statute of limitations for contract breaches in California is 4 years.

The statute of limitations for contract breaches in California (4 years) applies from the time of the alleged breach, regardless of the company's physical presence in the U.S. The fact that the Chinese company was operating in California by entering into a contract with a California resident means it was subject to California laws, including the statute of limitations. The company's lack of physical presence in the U.S. does not prevent it from being sued in a U.S. court, nor does it toll (pause) the statute of limitations.

The plans are to include:\n\n> (A) information regarding the manner and extent to which any insured\n> depository institution affiliated with the company is adequately\n> protected from risks arising from the activities of any nonbank\n> subsidiaries of the company;\n> \n> \n> (B) full descriptions of the ownership structure, assets, liabilities,\n> and contractual obligations of the company;\n> \n> \n> (C) identification of the cross\\-guarantees tied to different\n> securities, identification of major counterparties, and a process for\n> determining to whom the collateral of the company is pledged; and\n> \n> \n> (D) any other information that the Board of Governors and the\n> Corporation jointly require by rule or order.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has more information at [https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution\\-plans.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution-plans.htm), including the plans submitted by the banks.

The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 introduced the requirement for large bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies to create \"resolution plans,\" informally known as \"living wills.\" These plans are meant to provide a blueprint for how the institution could be dismantled in an orderly fashion if it were to fail, addressing the \"too big to fail\" problem.\n\nThe plans must include detailed information about the company's ownership structure, assets, liabilities, and contractual obligations, as well as how insured depository institutions are protected from risks arising from nonbank subsidiaries. This is precisely what option C describes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the plans are not about distributing assets to shareholders, but rather about ensuring an orderly resolution of the entire institution.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the plans are not about merging with other institutions, but about how the institution itself could be dismantled.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while deposit insurance exists (through the FDIC), it's not part of the \"living will\" requirement and is a separate mechanism altogether."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8417/can-the-details-of-estate-ownership-be-protected-by-attorney-client-privilege", "docs_id": 8417, "title": "Can the details of Estate-ownership be Protected by Attorney-Client Privilege?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *Title says it all.*\n\nI am curious about whether properties (physical as well as \"virtual estates\" i.e. domain\\-names) in the name of one's lawyer would be a viable alternative to \"proxy services\" who, for all intents and purposes, become owners of that which is in their name.

Attorney/Client Privilege covers information that you share with your client. Nothing else.

The lawyer would act as Managing Director, or CEO or whatever but you would own all the shares.

According to the information provided, if a client puts their attorney's name as the owner of their property, they have effectively sold or transferred ownership to the attorney. This arrangement is not protected by attorney-client privilege, which only covers information shared between attorney and client, not actual property ownership. \n\nOption A is incorrect because attorney-client privilege does not extend to property ownership arrangements. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the lawyer cannot legally hold the properties in their name while the client retains true ownership - this would be a form of misrepresentation.\n\nOption D, while potentially a way to achieve some privacy, is not the most accurate answer to the specific situation described in the question.

If a $10,000 forgiveness is announced, is there a basis for a class action lawsuit against the Federal Government?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have no injury and so no basis for a suit, unless your claim is that the educational institutions you attended were fraudulent (in which case you'd most likely sue them, or try to petition the government for existing relief procedures for such cases). Since you don't, you have no injury.\n\nAll parties entered their loans under the understanding that paying them off was necessary and potentially long term and arduous. The government forgiving amounts on existing loans does no injury to those who already paid. There is no injury in you having done what you agreed to do, in accordance with governing laws. Forgiving some debt for some people is just an act of executive largesse, and does not hurt you in any legally cognizable form.\n\nIndeed, it could be said that you have benefitted from having paid them off. For since doing so you have no longer been burdened by them, saving you both money and potential credit score or even legal issues, whereas those who still have debt are still so burdened. Plus paying them off yields benefits in your credit score and general loan worthiness; you can expect to have been able to get meaningfully better interest rates than someone identical to you but with substantial student debt.

According to the legal explanation provided, John has no basis for a lawsuit because he has not suffered a legally recognizable injury. The fact that he paid off his loans as agreed does not constitute harm in a legal sense. The government's decision to forgive loans for others does not retroactively injure those who have already paid their debts. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no basis for a class action lawsuit due to the lack of legal injury. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there's no indication of fraud by the educational institution, and even if there were, it would be a separate issue from the government's loan forgiveness program. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there is no legal requirement for the government to provide equal benefits to those who have already paid off their loans.\n\nThe key point is that fulfilling a previous obligation (paying off the loan) does not create a right to benefit from later policy changes, and is not considered a legal injury when others receive debt forgiveness."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73405/when-does-a-threat-become-a-crime", "docs_id": 73405, "title": "When does a threat become a crime?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is prompted by two cases:\n\n* [Richard Barnard](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/police-arrested-non-violent-palestine-activists-under-terror-legislation/) was charged with conspiracy to blackmail after saying he would go on a hunger strike against LaSalle Investment Management, the company from which Elbit Systems \\[Israeli arms company] rents its London office building, unless it evicted the arms manufacturer.\n* [Compound Labs](https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/01/compound_crypto_bug/) said they would dox recipients of their erroneous payout who did not repay 90% of said payout.\n\nAt first glance it would appear that both these are fairly similar, where an entity says they will take some legitimate action if another party does not take some other legal action.

This is standard practice for many service contracts, including domain registrations. The answer states that this is typically the case, and it would explain why the company feels justified in charging for the renewal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because disputing the charge may not be successful if the contract allows for automatic renewal.

The public defender declined to meet several times and told me he only get's the discovery evidence a day or two in advance. He was already assigned to me for a month. \n\nI had met with the prosecutor myself, before a public defender was assigned, trying to tell him the truth, but he refused to hear, even to take a 50 page document where I described all the harm this woman had done not only to me but to 5 other men (she's a sociopath and member of a cult, horribly deceiving people). You'd think he'd at least take it to use it against me. He said I have to pursue those criminal and civil issues separately from this case. THE SALIENT POINT FOR THIS QUESTION IS HE HAD THE DISCOVERY 1\\-2 MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME, NOTHING GOING TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER.\n\nIt turns out my public defender only got the discovery evidence the morning of the 1st pretrial, my court meeting at 1:30pm. And when I met with him at pre\\-trial, 1:30pm, he immediately intimidated me twice on first meeting \\-\\- with the discovery in his hand, he starting by saying \"these texts are despicable\", and then to my reply \"you have no idea what this woman did\", and he replying \"still, these texts are despicable.\" At that point I consciously or unconsciously realized this man would not help me, and \"folded\" and accepted one of the charges (no contests) \\-\\- charges very similar almost the same \\-\\- it appears prosecutors like to give you 2 charges so they can get you to accept one, and bypass the longer trial/judicial system.\n\nThe public defender says he regularly only gets discovery a day or two in advance, and in my case as I stated, only the morning of. Is this court misconduct?\n\nWondering how these public defenders are paid/incentivized, I asked the court multiples times to tell me how they pay their public defenders, and they refused to reply/comment.

Is this\n>  court misconduct?\n\nIt is a serious breach of substantive criminal law (it is called a *Brady* violation) not to turn over discovery prior to a plea or trial, and it is also an ethical violation not to do so.\n\nFailure to turn it over until a day or two before then, when it could have been made much sooner, is another question. The public defender could have insisted on a continuance, but that would have left open the possibility that the prosecutor would have withdrawn the prosecutor's offer.\n\nNothing that the public defender did appears to be misconduct.\n\nThe prosecutor is forbidden from communicating directly with you once the public defender is assigned as a matter of legal ethics. He isn't ignoring you because he is a jerk (maybe he or she also was a jerk, but this particular act of ignoring you doesn't reflect that).\n\nThe public defenders office probably could act collectively, or the ACLU or a similar entity might consider bringing a class action, to push for more than a day or two of advanced delivery of discovery from the prosecutors and might be able to convince a judge to change the prevailing custom. But, typically, public defenders are overworked as they are and wouldn't have much time in advance to look at the materials even if they were received sooner, so that is not a hill that they choose to die upon.\n\nPublic defenders routinely lack time to meet with their clients and time to really explain things properly. For what it is worth, some studies (I will update with a citations if I have time, but don't have it at hand) have shown that in terms of substantive conviction and sentencing outcome, that public defenders do no worse than much more expensive private criminal defense counsel (whom you probably couldn't have afforded anyway), although private criminal defense counsel usually has much more time to discuss the case with you leading to greater \"customer satisfaction.\" Of course, even that is only \"on average\". Your mileage may vary.\n\nAll of this, however, is really just side commentary. The fact that you, (admittedly) under the perhaps high pressure advice of your public defender, agreed to a plea bargain that you weren't entirely comfortable with from the prosecutor's office, in and of itself isn't improper. Your conviction in all likelihood would not be set aside on that basis, even if you collaterally attacked the plea bargain in a post\\-trial motion or habeas corpus action. \n\nThe judge almost certainly had you formally accept the plea after an advisement or had the advisement waived based upon your public defender's representation and consent. This makes the plea binding and extremely difficult to overturn. It is for all practical intents and purposes final and irreversible.\n\nGiven the kinds of cases that are brought in municipal court, it would not make sense to challenge the convictions on such mushy grounds, even if you could.

However, this might risk the prosecutor withdrawing their offer.

The Office will not register individual words or brief combinations of words, even if the word or short phrase is novel, distinctive, or lends itself to a play on words.\n\nExamples of names, titles, or short phrases that do not contain a sufficient amount of creativity to support a claim in copyright include:\n\n> * The name of an individual (including pseudonyms, pen names, or stage names)\n> * The title or subtitle of a work, such as a book, a song, or a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work\n> * The name of a business or organization\n> * The name of a band or performing group\n> * The name of a product or service\n> * A domain name or URL\n> * **The name of a character**\n> * Catchwords or catchphrases\n> * Mottos, slogans, or other short expressions\n> \n> \n> Under certain circumstances, names, titles, or short phrases may be protectable under federal or state trademark laws. For information about trademark laws, visit the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website or call 1\\-800\\-786\\-9199\\.\n\nUse of a name from a previous work can be one element that makes the later work a ***derivative*** work, but the name of a character alone will not m make a later work derivative. There must be significant and distinctive aspects of the source work (not merely common or generic aspects, or bare ideas) that are sufficiently original to be protectable, and those must be used in the later work to make the later work derivative. Even then a fair use defense may apply.\n\nHaving giant spiders called 'aragogs' would probably not alone be enough to make a work derivative of a Harry Potter novel, but if the detailed description and behavior of those monsters was used, it might possibly do so.\n\nFailure to object to an infringement does not forfeit copyright, and later infringements can still have legal action taken over them.\n\n### Distinctive Characters: Court Cases\n\nThe OP asks:\n\n> Are there any similar court cases?\n\nIn [*Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation*, 45 F.2d 119 (2d Cir. 1930\\)](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/45/119/1489834/) the famous Judge Learned Hand wrote:\n\n> If Twelfth Night were copyrighted, it is quite possible that a second comer might so closely imitate Sir Toby Belch or Malvolio as to infringe, but it would not be enough that for one of his characters he cast a riotous knight who kept wassail to the discomfort of the household, or a vain and foppish steward who became amorous of his mistress. These would be no more than Shakespeare's \"ideas\" in the play, as little capable of monopoly as Einstein's Doctrine of Relativity, or Darwin's theory of the Origin of Species. **It follows that the less developed the characters, the less they can be copyrighted**; that is the penalty an author must bear for marking them too indistinctly.\\[*Emphasis added*]\n\nIn he later case of [*Anderson v. Stallone*, 11 U.S.P.Q.2d 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989\\)](http://www.kentlaw.edu/faculty/rwarner/classes/legalaspects_ukraine/copyright/cases/anderson_v_stallone.html) the court wrote:\n\n> The precise legal standard this Court should apply in determining when a character may be afforded copyright protection is fraught with uncertainty. The Second Circuit has followed Judge Learned Hand's opinion in *Nichols v. Universal Pictures*, 45 F.2d 119 (2d. Cir. 1930\\), cert. denied, 282 U.S. 902 (1931\\). Judge Hand set forth a test, simple in theory but elusive in application, to determine when a character should be granted copyright protection. Essentially, under this test, copyright protection is granted to a character if it is developed with enough specificity so as to constitute protectable expression. *Id*. at 121\\.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The Rocky characters are one of the most highly delineated group of characters in modern American cinema. The physical and emotional characteristics of Rocky Balboa and the other characters were set forth in tremendous detail in the three Rocky movies before Anderson appropriated the characters for his treatment. The interrelationships and development of Rocky, Adrian, Apollo Creed, Clubber Lang, and Paulie are central to all three movies. Rocky Balboa is such a highly delineated character that his name is the title of all four of the Rocky movies and his character has become identified with specific character traits ranging from his speaking mannerisms to his physical characteristics. This Court has no difficulty ruling as a matter of law that the Rocky characters are delineated so extensively that they are protected from bodily appropriation when taken as a group and transposed into a sequel by another author.\n\nNames may be Protected as Trademarks\n------------------------------------\n\nA name **may** be protected as a trademark.

If a reasonable person could be confused as the the source of a product, or who endorsed it, then the use of the mark **may** be infringing.\n\nTrademarks are also country\\-specific. What is a protected mark in country A may be quite unprotected in country B.\n\nWhile trademarks do not **expire** if they remain in use, if a term becomes \"generic\" and loses the distinctive association with a specific brand or maker, then it may also lose protection as a trademark. At one time Xerox feared that its name would become a generic synonym for \"photocopy\" and that it would lose trademark protection. It undertook to discourage people from using the mark \"xerox\" in connection with photocopying using non\\-Xerox equipment. Similarly the maker feared that \"Kleenex\" would become a generic synonym for \"face tissue\" and took steps to avoid this. However, a single use would not cause this result, it would require widespread use amounting to a change in the language for such distinctive marks to lose protection.\n\nI strongly suspect that \"Harry Potter\" has been protected as a trademark in a number of countries. I am far more doubtful that \"aragogs\" has been, or even could be, protected as a trademark. The word \"aragogs\" is one fictional element in the HP books, but it is not used to label, identify, or advertise those books (or related products). Thus it is probably not protected. And even if it were, using such a term in the text of a work of fiction is probably not infringing I could write a mystery novel in which one of my characters has a Coke without seeking permission, and it would not be infringing the soft drink company's trademark.

I'm looking for your legal advice on what actions to take.\n\nTo give you a bit of background: it was an Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement within a shared house. I had many issues with this letting agency with them breaking into my room without any notice, stealing the keys for the garden (when it was more than 40\u00b0C in the house), and many other things I can detail if needed.\n\nBut the worst was that, at a time where I was spending 2 days abroad every week for work, they rented my room, not respecting the one month notice period on the contract (because they were unable to rent the room next to mine and at some point found a bunch of guys who were happy to rent the two rooms... the house had 4 rooms in total) two weeks before the end of the leaving date. So basically one night, I came back from my business trip and found almost all my stuff in packages downstairs, someone in my room, and was left with no other option then to sleep on the kitchen table where I got bitten by ants all night long.\n\nOn the next day, I checked my stuff and found out that more than \u00a3500 of goods had disapeared. I emailed them and they told me they did not steal anything... I went to see the police, who told me that without CCTV in the house they could not proceed with a charge against my landlord for them stealing my goods.\n\n**I would like to get your opinion on the kind of action I can take against them as they breached the law/agreement on several points.**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Usual disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer. If you are serious about proceeding with this, talk to a lawyer who specialises in this kind of thing. I imagine that you will need to provide proof of the above incidents in order for any legal action to succeed.*\n\nAccessing a tenant's room without notice or permission, and without a very good reason (e.g. a gas leak) is likely to be classed as harassment; specifically, \"acts calculated to interfere with the peace or comfort of the residential occupier\".\n\nRenting out your room and removing your belongings before the end of a tenancy is likely to be illegal eviction.\n\nBoth of these are criminal offences under the [Protection from Eviction Act 1977](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/43). [Shelter](http://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/harassment_and_antisocial_behaviour/harassment_and_illegal_eviction/legal_remedies/criminal_action) mentions that it's normally local authorities, rather than the police or individuals, who carry out prosecutions under this act (see also: [Shelter articles](http://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/harassment_and_antisocial_behaviour/harassment_and_illegal_eviction), [Landlord Law Blog articles](https://www.landlordlawblog.co.uk/tag/harassment/)), so you might want to start there.\n\nThere is also the matter of [civil action](http://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/harassment_and_antisocial_behaviour/harassment_and_illegal_eviction/legal_remedies/civil_action/causes_of_action), including for breach of contract.

The documentation mentions that local authorities, rather than police or individuals, typically carry out prosecutions under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977 for offenses such as harassment and illegal eviction. The landlord's actions of entering the room without notice and prematurely terminating the tenancy likely fall under these categories.\n\nOption A, while potentially valid, is suggested as a secondary step after consulting with a lawyer, making it less immediate than contacting local authorities.\n\nOption C is less suitable because the police already indicated they couldn't proceed without CCTV evidence.\n\nOption D, mediation, is not mentioned in the documentation and may not be appropriate given the severity of the landlord's actions."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38123/wet-ink-signatures", "docs_id": 38123, "title": "Wet Ink Signatures", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently I've been pondering something. A lot of encounters with debt collector videos appear on YouTube and various other sites. These videos typically feature people arguing with debt collectors/debt enforcement officers about warrants \\& legality of entering the property. One of the most common lines you hear in these clips is \"you need a wet ink signature for the warrant to be legal\"\n\nIs that actually true? If so, what does that **actually** mean in the eyes of the law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm assuming you are talking about \"warrants in debt\" and not arrest warrants. A warrant in debt is that the creditor has filed with a court for the repayment of a debt. The court will then issue a judgement (in default if you do not appear) either for the creditor or the debtor. After that, the creditor can then (if they win) seek things such as garnishment to repay the debt.\n\nNow in the UK, they have accepted the [\"Electronic Communications Act of 2000\"](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/7/contents) which means that a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES) is as legally binding as a \"wet ink\" signature. Non\\-QES signatures may also be binding, but that requires additional evidence.\n\nLet's take an example of a small personal loan. Let's say you apply electronically for a loan of X amount. The loan is approved and the money is transferred into your bank account electronically. You spend the money but make no attempt to repay the loan. \n\nFirst the bank will make attempts to collect the debt via normal means, then they may sell the debt to a debt collector. The debt collector will apply for a \"warrant in debt\" to take you to court for the amount (possibly with fees). If you do not appear, a default judgement will be applied to you.\n\nIf you signed the loan application with a QES compliant system, that signature is all the debt collector will need to show that you accepted the debt and the repayment terms. If you did not sign with a QES system, they can still submit the application but they may have to prove other things, like:\n\n* Your intent to obtain money for some purpose\n* Your action in keeping/spending the money\n* No action on your part to return or rectify the transfer\n* Any payments you may have made towards the loan (shows that you acknowledge the loan and terms)\n\nSo no, as of at least 2000 most countries accept some type of electronic signature to be legally binding.\n\n---\n\nAn entirely different topic would be if the debt is legal without the paperwork. Many debt collection agencies buy debt in bulk that may not be much more than an Excel sheet with the amounts and names/addresses and other personal information. A lot of times the entire debt \"paper trail\" is not transferred with these debt purchases so a debt collector may have purchased $10 million worth of debt for $50,000 that is nothing more than an Excel sheet. I believe in the US this has held up, but I'm not sure about the UK/rest of the world.\n\nWhat the YouTube people may be saying is that they don't have anything regarding the debt as far as binding paperwork goes. That may be something completely different.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, which of the following statements is true regarding electronic signatures and their legal validity for debt-related warrants?\n\nA) Only \"wet ink\" signatures are legally binding for warrants in debt.\nB) Electronic signatures are never accepted as legally binding for any type of warrant.\nC) Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) are as legally binding as \"wet ink\" signatures for warrants in debt.\nD) All types of electronic signatures are equally binding without the need for additional evidence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Electronic Communications Act of 2000 in the UK, Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES) are considered as legally binding as \"wet ink\" signatures for warrants in debt. While non-QES electronic signatures may also be binding, they typically require additional evidence to prove their validity. This legislation has made it possible for electronic signatures to be accepted in legal proceedings, including those related to debt collection.

Atencio, Marshall](https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/1746), 189 N.E.2d 223, Atencio and Marshall were playing RR with Britch, and Britch lost the game, fatally. He was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. On appeal, the court reminds us that \"Involuntary manslaughter may be predicated upon wanton or reckless conduct\", citing well\\-established precedent that \"The essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct, by way either of commission or of omission where there is a duty to act, which conduct involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm will result to another\". While Britch could not sue defendants (had he surviced) because of his voluntary contributory act, the Commonwealth's interest is that a person \"should not be killed by the wanton or reckless conduct of himself and others\".\n\nThe defendants argued that there is no necessary connection between their pulling a trigger and his pulling the trigger, i.e. there were three games of solitaire, and there is no causal connection between defendants pulling the trigger and the deceased doing so (the court rejects that contention), instead, \"There could be found to be a mutual encouragement in a joint enterprise\". And while \"There may have been no duty on the defendants to prevent the deceased from playing\" the court also said that \"there was a duty on their part not to cooperate or join with him in the 'game.'\" \n\nIn Washington, [RCW 9A.32\\.070](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.32.070) has a different name for the same crime:\n\n> A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when, with\n>  [criminal negligence](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.08.010), he or she causes the death of another person.\n\nIn Arizona, [ARS 13\\-1102(A)](https://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/13/01102.htm&Title=13&DocType=ARS)\n\n> A person commits negligent homicide if with [criminal negligence](https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/00105.htm) the\n>  person causes the death of another person\n\nIn general, it could be argued that the act exhibited recklessness manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. Colorado's [first degree murder statute](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-18/article-3/part-1/section-18-3-102/) includes the case where\n\n> Under circumstances evidencing an attitude of universal malice\n>  manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life generally,\n>  he knowingly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to\n>  a person, or persons, other than himself, and thereby causes the death\n>  of another\n\nThat said, it is not likely that prosecutors would seek to punish RR in this way.

This conclusion is supported by several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. The Massachusetts case of Commonwealth v. Atencio, Marshall established a precedent for charging participants in Russian Roulette with involuntary manslaughter when a death occurs.\n\n2. The court defined involuntary manslaughter as predicated upon \"wanton or reckless conduct,\" which involves intentional conduct with a high likelihood of substantial harm to another.\n\n3. The court rejected the argument that each participant's actions were independent, instead finding \"mutual encouragement in a joint enterprise.\"\n\n4. Various state laws (Washington, Arizona) define similar offenses as manslaughter in the second degree or negligent homicide, which align closely with involuntary manslaughter.\n\n5. While some jurisdictions might have statutes allowing for more severe charges (like Colorado's first-degree murder statute for extreme indifference), the documentation suggests that prosecutors are unlikely to seek such severe punishments for Russian Roulette cases.\n\nFirst-degree murder (A) and conspiracy to commit murder (D) are too severe given the context, as they typically require premeditation or specific intent to kill. Second-degree murder (B) is also likely too severe, as it usually involves intentional killing without premeditation, which doesn't fit the reckless nature of Russian Roulette.\n\nInvoluntary manslaughter (C) best captures the reckless behavior and unintended but foreseeable fatal outcome described in the legal precedents for Russian Roulette cases."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79660/is-fatca-really-reciprocal", "docs_id": 79660, "title": "Is FATCA really reciprocal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Question is obviously for non\\-US persons.

For example, [the treaty with Germany](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/131/FATCA-Agreement-Germany-5-31-2013.pdf) clearly creates reciprocal obligations in language including the first part of Section 3\\. Reports you have seen to the contrary are incorrect, at least insofar as what the U.S. is legally required to do in cases where someone who is a citizen of a country it has a treaty with has an account in the U.S.\n\nI do not know to what extent tax authorities in countries with these treaties, such as Germany, actually utilize their treaty rights, but they have the legal right to do so.\n\nThose treaties (or related pre\\-existing treaties in some countries that already had tax treaties with the U.S. containing overlapping provisions) afford the non\\-U.S. countries which are parties to those treaties with reciprocal rights to the rights of the U.S. under the treaty (basically to get information about the accounts of and compel tax withholding from citizens of the other country).\n\n[At least one critic](https://us-tax.org/2021/03/18/fatca-11-years-later-us-still-the-tax-haven/) calls FACTA non\\-reciprocal, but the critic is using the term in a non\\-standard manner. Both sides have equal legal rights, but many foreign countries choose not to enforce their rights with respect to the U.S. based accounts of their citizens because they don't have an income tax, or their income tax does not extend to U.S. based accounts of their citizens:\n\n> Typically, the country signing a Model 1B IGA has no need for\n> information about financial accounts of its nationals or residents\n> since the country imposes no income tax or has only a territorial\n> income tax. The United States and the United Arab Emirates (which has\n> no income tax), for example, have signed a Model 1B IGA\n> (non\\-reciprocal). This can clearly be seen by comparing Article 2 of\n> the Model 1 reciprocal IGA with the one signed by the UAE. The UAE IGA\n> follows the non\\-reciprocal IGA Model 1B for countries that do not have\n> a tax treaty or tax information exchange agreement in place with the\n> USA. This means that the UAE will send information to the IRS about US\n> account holders at UAE financial institutions, but the US will not be\n> sending information about UAE account holders in US financial\n> institutions to the UAE. Since the UAE does not impose an income tax,\n> this information is not needed for tax enforcement.\n\nWhile this may be a \"bad deal\" in isolation for the non\\-U.S. country to sign because it gets something of less use to it and it is to the U.S., it has the same rights and if it wants to impose a tax on the U.S. account income of its citizens, it may do so and receive U.S. cooperation in getting that information pursuant to its treaty rights.\n\nAlso, the quoted discussion overstates the extent to which a country with an income tax that has a territorial taxation basis for its taxes exempts \"hot\" intangible assets like interest and dividends on financial accounts held by persons domiciled in their country from income taxation.\n\nMany of countries with income taxes treat income intangible assets like financial accounts as domiciled where the owner resides for tax purposes. So, if a French citizen who lives in Paris sets up a bank account at a bank in Chicago, interest on that bank account may still be subject to U.S. taxes, even if interest on that bank account might not be subject to French income taxes if that French citizen lived permanently in Chicago.\n\nIt took a while to get intergovernmental agreements in place with foreign countries, so initially, the process didn't work as planned. But as of 2022, a great many countries do have intergovernmental agreements with the U.S. giving them right to access U.S. account information of their nationals if they wish to do so.\n\n> Some say FATCA isn't actually reciprocal because US wants to be the\n> best tax haven and attract as foreign capital as it possibly can.\n\nNot really.\n\nCongress passed FATCA in 2010 in an effort to enforce its own tax laws. It wasn't actively trying to be a tax haven or attract foreign capital, and the U.S. states like California and New York that are the centers of U.S. foreign capital investment have laws that are neither particularly asset protection friendly, nor particularly low in taxes.\n\nThere are some mostly small, rural states in the U.S. like South Dakota, Alaska and Montana that have tried to position themselves as asset protection havens. But this is limited in effect because U.S. tax law and other aspects of U.S. law limit its desirability for this purpose. Certainly, there is no fair telling of the legislative history of FACTA or of U.S. foreign policy which would suggest that a desire to be foreign tax haven has been an important factor in passing FACTA or in U.S. international tax treaty development.

FATCA treaties between the US and other countries do provide legal reciprocity, giving both parties equal rights to request information about their citizens' foreign accounts. However, the practical implementation can vary. Some countries may choose not to exercise their rights, particularly if they have no income tax or only territorial taxation. The reciprocity exists in the legal framework, but its utilization depends on each country's tax system and enforcement decisions.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because FATCA treaties do provide reciprocal rights, even if not all countries use them.

How commonly do Canadian lawyers appear before the JCPC nowadays?\n2. Why not instruct English barristers for representation before the JCPC? What advantages can Canadian lawyers have over English barristers in JCPC cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The cited case (*Ross* \\[2012] UKPC 3\\) is not a Canadian case. It is from St Kitts and Nevis, an appeal from the Court of Appeal of that small Caribbean country to the Privy Council. The two barristers are from the same firm based in Canada (WeirFoulds LLP), a firm which also has a [cross\\-jurisdictional practice](https://www.weirfoulds.com/practice/internationalcross-border) encompassing several countries in the eastern Caribbean who share [their appellate court system](https://www.eccourts.org/). Those nations also have a common pathway for onward appeals to the Privy Council, for essentially historical reasons dating from the era of the British Empire. Thus, counsels' appearance in this case is not because they are Canadian, but because of their separate entitlement to appear in Caribbean appeals.\n\n* Frank Walwyn's biography (linked in the question) says he is \"He is licensed to practise law in Canada, and is also a member of the bars of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Dominica, Grenada **and St. Kitts and Nevis**.\" (my emphasis). Membership in the St Kitts bar was enough for him to be able to also appear before the Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, and therefore the JCPC as well.\n* Bryan Finlay's biography does not specify, but as senior partner in the same firm he may well have the same status. In any case, since \"duly qualified members of the Bar in countries from which appeals to the Queen in Council lie have a right of audience before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council\" (*Halsbury's Laws of England*, vol. 66, para 795, 2020 ed.) he could appear before the JCPC whether or not he was allowed to do so in lower courts.\n\nRegarding your Q2 (Why Canadians?): In this case, the appeal was from St Kitts, which is a very small country of about 50k people. This would give a small talent pool from which to draw, if *only* barristers from St Kitts were eligible to practise in appeals. That is why the shared Eastern Caribbean court system exists and why there is some added generosity about qualifications between the participating countries. While the appellant Ross might have had many choices, he himself is \"a Canadian lawyer who was at the time \\[\\= 1983] practising in Halifax, Nova Scotia\", and could therefore have been drawn to a Canadian firm with a Caribbean practice.\n\nThe appeal, moreover, does not appear to have turned on any local peculiarity of St Kitts' law. It was mainly about how certain commercial documents should be interpreted. The issues arising would be accessible to practitioners from many common\\-law countries. Canada is not especially at an advantage or disadvantage, and neither is England. There *are* several barristers in London who have Caribbean experience and qualifications and who are more commonly instructed to appear on Caribbean\\-related cases (London is a nexus for commercial litigation, and several Caribbean jurisdictions are commercially important in this way, such as the Cayman Islands).\n\nI have no data on your Q1 (How many Canadians?). I expect that there are not many, because the natural choice of counsel might be either a London\\-based barrister, or one from the jurisdiction of origin who has been handling the case so far, rather than from a third country with no recent history of JCPC appeals.

The Canadian lawyers were able to appear before the JCPC because they were members of the bar in St. Kitts and Nevis, the jurisdiction from which the case originated. Specifically, Frank Walwyn's biography states that he is \"licensed to practise law in Canada, and is also a member of the bars of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, the British Virgin Islands (BVI), Dominica, Grenada and St. Kitts and Nevis.\" This membership in the St. Kitts bar allowed him to appear before the Court of Appeal of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court and consequently before the JCPC. \n\nOption A is incorrect because special permission based on Canadian law expertise was not the reason for their appearance. Option C is incorrect because Canadian lawyers do not have an automatic right of audience before the JCPC; Canada stopped using the JCPC for appeals in 1949.

If you and the older child's mother subsequently married after birth, that would have been considered to have legitimated the child, and so the child would automatically have gotten British citizenship according to former section 47(1\\) of the British Nationality Act of 1981\\.\n\nIf the older child did not get citizenship via legitimation after birth, then you can register the child as a British citizen now using [Form UKF](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-as-a-british-citizen-if-you-were-born-before-july-2006-to-a-british-father-form-ukf), regardless of whether the child lives in the UK or their age.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A British citizen father has two children born in the UK between 2 October 2000 and 29 April 2006 to a US citizen mother.

The older child did not automatically acquire British citizenship at birth because the parents were not married and the mother did not have indefinite leave to remain at the time of their birth. However, the older child can apply for British citizenship using Form UKF, which is specifically for children born before July 2006 to a British father.

This is baked into international law as part of the UN charter: \"nothing ... shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.\"\n\nThe basic assumption of criminal law is that it is, by default, territorial. If a US national commits a crime in the Ivory Coast, then that is primarily the Ivory Coast's problem to deal with. There are both practical and political reasons why this is a good idea.\n\nThe practical matters are that law enforcement and the courts in the Ivory Coast have the on\\-the\\-ground resources and knowledge to investigate and prosecute the crime and the US doesn't. US police forces can't collect evidence and interview witnesses in the Ivory Coast unless the Ivory Coast allows it. US courts can't subpoena witnesses.\n\nOn the flip side, foreign jurisdictions don't have to follow the US Constitution when conducting searches and beating up, I mean, interrogating, suspects. That may make a lot of the evidence collected in foreign jurisdictions inadmissible in US courts.\n\nThe political reasons are the US (and anyone else) should stay the f\\&^% out of the internal operations of other countries. The treaty of Westphalia ended 30 years of the most brutal warfare in history, which killed an estimated one\\-third of Europe's population, which was largely fought because the ruler of country X wanted to tell the ruler of country Y what religion they should have.\n\nExtraterritorality in [US law](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RS22497.html)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConstitutional restrictions can limit exterritoriality. First, the statute must be within Congress' power to enact. Second, neither the statute nor its application may violate due process or any other constitutional right (see above).\n\nThe presumption is that Federal laws only apply within US territory. To be extraterritorial, Congress must make this clear, ideally explicitly, but the courts can find that some laws are implicitly extraterritorial based on their language.\n\nOther nation's approach is different.

This aligns with the concept of Westphalian sovereignty and the practical and political reasons for limiting extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because US citizens are generally not held liable in US courts for crimes committed overseas, as jurisdiction typically belongs to the country where the crime occurred.\n\nOption B is false because US courts do not have unlimited jurisdiction over corporations for actions abroad, as demonstrated by cases like Nestl\u00e9 USA Inc. v.

I *intentionally* destroy the baseball *before* its return is requested?\n\nIs there a common law tort that clearly applies to either of these scenarios?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Actions in common law tort exist for both scenarios. Potential torts are *negligence*, *trespass to chattel*, and/or *conversion*. \n\nPutting the largely apparent tort of negligence aside, since that is nearly always available when something and/or someone is damaged by another (requiring only the \\[negligent] act, causation and damages) I'll focus on the other tort potentially applicable to scenario 1\\.\n\nThe minority rule concerning *trespass to chattel* can be established even when the interference is negligent, whereas the majority rule requires intent to deprive. Interestingly, when the Restatement 2d of Torts talks about minority rule vs. majority rule, it really means \"least often applied\" vs. \"most often applied\", rather than merely \"in some (fewer or greater) defined jurisdiction(s)\". \n\nWith these type of uncommonly pled torts, you *could* find a huge jurisdiction like California having lower courts (especially small claims or district courts) applying both the minority rule in some courts and the majority rule in others. This, all within one judicial jurisdiction if that state's law court has not weighed in on their interpretation of preference. \n\nThe Restatement 2d (Second) of Torts \u00a7 217 and \u00a7218 define liability in *trespass to chattel* as \"intentionally (negligently \\- minority rule ):\n\n> (a) dispossess(ing) the other of the chattel, or;  \n> \n>  (b) the chattel is impaired as to its condition, quality, or value, or;  \n> \n>  (c) the possessor is deprived of the use of the chattel for a substantial\n>  time, or;  \n> \n>  (d) bodily harm is caused to the possessor, or harm is\n>  caused to some person or thing in which the possessor has a legally\n>  protected interest.\n\nTrespass to chattel can consist of mere \"intermeddling with or the limited use of the possession\" and no damage need occur to the property, as damage is *per se*; however in your scenario, actual liability would occur in the destruction of the possession.\n\nThe 2nd scenario would lie in the more serious tort of conversion. \nThe tort of conversion will *always* requires *intent to deprive* the owner of his property, and the majority view is that the deprivation is intended to be *total or forever* (whether by continued deprivation or by destruction). \n\nThere are 3 elements required to establish conversion: \n\n1. plaintiff's ownership or right to possession of the property at the time of the alleged conversion;\n2. defendant's conversion by a wrongful act or disposition of plaintiff's property rights;\n3. damage(s).\n\nWhile anticipating the follow\\-up question to either scenario, being \n\"what about the fact that you didn't take the ball, but rather it ended up on your land, and shouldn't that count for something\"...the answer (to the unasked question :\\~) is no. \n\nThe act of taking possession over property to satisfy the necessary prong in both torts may take any number of forms, but need not be wrongful to begin with. All that is required to establish *possessory control* over the chattel in a tortious manner is merely interfering with the plaintiff's right of possession, which *is* a wrongful deprivation of something the owner was entitled to possess (so in other words, even if you didn't go and take it, once you know it's there, it's not yours, and you seek to keep it, either temporarily, permanently \u2013 the act of wrongful possession has occurred. The way the property was acquired is not at issue.\n\nConversion and Trespass in Chattel are often spoken of interchangeably despite the fact that they are different. The difference between a cause of action for conversion and one for trespass against chattel is measured only by the degree of interference with the plaintiff's rights in their chattel. \n\nWhile the distinction seems subtle in a vacuum, in the old English cases where these torts were typically decided, conversion was one small step from criminal activity, whereas today conversion may be the civil adjunct to a criminal suit.\n\n\\*for those not familiar: *chattel* is any possession that is not real estate.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a scenario where a baseball lands in your yard and you accidentally destroy it with your lawnmower before its return is requested, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences?\n\nA) You cannot be held liable as the baseball was on your property without your consent.\n\nB) You can only be held liable under the tort of conversion, which requires intent to deprive.\n\nC) You may be held liable under the tort of trespass to chattel, but only in jurisdictions that follow the minority rule.\n\nD) You can be held liable under the tort of negligence, regardless of the jurisdiction.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While trespass to chattel could potentially apply in jurisdictions following the minority rule (which allows for negligent interference), and conversion typically requires intent to deprive (which is not present in this accidental scenario), negligence is the most widely applicable tort in this situation.

If you are merely processing the data but don't have control over it (e.g. another business is using your software to do something with data that it is providing you) then you are likely to be a data processor.\n\nConversely, if you control the data, you are likely to be a data controller.\n\nIt is possible to be both a data controller and a data processor at the same time.\n\nThat specific link in your post goes on to state:\n\n> Our business customers may qualify as controllers when they purchase certain of our products and services. We act as processors on behalf of such Customers.\n\nThis is referring to the Teams product that StackExchange offers or whatever the \"internal company\\-only question and answer site\" product they offer is called.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to GDPR regulations, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between a company that provides a software platform for user-generated content and its users?\n\nA) The company is always the sole data controller, while users are data subjects.\n\nB) The company is always the data processor, while users are data controllers.\n\nC) The company can be both a data processor and a data controller, depending on the specific function and context.\n\nD) Users are always joint controllers with the company, regardless of how they use the platform.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The relationship between a company providing a software platform and its users under GDPR can be complex and context-dependent. As seen in the example of StackExchange, a company can act as a data processor when users provide personal information, but it may also be a data controller in other aspects of its operations. The determination of whether an entity is a controller or processor depends on the specific functions being performed and the level of control over the data. In some cases, as mentioned with Microsoft Teams integration, there can even be joint controllership. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that a company can be both a data processor and a data controller, depending on the specific function and context of data handling."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77604/can-an-hvac-installers-warranty-be-voided-if-another-company-works-on-the-syste", "docs_id": 77604, "title": "Can an HVAC installer&#39;s warranty be voided if another company works on the system?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: After moving into a new home, I had a licensed HVAC company install a whole house humidifier.

So I am looking for the case law that lead to the inability for judges in Texas to understand the following analogy.\n\nIf I rent a room in a hotel and I have rented hotels to go on vacations and what not. If hotel management also rented a room to someone beside me or above me and they brought a cat and are allowing the cat to urinate in the hallways and I can smell that and I report that.

Or put another way, why does my quiet enjoyment not extent to the landlord AND the genteel that they decide or not decide to take on as tenants or \"guests\" to use the hotel analogy.\n\nI am pretty certain my analogy makes sense. I am a paying customer, a tenant, the law says quiet enjoyment is implicit in lease agreements (although it seems weak and its preferable to have something explicit in the lease such as in the case of Fidelity Mutual v. Kowalsky) and it should extend to not just what the landlord does or does not do to me, but the people they choose to serve or employ.

The hotel will apologize, give me a new room and probably throw in something complimentary and then deal with the guest with the urinating cat.\n\nThe relationship between a boarder and a hotel is not the same as that of a landlord and tenant. This is a major distinction, the hotel is acting as a service provider, not a landlord and enjoys some careful distinctions, like being able to remove a boarder for non\\-payment without going through an eviction process...\n\n> You see the above there, thats called good customer service and yet if a tenant does the same thing and it stinks to high heaven, its unsanitary as well, the landlord of the apartment complex in Texas is under no obligation to do anything about it and I have experienced that they indeed do not do anything about it.\n\nYes, this is \"customer service\" on the hotel's part. They are trying to win your continued business because you can walk away and not pay for **future** visits. They, however, are not **legally** obligated to do any of that for you. They can just say \"sorry\" and not do anything and you'll be obligated to the night's you've stayed (including any nights you leave after the check\\-out time due to a dispute). They don't have to give you anything for your trouble.\n\n> So if there is a precedent that absolved landlords of apartment complexes from being held responsible for the type of \"guest\" if you will, that they allow to rent from them, what case is that?\n\nAgain, a tenant is not a \"guest\", in many legal senses of the term. The tenant has rights and you may be able to move to leave your apartment early and sever the relationship if your requests are not met and they rob you of \"peaceful enjoyment\" of your property, but the landlord is not obligated to rectify the situation outside the terms of your (and their) lease. They don't owe you anything other than what they are obligated to provide in writing (and the law). If you find your peaceful enjoyment is hindered, start documenting and requesting resolution. They won't do anything for you, but when you move and break your lease, you can defend yourself in small claims.\n\n> And if at all possible how much does the fact that apartment complexes throughout Texas are owned by hedge funds and real estate holding companies weigh in to that disconnect in the above analogy?\n\nNone, a \"landlord\" is not defined to be a private individual or a corporation. The only time that I know something like this has come into effect is for military housing off\\-base where leases are negotiated en\\-mass, there was a case of price fixing and failure to resolve problems. I forget the exact case but the company lost billions in contracts... A \"landlord\" is held to the same standards be it a \"mom and pop\", or a multinational billion\\-dollar corporation.\n\nAnd, as you are very much finding out, Texas is a very \"landlord friendly\" state that gives a lot of power to landlords. For example, in Texas, a landlord can change your locks at any time as long as they leave instructions on where to find/obtain the replacement keys.

[This article](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1919&context=californialawreview) discusses the position that \"due process forbids convicting an individual of a crime unless the government proves the elements of the charged offense beyond a \nreasonable doubt\". This standard is actually not stated anywhere in the US Constitution, but it has been assumed as an implicit meaning of \"due process\".\n\nIt sounds like you were charged with a crime, and there is most likely an applicable statute in your state that is analogous to [RCW 26\\.50\\.110](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.50.110) in Washington. So you have the right to a trial and the prosecution would have the obligation to prove all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. It also appears that you did violate the applicable law and you were willing to plead guilty, as urged by your attorney. You are correct that you don't technically have to prove your innocence, but there is a practical problem that if the prosecution provides some weak evidence that you violated the law, then the jury might decide that your failure to refute the evidence means that there is no reasonable doubt. The problem is that there is a tendency for jurors to think that the defendant has to *create* a doubt. States differ somewhat in how they explain the burden of proof to jurors, and you might fare better in a state where the instruction is that \"you must be firmly convinced\".\n\nSince the attorney seems to have said that \"the constitution doesn't apply to this\", this is a puzzle. I would not assume (though it is possible) that the attorney was incompetent. It is possible that he was speaking of a non\\-criminal matter, and it is possible that you were talking at cross purposes. There is no legal situation where \"the constitution doesn't apply to this\", but perhaps \"that constitutional limitation doesn't apply to this specific situation\". Regardless of what the attorney said, your attorney doesn't violate your rights, even if he gives you bad advice. The actual court might, and then you would have a cause for an appeal. Similarly, if the district attorney reasonably believes that you are a danger to society and is prosecuting you, that is not a violation of your constitutional rights.

Do you have reasonable articulate suspicion?\"\n> \n> \n> Officer 1: \"I do\"\n> \n> \n> Jim: \"What is your suspicion?\"\n> \n> \n> Officer 1: \"It looked like you are carrying a gun in your back pocket. I'm stopping to insure you are carrying it properly\"\n> \n> \n> Jim: \"Well have you insured it is a firearm?\"\n> \n> \n> Officer 1: \"No you keep turning so I can't see it. You don't have to be a dick to me\"\n> \n> \n> Jim: \"Well, you are being one to me\"\n\nJim pulls out his fold\\-able walking cane (He is legally blind) from his back pocket DISPELLING the concern about carrying a gun.\n\nShe proceeds to ask him for ID and he refuses to give it. The initial officer's sergeant shows up and he demands ID. After refusing a second time, he is handcuffed. They start searching Jim and he advises them that he does not consent to a search of his person.\n\nThey reach into his pocket, pull out his ID and run it. His ID comes back clean.\n\n> Officer 1: \"Was that hard?\"\n> \n> \n> Jim: \"It going to be for you\".\n\nThe sergeant throws his hands up in disgust to what he hears.\n\n> \"Arrest him for resisting\".\n\nJim was charged with \"resisting arrest without violence\".\n\nAll Charges were immediately dropped.\nOfficer 1, Was suspended without pay for 7 days.\nThe Sergeant was demoted \\& suspended without pay for 7 days.\n\nRelevant Florida case law:\n\n* Macon v. State (Fla app. 2003\\): Allows resistance of unlawful arrest without violence\n\nQuestions:\n\n* Were Jim's rights violated?\n* Is there a aggravated violation due to Jim being legally disabled?\n* Are Police allowed to search a detained persons pockets for merely a detention after being advised they are not allowed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don\u2019t believe there is an aggravated violation due to his disability, but it is quite likely that a court will find that to be a violation of his rights.\n\n[Florida\u2019s stop and frisk law](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2018/0901.151) 901\\.151(2\\) would indicate the original stop and temporary detention was valid, but once the item in his back pocket had been identified, 901\\.151(3\\) requires that the detention be immediately terminated.\n\nAfter the identification, he was no longer being legally detained, it was thus either an illegal detention and a violation of his 4th amendment rights or a consensual encounter under Florida law, and if consensual no requirement to Id. But just because it was a violation of his rights doesn\u2019t mean that he will automatically win a lawsuit if he brings one.\n\nJones v. State, 584 So.2d 190 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991\\) holds that you can\u2019t be charged with resisting arrest without violence (aka 843\\.01\\), when the arrest itself is unlawful. I suppose Hodges could be charged with \u201cobstructing\u201d which is covered by the same statue, but more ambiguous than \u201carrest\u201d.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the case of Jim Hodges and Florida law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of the police officers' actions?\n\nA) The officers were justified in searching Jim's pockets and arresting him for resisting arrest without violence, as he refused to provide ID during a lawful stop.\n\nB) The officers violated Jim's rights by continuing to detain him after he revealed the walking cane, but the search of his pockets was legal as part of the initial stop and frisk.\n\nC) The officers' actions were completely lawful throughout the encounter, as they had reasonable suspicion to stop Jim and he was uncooperative.\n\nD) The officers violated Jim's rights by continuing to detain him after he revealed the walking cane, searching his pockets without consent, and arresting him for resisting arrest without violence when the arrest itself was unlawful.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This answer is correct because:\n1. According to Florida Statute 901.151(3), the detention should have been immediately terminated once Jim revealed the walking cane, dispelling the suspicion of a weapon.\n2. Searching Jim's pockets after being advised they did not have consent, and when the initial reason for the stop was dispelled, likely violated his 4th Amendment rights.\n3. The arrest for \"resisting arrest without violence\" was likely unlawful, as per Jones v. State, 584 So.2d 190 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991), which holds that one cannot be charged with this offense when the arrest itself is unlawful.\n4. The fact that the charges were immediately dropped and the officers were disciplined supports this interpretation of events."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5310/how-to-win-against-a-moving-violation-ticket-that-was-issued-different-than-what", "docs_id": 5310, "title": "How to win against a moving violation ticket that was issued different than what I had allegedly committed?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **I was stopped by an officer that claimed I sped over a 30mph speed limit. When he saw that I have a radar detector, he proceeded to \"cut me a break\" and gave me a ticket for \"failed to signal\" (but I did use my signal, and the officer knows it).**\n\nHe did not use radar (my radar detector would have indicated otherwise) and I was in the lead among other cars. I wasn't speeding, but accelerated faster than the other cars. It seems to me that he realized that he may not have a strong argument in court when he saw my radar. Therefore, I received a citation that was different than the one I was stopped for. \n\nHow would a typical case like this play out in court (generalized)? \nWould he tell the truth, and if he does, would that means the case would be dismissed on the grounds that I did not violate the law in which the citation has stated? (I would probably use \"motion to summary judgement\" if this happens.)\n\n**RESULTS** from my case:\n\n**First Trial:** Officer did not show up (did not give a reason). The Judge offered a continuance to the officer. Case postponed. (NYS penal code states along the lines that if the officer did not give a reason for missing the court date or is not one of the few exceptions for missing the date, case should be dismissed. However, in my case it wasn't. Perhaps the judge had the final say regarding this matter. \n\n**2nd Trial:** Officer did not show up. Prosecutor tried to get me to come back. However, I mentioned the continuance is final and that the officer not showing up means there is no witness against me. I got my hearing in front of the judge and the case was dismissed. \n\n**Notes**: After going through this ordeal, I realized that the prosecutors were really out to get people to agree to plea bargains. Even going as for as lying to me the officer was present to get me to sign a plea. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I took my car to the mechanic to have a squeaky brake looked at. I was told it would cost $30\\. The mechanic fixed whatever the problem was. When I was checking out, they could not find a $30 brake\\-work item in their computer so they billed it as Tire Balancing $30\\. Or some such thing. Meh, accounting.\n\nThis is not how the law works.\n\nThe prosecution needs to prove every element of the crime you are charged with. They need to *prove* you did not signal. The way this usually works is the cop takes the stand and testifies, and you can cross examine him. Then you can testify if you want to, and can be cross\\-examined. There might be other evidence against you also, like a dash cam. Assuming there is no other evidence, and that the officer did not prove every element of failing to signal, you do not need to testify. You can tell the judge that the prosecution failed to make the case and ask to have the charge dismissed. Of course, if the judge thinks they did make their case, then you lose. On the other hand, you could take the stand and testify, and subject yourself to cross examination. Just a word of warning, if it's your word against a cop's word, you will lose.\n\nYour best bet is to get discovery, get the dash cam, and show that you did signal.\n\nBe aware, if you get too saucy, the prosecution can add charges. So they could add the speeding charge, but of course, (see above), they then need to prove it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An officer stops a driver for speeding but instead issues a citation for failure to signal. The driver maintains they did signal and believes the officer changed the citation upon seeing their radar detector. In court, which of the following scenarios is most likely to result in a dismissal of the case?\n\nA) The driver argues that the original reason for the stop was speeding, not failure to signal.\nB) The officer testifies truthfully that they did not witness the driver fail to signal.\nC) The driver presents a motion for summary judgment based on the officer's testimony.\nD) The driver cross-examines the officer aggressively about the discrepancy between the stop reason and the citation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the reason for the stop does not negate the citation issued. The officer can cite for any observed violation.\n\nB) is correct because the prosecution must prove every element of the crime charged. If the officer testifies truthfully that they did not witness the driver fail to signal, this fails to prove an essential element of the offense.\n\nC) is incorrect because a motion for summary judgment is typically used in civil cases, not traffic court. Additionally, such a motion would be premature before hearing the officer's testimony.\n\nD) is incorrect because aggressive cross-examination alone is unlikely to result in dismissal and could potentially antagonize the judge. Moreover, the discrepancy between the stop reason and the citation is not grounds for dismissal if the cited offense can be proven.\n\nThe correct answer (B) aligns with the principle stated in the documentation that the prosecution needs to prove every element of the crime charged. If the officer truthfully testifies they did not witness the failure to signal, this undermines the prosecution's case and is most likely to result in dismissal."}}
