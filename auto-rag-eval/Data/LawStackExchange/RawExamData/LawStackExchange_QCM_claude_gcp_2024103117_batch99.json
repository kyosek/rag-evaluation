While not all states have specific laws addressing teen sexting, some have adapted their existing child pornography laws to treat teen sexting cases less severely.

A written contract merely serves as evidence (really good evidence) of what those terms and conditions were.\n\nFor this to matter, it would have to be part of a dispute about the contract. If the parties looking at the term know and agree on what it means then that is what it means.

The reason for the limitation is that if your employer asks for money back, you obviously should be able to defend yourself, for example by proving that you never received that money. After five or six years it is assumed that you wouldn't be able to provide any such evidence, so nobody can ask for the money back anymore. \n\nThat's not specific to overpaid wages but quite general. \n\nIn addition there is the question whether the pilots should have known they were overpaid. For example, I'm quite happy with my salary, but if it was less, I would look for and find a different job that pays better. If the company claimed in five years time that I had been overpaid all the time, then I would say that if they had given me the \"correct\" lower payment, I would have found a better job elsewhere, so asking me to repay the money seems quite unfair. \n\n(Why do you need to defend yourself? Maybe your salary was \u00a33,000 per month. Someone in the right position records that they are paying you \u00a34,000 but puts \u00a33,000 into your account and \u00a31,000 into their own.

According to UK law, the statute of limitations for recouping overpayments is typically 5-6 years, depending on whether the case is in Scotland or the rest of the UK. The employer can only legally pursue overpayments made within this timeframe. Option A is incorrect because while the statute of limitations has passed for some of the overpayments, it hasn't for all of them. Option B is incorrect as it ignores the statute of limitations.

I am aware of the \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard in some legal systems but I'd welcome any more information of text to continue research. For an example, let us assume that it's proven that certain chemical compound can induce a specific disease \\- some type of cancer, for an example. It is also well established that exposure to that chemical is not sole cause of this type of cancer, so there is incidence in a healthy population. So, let say that incidence doubles and it is found that a factory upstream of affected population has been dumping this chemical into water source. Person that has this disease sues the factory. There is no scientific way to prove that the person wouldn't get it without exposure, but it can be proven that this is probable (50%) and that the person was exposed. How would such situation be viewed in continental or common law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As an academic matter, the US system has struggled with this, and law professors spend their lives debating it.\n\nAs a realistic matter, I'd bet that company in your example gets nailed.\n\nOn the theory, the issue here is but\\-for cause. Civil liability requires that the jury find it more likely than not, or over 50% likely, that but\\-for D's actions, P's injuries would *not* have occurred. Your hypo puts it at exactly 50, and tie goes to the defendant, so in this case even the theory is clear. But, say you change it a little bit to make it more like 65 or 70%. Now, you're getting into the territory of the classic blue bus case. A man is hit by a blue bus. Two companies in town own blue busses, and one company owns 90% of them. Can he recover against that company with no other evidence? The black letter answer is no, that naked statistical evidence doesn't cut it. The rationale is that if it were the other way, anytime someone got hit by a blue bus, that company would automatically have to pay out unless they had some evidence to disprove their liability. The burden of proof has been shifted, violating a fundamental tenet of our legal system.\n\nBut, this doctrine obviously poses an issue for plaintiffs like yours. It's one thing to say that someone hit by a bus needs to have more evidence. Theoretically, they could go out and get it: they could find the bus routes and schedules, examine where they were, and show that X company had a bus going by there at that time. They can also canvas for witnesses. It's much harder when, as your excellent hypo touches on, the science is so complicated. One controversial solution that has been debated a lot recently is market\\-share liability, but that doesn't seem pertinent here because you have mentioned another company.\n\nOn the legal realist side. As far as I can tell the system usually finds a way to hold the company responsible. One example is the tobacco litigation. My understanding is the science couldn't definitively *prove* that smoking caused cancer, but it could prove that it raised the risk significantly. Here's some information on that [https://www.tortmuseum.org/the\\-tobacco\\-cases/](https://www.tortmuseum.org/the-tobacco-cases/) from the American Museum of Tort Law, which, yes, is a real thing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit against a chemical company, scientific evidence shows that exposure to the company's chemical doubles the risk of a specific type of cancer, but cannot prove definitively that any individual case was caused by the exposure.

While the U.S. legal system theoretically requires proving causation beyond a 50% likelihood in civil cases, in practice, courts often find ways to hold companies responsible in situations with strong statistical evidence of harm, even without definitive proof of individual causation. This approach is similar to how tobacco litigation was handled, where increased risk was sufficient for liability. Options A and D are incorrect because they represent extreme positions not supported by legal precedent. Option B, while theoretically possible given the challenges of proving definitive causation, does not align with the practical approach courts often take in such cases, especially when dealing with public health issues and corporate responsibility."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28501/can-i-sell-computer-source-code-that-i-reuse-in-other-applications-that-i-still", "docs_id": 28501, "title": "Can I sell computer source code that I reuse in other applications that I still sell?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have several different versions of the same software (written in .Net/WPF) that interact with different brands of hardware.

But it would be derived from a Non\\-Commercial copy.\n\n**Is that breach of NC licence, if I am profiting from a reproduction of PD text I extracted myself, but using NC digital copy (scanned images) of that book to retrieve it?**\n\nI personally considered the following line of reasoning in favor of an individual being able to use the end result commercially, i.e. for selling ebooks of Public Domain works:\n\n1. *The photographer has copyright in the photograph itself, not in the items photographed.*\n2. *A \u201cslavish copy\u201d of a work would not qualify for protection if there is no creativity involved.*\n3. *Copyright protects literary and artistic expression, not facts.*\n\nI am interested in how this works globally, but mostly within the EU.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> But while some libraries allow unrestricted use of their Public Domain content, others do not and limit the use of their copies to Non\\-Commercial use. It is my understanding that NC only applies to the digital copy, not the work itself.\n\nYour understanding is correct. An ancient text, or one long out of copyright, does not get new protection by creating an image of the text. At most the image itself is protected, not the underlying text. In the US, and other jurisdictiosn that follow the rule of the 1999 [*Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp* case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgeman_Art_Library_v._Corel_Corp.) there is no copyright protection on the image because it has no original content. Some EU courts have indicated that they will be following the logic of bridgeman. To the best of my knowledge no EU decision grants copyright protection to an otherwise out\\-of\\-copyright work because of its presence in a digital library or collection.\n\nHowever, if a person gained access to a digital library or collection subject to a TOS agreement which includes \"no commercial use\" terms and then published a text from it commercially, that person might be subject to a breech of contract or similar suit by the library.

While the original works are in the public domain and cannot be subject to new copyright restrictions, the researcher agreed to the digital library's terms of service, which included non-commercial use restrictions.

The chief exception is a work for hire, and that's obviously not the case here.\n\nHowever, I think your problem is fixable. Copyrights can be transferred, certainly in exchange for *consideration*.

So, generally speaking, someone who enters the intersection, after coming to a full stop, when it is not safe to do so because someone else is in the intersection, is the one at fault (although, it is certainly possible that more than one car could enter an intersection when it wasn't safe to do so).\n\nIt isn't entirely clear from the facts presented in the question who is at fault, since the key question of who entered the intersection when it could not be safely entered isn't entirely clear from the facts presented in the question.\n\nAlso traffic law liability would not necessarily imply civil liability for damages, particularly if both parties were actually at fault, even if only one was cited with a traffic ticket.\n\nThere are other parts of the Texas Transportation Code which one might expect to apply, that do not:\n\n> \\[U]nder Texas law, drivers turning left must yield to traffic from the\n>  opposite direction.

Can I be forced to cede the rights to my intellectual property?\n\nThis question is relevant because in the gaming industry it happens very often that some people make a really good game, then they fail for awhile and go bankrupt, and then suddenly another company with no regards to quality gets their hands on that intellectual property and starts ruining it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is there any way one can have their own intellectual property licensed to their own company, such that the person owns that IP and not the company?\n\nYes. This is quite common. \n\nThe ideal asset protection strategy is to have one company that deals with customers, one that deals with suppliers, one that employs and one that owns property (including intellectual property). Local tax law may make it better for some assets (such as real property) to be held personally.\n\nObviously this imposes additional overhead which may not be warranted for small businesses and such ... pessimistic shall we say, arrangements are not acceptable in public companies.\n\n> If I agree to the sale, the new company will ONLY own the licenses that I gave to my company, and NOT my IP correct?\n\nThe issue is not if *you* agree to the sale, it\u2019s if *they* will agree. If you can get a buyer, expect to receive *much* less if you are not actually selling the thing that makes your business a business. Effectively your are renting the IP and you don\u2019t get as much for renting out your house as you do for selling it.\n\nLicensing models do work: for example, McDonalds (everywhere but the US) has a licensing agreement with McDonalds (USA) for the IP but that agreement is geographically exclusive, long\\- term (decades at least) and very secure.\n\n> Does this, in any way, affect the IP that I personally hold?\n\nNo\n\n> Can I be forced to cede the rights to my intellectual property?\n\nProviding every transaction was arms length and at market rates and above board: no.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An entrepreneur creates a valuable intellectual property (IP) for a book called \"Thunderbolt\" and then establishes a company to develop content based on this IP. The entrepreneur licenses the IP to the company for specific projects with limited timeframes. If the company is sold or goes bankrupt, what is the most accurate statement regarding the fate of the original IP?\n\nA) The IP automatically transfers to the new owners or creditors of the company.\nB) The entrepreneur retains full ownership of the IP, but loses all future licensing rights.\nC) The IP becomes public domain and can be used freely by anyone.\nD) The entrepreneur retains ownership of the IP, and only the existing licenses transfer to new owners or are liquidated.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, when an individual licenses their personally-owned IP to their own company without transferring ownership, they retain control of the IP itself. In the event of a sale or bankruptcy, only the existing licenses would transfer to new owners or be liquidated as assets. The original IP owner (the entrepreneur) would still own the intellectual property and could potentially create new licenses in the future.

Under federal law in the United States, sex-based discrimination in public accommodations (such as nightclubs) is not prohibited. This means that \"ladies' night\" promotions are generally legal at the federal level. However, some states and cities have enacted their own laws that are stricter than federal regulations. For example, the question mentions that in Seattle, sex discrimination in public accommodations is illegal. Therefore, while these promotions may be legal in many parts of the country, they could be illegal in specific jurisdictions with more comprehensive anti-discrimination laws.

All questions can be boiled down into questions of law and questions of fact. This is opposed to an inquisitorial system, where the prosecutor, defense, and judge are working to answer these questions in a fact finding forum.\n\nBecause of this, in Common law, the judge takes the role of \"Trier of Law\", i.e. he is the arbiter of what the law says. The Jury will talk the role of \"Trier of Fact\". Essentially, if the prosecutor and defense attorneys are in a competition against each other, the judge will serve as the referee and decide whether something is allowed to be discussed in trial and whether the jury should count it. Because of this, the judge cannot call out objectional behavior by one side or the other as it would call into question his/her ability to be neutral in his assessment of the law. Thus it is the burden of the opposing party to object to something that is objectional.\n\nFailure to object means that the the side that should object is okay with this activity by opposing counsel, so the judge must allow it. Sometimes, objections are raised at trial for the sole reason that they will be part of the appeal of the case. Appeals can only call raise Questions of Law, which again, is the judge's domain. Thus the judge can't object, since we operate on the fact that the judge is neutral. If the judge is not neutral, than the case can be overturned easily by an appellant court.\n\nEssentially, the \"Objection\" is similar to a coach playing sportsball asking a ref to review a play on the sportsball field. Under this game rule, however, the judge is there to make the call if and only if he/she is asked to make it. Otherwise the objectionable action is permitted to stand.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a common law court system, why does the judge typically not raise objections on their own initiative during a trial?\n\nA) The judge lacks the legal knowledge to identify objectionable content\nB) It would compromise the judge's role as a neutral arbiter of the law\nC) Objections can only be raised by the jury, not the judge\nD) The judge is prohibited by law from interfering with the proceedings\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In a common law adversarial system, the judge serves as a neutral \"Trier of Law.\" If the judge were to raise objections on their own initiative, it could call into question their impartiality and ability to neutrally assess the law. The responsibility for raising objections falls on the opposing attorneys, as they are engaged in a competitive process of presenting their cases.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because judges are typically well-versed in legal matters and can identify objectionable content. However, it's not their role to actively object.\n\nAnswer C is false because the jury doesn't raise objections; their role is to be the \"Trier of Fact\" and determine factual matters in the case.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while judges generally don't raise objections themselves, they aren't legally prohibited from interfering in proceedings.

In commercial leases, it's common and legal for security deposits to be expressed as a percentage of the monthly rent. If the lease specifies this arrangement, then as the rent increases, the security deposit can also increase proportionally. This practice is generally considered legal in California for commercial properties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there are strict rules for residential properties, commercial leases often allow security deposits based on rent percentages.\n\nOption B is incorrect because if the lease stipulates the security deposit as a percentage of rent, the tenant is typically obligated to pay the increase.\n\nOption C is incorrect because damage to the property is not a prerequisite for increasing a security deposit in this context.

So long as none of the consideration for the agreement is sex and sex in not required by the agreement or purports to be bindingly consented to in the agreement. (Cohabitation agreements that do so are called meretricious and are void as a matter of public policy because they constitute agreements to engage in illegal conduct, i.e. prostitution.)\n\nPeople who are not married can also name each other as death beneficiaries of assets, in a will or trust, or as agents in powers of attorney for each other.

([America, A Concise History](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0312643276))\n\n*Emphasis mine.*\n\nThis does not make much sense to me. \n\nThis decision is in the context of the (very violent) intimidation of blacks especially by ex\\-Confederates followed by a Democratic political coup. From what I understand, the Democrats disenfranchised African Americans. The Supreme Court then ruled that it was the state's responsibility to ensure that its citizen's rights were not infringed upon. \n\n### First contention\n\nFirstly, why would it be the state's responsibility to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, which is part of the Constitution? The Fourteenth Amendment states,\n\n> The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. ([Section 5 of the 14th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution))\n\nDoes this, not to mention that it is a Constitutional amendment, not imply that issues pertaining to the Fourteenth Amendment, such as equal access to voting ([Section 2 of the 14th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)), are under federal jurisdiction?\n\n### Second contention\n\nIf \"private groups\" like the KKK took *political* power, would the governments that they became part of not be violating former slaves' civil rights (as opposed to just private individuals)? Therefore, it would be that state's duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to address the illegal actions of actors within its jurisdiction. However, if the state fails to address these actions, would it not then become the federal government's jurisdiction since the state failed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment within its borders? \n\nWould the plaintiff have needed to sue the state for failing to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in order for it to be under federal jurisdiction?\n\n### Closing\n\nI am not very fluent in law things, so please excuse me for any misused vocabulary (like \"jurisdiction\"), nor do I have a thorough understanding of federal vs. state jurisdiction or Constitutional law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the \"state action\" requirement is the norm for most civil rights violations. The U.S. Constitution is structured in such a way that it is designed solely to protect people from government overreach. Statutes engaged by legislative bodies at the state and federal level protect people from misconduct by private parties.\n\nFor example, ordinary state criminal laws would ordinarily forbid private parties from acting as armed vigilantes to prevent people from doing pretty much anything. And, if armed vigilantes were doing something that government officials and politically powerful people in the state didn't approve of, they would have been arrested, charged and convicted of crimes by the police.\n\nThe trouble is that in the U.S. legal system, if the government decides not to enforce its criminal laws, you are limited to bringing civil lawsuits against the offenders for damages or injunctive relief (e.g. a court order ordering the vigilantes to stop misbehaving). But, as a practical matter, private lawsuits are not very effective when the courts and government officials are determined to thwart you and so are a significant share of the members of any jury pool. (This is one of the reasons, as a matter of logic, for the Second Amendment, because you need some way to protect yourself from crimes if the government exercises its right to do nothing to protect you from criminals even when it is capable of doing so.)\n\nThe U.S. Constitutional and legal system requires the good faith of the elected officials in state and federal government to work properly. But, if majorities of voters under whatever flawed electoral system is currently in place are bound and determined to suppress a political minority, the democratic features of our political system make it very hard to intervene to protect that political minority.\n\nAs you note, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution (collectively, the Civil Rights Amendments) all empower Congress to enact legislation enforcing those provisions in addition to any self\\-executing effect that they have, although the exact scope of that enforcement power was at the time a matter of some legal debate and in any event often wasn't exercised by Congress (which by then had white, anti\\-civil rights members in many House and Senate seats). But, in *U.S. v. Cruikshank* a very racist U.S. Supreme Court held that the state action requirement applied not just to self\\-executing aspects of the Civil Rights Amendments, but also to the 1870 Enforcement Act adopted by Congress during Reconstruction with an intent to stop precisely the kind of armed private action that occurred. It held that the 1870 Enforcement Act as applied to private parties was unconstitutional.\n\n(Around the same time the *Slaughterhouse* cases gutted the privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution, and *Plessy v. Ferguson* gutted the 14th Amendment with the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.)\n\n> However, if the state fails to address these actions, would it not\n> then become the federal government's jurisdiction since the state\n> failed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment within its borders?\n\nNo. The U.S. Constitution doesn't provide much protection at all against state inaction. (The human rights tribunal for the Americas has faulted the U.S. for violating human rights by not having protections against this kind of conduct which all Latin American countries do have.)\n\n> Would the plaintiff have needed to sue the state for failing to\n> enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in order for it to be under federal\n> jurisdiction?\n\nNo. The plaintiff would have no remedy, which was basically the intended and expected effect of *U.S. v. Cruikshank*. The justice of the U.S. Supreme Court weren't any more stupid then than they are now. They just had different values and part of those values was the belief that it wasn't the place of the federal government to curb the acts of groups like the KKK and Jim Crow laws (in part to prevent a re\\-ignition of the Civil War in a post\\-Reconstruction period when white supremacists were more powerful than ever in the states that had previously fought a war with overwhelming support from majorities of people entitled to vote to preserve slavery). The Civil Rights Amendments were shoved down the throats of the Southern states as a condition for readmission to equal standing in the Union free of military law and civil disabilities during Reconstruction. So, they ratified those amendments under duress and then did everything they could to reinstate the pre\\-civil war system as completely as possible which they had still believed in despite losing the Civil War (and indeed, [modern political figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore) like [Roy Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore), a previous Alabama Supreme Court Justice, still want to return their states and the nation to the ante\\-bellum South, and argue that slavery was as much good as it was bad for the slaves and for the South).\n\nIt took a century and two World Wars and the Korean War, in which African\\-Americans served in the military for the U.S., and a thriving post\\-war economy, for those attitudes to change.\n\nUltimately, in light of this ruling, in the 1960s, the Civil Rights Acts were adopted by Congress to regulate discriminatory conduct by private parties, not with the justification and authority of enforcement powers of the Civil Rights Amendments, but instead based upon the interstate commerce clause whose scope had been dramatically expanded during the Great Depression in cases like *Wickard v. Filburn*, a choice which a pro\\-civil rights U.S. Supreme Court gave its stamp of approval in the *Heart of Atlanta Motel* case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court's ruling in U.S. v.

Cruikshank ruled that the federal government's power to protect citizens' civil rights was limited. It could only intervene if state governments themselves were directly violating these rights. The Court held that violations by private individuals or groups were a state responsibility, beyond federal jurisdiction. This effectively limited the scope of the 14th Amendment and the 1870 Enforcement Act, ruling the latter unconstitutional when applied to private parties. This decision significantly weakened federal protections for civil rights, particularly for African Americans in the South, leaving them vulnerable to intimidation and discrimination by private actors like the KKK."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16547/what-do-we-call-the-rules-written-in-an-act-laws", "docs_id": 16547, "title": "What do we call the rules written in an Act, laws?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From CHAPTER III of Wildlife protection **act**,1972 (India)\n\n> 9.

When the body makes a formal decision to adopt the written document (by a vote, for example), it is deciding to do the thing described in the document; that is, it is deciding to act. Typically, for a legislature, the thing it's doing is to create, modify, or repeal a law.\n\nIt's not very difficult to see how a document that describes a legislature's desire *to* act came to be called *an* act. In some contexts, however, it can also be called a law.\n\nSo the word *law* can refer to the entire system (as in *law school*), to a particular act (as in *the legislature passed a law today called the XYZ Act*), or indeed to a particular rule or section of an act (as in *the law in question is subparagraph 2(B)(ii)(b) of the XYZ Act*).\n\n*Law* can also refer to *case law,* of course, or *regulatory law,* so we tend to use *statutory law* or *statute* to denote the laws created through the legislative process.\n\nIn conclusion, the word \"law\" has several related meanings, so its use can be imprecise. When speaking about specific paragraphs, precision may be in order.

WotC bought TSR and all its assets, including copyrights. There were at least two other RPGs that tried to use Beholders and other original creatures from the *Monster Manual* of D\\&D and dropped them after a cease and desist order from the copyright holders. I believe one was from TSR, and one from WotC after they purchased TSR. To the best of my knowledge there was no actual copyright suit, so the validity of the copyright was never tested in court, but it is probably valid.\n\nMerely calling a creature a \"Beholder\" is not enough to violate the copyright, there would need to be actual copying of the description, or a sufficiently detailed similarity to make the use an infringement. That is always a matter of judgement, ultimately for a court in a copyright suit (or an appeals court).\n\nSo, while all the possibilities mentioned in [the answer by @Dale M](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/64375/10) are valid, it is additional possible that the version used by HOMM3 is not sufficiently close to the one copyrighted as part of AD\\&D for a copyright claim to prevail, or the WotC fears that it would not prevail, and so does not spend the money to try.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why Heroes of Might and Magic 3 (HOMM3) was able to use \"beholders\" in their game without facing copyright issues from Wizards of the Coast (WotC), while Tibia had to change their creature's name from \"beholder\" to \"bonelord\"?\n\nA) HOMM3 obtained an official license from WotC to use beholders in their game.\nB) The copyright on beholders expired before HOMM3 was released.\nC) HOMM3's version of beholders may not be sufficiently similar to the copyrighted D&D version to constitute infringement.\nD) WotC only enforces its copyright on beholders for online games, not single-player games.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, copyright infringement for creatures like beholders requires more than just using the name - there needs to be a sufficiently detailed similarity to the original copyrighted version. It's possible that HOMM3's version of beholders was different enough from the D&D version that WotC didn't believe they had a strong case for copyright infringement. Alternatively, WotC may have decided not to pursue legal action against HOMM3 for other reasons, such as the cost of litigation or the risk of losing the case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of HOMM3 obtaining a license. Option B is false because the copyright was still active (WotC enforced it against Tibia).

This statutory instrument was made in response to a 1996 decision of the European Court of Justice ([*P v S and Cornwall County Council*, C\\-13/94](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61994CJ0013)) that [Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A31976L0207) , regarding equal treatment of men and women, also covered discrimination on the grounds of gender reassignment. The regulations were made in order to bring domestic law up to date with the EU requirement, by amending the Sex Discrimination Act 1975\\. The definition at the time, found in the amended [section 82](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/65/section/82/1999-05-01), was:\n\n> \"gender reassignment\" means a process which is undertaken under medical supervision for the purpose of reassigning a person\u2019s sex by changing physiological or other characteristics of sex, and includes any part of such a process\n\nSo the idea of \"other characteristics\" or \"other attributes\" comes from the 1999 version of the law. I expect that the change to \"attributes\" is simply because the Equality Act 2010 uses the term \"characteristic\" to mean something else, as it consolidates many different regimes about discrimination on the basis of sex, race, disability, etc., all of which are called \"characteristics\".\n\nThe more recent text removes the part about \"medical supervision\", and explicitly includes people at any stage of transition. [Explanatory Notes](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/notes/division/3/2/1/4) to the 2010 Act give the example:\n\n> A person who was born physically female decides to spend the rest of her life as a man. He starts and continues to live as a man. He decides not to seek medical advice as he successfully \u2018passes\u2019 as a man without the need for any medical intervention. He would have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment for the purposes of the Act.\n\n(These notes are not binding in law but they do give a good idea of what the drafters meant to say. The concept of 'passes' is also not the most sensitive language to bring in, since trans people do not necessarily want to measure themselves by their ability to pass undetected, and may present differently in different contexts.)\n\nThe example shows that someone can have the protected characteristic without having, or contemplating, any change to their body. So from this example, the other attributes of sex would include all those ways in which the man \"continues to live as a man\". From general knowledge of trans men, that could include using a masculine name and pronouns; wearing traditionally\\-male clothes; wearing a binder, baggy clothing, padding in the crotch, or other ways to suggest a more masculine than feminine body; having a traditionally\\-male haircut; using traditionally\\-masculine body language; pitching the voice lower; and so on. The situation for trans women would be parallel. These things are all attributes of sex, in that our society abounds in stereotypes of what is a \"manly handshake\", or a \"girly drink\", or otherwise associated with a particular sex.

This officer had used various police resources and people to access personal information about my partner despite those inquiries having no lawful purpose. They also pulled information about family close to my partner too, which has been their own standalone case. This information gathering continued to happen on and off for years, some of which even took place after we told the city that we were concerned this may be happening \u2014 this was affirmed through an audit and investigation that took place.\n\nThis particular officer has also had a past of other misuse of police resources, some of which they've been punished for or put their job at risk of termination. Throughout our research, their action clearly violates policies and some of the guidelines deem these repeated actions as being immediate grounds for termination. However, the feedback we've gathered so far suggests that this officer not only wasn't terminated or adequately punished, but that they've continued to retain full access to these systems that were abused.\n\nWe're suspicious that there may be quite a few people in cahoots that is allowing this officer to avoid necessary punishment. Some of this suspicion comes from numerous contradictory claims in their communication compared to the documentation we received; the lack of transparency and effort when they were forced to report to other agencies (even ones above them); and that they have repeatedly went well beyond the deadlines of numerous statutes, resulting in some opportunities of tort to be impossible (we found these out afterwards, of course).\n\nIt's worth noting that we've contacted a few lawyers.

The basis for that suit would be negligence, that is, they had a duty of care to you, but they failed to act in a reasonable manner to prevent the harm. A prominent question in such a case would be whether the damage was a foreseeable outcome (if not, there is no negligence), or one\\-time while foreseeable (if this is a repeat offense, the consequences to them of deliberately ignoring the problem could be worse). There is also the consideration of comparative liability, since you might have been able to avoid the situation by doing something else. In some states, any fault assignable to you means you lose, but in California they follow the pure comparative fault rule, where your portion of the liability is deducted from an award (but you can still collect something if it was 99% your fault).\n\n[Here](https://www.eater.com/2017/5/19/15662790/starbucks-hot-coffee-lawsuit-florida-100k) is an incident involving Starbucks (lids) where the plaintiff won, [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/05/11/starbucks-lawsuit-hot-coffee-cop-police-officer/27148147/) is one where the plaintiff lost", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer at a Starbucks coffee shop is injured when a wobbly table causes hot coffee to spill on their arm.

The customer can indeed sue Starbucks for negligence, claiming that the coffee shop failed to maintain a safe environment by allowing wobbly tables to remain in use. The lack of immediate medical treatment does not preclude a lawsuit, although it may affect the damages awarded.\n\nThe key point here is the concept of comparative negligence. In some states, any fault on the part of the plaintiff would bar recovery (contributory negligence). However, many states, including California as mentioned in the passage, follow a comparative negligence rule. Under this rule, the plaintiff can still recover damages even if they are partially at fault, with their award reduced by their percentage of fault.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they wrongly assume that lack of immediate medical treatment or only claiming lost wages are the only options.

Publishing such a list would not infringe on the copyright of the original work, as it merely presents factual information about the work rather than reproducing its creative content. Options A and D are incorrect because permission and royalties are not required for publishing facts about a copyrighted work.

In legal proceedings, the discovery process requires parties to disclose all relevant information, even if it might be potentially damaging to their case. This is done to ensure fairness, prevent surprises during trial, and encourage settlements when appropriate. Withholding or tampering with evidence (options A and B) is not allowed and can lead to serious legal consequences. Option D is incorrect because discovery requests typically override personal privacy concerns in legal matters, and the right against self-incrimination generally applies to testimonial evidence, not physical evidence like video footage.

I'm not sure if I need to contact the person in the image directly, or the owner of the image, not even sure how to find that out.\n\n[I've read that](https://blog.printsome.com/printing-fan-art/) as long as I make it clear that the image is not official or linked to the person it should be ok. Also if the image is a parody or a criticism, or something that is highly transformative, that's also ok.

From the description, the modified images are *derivative works*. Making or distributing derivative works requires the permission of the holder of the copyright on the original (source) work. Some open source licenses (such as the Creative Commons licenses that do not include an ND clause) grant such permission in advance. Otherwise permission must be requested from, and granted by, the copyright holder or the holder's agent.\n\nIn the absence of permission this is copyright infringement. If advertised widely for a fee, a copyright suit is more likely, and might result in sizable damages. The holder might not grant permission, or might charge a fee. A lack of any answer from the holder must be treated as a \"no\".\n\nRight of Publicity\n------------------\n\nIn some jurisdictions a person has a \"right of publicity\" in his or her own image or likeness. This generally means that photos or images of the person cannot be used commercially without permission from the subject. In some places this right is limited to the use of such images in advertising, not as art subjects themselves.\n\nI don't know the extent of such rights in England and Wales, or elsewhere in the UK. In the US this varies by state. But if such rights apply, use of such images without permission can result in a suit and significant damages.\n\nDefamation\n----------\n\nIf showing an image of a person with added tattoos would tend to bring that person into disrepute, or make others think badly of that person, for example if the added tattoos were Nazi or gang symbols, then distributing such an altered image **might** be defamation. This would only apply if people actually thoguht the tattoos indicated that person's choice or attitude, or if reasonable people might think so.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nBefore making this a business, even a hobby business, one would do well to consult a lawyer with IP expertise. There are significant legal risks here, which are increased by doing this for profit, and advertising it on the net. It might well be that in many cases appropriate permissions can be obtained free or cheaply, but it is not safe to assume this.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A graphic designer in the UK wants to sell digitally manipulated images of local celebrities on Instagram.

Option B is correct because it accurately reflects the dual nature of the emails in this context. The emails are not hearsay when used to prove the landlord received complaints, but they would be hearsay if used to prove the truth of the complaints' contents. In practice, however, such hearings often have relaxed evidence rules, so the emails might be admitted more broadly.

I fear the editorial of the original book can take legal action against me. \nDo this can lead to legal problems? \nThe summarized book has been on the internet since 2011, is there the possibility of a demand coming from the editorial or author of the original book?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic question is whether you \"copied\" the book, which is not limited to verbatim cut and paste type copying. Even with verbatim quotes and equations copied from the book, some amount of that is allowed under the [fair use doctrine](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info). There is not much (any) clarity in the law when it comes to educational\\-use quote\\-copying. However, based on your description, I would not conclude that this work counts as \"fair use\": but a judge or jury might decide it is, depending on the exact facts.\n\nIf you reduce a 600 page book to 200 pages, that sounds like \"copying\" while creating a derivative work. This would be especially the case if the structure of your book strongly resembled the structure of the original book, and what you did was omit some sentences and reword some sentences. On the other hand if you wrote an independent book on the topic, happened to reflect the original author's ideas, and even copied a small amount of text by way of illustrative quotes, then that resembles an independent creation rather than copying.\n\nThere are [4 plus factors](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7683/in-the-us-when-is-fair-use-a-defense-to-copyright-infringement) recognized in the fair use defense, where the fact\\-finder would somehow \"take into consideration\" these factors: purpose and character (non\\-profit, teaching, exegesis all in your favor), nature of the work (equations implies science hence facts, being factual favors fair use), amount and substantiality (not in your favor, if you're paraphrasing a whole book), and effect on market. As a first approximation, your work might have a devastating effect if your work is good and the original is expensive plus popular \u2013 you created a free competitor. Framed in terms of your intended original use, probably not so significant, limited to the size of your class (assuming that your work was a replacement for, and not a supplement to, the original \u2013 which may be what you did). The law isn't stated in terms of your intent in creating the work, it's stated in terms of what you did. Still, the fact\\-finders might be influenced by innocent intent. Then finally, there is \"transformativeness\" as a unifying consideration, so that copying that substantially transforms a work into a new work fares better under a fair use analysis \u2013 this would appear to be a quite transformative work.\n\nWhether or not the rights\\-holder is likely to go after you depends on many unknowables, especially whether there would be any point in suing you, and how much the publisher and author care.\n\nRegardless of the relationship between the original book and your version, you have created a work that is also protected by copyright. That means that it is illegal to upload your work to Scribd, Slideshare, or anywhere else, without your permission. When someone illegally uploads a work to a server, if you learn about it, you as author can file a [DMCA takedown notice](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24057/how-can-i-legally-protect-my-website-from-users-who-upload-copyrighted-material/24060#24060). A law\\-abiding service will then take the work down (unless the uploader officially claims he has the right to upload it). If they do claim they have the right, you have to sue them.

While there are fair use considerations (educational purpose, potential transformative nature), the extent of copying and potential market impact could work against a fair use defense. However, the situation is complex and would require legal analysis to determine definitively.\n\nImportantly, regardless of the legal status of the summary in relation to the original work, the professor has created a new work that is also protected by copyright.
