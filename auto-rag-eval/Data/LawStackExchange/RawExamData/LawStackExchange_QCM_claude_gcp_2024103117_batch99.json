The correct answer is C because, as seen in cases like Melmark v.

Alex*, [2017 SCC 37 at para. 31](https://canlii.ca/t/h4mzd#par31)).\n\nMany factors would pull a court to interpret a statute more narrowly or broadly than an acontextual, isolated reading of the words would suggest. Generally, this includes the full text, context, and purpose of the statute. Courts will look to:\n\n* the words of the provision\n* the surrounding words and related provisions\n* the words of the entire statute\n* the entire statute book\n* the legislative purpose as revealed through legislative history and the mischief the provision is meant to deal with\n* the presumption of constitutionality\n* etc.\n\nBasically every doctrine of statutory interpretation will pull towards either a narrow or broad reading of a provision. I would hesitate though to call these \"corrections\" of \"legislative flaws\" but rather an attempt to give effect to the legislative intent. Even the doctrine of absurdity that you mention is based in an assumption that the legislature does not intend absurd results. Instead of correcting \"legislative flaws\" this doctrine/canon is a way to *avoid* judicial error.\n\nHowever, *after* a full interpretation of a statute reveals that it is unconstitutional because it is over or under\\-inclusive, then a court may use the *remedies* of reading down or reading in (these are constitutional remedies not part of the ordinary act of interpretation). In such a circumstance, where it is a \"safe assumption\" that the Legislature would have enacted the \"corrected\" version, the court may declare the correction. See *Schachter v.

Here is a list of some of them:\n\n* Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs (\\>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Olmec Inscriptions (\\>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Mayan Glyphs\n* Ancient Aztec Glyphs\n* Old English Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Old Runic Inscriptions (\\>1000 years old)\n* Old Irish Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Inscriptions (\\>3000 years old, like the [oracle bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone))\n* Ancient Latin Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Greek Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Etc. There are many other cultures such as Finnish, Tibetan, etc.\n\nSome of these are owned by places like the Catholic Church, others by places like the British Library, or other Libraries or Museums, even others are held by Universities, and still others are held by private individuals who may post an image online of the artifact for a variety of reasons, like [this person did](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/4t9kop/book_written_in_geez_ancient_ethiopic_unknown_age/). Also, some artifacts may have been *created* in one place (like in China), but *hosted* in another place (like at the British museum).\n\nSo the question is about looking at an online image of one of these artifacts, which is provided by one of the owners, and then either drawing a picture to replicate the object (like the image below), or copying it into text form, such as [this](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/), which was transcribed from [an image of a manuscript](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/manuscripts/cp/?tp=ob), into [electronic text](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/view/#edition/translation).\n\nSpecifically, all of the things I am talking about are pre\\-copyright era, the actual objects themselves. So then someone finds/discovers the item (either they found it pre\\-copyright era, like 1000\\+ years ago finding something and putting it in the king's library), or it was discovered post\\-copyright\\-starting era. So somebody owns it. I am not concerned with that part. But then they take a picture of it and put it online. Some of the pictures (like the reddit image) are just quickly shot with an iPhone. Others require significant cost, care, and tooling, such as taking a picture of a fragile ancient manuscript, while others require that much cost/care/tooling to startup, but then can be automated for thousands or millions of artifacts (like the Google books project). But in the end, an image of a natural, copyright\\-free artifact (since it was created pre\\-copyright era) is online and publicly available.\n\nWhat you see in this situation often is \"this image is copyrighted\". To me that means that you can't directly sell the image, or host it on your site/product for commercial gain. But given the *content* of the image is in the public domain (again, the content from all those cultural resources listed at the beginning) because it was created thousands of years ago, I wonder what you are allowed to do with the image.\n\nI wonder if you are allowed to:\n\n* Make a drawing of it (like the sketch below).\n* Transcribe the text contained in the original document (which you could *see* because of the copyrighted image).\n\nObviously the drawing wouldn't be a straight copy of the *photograph*. It would draw the essence of the content instead. So the content is public domain, but the image is copyrighted and the artifact is owned. I wonder if you are allowed to essentially write down in electronic form what is in the manuscript artifact, or in the case of glyphs, to write down the glyphs.\n\nWhat this would mean is that one could go to a museum website and view their manuscripts, and transcribe them, and then do what you want with the transcription. If that's not allowed, I would be interested to know the reason.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you're describing is generally permissible in the United States.\n\nThe photographer has copyright in the photograph itself, not in the items photographed. This means that they have copyright in the way that they composed the photograph \\-\\- what background they placed it against, lighting, camera placement, etc. \\-\\- but not in the ancient manuscript. \n\nIf you are strictly transcribing the text of the script, you're not infringing on anything that's copyrighted. If you make a sketch, there's more potential for infringement, but I suspect that you would not be working to faithfully copy the angles of the shadows as much as you would working to faithfully copy the image and condition of the artifact. \n\nEven if you were, calling that a copyright infringement would require that the image truly be copyrighted, and I'm not 100 percent convinced that they would be. Copyright is only available to *original* works of authorship, and that means that the author has to make some meaningful efforts to create something new out of the copyrighted elements discussed above.\n\nBut what has the photographer done in that picture of the Coronation Oath? It appears that they've photographed the book head\\-on, as it's displayed by the museum, with lighting as provided by the museum, in an effort to recreate the display one would see while visiting the museum. Is that really sufficiently \"original\" to merit copyright protection that could be invoked to prevent someone from drawing a duplicate? I doubt it.\n\nBut that picture of the Ge'ez book may be different. Someone appears to have grabbed the book, opened it up under weird lighting, kept their hands in the photograph, and otherwise actually composed a photograph that may not be particularly artistic, but is nonetheless difficult enough to duplicate that it can be considered original.\n\nSo let's be generous to the copyright trolls and assume that the sketch you're imagining is protected. Even then, that only raises the question of whether the copy is a fair use. You haven't said anything about how the hypothetical copier would be using these materials, but I have a hunch that the idea isn't to launch a multimillion dollar merchandising enterprise. If the idea is more academic or cultural, you'd have a better claim to fair use.

Which of the following actions would most likely be considered permissible under U.S. copyright law?\n\nA) Downloading the museum's photograph and using it in a published academic paper without permission\nB) Creating and selling posters featuring an exact copy of the museum's photograph\nC) Transcribing the text of the Mayan glyphs from the photograph and publishing the transcription in a scholarly article\nD) Using photo editing software to remove the background of the museum's photograph and selling the edited image online\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Transcribing the text of the Mayan glyphs from the photograph and publishing the transcription in a scholarly article would likely be permissible under U.S. copyright law. The content of the ancient inscription itself is in the public domain due to its age, and transcribing text from a copyrighted photograph does not infringe on the photographer's copyright, which only extends to the original elements of the photograph such as composition, lighting, and angle.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it involves directly using the copyrighted photograph without permission. Option B is not permissible as it involves reproducing and selling the copyrighted photograph. Option D, while altering the original photograph, still uses a substantial part of the copyrighted image for commercial purposes without permission.\n\nThe correct answer (C) focuses on the content of the ancient artifact itself, which is not subject to copyright, and uses it for academic purposes, which would likely be considered fair use even if there were any question of copyright infringement."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74435/can-a-person-doing-criminal-activity-claim-self-defense-if-the-criminal-activity", "docs_id": 74435, "title": "Can a person doing criminal activity claim self defense if the criminal activity has nothing to do with why he is attacked?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1UrFZ.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1UrFZ.png)\n\nBasically what [Kyle Rittenhouse did](https://m.timesofindia.com/world/us/key-moments-in-the-us-murder-trial-of-kyle-rittenhouse/amp_articleshow/87650966.cms) is clearly self defense.\n\nHowever, he is carrying a gun against the law.

Then someone robs him and he grabs a nearby gun and kills the robber. Can he claim self defense?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This appears to apply to all criminal activity, BUT\n===================================================\n\nIt only applies when defending a dwelling or business\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nand only removes a presumption, not the full right to self defense\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt has no effect on the Kyle Rittenhouse case.\n==============================================\n\nWhen interpreting the law, you can't take one sentence out of context and try to apply it. You must read the entire law, and interpret each statement in context.\nIn Wisconsin statute 939\\.48 (Self\\-defense and defense of others), the section you are citing is (1m)(b)(1\\). It contributes to 939\\.48(1m)(b), which modifies 939\\.48(1m)(ar), which expounds on (1\\).  \n\nTo paraphrase the law,  \n\n939\\.48 (self\\-defense)  \n\n1\\) A person may only use lethal force to defend themself or others from an immanent crime that would cause death or great bodily harm.  \n\n1ar) When defending your home or business, you may presume that someone breaking in poses the threat of death or great bodily harm.  \n\n1b) On second thought, you MAY NOT presume this under a couple of conditions:  \n\n1b1\\) You are actively engaged in criminal activity  \n\n1b2\\) You have reason to believe the person breaking in is a police officer, fire fighter, or paramedic engaged in their lawful duty.  \n\nIn legal terms, a presumption is something you shall / may act on before you have firm evidence to the contrary.  \nIf someone is breaking into your home, you do not have to identify them or see clear evidence of a threat (e.g., if it's too dark to see).  \n\nBUT if you can see someone clearly, and see a clear threat / clear lack of threat, you are no longer acting under presumption.  \n\nSo,  \n\nIf you are in bed, and someone breaks into your house, you may normally fire on them without clearly seeing a weapon.  \n\nBut if your spouse flips on the light and the intruder sees your gun and surrenders, you may no longer fire. You have firm evidence the intruder is not a threat.  \n\nIf you are hacking into the pentagon's computers late at night, and someone kicks in your door, you may **not** shoot at them, because you cannot presume threat. (It may be the FBI serving a no\\-knock warrant.)  \n\nBut if you flip on the the light and see someone in a ski mask threatening you with a crow bar, you may shoot him. You now have firm evidence of a threat to your life.  \n\nNone of this has any effect on the Kyle Rittenhouse case.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nKyle was not defending his dwelling or business.  \n\nKyle's legal defense does not rest on a (claimed) presumption of threat, it rests on (claimed) evidence of threat.  \n\nLikewise, the accusations against Kyle don't claim that illegal possession of a firearm negates self\\-defense.  \n\nI don't know of any case law in Wisconsin involving self\\-defense while illegally carrying a gun, but there's nothing in the statute law that would bar self\\-defense in that situation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Wisconsin, under what circumstances does engaging in criminal activity affect a person's right to claim self-defense?\n\nA) It completely eliminates the right to claim self-defense in all situations\nB) It only affects the presumption of threat when defending a dwelling or business\nC) It prevents claiming self-defense when using a firearm illegally\nD) It has no effect on self-defense claims whatsoever\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nAccording to Wisconsin statute 939.48, engaging in criminal activity only affects the presumption of threat when defending a dwelling or business. It does not completely eliminate the right to self-defense (ruling out option A), nor does it specifically prevent claiming self-defense when using a firearm illegally (ruling out option C). Option D is incorrect because criminal activity does have some effect, albeit limited. \n\nThe statute states that a person engaged in criminal activity may not presume that someone breaking into their home or business poses a threat of death or great bodily harm. However, this only removes the presumption, not the full right to self-defense. If the person can provide clear evidence of a threat, they may still claim self-defense even if engaged in criminal activity.\n\nThis nuanced interpretation of the law highlights the importance of understanding legal contexts and not applying individual sentences in isolation."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/20002/can-i-use-youtube-free-audio-library-music-in-my-online-video-editor", "docs_id": 20002, "title": "Can I use Youtube Free Audio Library music in my online video editor?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I made an online video editor (website) and I want to let users to use music from youtube free audio library in their videos.

As far as I knew constitutional law mainly deals with the functioning of states and governments so why encode certain rights directly into the Constitution while others as separate law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the right to privacy *derives* from the Constitution, as \"an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 and as a part of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution\", see [Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) vs Union of India](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/127517806/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=5acaba5e380f6eae795ea1b36840600880fc48d8-1608839571-0-AVbX96SupH8XC4my66wi255vodkdxh4r_hbLBTafUEU8kHGPTH7AEfeuhCsmmX-mB6Ab3mJtiwa7tnb4zETVg9vAMwMF8y92tDm2TrA0ybhmxi5MzN1mhTtsqkTz77ChScRLupmO9iCeCBlz7kycFgDUciu7NuTupsEqQmRPCI3GMWP7iNQ7bH8CtBdJbIW6tBhQTwFQqEUUeAJtVRDgWMmuPOYeIoAQkzIYTwdFnTxAWSg8GftF2ovctNdNg0-NJLWsIxAoHvBHZyZo1lK61Yffg-DszgN-wCQyNVdLzGvmBbAQYG-2bfbiAVTjEhy8Lqvw7XPc8VLjpccYbtaQ5wDPdf6AhEOr2kpzrZjT8P1MGl0rlu2Y0WuOjfvaIIyXWg). The issue here is that prior to this ruling, the right to privacy was only *implicit* in the Constitution, and it took a lawsuit and argumentation to extend the interpretation of the Constitution. The right to information is a [statutory right](https://rti.gov.in/rti-act.pdf). The rights created by this law are stated explicitly, so no lawsuit or interpretation is required (unless a court case is required to understand what a \"competent authority\" is, or whether the right includes more than the 4 enumerated sub\\-rights). That is, this statute specifically creates a right, which could not be inferred from the Constitution.\n\nThere are three ways to create a new right. One is to \"discover\" that it was implicit in existing law, as in the Aadhaar ruling. Another is to amend the Constitution and add something to Part III. Turn to the [Constitution itself](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/India_2015.pdf?lang=en), art 368, which describes amending the Constitution. The third way is to do this statutorily, as in the right to information. Acts of Parliament are \"easier\" than Constitutional amendments: an amendment requires a 2/3 quorum, and us subject to other specific restrictions, possibly requiring approval by a majority of states. Likewise the right to free, compulsory education is Art. 23a of the Constitution, but the details of implementation are a statutory creation, subject to judicial review unlike Constitutional amendments (hence [Pramati Education and Cultural Trust v. Union of India (2014\\)](https://clpr.org.in/litigation/pramati-educational-cultural-trust-ors-vs-union-of-india-ors/)).\n\nTheoretically, the Constitution could be amended to require that all rights must be encoded in the Constitution, which would make it more difficult to create new rights.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between constitutional rights and statutory rights in India?\n\nA) All fundamental rights in India are explicitly stated in the Constitution and cannot be derived through interpretation.\n\nB) Statutory rights, such as the right to information, carry more legal weight than constitutional rights.\n\nC) Constitutional rights can be implicit and later recognized through court rulings, while statutory rights are created through specific legislation.\n\nD) The right to privacy in India is solely a statutory right and not derived from the Constitution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the relationship between constitutional and statutory rights in India.

Mention the agreement you have found as grounds for your request. You might want o clarify upfront with your electricity provider who exactly you are supposed to contact, the maintenance company would be my first guess.\n\nChances are, you'll be given the access code.

Canada (Attorney General)*, [2020 SCC 28](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18510/index.do), but it presents a variety of examples from Canada and the United States (where it's called \"disparate impact discrimination\") for background.\n\n> Instead of asking whether a law explicitly targets a protected group for differential treatment, a court must explore whether it does so indirectly through its impact on members of that group (see *Eldridge*, at paras. 60\u201162; *Vriend*, at para. 82\\). A law, for example, may include seemingly neutral rules, restrictions or criteria that operate in practice as \u201cbuilt\u2011in headwinds\u201d for members of protected groups. The testing requirement in *Griggs* is the paradigmatic example; other examples include the aerobic fitness requirement in *Meiorin*, and the policy requiring employees to work on Saturdays in *Simpsons\u2011Sears* (see also *Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission)*, \\[1990] 2 S.C.R. 489\\).\n\nFrom these examples:\n\n* *[Eldridge](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1552/index.do)* was about failing to provide sign\\-language interpreters as an insured benefit under a provincial medical services plan. This restriction applied equally to the hearing and deaf populations. But this had an adverse impact on the deaf population. Because this was a government service, it was subject to scrutiny under the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.\n* [*Griggs*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/124) was a class action against a large employer who required applicants for higher\\-paying jobs to pass an aptitude test and have completed high school. The claim was that this discriminated against African\\-American employees in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Right Act. The Supreme Court of the United States held that the standardized testing requirement rendered a \"disproportionate number\" of African\\-Americans ineligible from promotion, transfer, or employment.\n\n> Congress has now provided that tests or criteria for employment or promotion may not provide equality of opportunity merely in the sense of the [fabled offer of milk to the stork and the fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Stork).

The restaurant denies this request, citing operational needs.

While the policy is neutral on its face and applies to all employees equally, it has an adverse effect on the Seventh-day Adventist employee due to their religious beliefs. This fits the definition of adverse effect (or indirect) discrimination.\n\nHowever, unlike direct discrimination, adverse effect discrimination may be permissible if the employer can demonstrate that accommodating the employee would cause undue hardship. The correct approach is to recognize the potential for adverse effect discrimination and then consider whether accommodation is possible without undue hardship to the employer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this is not direct discrimination.

It is recommended reading.\n\n**TL;DR**: The *controller* is the one who calls the shots (i.e. what personal data to process, what means to use to process it, the purpose of processing, and the legal basis for processing). This is usually the owner of information system. The *processor* is the the entity that actually do the processing.

This also means that the client is the *controller*.\n\nA \"privacy policy\"\\-type document is not sufficient to regulate the relationship between the *controller* and *processor*. \n\nHow to regulate this relationship is described in [GDPR Article 28 (3\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/). Its start out by saying:\n\n> Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject\\-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller.\n\nIt then goes on to describe what stipulations the contract must contain.\n\nThis contract is usually called a **DPA**. The initials may stand for \"Data Processing Agreement\" or \"Data Protection Addendum\".\n\nBasically, if you personal process data on behalf of clients, you *need* to have this place.

As a web developer processing data on behalf of clients, you are acting as a data processor. GDPR Article 28(3) requires that the relationship between a data controller (your client) and a data processor (you) be governed by a contract or other legal act, commonly known as a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). This agreement should outline the subject-matter and duration of the processing, its nature and purpose, the type of personal data involved, and the obligations and rights of the controller.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a privacy policy for your personal website does not cover your activities as a data processor for clients.\n\nOption B, while it shows awareness of the different roles, is not the correct approach.

The reputable hosting companies typically have a statement about secure servers and signing for a chain of custody if they receive physical media. \n\nI ran the cost and we can get server capacity on a cloud like an Amazon or Azure for literally pennies on the dollar and get (or release) capacity on demand.\n\nThe owner claims cannot satisfy chain of custody if the data hit a cloud. Is that true? \n\nI know two questions is not protocol for this site but what if the cloud account is owned by the customer? We just sell software/service. Now the customer would most likely need to give us access to the data but very easy to only give us read only access \\- they control the cloud account. Anyone doing review would have read only access. Could a customer sign a (valid) chain of custody if the data hit a cloud?\n\nI am clearly a techy. The original disc is still in a physical chain of custody. What is produced to the court is page by page tiff (or other rendition) redacted (or not) and stamped with a bates number. I know the law is the law and does not need to make sense but the original is not what is produced to the court. I am not getting touched a cloud would invalidate. Can you not just sign that Azure/Amazon was part of chain custody? It is not like the hammer that was used to crush the skull. Discovery data started as a clone of the collected physical disc or it was produces by the opposing party (still a copy).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Owner claims cannot satisfy chain of custody if the data hit a cloud.\n> \n> \n> Is that true?\n\nNo. On the one hand, as you say, you can just include the cloud provider on the chain of custody. On the other hand, opponents don't ask for chain of custody. And when they do, it's going to take a pretty drastic series of events to diminish the admissibility or weight of the evidence in court.\n\nTen years ago chain of custody was taken more seriously but after many recent court opinions about proportionality and cooperation, lawyers don't challenge chain of custody unless something glaring appears to be wrong.\n\nI could go on, but suffice it to say \\- I don't know of any case where chain of custody made a difference in civil litigation.\n\nBe aware that adding cloud storage adds a step to your processing and production workflow. As it is, you probably receive original evidence and process the data, host it for review, and then convert to TIF for production. If the data is hosted in the cloud rather than your local server your attorneys will be waiting for you to get the data uploaded to the review platform. And then when the review is done the production might take longer because of the download. Obviously the production delay is not as severe as the upload for review. There are ways around this, like rolling the upload, but this takes more human hours because of the additional management required.\n\nI'll also add security as the reason to stay out of the cloud. Litigation evidence is usually highly confidential and requires a high degree of security.\n\nSo, there are reasons for discovery vendors to avoid the cloud.

I did ref law.stackexchange but no on else posted anything.  \n\n2\\. The closest thing I found searching this site was a reference to the Joint Guidance on the Application of FERPA and HIPAA \\- which seems only to concern info collected by the school (not assignments) and who this can be disclosed to.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are certain privacy laws regarding what schools can reveal about students. To completely answer the question, we would have to know the state and school district involved, but we can get a pretty good estimate of the legal situation from applicable federal law, [34 CFR Part 99](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr99_main_02.tpl) (FERPA). That regulation addresses disclosure of student records, and they define \"record\" as \n\n> any information recorded in any way, including, but not limited to,\n>  handwriting, print, computer media, video or audio tape, film,\n>  microfilm, and microfiche\n\nwhich would include any written assignment (which is somehow written, and contains \"information\"). The regulations also refer to \"personally identifiable information\", which includes the student's name, which would normally be included on any assignment turned in, but could be removed if the teacher wants to in some way redistribute the essay.\n\nSubpart D addresses disclosing PID from a record, and generally consent is required (which could be from the parent, in the case of a minor), except as specified in [\u00a799\\.31](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=22e4dc673ac41bbc465f0af2269cac7e&mc=true&node=sp34.1.99.d&rgn=div6#se34.1.99_131). This would include for example those within the agency or institution who have been found to have an legitimate educational interest. This would include for example another teacher, the principle, the school psychiatrist (if there is one), but not the lunch lady or janitor. This would also include the psychiatrist who contracts with the school for consultation (but isn't an employee) as long as they are under the direct control of the school. It will also include disclosure to state and local educational authorities, under certain circumstances. (This is just a fragment of the conditions for non\\-consensual disclosure: the short version is, if the disclosure is to the school psychiatrist, it is allowed).\n\n\u00a799\\.36 then addresses \"health and safety emergencies\", which allows disclosure \"if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals\", where the agency \"may take into account the totality of the circumstances pertaining to a threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals\", and if it \"determines that there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals, it may disclose information from education records to any person whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals\".\n\nOne thing to note is that this regulation imposes restrictions on the school but not directly on the employee. The institution is expected to construct rules that implement the institutional requirements on their employees. If a disclosure is contrary to federal regulation, the penalty is visited by the government on the institution; the institution will then (hopefully) have established policies that employees will have to follow. Federal regulations do not anticipate that a teacher will make a *sua sponte* decision that a certain child may be a threat to public safety and therefore discloses a record. Instead, the teacher would probably make a disclosure within the organization, at which point the organization makes a decision whether the record needs to be turned over to the police, or someone else within the organization.\n\nAs for the specific case described, since the document presumably does not contain personally identifiable information, the disclosure restrictions do not apply. They do not apply to \"legitimate\" disclosure within the organization, and may not apply to certain kinds of disclosure outside the organization, but probably would prohibit disclosure to a neighbor who happens to be a child psychologist. The organization may well have promulgated rules that apply to employees which grossly misrepresent what the FERPA rules actually say (my employer did, \"out of an abundance of caution\"), so it is possible that the disclosure is contrary to FERPA\\-inspired local policy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An instructor at a public university receives a disturbing assignment from a student that appears to describe violent acts in graphic detail.

This includes school employees like a school psychologist or a mental health professional who contracts with the school and is under its direct control. This approach maintains student privacy while allowing the instructor to seek professional guidance about potential safety concerns. Options A and B are incorrect as they misinterpret the scope of FERPA's restrictions.

However, even if it was, it is possible that it would not meet the [federal minimum standards for warranties](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67241/what-are-the-legal-protections-to-buy-if-seller-refunds-instead-of-delivering-wh/67242#67242) as, per paragraph (d) a warranty has to provide for remedy without a charge. If there is absolutely no way for you to obtain the information to prove that a remedy is due \u2014 for e.g. no third party has legal or technical capacity to diagnose the vehicle \u2014 that is likely also a term to be found unconscionable and void, and may be found fraudulent, malicious and/or oppressive which may entitle one to collect punitive damages. (It is worth obtaining written confirmation of whether this decision is made in accord with their policies or on a line that they announce to be recorded)\n\n**Question 2:** Most likely same as Question 1\\.\n**Question 3:** Most likely same as Question 2\\.\n\nAccording to 15 U.S.C., subsection (a) of [Section 2302](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2302) entitled \"Full and conspicuous disclosure of terms and conditions; additional requirements for contents:\n\n> \"In order to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers, prevent deception, and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products, any warrantor warranting a consumer product to a consumer by means of a written warranty shall, to the extent required by rules of the Commission, fully and conspicuously disclose in simple and readily understood language the terms and conditions of such warranty.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) A statement of what the warrantor will do in the event of a defect, malfunction, or failure to conform with such written warranty\u2014at whose expense\u2014and for what period of time.\"\n> \n> \n> (5\\) A statement of what the consumer must do and expenses he must bear.\n> \n> \n> (6\\) Exceptions and exclusions from the terms of the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (7\\) The step\\-by\\-step procedure which the consumer should take in order to obtain performance of any obligation under the warranty, including the identification of any person or class of persons authorized to perform the obligations set forth in the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (12\\) The characteristics or properties of the products, or parts thereof, that are not covered by the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (13\\) The elements of the warranty in words or phrases which would not mislead a reasonable, average consumer as to the nature or scope of the warranty.\n\nIt may, in addition to any or all of the above, be a violation of paragraph (8\\), (9\\), (10\\) and/or (11\\) based on specific fact patterns.\n\n**To the 2nd point added:** If the manufacturer stated that the vehicle would run at least a certain number of miles on a full charge for a certain number of miles driven or number of years, and did not stipulate it otherwise, they would have to remedy this. It is highly likely that they tried to evade making such written statement (if not written, it's not a warranty under Magnuson\\-Moss). If they did, and they did not define the scope of what they would have to do in the case of a defect or malfunction, they would have to remedy it by repairs within a reasonable time; if they fail, they would have to refund or replace.\n\nThis does not mean that it is likely worth pursuing the matter in court other than maybe in small claims (See: [ohwilleke's reply to this question for a general explanation](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67241/what-are-the-legal-protections-to-buy-if-seller-refunds-instead-of-delivering-wh/67242#67242)). Moreover, most auto manufacturers put arbitration provisions in their sale contracts and/or their warranties and generally it may be required of one to opt out of it within 30 days of entering into the agreement. If that took place, first the dispute would likely need to be disputed through a qualified dispute resolution mechanism of the manufacturer, dealer, distributor and/or sellers choice depending on who gave the warranty.\n\nThe specific State's lemon laws may provide for civil penalties for willful violations which may or may not be a very high bar to meet depending on the State's case law, and which is more likely to make it worth for \"lemon\" lawyers to take the case, but generally they are not a great deal more like hyenas of this segment of the law.

It mandates that warrantors must state what they will do in the event of a defect or failure to conform with the warranty, including at whose expense.\n3.

You're liable.\n\nNow the situation may be more complicated if an oncoming vehicle appears to yield to you. You can choose to proceed or you can choose to wait. In your case you choose to proceed and if there is no incident, life goes on.\n\nBut you posed the hypothetical that the oncoming driver appears to yield but in fact doesn't or intentionally speeds up after you begin your turn and there is a collision.\n\nSo legally speaking the oncoming driver is at fault because intentionally causing an accident, nearly everywhere, is illegal. But how do YOU prove that happened. It's going to be your word against his unless there are bystanders who witnessed it. It's going to be an uphill battle to win in this case because it appears that you are at fault. Say you had a dashcam that shows the whole thing. Would that necessarily be convincing?

Even if the oncoming driver appears to be yielding, they still have the right-of-way. By remaining stopped, you avoid potential accidents or legal complications.

If the vehicle doesn't have a separate compartment, the firearm must be in a locked container. This federal law preempts state laws, allowing for legal transportation without needing to register at each state border or obtain special permits. The option to ship to a dealer and pay taxes is not legally required in this scenario, and there is no federal interstate firearm transportation permit for this situation."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58052/can-cloud-services-providers-be-asked-to-turn-over-data-from-foreign-countries", "docs_id": 58052, "title": "Can cloud services providers be asked to turn over data from foreign countries?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can cloud providers be asked to provide data from other countries to the government/law enforcement for security purposes? Can Amazon be asked to provide data from non\\-US countries for any security reason, substantiated or not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking a business can be subpoenaed to provide any records, electronic or otherwise, by any court with jurisdiction over that business. Most subpoenas are issued in the context of pending lawsuits or criminal cases, some can be issues by certain regulatory or criminal law enforcement agencies.\n\nThere are defenses to a subpoena which can be asserted to quash the subpoena before the information is provided by the business. The main defense is that the information is privileged, for example, because it contains attorney\\-client confidences, or it is protected as a trade secret which could be disclosed to a competitor or lose its trade secret status if access to the information is not controlled.\n\nBut, generally speaking, ordinary business records of dealings that a company like Amazon has with its customers are not privileged or otherwise exempt from disclosure pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nAnother process which is available but less common when dealing with a third\\-party is a search warrant. In general, a business is not exempt from disclosing records pursuant to a criminal search warrant simply because the records involve non\\-U.S. persons.\n\nThere are also special procedures similar to, but not identical to, subpoenas under the Patriot Act such as \"national security letters\" that can be issued when national security is at issue. Unlike a typical subpoena, the process involved in a national security letter information request must generally be kept secret from the public and from the target of the investigation. National security information requests are overseen the the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Court which is a non\\-adversarial court that operates much like a judge or magistrate to whom a criminal search warrant application is made, except that attorneys that practice before it must have security clearances and its proceedings operate with a much higher level of secrecy. National security inquiries are still subject to legal limitations which the FISA court evaluates, although the FISA court has a reputation for being something of a rubber stamp (there is debate over whether this reputation is well earned).\n\nThere is a detailed body of law describing what justifications are necessary for various types of record requests and what exceptions to the duty to disclose exist, but without more specifics in the question, an answer in this forum is not a place for a comprehensive treatise reviewing all of them which could fill several law review articles.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. government agency is investigating potential international cybercrime involving users of a major cloud service provider.

According to the provided information, cloud providers can be compelled to provide data from both U.S. and non-U.S. users through proper legal channels. These channels include subpoenas, search warrants, and special procedures like national security letters.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the agency's ability to obtain data is not limited to U.S. citizens.

If that were true, then the conspirators who did those things would have been guilty of criminal conspiracy under Louisiana law, and the New Orleans District Attorney would be able to prosecute that crime.\n\nThe result of the investigation was an indictment and trial of Clay Shaw (he was acquitted). You can read Garrison's opening statement at <http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/russ/testimony/garrisono.htm>, which includes the detailed charges and some arguments by the defense over jurisdictional issues.

A district attorney's jurisdiction is typically limited to crimes committed within their district. However, in cases of conspiracy, if part of the conspiracy (such as planning meetings or other overt acts) occurred within the DA's jurisdiction, they would have the authority to investigate and potentially prosecute those aspects of the crime. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a local DA does not have inherent authority over federal crimes or crimes committed in other states. \n\nOption C is plausible but incorrect. While cooperation between jurisdictions does occur, a DA doesn't need special permission to investigate activities that occurred within their own jurisdiction, even if related to a crime committed elsewhere. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it fails to account for the possibility of conspiracy charges based on actions within the DA's jurisdiction, even if the main crime occurred elsewhere.\n\nThis question tests understanding of jurisdictional limits and the nature of conspiracy charges in criminal law."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7583/can-the-cashier-be-held-liable-for-credit-card-fraud-if-procedure-isnt-followed", "docs_id": 7583, "title": "Can the cashier be held liable for credit card fraud if procedure isn&#39;t followed?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Since the liability shift back in October, retailers are now liable for credit card fraud that occurs through them. This is to encourage them to move to the more secure chip and pin POS systems, but many retailers have not made said switch and instead have adopted more rigorous verification methodologies for the old system.\n\nOne such system I have seen requires the cashier to check the ID of the customer and match it with the card, as well as match the last four digits of the card with the last for digits that were read by the card reader. Other procedures require signature checking and other such things.\n\nMy question is this, if the cashier does not follow one or all of these steps (cashiers are required to maintain a certain speed, these procedures are very time consuming) and fraud occurs, then is the company able to transfer liability to its employee on the grounds that procedures were in place to prevent it, but were not followed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In theory, yes; in practice no.\n\nAt common law, an employer is [vicariously liable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_liability) for the negligent actions of an employee performed in the course of employment, and the employee is also liable to third\\-parties but can claim indemnity from the employer. The employer can sue the employee for breach of contract and win (see [Lister v Romford Ice Cold Storage](http://www.safetyphoto.co.uk/subsite/case%20i%20j%20k%20l/lister_v_romford_ice__cold_storage.htm)), however, such suits are rarely brought and even more rarely successful.\n\nThis is partly because of the bad publicity such cases generate but mostly because many jurisdictions have introduced laws to stop them like the NSW [Employee's Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ela1991217/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A retail company implements strict procedures for credit card transactions to avoid liability for fraud.

The answer explains that employers are generally vicariously liable for employee actions during employment. Although employers can sue employees for breach of contract, such cases are uncommon and often unsuccessful. This is due to potential negative publicity and laws in many jurisdictions that protect employees from such liability transfers. Therefore, while legally possible, it's unlikely in practice for the company to successfully transfer liability to the cashier in this scenario."}}
