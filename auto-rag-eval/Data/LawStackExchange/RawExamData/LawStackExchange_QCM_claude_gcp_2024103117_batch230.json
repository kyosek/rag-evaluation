Does it cover both civil and criminal actions or just one or anothor\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An example of where this is not allowed is Seattle, WA.

I recognize that there is this meme about Seattle, but this is a distortion of an incident when the police turned a blind eye to a fight. We have police issues, no doubt: there is nothing legal about such fights. Of course, for a licensed event, you can \"fight\".\n\nOf course the potential legality depends on how mutual combat is defined. [Illinois v.

Using \"Like Spotify for podcasts\" as a tagline could potentially lead to legal issues for trademark infringement. This use does not fall under nominative use, which is when a trademark is used to refer to the actual product or service it represents. In this case, the new service is not actually Spotify, but is comparing itself to Spotify.\n\nA is incorrect because this use likely doesn't qualify as fair use in trademark law. Fair use typically applies when a trademark is used descriptively, not as a comparison or to leverage another brand's recognition.\n\nB is incorrect because this isn't truly comparative advertising. Comparative advertising typically involves direct comparisons between competing products, often with specific claims or features being compared.\n\nD is incorrect because changing the wording to \"Better than Spotify for podcasts\" doesn't resolve the fundamental issue. While this might be closer to comparative advertising, it still uses Spotify's trademark without permission and could still be problematic.\n\nThe key issue here is that the company is attempting to use another brand's trademark to define or promote their own product, which is generally not allowed without permission from the trademark owner."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81965/would-sentient-aliens-be-legal-persons", "docs_id": 81965, "title": "Would sentient aliens be legal persons?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose some sentient aliens figure out how to receive our radio and TV broadcasts.

defendant should be released from custody prior to trial, and over what terms of pre\\-trial release are appropriate.\n\nThe attorney can advise the client not to do anything else that would make it easier for the prosecution to prove the client committed the crime (e.g. advising the client not to brag about having committed the crime on social media).\n\nThe attorney can advise the client on how to behave in the courtroom so as to avoid contempt of court sanctions, and how to dress and behave appropriately and in a manner that the court will find to be sympathetic (e.g. wearing a suit to court, acting respectfully, not speaking ill of the victim).\n\nThere are a variety of defenses not inconsistent with guilt that are available:\n\n* One can argue that the statute of limitations has run.\n* One can argue that the court that the case is being tried before does not have jurisdiction over the offense.\n* One can argue that the crime was committed prior to the effective date of the law, or after it was repealed (if relevant).\n* One can argue that the law in invalid under human rights treaties or similar grounds for invalidity.\n* One can argue that the defendant has immunity from prosecution (e.g. due to diplomatic immunity, or because the defendant was acting pursuant to lawful military or court orders, or because of an agreement reached with a prosecutor previously perhaps in exchange for testimony in another case, or because the defendant acted based upon assurances from an authority upon whom he was entitled to rely that his actions would not be punished)\n* One can argue that evidence is inadmissible for some legally recognized reason (e.g. lack of authentication or doctor\\-patient privilege or a marital privilege).\n* One can argue that the facts presented by the prosecution don't establish the elements of the crime charged (e.g. no evidence has been presented that permission to use the property was not granted in a trespass case).\n* One can argue that the facts presented don't establish the elements of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt even if some evidence is presented (but subject to limitations on what kinds of doubts may be suggested).\n* One can make an insanity defense, or a lack of capacity to commit a crime defense.\n* One can argue that a justification (e.g. self\\-defense) excuses the crime.\n\nIn the U.S., an attorney could implicitly or even expressly make a jury nullification argument, but I do not know if this would be permitted in New Zealand or not.\n\nBut one cannot argue, for example, that a different individual than your client committed the crime, or that the crime didn't happen at all.\n\nThis ethical limitation, by the way, is much more restrictive than the limitation under U.S. law, which prohibits an attorney from introducing evidence or testimony known to be false or fraudulent, but does not generally prohibit making arguments based upon possible inferences from the true facts that the attorney knows to be false inferences (i.e. the facts are true, but the conclusions that the lawyer asks the court to draw from the facts are not consistent with what really happened).\n\nFor example, a U.S. attorney could argue in a case with several co\\-defendants, that the victim might have been assaulted by one of the co\\-defendants rather than his client, based upon the evidence available, while a New Zealand attorney whose client had confessed to having assaulted the victim, couldn't ethically make that argument.\n\nA defense lawyer in either the U.S. or New Zealand could find a forensic science article showing that the technique used to link the bullet to the gun by police investigators is unreliable and use it to cross\\-examine a prosecution forensic expert.\n\nBut, a New Zealand lawyer, unlike a U.S. lawyer, could probably not argue that there is alibi evidence putting your client on the other side of town at the time that the coroner erroneously believes the time of death to have occurred.\n\nOf course, any counsel or advocacy provided by defense counsel in connection with a sentencing phase of the proceeding would also not be inconsistent with this ethical rule and, in practice, much of the value that a defense attorney adds to the process for a defendant comes at that stage of the case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question

The reason is simple: All of those countries signed the *Geneva Convention on Road Traffic.* According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Convention_on_Road_Traffic#Cross-border_vehicles), by signing the Convention, those countries agreed to respect each others technical requirements. As a result, any car *registered* in the US that *meets US technical requirements* can be legally driven on the roads of *any country* that signed the Convention.

How?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The modern rule in the UK is that copyright lasts until the end of the calendar year following 70 years after the death of the author. So if the author died in or later than 1953, it would be under copyright under this general rule.\n\nHowever, this wasn't always the rule and the museum speaks of a copyright revived in the 1990s. So I went down that rabbit hole of historical UK copyright legislation. I personally find it interesting, but it turned out to not be entirely determinative.\n\nIt all turns on publication date and date of death of the artist, neither of which I can find, with the museum only stating the artist was [active in the 1930s](https://collection.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/people/cp20240/s-r-wyatt). But even assuming the most favourable facts for this to still be copyright under a \"revived\" copyright, the latest date I can find for copyright to still remain under that regime is end of 2015\\.\n\n---\n\nPer *Copyright Act **1956*** [s. 3(4\\)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1956/74/section/3/enacted):\n\n> in the case of an engraving, if before the death of the author the engraving had not been published, the copyright shall continue to subsist until the end of the period of fifty years from the end of the calendar year in which it is first published;\n\nFor the fact pattern I'm outlining, we must assume the author died before publication. As for the engraving bit, s. 48 defines that lithographs are engravings, and while I am far from an expert in this field, skimming the [Wikipedia article on lithography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography), it does seem quite possible the poster could be a lithograph.\n\nI'll note here since you bring up who precisely would be the owner of the original copyright, that it does seem likely that the poster was a [work for hire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire), following the provisions of [s. 4(2\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1956/74/section/4/enacted). As such, the copyright would have indeed ultimately transferred to British Rail.\n\nJumping ahead a bit, the more precise year which the museum states is \"the 1990's\" is 1995 (we'll get to why). So in order for copyright to have first expired as per the museum's statement and the authors active years, we must assume a publication date between 1930\\-1945 (or thereabouts, I'm not being super careful in this answer about the months things happen in, so there may be accumulation of off\\-by\\-one errors).\n\nBecause of those years, I now have to quickly address why the *Copyright Act **1911*** isn't relevant. The transitional provisions outlined in the [Seventh Schedule](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1956/74/schedule/SEVENTH/enacted) reveal that only for photographs are the copyright duration provisions maintained from the 1911 Act.\n\n---\n\nNow we can jump into the modern law, the *Copyright, Designs and Patents Act **1988*** (*CDPA*). The transitional provision in the [Schedule 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/schedule/1/enacted) s. 12(2\\)(b) directly maintains the 1956 copyright duration in this case which given our possible publication years, would have led to copyright expiry sometime between 1980\\-1995\\.\n\nHowever, in 1995, the UK passed *The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations **1995***. This was in accordance with European legislation harmonizing copyright duration, in *[Directive 93/98/EEC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31993L0098)* (itself since replaced by *[Directive 2006/116/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32006L0116)*).\n\n*Side Note: 1995 is a peculiar year for copyrights in Europe due to that directive and so is exactly where I started my research for this answer, because it caused weird quirks for copyright terms in some countries in some cases.*\n\nFor the UK, [s. 5](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/3297/regulation/5/made) of the regulation amended the *CDPA*, basically establishing the general European standard of copyrights expiring 70 years after the author's death.\n\nMore importantly for our case though is the regulations own section explaining in which cases the new copyright term expires. In [s. 16](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/3297/regulation/16/made):\n\n> The new provisions relating to duration of copyright apply\u2014 (a) \\[...] (b) \\[...] (c) \\[...] (d) to existing works in which copyright expired before 31st December 1995 but which were on 1st July 1995 protected in another EEA state under legislation relating to copyright or related rights.\n\nNow, I'm not going to go through and look at all the EEA contries legislation to confirm, but it seems incredibly likely that one of them would have had engravings protected for life\\+70 in 1995, given that's what Europe has now standardized on (since we're assuming pre\\-publication death for an author who was active in the 1930s).\n\nNotably, [s. 17](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/3297/regulation/17/made) even defines cases of expired works re\\-entering copyright as \"revived copyright\", matching the terminology the museum's statement used.\n\nIt would have been great if the 1995 regulation explicitly spelled out the relationship with *CDPA*'s Schedule 1 s. 12, but in judicial interpretation, newer legislation takes priority, so the 1995 law would control.\n\n*Note: The answer is getting long enough so I'm not going to fully research/cite this, but for regulations vs. legislation, we have a weird case of a regulation amending a statute. I'm fairly certain this is due to UK Acts passed for European Community membership elevating regulations to primary legislation when they are passed for compliance with European law.*\n\nSo given our assumed facts, the poster would have revived copyright per the 1995 Regulations. However, you may note (as I belatedly did after first posting this answer) that even given revived copyright, that revived copyright is still life\\+70\\. And the assumptions made for copyright revival under this clause requires a posthumous publication date of 1945 at the latest. This means at best any copyright under these particular circumstances would have expired in 2015\\.\n\n---\n\nThere is a bit of a middle ground here. If the poster is not a lithograph, or the publication was not posthumous, the work would have gained a life\\+50 term per aformentioned *Copyright Act 1956* [s. 3(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1956/74/section/3/enacted). But then for copyright to expire and be revived, we still have to assume a 1945 death date at the latest.\n\nAlternatively, instead of copyright revival, it could have gotten extended from life\\+50 to life\\+70 per the 1995 Regulations [s. 16(c)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1995/3297/regulation/16/made). But because we are more than 20 years from 1995, it mathematically works out that it doesn't matter anymore and we can just work with the life\\+70 rule.\n\nA combination of 1995 Regulations s. 16(c) and posthumous publication though does actually give another reasonable way for the work to still be under copyright.

The copyright status of the 1930s poster is complex due to changes in UK copyright law over time. While many scenarios could lead to the copyright having expired, there's a possibility it's still valid under specific circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all works from the 1930s are automatically in the public domain. Copyright duration depends on various factors including the artist's death date and publication date.\n\nOption B oversimplifies the situation. While the general rule is life plus 70 years, there are exceptions, particularly for works published posthumously.\n\nOption C correctly identifies a scenario where the copyright could still be valid. If the poster is considered an engraving (which could include lithographs) and was published posthumously between 1973-1988, it could be protected for 50 years from publication under the Copyright Act 1956, potentially extending protection to 2038.\n\nOption D is incorrect because copyright is not permanent, even if it was revived in the 1990s.

There is no aspect of the current contract which guarantees future tenure, and it is standard that the rules of tenure can change and untenured faculty must follow whatever the current rule is at the time one is reviewed for tenure. That would include the elimination of tenure. The university rules say that the university rules can be changed (and describe how those changes are made). However, university rules are subordinate to the statutes governing the universities, and you can't sue the legislature for breach of contract.

State legislatures have the authority to determine how public institutions, including universities, are run. The current contracts and university rules do not guarantee future tenure opportunities, and it is standard practice that untenured faculty must follow whatever rules are in place at the time of their tenure review. Additionally, university rules are subordinate to state statutes, so changes in state law would supersede any existing university policies. The professor would likely lose the case because there is no breach of contract when the rules change due to new legislation.

For example; an author writes a book in 2009 and in 2020, re\\-edits the book with new material. Does this new material benefit from the earlier copyright? What if the author is suspected of infringement with this new material only, in 2021, by a second author who published his work in 2015? Is the first author accountable to the second? How can it be proven if all the old copies have been removed from the shelves?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nThe author of a derivative work only gets a copyright on content that is original to the derivative work. There is no new copyright on content from the source work. The author of a revised edition only gets a new copyright on new content in the revised edition (provided that it is original).\n\nThis used to be more important when a copyright term was calculated from the year of publication. Now it is important only in edge cases, such as when it is claimed that the new content was copied from another work, and is infringing. The date of publication is now less important because the copyright in most things that a specific author writes expires at the same time: 70 years after he or she dies (works published anonymously and works made for hire are exceptions to this rule).\n\nThe relevant US law is [17 USC 103](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#103), which provides that:\n\n> (a) The subject matter of copyright as specified by section 102 includes compilations and derivative works, but protection for a work employing preexisting material in which copyright subsists does not extend to any part of the work in which such material has been used unlawfully.\n> \n> \n> (b) The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the preexisting material.\n\nIf Author A writes and has published a book in 2009, A owns the copyright on it (unless A sells or transfers it). Let us suppose that Author B writes a different book on a related subject in 2015, and then A publishes a revised edition of the 2009 book in 2020\\. In 2021 B accuses A of having copied content from the 2015 book without permission, and incorporating such infringing content into the 2020 edition. A claims that this content was already present in the 2009 edition. How can A prove this defense?\n\nCommercial publishers pretty much always retain a few copies of every edition, even if a newer edition is the only one offered for sale. In any case, a commercially published US book will essentially always be registered with the Copyright office, whch means that a copy will have been sent to the Library of Congress, and that copy can be checked.\n\nMoreover, B is not likely to even file such a suit unless B's lawyers have a copy of the 2009 edition and can show that the copied content was not found in it.\n\nIf it were proved to the satisfaction of a court that A had, in the 2020 edition, copied from B's 2015 book, A would be liable for damages to B, the amount determined by the court, and B could also get an injunction stopping distribution of the 2020 edition.\n\nLaws in other countries on these points are generally similar.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Author Alice wrote a book in 2010 and published a revised edition in 2022 with new material.

According to copyright law, particularly 17 USC 103, the copyright in a derivative work (such as Alice's 2022 revised edition) extends only to the new material contributed by the author. This new copyright is independent of and does not affect the copyright of the preexisting material from the 2010 edition. The new material in the 2022 edition receives its own copyright protection, separate from the original 2010 content.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the entire 2022 edition does not receive new copyright protection; only the new, original additions do.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while proving the content was in the 2010 edition would be a strong defense, it doesn't automatically protect Alice from the claim. The court would still need to evaluate the evidence.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the availability of the 2010 edition on shelves doesn't determine the validity of Bob's claim.

It's not a universal legal phrase. Furthermore, it is a slang expression like \"Murder One.\" I doubt any jurisdiction has a crime of \"Grand theft, auto.\" It might be \"Grand theft, automobile.\"\n\n\"Theft\" or \"larceny\" is a common law crime. \"Grand theft\" (or \"Grand Larceny\") is statutory crime that usually imposes a higher penalty for the theft of a higher value item(s). Not all jurisdictions even have \"grand theft.\"\n\nThe taking of an automobile may be defined as a simple larceny or it may be defined as a separate crime of auto theft.

The documentation explains that API licensing and source code licensing can be separate concerns. A company can release open-source code while still maintaining control over the API usage through licensing and technical means. The API can be hosted as a service, requiring users to accept specific terms and possibly pay fees, regardless of the source code's license.

True/false?\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When a contract states a thing that you get for a stated price, that means you should get the thing described, and you pay the stated price. If the landlord makes a mistake and wishes he had charged more, he can wait until the end of the lease period and then increase the price as he desires. He cannot raise the price until the end of the contract, and cannot retroactively charge that increase. (It's impossible to imagine there being contract language that allows that outcome, but we will assume there is no such clause).\n\nIf the stated area is not as stated, especially if the area is actually smaller, the landlord is in breach of the contract, and could be sued for damages. It would depends on how different the areas are, when it comes to assigning damages. For example, 4 sqm in a unit with 800 sqm is not likely to result in any loss to the tenant. If the unit is bigger than stated, the prospects for damages are even less, perhaps a bit for added heating cost.

According to contract law principles, when a lease agreement specifies a set price for a described property, both parties are bound by those terms for the duration of the contract. The landlord's miscalculation is their own error and does not give them the right to retroactively change the agreed-upon rent.

If compensation is required, usually money is returned instead of the item.\n\nIn the examples, the outcome of the two latter is somewhat easy to deduce: the land for parking is returned, and the owner of the land under the highway instead gets payment for his land that becomes government property.\n\nThe car with the smashed window would be generally returned to its real owner if he was not involved in the crime.\n\nCorrect Order Of Operations\n---------------------------\n\nSo technically, the Police *first* seize an item, then the court rules the item to be confiscated, which means it becomes government property.\n\n### Forfeiture?\n\nForfeiture is only different from Confiscation in the process of how it happens. Forfeiture and Confiscation both have the same outcome but at times different means. In older legal texts, the two words always come together: Confiscation and Forfeiture.\n\nIn modern parlance, Confiscation is usually used when the seizure of an illegal thing happens, such as drugs, where Forfeiture is used when a legal thing is demanded by the government, such as land.\n\nSee also, in the US, [Civil Asset Forfeiture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) and Criminal Asset Forfeiture.\n\nIndia \\& Confiscation\n---------------------\n\nIn India, there are actually many more laws that confiscate or forfeit items or land to the government, [as this article elaborates](https://advocatechenoyceil.com/2020/03/21/confiscation-and-forfeiture-of-properties-in-india). The most relevant one seems to be the Criminal Procedure Code (1973\\), which deals with property *in general*, when criminal charges are dealt with:\n\n> 452.

The term \"style\" in \"style of cause\" has a complex etymological history. It originates from the Latin word \"stilus,\" which initially meant a writing instrument. Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the act of using this instrument to write a name, then to refer to the name itself, and finally to any official name or title.

The same distinction between portions of a ruling that are binding precedents and those that are mere dicta also applies in all other appellate courts in a common law legal system such as India's.\n\nAlso, a portion of a court decision is not *dicta* merely because it is far reaching. A binding precedent can be broad or narrow in the deciding court's discretion. What makes \"dicta\" distinct is that it is literally \"off topic\" and not literally controlled by the potentially broad principles used to decide the case before the Court. What determines whether a part of the ruling is \"off topic\" is the exact scope of the issue that the court states that it is resolving.\n\nFor example, if the Court states that it is resolving the question of \"due process in an admiralty case\" and remarks on due process in an ordinary non\\-admiralty case, the later remarks are dicta. But if the court states that it is resolving the question of \"due process in a legal proceeding\" then the same statement is not dicta.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The Supreme Court of India issues a ruling in a case involving maritime law.

In Indian jurisprudence, as in other common law systems, dicta are not binding precedent. However, because they come from the Supreme Court, they carry persuasive authority.

As this would seem unfair to tenants.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no law requiring a person to say nice things about you, or specifically for a landlord to give a positive recommendation. However, you can sue a person for defamation, if they have said untrue things that harmed you. You would then need to show that he said things, that they were untrue, and that you were harmed. The main issue on the first point would what exactly he said. A subjective stars rating is neither true nor false, nor is a comment \"I would give negative 5 stars if it were possible\". The statement \"Smith abandoned his apartment without giving the required 60 day notice, thus breaching his lease\" could be true or false. You would then need to provide believable evidence that the statement is false. You would need to hire an attorney versed in local defamation law and practices to know whether your evidence would be deemed sufficiently credible, but on the face of it, you have fairly good evidence (assuming that they don't have iron\\-clad proof that you never entered the office). Then you would have to prove that you were harmed, requiring some legal remedy. One out\\-there option would be to sue them for a million dollars: it is unlikely that you actually suffered a million dollars damage. On the minimal side, you reputation has been besmirched, and a letter retracting the accusation would certainly be appropriate. Your attorney would advise you of the best remedy.\n\nIt is not always necessary to file a lawsuit and pursue the matter through the courts. One might get a satisfactory result by having an attorney write a letter outlining the wrong that the other party has committed, and what you want by way of remedy. Even before that, you can (for free) inform them of what actually happened and mention that you'd prefer not to have the courts resolve the matter.\n\nIt is not clear whether you mean that the former landlord is suing you for breach. If so, your concern would be showing that you complied with the terms of the lease, especially that you did deliver the notice to the correct location in the correct manner in a timely fashion. Leases do not typically include onerous notice requirements (whereas legal notices may require delivery by certified mail). Again, the main factual question would be whether you did comply (and thus did not break the leash).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant, Sarah, gave a 60-day notice to vacate to her apartment complex's front desk, but the complex lost it.

She would need to prove that the landlord's statement was false, that it caused her harm, and seek an appropriate remedy. The documentation mentions that suing for a large sum of money is unlikely to succeed if the actual damages aren't that high. Instead, a more appropriate remedy might be a retraction of the false statement.

In many cases (likely nearly all cases), if you show up in court and provide documents that your insurance is current, and was current at the time the ticket was issued, the judge (or the prosecutor) will likely dismiss the case with no penalties.

All boldings and italics are mine.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A security interest is an interest that only extends as a security, i.e. \"Property that is given or pledged to guarantee the performance of an obligation\".\n\nSo for example, a bank mortgaging a house has a security interest in the property, allowing them to do things such as force a foreclosure sale in certain circumstances, as well as claim their money immediately if the property is sold; likewise, a car title loan issuer has a security interest in the car their loan is based off of. This doesn't have to be a loan debt; it can be a performance bond, such as a bail bond to appear in court.\n\nA security interest does not extend to the property itself, merely the obligation. So, for example, if you default on a home loan, the mortgage company can foreclose and force a sale, but they cannot claim all of the money of the sale, only the portion corresponding to the debt (e.g. if you default on a debt that is currently 100k, secured by one's house, and the house sells in foreclose for 200k, the bank can only keep 100k (plus allowed fees); the remainder must be paid to the former owner).\n\nA property interest that is not a security interest is an interest in the property itself. So for example, owning a portion of a house, via an inheritance, is a property interest; because it is not a guarantee for anything, it is not a security interest. Or in other words, a property that is not a security interest is the \"default\" state, with said property interest only becoming a security interest if it is pledged in some manner.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John and Sarah are siblings who inherited their parents' house jointly.

One may not, under UK copyright law (or indeed under any copyright law) simply copy the words and phrases used by someone else, even with trivial changes, to avoid the effort of composing one's own words to express an idea or describe and event. a [close paraphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphrasing_of_copyrighted_material) will generally be considered an infringement of copyright.\n\nHowever, copyright does not protect ideas. A journalist may describe an event, basing the account on the3 accounts of other journalists. As long as the new account does not directly copy or closely imitate the source accounts, it will probably not be treated as an infringement of copyright.\n\nThe \"fair dealing\" in UK law is a narrower exception to copyright than the US concept of \"fair use\". According to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing#United_Kingdom):\n\n> Under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA), fair dealing is limited to the following purposes: research and private study (both must be non\\-commercial), criticism / review / quotation, and news reporting (sections 29, 30, 178\\); as well as parody, caricature and pastiche (section 30A) and illustration for teaching.\n\nSo unless the use by the second journalist fits one of those categories, fair dealing will not apply. If the copied content is incorporated into a commercially published article, it fairly obviously is not for the purpose of \"research and private study\" or \"illustration for teaching\". It might well, however, be for \"news reporting\" or one of the other fair dealing purposes, and the detailed facts of the matter would be used to determine if this was a case of fair dealing or not.\n\nArticle 2 paragraph (8\\) of the [Berne Copyright Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) says that:\n\n> The protection of this Convention shall not apply to news of the day or to miscellaneous facts having the character of mere items of press information.\n\nSection 30 paragraph (2\\) the [UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III) says:\n\n> Fair dealing with a work (other than a photograph) for the purpose of reporting current events does not infringe any copyright in the work provided that (subject to subsection (3\\)) it is accompanied by a sufficient acknowledgement.\n\nTaken literally these provisions would seem to mean that there is no copyright at all on news reports in the UK. I do not believe that that is a correct interpretation.

The leading case is [R v Rondo](https://www.gotocourt.com.au/criminal-law/nsw/unlawful-searches-reasonable-suspicion/) where the court said:\n\n> reasonable suspicion involves\u00a0less than a reasonable belief but more than a possibility.

There is skill and science involved, and both actuaries for earthquake insurers and government officials do and can make predictions and be paid for making predictions (*ex ante*), and a \"success bonus\" would not be improper.\n\nAt the current levels of scientific knowledge, sufficiently detailed individual predictions are effectively random, but this is also true, for example, for futures markets in agricultural commodities which depend to some extent on weather prediction beyond the scope of current scientific knowledge.\n\nUltimately, I would be surprised if a court held that a prediction market was a form of illegal gambling. Gambling law enforcement in the U.S. is not vigorous, and judges and prosecutors and regulatory agencies have taken note of the fact that true gambling in a variety of forms has been legalized in various contexts, so the public policy against gambling and the will of the key legal actors to enforce edge cases of a prohibition that has increasingly more exceptions to it, seems unlikely. This is particularly true given that economists would be available to testify as to the public policy benefits of prediction markets that set them apart from idle gambling with no positive externalities.\n\nSo, while this isn't a clear cut case, I would expect that a prediction market would not be held to be illegal as a form of gambling. But, it still might be subject to regulation either as a form of commodity market, or as a public contest, or perhaps under principles applicable to trusts and to contracts that are open to being accepted by multiple parties.

The source suggests that obtaining an opinion letter from an attorney or seeking an advanced ruling from relevant government agencies would be the safer course of action.

But follow\\-up questions are significantly more important because there is where a defamer is likelier to incur contradictions. Keep in mind that a defamer will hardly ever admit guilt, whence a plaintiff needs skill to evidence the defamer's liability.\n\nAlthough you can expect the defendant to be coached by her lawyer toward deposition, there is only so much that either crook can foresee or predict as to what direction your questioning will take. No lawyer can spoon\\-feed his client on every imaginable question that is relevant to the case. In this regard, the limit is your abilities to plan your questions as well as to \"think quick on your feet\".\n\nA defamer is allowed to answer evasively (saying \"I don't know\", \"I don't recall\", or the like) on written interrogatory, a deposition, or a trial. The difference is that in a written interrogatory the defamer's lawyer has (and will use) the perfect opportunity to fabricate any and all answers, thereby defeating the purpose of follow\\-up questions.\n\nWhether the defendant's answers shift over the course of litigation, that should be the least of your concerns. In fact, the defendant's significant shift might result in the defendant's loss of credibility before the jury.\n\nYou did not specify your jurisdiction.

You are welcome to all other records of the case I have uploaded [here](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/viggers-v-pacha_74.html), but the briefs in the MI Supreme Court as well as the SCOTUS (and to a great extent in the MI Court Of Appeals) are most concise, and they reflect more proficiency than what can be expected in a pro se litigant's initial motions.\n\nThis [transcript of defendant's deposition](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9pwLmQ-UixYcGI1cFN6TGJqTWs) might also be of your interest. You will notice the defamer answered \"*I don't know*\" and \"*I don't recall*\" to the point of sounding demented.

In that transcript, you will also notice his lawyer's [misconduct](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HFP9-tZFBtZUMUvo3cGGVdJjgMvLgckK) during the defamer's deposition.

If a defense witness is taken out of order, something that a defense witness says could inadvertently tip the balance by establishing some minor but mandatory element of some offense that the prosecution failed to include it its \"case in chief\".\n\nFor example, maybe the relevant statute requires that the defendant be over the age of eighteen to be guilty of a crime (e.g. statutory rape), and the prosecution forgets to ask a question about the defendant's age in their case in chief, so the prosecution fails to prove that element of the crime. If a defense witness taken out of order says that \"I've known the defendant since I went to his fifth birthday party in 1980\\.\", that could be the difference between having the case reversed on appeal and affirming a conviction on that count. So the defense is reluctant to allow its witnesses to be taken out of order.\n\nAfter the prosecution has presented its \"case in chief\", and the defense has presented its \"case in chief\", the prosecution may then present rebuttal witnesses to the testimony of the defense witnesses, and often, the defense may then present rebuttal witnesses to the prosecution's rebuttal witnesses. After the prosecution completes its case in chief, the defense has the right, if it wishes to do so, to present no additional evidence whatsoever.\n\nIn a criminal trial, the prosecution often presents many witnesses and the defense often presents far fewer witnesses, but that is not a hard and fast rule.\n\nOften the defense presents very little evidence for reasons similar to its reasons for not wanting to take a defense witness out of order.\n\nFor example, suppose a prosecution witness on a key point is not very credible. Offering a defense witness on that point who is also not very credible could bolster the jury's opinion of the prosecution witness's credibility, or could simply help to corroborate that \"something\" definitely happened that was memorable when the crime was allegedly committed, even if their accounts are not identical.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal trial, which of the following scenarios regarding witness testimony order is most accurate?\n\nA) The defense can freely intersperse its witnesses with prosecution witnesses to create a more balanced narrative.\n\nB) The prosecution presents all its witnesses, followed by the defense, but rebuttal witnesses from either side can be called at any time.\n\nC) The prosecution presents its case-in-chief, then the defense presents its case-in-chief, after which the prosecution may present rebuttal witnesses, and finally the defense may present rebuttal to the prosecution's rebuttal.\n\nD) The judge determines the order of witnesses based on their availability and the logical flow of evidence presentation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is correct because it accurately describes the typical order of witness testimony in a criminal trial. The prosecution presents its case-in-chief first, followed by the defense's case-in-chief. After this, the prosecution may present rebuttal witnesses to counter the defense's evidence, and the defense may then present rebuttal to the prosecution's rebuttal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the defense does not typically intersperse its witnesses with the prosecution's. This would be highly unusual and could potentially harm the defense's case.\n\nOption B is partially correct but ultimately incorrect because while the prosecution does present its witnesses first, followed by the defense, rebuttal witnesses cannot be called at any time. They are typically called after both sides have presented their main cases.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the judge does not typically determine the order of witnesses.

City of Rancho Palos Verdes&quot; was Financially Unable", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Here is a sort of transcript of the case *Joannou v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes*: [https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca\\-court\\-of\\-appeal/1644364\\.html](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1644364.html). In short, there was a piece of land that had been gradually migrating due to Earth movements over a few decades. It ended up in a section claimed by the city. Joannou had bought the land after it had migrated into City territory, and the City claimed Joannou could not own the land. Joannou and other homeowners sued on the basis of the Cullen Earthquake Act, which said that in the event of a disaster moving the land, the boundaries would be withdrawn. The Court ruled that the Cullen's Act did not apply, and part of their reasoning was that the appellants could have done things to make the houses immovable, like anchoring them to the bedrock. They had other reasoning like citing the dictionary definition of disaster was that is was sudden, not gradual, and that there had been an earlier case similar to this.\n\nBut let's say that one of the appellants could not afford to take those measures like anchoring. I have two questions:\n\n1. There was one appellant, and this appellant could not afford to take those measures. Would the court have ruled in the appellants favor, assuming the other reasoning held true?\n2. If the answer to (1\\) is Yes, then what if there were multiple appellants, and one of those appellants could not afford. Would an exception be made for that appellant?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Failure to engage in preventative measures, be it by negligence, ignorance, or financial inability, is not a defense. If they couldn't afford it, then they couldn't afford that property's risks, and they can either choose to suffer those risks or do something like sell it off to someone else (who might have been able to do something) or not buy it at all and consider some other property (housing markets providing you few to no options is also not a defense). Your hypothetical is similar to saying \"I didn't have (enough) accident insurance, and was ordered to pay $1m in damages for an accident I caused. I couldn't afford the (additional) insurance, though, but if I could have I would have gotten it and I wouldn't have to pay these damages personally. Therefore I shouldn't have to pay these damages.\" Which is clearly nonsense. Granted, in most US jurisdictions you are required to have some minimum amount of accident insurance to drive legally, but probably there are no laws regarding your home being anchored to bedrock. The key here is that those minimums can be quite low, and paying extra can get you substantially more coverage (both in breadth and value). But nobody gets a pass for not being able to afford the more extensive coverage they may have otherwise desired. Similarly, a home being anchored to bedrock may go above and beyond the minimum necessary, but is required to fully protect yourself against certain things. If you don't do it, you aren't protected, regardless of your reasons and circumstances.\n\nThe only circumstance I could image being an exception, unless explicitly encoded by the local law, is government malfeasance or gross negligence: e.g. you took all of the steps to get the proper permits and anchoring done, but the government *intentionally* (or through gross negligence) failed to grant them until such time as the property drift converted your property into government property. Possibly then a court would rule against the government, but off hand I'm not aware of any such cases (and the ruling may just be to pay the homeowner a fair price, rather than to redraw property lines). And in any case, *proving* the intentionality or gross negligence may be difficult, depending on how much deference the court gives the government and their likely claims of everything having been within normal and acceptable bureaucratic timeframes and delays.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Joannou v. City of Rancho Palos Verdes, the court ruled against the appellants partly because they could have taken measures to prevent their property from moving, such as anchoring houses to bedrock. If a similar case arose where one appellant could prove they couldn't afford such measures, which of the following outcomes is most likely based on legal principles?\n\nA) The court would rule in favor of that specific appellant due to financial hardship, but maintain the ruling against other appellants.\n\nB) The court would rule in favor of all appellants, as one party's inability to afford preventative measures invalidates the expectation for all.\n\nC) The court would still rule against all appellants, as financial inability to take preventative measures does not constitute a valid legal defense.\n\nD) The court would require the city to pay for preventative measures for those who can't afford them, then rule based on whether those measures were implemented.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to legal principles, an individual's financial inability to take preventative measures or afford insurance against risks does not constitute a valid legal defense. The court would likely maintain its ruling against all appellants, regardless of their financial situations. This is similar to how inability to afford more comprehensive insurance doesn't exempt someone from liability in an accident. The law expects property owners to either manage the risks associated with their property or choose not to own property they cannot afford to maintain or protect.

There might be some specific law in a particular jurisdiction, and the question does not say where this is assumed to occur.\n\nIf a person actively impersonates a store employee, say by \"selling\" an item to a would\\-be customer and keeping the money, that would be fraud, or perhaps \"theft by deception\". If a person pretending to be a store employee gives a patron advice as if from an employee, say on whether a product has a specific feature, that is IMO unethical, but probably not illegal. If a person pretending to be an employee runs down the store and advises a patron to go elsewhere to shop, that might be \"interference with a commercial relationship\" which is a cause for a civil action in some places, I understand. Certainly the management would object.\n\nIf the management notices such a fake employee, I think they would tell that person to leave the store. Failing to do so, or returning later, would then be trespass.\n\nCopying the store logo might well be a technical infringement of copyright, but as long as there is no economic damage, a copyright suit is IMO quite unlikely.

I'm trying to figure out if it was actually written correctly or not...\n\nSo this guy assaulted another guy, pretty much. It was a pretty messy assault, though, and they both wound up with injuries although the victim didn't get the chance to fight back before the attacker stopped. Nobody witnessed the assault, but the police showed up after the fact and arrested the attacker, but not the victim.\n\nA while later, the victim is subpoenaed to court. The attacker has a lawyer. He didn't hire the lawyer, though, one was provided for him. The attacker is being charged with attempted murder. When the victim is called to the stand, he says it wasn't attempted murder. The thing is that the attacker and the victim were actually friends, they just got into a heated argument, and the one guy just took it too far and attacked the other guy. On the stand, the victim says that the attacker wasn't trying to kill him, he was just trying to beat him up a little to scare him off, pretty much.\n\nThe judge concludes that it wasn't attempted murder, but aggravated assault, and the attacker is sentenced to six months in prison. The attacker is sent to a holding cell, requests to speak with the victim, and the victim shows up.

Thanks in advance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some of this will vary by Jurisdiction, that is by country, and by state in the US, or by province in some other countries. This answer will be focused on the US. Other answers may address other countries.\n\n> Why did they only arrest the attacker and not the victim?\n\nThere is not enough information here to say, but stories from participants or witnesses could have made it clear who the attacker was. If the police believed that one party was only defending himself, they might well arrest only the attacker.\n\n> Can the victim be subpoenaed to court?\n\nYes, the victim can be subpoenaed just as any witness can be. In some areas a victim is routinely subpoenaed even if s/he si expected to attend voluntarily. \n\n> Could they have actually done anything without the victim present?\n\nYes, if there is enough evidence. The victim rarely takes the stand in murder cases, after all. However, in some cases there is simply not enough evidence aside from the testimony of the victim, so that becomes vital to the case. But if there were many other credible witnesses, the prosecutor might choose not to call the victim. The prosecutor has wide latitude on what witnesses to call and what evidence to presnent, and what charges to bring.\n\n> Would the attacker have been put in a holding cell?\n\nS/he might have, that would depend on the policy of the local police, and the facilities the police had available.\n\n> Could he have requested to see the victim? This seems like the \"one phone call\" thing to me, but is that possible here?\n\nS/he could **ask**, but the police would not be required to grant any such request. Indeed permitting this would be a bit unusual, but not unheard of. Usually a visitor would not see a person in a cell, but in some sort of room for the purpose. Details vary. (**Edit** Comment suggest this is even less plausible than I had thought, unless this is set several decades or more ago. It probably dosen't change the plot much if the attacker was brought to some sort of conference room or visitor's room instead.)\n\n> Is the victim's testimony enough to actually reduce the sentence down to aggravated assault? Is six months too short of a time?\n\nIf the judge or jury believed the testimony that there was no intent to kill, then a conviction of aggravated assault would be possible, as a *lesser included offense*. But this would depend on the totality of the evidence, and the way in which the finder of fact (judge or jury) interpreted it, and whether all the elements of aggravated assault had been proved, and whether any elements of attempted murder had **not** been proved. In those jurisdictions that I know about, intent to kill is an element of attempted murder.\n\nAs for the sentence, 6 months is not, I think, outside the range of plausibility for aggravated assault, depending on the facts and the view taken by the judge. The Judge has wide discretion to choose a sentence up to the maximum allowed by law, or much lower. The \"usual sentence\" varies by jurisdiction, and does not bind the judge anyway. \n\n> Would the attacker just go back to normal after his release? Would there be any further punishments or restrictions?\n\nThe court could impose an additional term of probation, with various restrictions, depending on the local law, and the choice of the Judge. These might include staying employed, not getting into other fights, not owning a firearm, taking anger management courses, or other possibilities. Failure to comply with such conditions might lead to a person being sent back to jail/prison. The Judge does not have to impose any such restrictions however. \n\n> Could the victim change his testimony afterward and reopen the case? Or would that be unreliable?\n\nIt can happen, but reopening the case is far from automatic. Generally a court has to order the case reopened, and courts generally are reluctant to do so.\n\n> How many years would the attacker have been facing for the original attempted murder?\n\nProbably quite a few, but this varies a good deal by jurisdiction. And the Judge would have considerable discretion up to the maximum sentence permitted by the law in that jurisdiction.\n\n> Why did it take so long for the case to start?\n\nThe question does not say how long it took, but it is not uncommon for major cases to take several years before the start of the trial, partly because of the time taken to investigate, and partly because of backlogs in the court system. There are cases on record where the trial took place decades after the crime.

This is to block them out and thus prevent data collection through comments or personalized ads .\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Whatever the hypothetical new law is, the lowest\\-hanging fruit is Youtube, where India could take action against Youtube.

Indian courts might enter a similar judgment against YT, and in principle it could be enforced by blocking YT in India, which is not a trivial thing.\n\nThe other prong of legal attack would be against the channel owner. In the case of COPPA, the channel owner is also liable \u2013 for the Indian case, it would depends on what the act says. So the FTC can take action against a channel owner, although enforcement would be challenging in certain countries, but pursuant to [the court order](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/172_3083_youtube_coppa_consent_order_signed.pdf), YT could land in legal hot water if it *tolerates* violations by channel owners. The same would hold for the Indian hypothetical.

The example of the FTC's action against YouTube for COPPA violations in the US demonstrates that governments can take action against platforms like YouTube to enforce compliance with data protection laws. In this hypothetical scenario, the Indian government could potentially use similar tactics, such as the threat of blocking YouTube in India, to ensure the platform's cooperation. YouTube, in turn, would have \"complete leverage\" over channel owners and could enforce compliance to avoid legal issues.

If it makes a difference, this is under UK law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR allows the right to access to be limited if this access would \u201cadversely affect the rights and freedoms of others\u201d (Art 15(4\\) GDPR). However, **access to the recording would not give you more information than you've already received during the phone call**, so this exemption is quite unlikely to apply in any case.\n\nUK data protection law also has a large list of additional exceptions, as [summarized here by ICO guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/right-of-access/what-other-exemptions-are-there/). These exemptions also cover some aspects of trade secrets, and even mention insurance examples. However, not such exemption is likely to apply in your case: the recording would not give you more information than you already have.\n\nIf the data controller is concerned about some parts of the conversation, they should provide a redacted copy and explain why the redactions were performed. They should not reject the request outright.\n\nIf the data controller wants to reject the request entirely, they must do so within the time frame for the DSAR (one month), must explain their reasons, and must inform you that you're allowed to lodge a complaint with your supervisory authority or to sue them. However, [ICO guidance is flexible on how detailed the reason for refusal can be](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/right-of-access/when-can-we-refuse-to-comply-with-a-request/#refuse6):\n\n> Where an exemption applies, the reasons you give to an individual for not complying with a request may depend upon the particular case. For example, if telling an individual that you have applied a particular exemption would prejudice the purpose of that exemption, your response may be more general. However, where possible, you should be transparent about your reasons for withholding information.\n\nHere, I don't see any reason why full transparency would be a problem, so I would expect that the data controller can point to a specific exemption in UK data protection law.\n\nIf you are unsatisfied with the data controller's response, please consider lodging a complaint with the supervisory authority. In the UK, this is the ICO. On the [ICO complaints page](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/), you can fill out the online form about \u201cyour personal information concerns\u201d.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under UK data protection law, when can a company legitimately deny a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) for recorded phone conversations?\n\nA) When the recordings contain any third-party information, regardless of its sensitivity\nB) When providing access would reveal trade secrets or insurance policy details\nC) When the recordings contain information that could adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others, and this information wasn't already disclosed during the call\nD) When the company believes the request is part of an ongoing complaint against them\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the GDPR and UK data protection law, a company can deny a DSAR if providing access would \"adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others\" (Art 15(4) GDPR). However, this exemption is unlikely to apply if the information in the recordings was already disclosed during the call.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the mere presence of third-party information doesn't automatically justify denying the request. The company should attempt to provide a redacted version if possible.\n\nOption B is partially true but overly broad. While there are exemptions related to trade secrets and insurance in UK law, these don't universally apply to all such information, especially if it was already discussed with the requester.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The fact that a request is part of an ongoing complaint is not a valid reason to deny a DSAR.\n\nIt's important to note that if a company does deny a DSAR, they must do so within the specified timeframe, explain their reasons, and inform the requester of their right to complain to the supervisory authority (ICO in the UK) or pursue legal action."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24176/how-do-you-go-about-conducting-business-internationally", "docs_id": 24176, "title": "How do you go about conducting business internationally?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a few questions on this topic.

If your answer to both of the questions above is \"Yes\", can this process be scaled? (Company A wanting to repeat this process with other companies from different countries)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. No. A plaintiff may travel to the defendant's jurisdiction to file suit if desired. Nobody usually does this, though, due to travel and logistical considerations. The defendant is the one who decides whether to challenge jurisdiction.\n2. Good contacts will include a forum selection clause which would lay out what happens where in the event of a dispute. And this can be anywhere, it is not limited to the locations of the plaintiff and the defendant.\n3. N/A.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Company X, based in Japan, wants to enter into a service agreement with Company Y, based in Brazil. Company X has no presence in Brazil, and Company Y has no presence in Japan. Company X is concerned about legal protection and potential disputes. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal considerations for this international business agreement?\n\nA) Company X must establish a legal entity in Brazil to enforce its rights in case of a dispute.\nB) The contract must be based solely on Brazilian law to be enforceable.\nC) Company X can only sue Company Y in Japanese courts.\nD) The contract can include a forum selection clause specifying the jurisdiction and applicable laws for potential disputes.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because a well-drafted international contract can include a forum selection clause that specifies where and under which laws any potential disputes will be resolved. This allows the parties to choose a neutral or mutually agreeable jurisdiction, which doesn't have to be limited to either company's home country.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a foreign company is not required to have a local entity to enforce its legal rights in another country. They can file suit in the defendant's jurisdiction if necessary.\n\nOption B is false because the contract doesn't have to be based solely on Brazilian law. The parties can agree on the applicable laws in their contract.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it's overly restrictive. The ability to sue is not limited to the plaintiff's home country courts. The choice of court can be agreed upon by both parties or determined by relevant international agreements."}}
