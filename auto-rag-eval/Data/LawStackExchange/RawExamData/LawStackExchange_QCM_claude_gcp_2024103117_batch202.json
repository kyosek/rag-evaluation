References to *protected categories* are not a requisite element of *harassment*.\n\nTypically *harassment* is defined as a pattern of conduct (thus encompassing two or more acts) consisting of unconsented contact that would cause a reasonable person to be frightened, annoyed, distressed, molested, and/or experience other unpleasant emotions. See, for instance, the definition of harassment in Michigan legislation, [MCL 750\\.411h(1\\)(c)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(c52sqae3mdxfxetiqb4gkkmv))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-750-411h).\n\nThe notion of harassment can \\-\\-but does not necessarily\\-\\- involve targeting or attacking of one or multiple *protected categories* in which the victim belongs. For instance, sexual harassment is understood as harassment with purposes of mocking the victim's sexual orientation, or procuring sexual gratification from/with that person. The adjective \"*sexual*\" merely qualifies the context of the troubling pattern of conduct, but that term in and of itself is not what imports the character of harassment.\n\nThe examples in the paragraph you quote are inaccurate and/or inconclusive because they would highly depend on the context. The adjective \"*selfish*\" is not sufficiently related to Judaism, whence it would be unreasonable for a Jew to allege *religious harassment* merely because somebody called him \"selfish\". Instead, a finding of religious harassment would involve repulsive allusions to themes or elements to which Jews would be sensitive based on historical grounds (such as nazism, and antisemitism), doctrinary grounds (jokes about pigs), and so forth.\n\n> Where I can find a complete list that includes all the possible words?\n\nFor the reasons explained above, there is no such list. Words would have to be assessed in light of the context in which the course of conduct takes place.\n\nFurthermore, not all harassment involves words.

This definition does not require explicit references to protected characteristics, although such references can be a factor in certain types of harassment (e.g., sexual or racial harassment).\n\nOption A is incorrect because harassment does not always need to involve explicit references to protected characteristics. While such references can be a factor, they are not a necessary condition for conduct to be considered harassment.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a single instance of name-calling, especially over something trivial like shoes, would likely not meet the legal threshold for harassment.

What they take is an easement, but it seems just barely short of fee simple: the land reverts to the permanent owner or successor only if the railroad stops running trains along the track and thereby abandons the easement, but until then it seems to be entirely theirs. Railroads seem to continue operating on a particular track for well over a century sometimes.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n* In which states in the U.S. do railroads have this power?\n* Might that be the reason why many railroad rights\\-of\\-way are held in easement rather than in fee simple?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL; DNR: \n\n1\\) It is not clear which states gave railroads the power to seize property. It is clear that eminent domain has been used to take land for railroads in every state. However, not every railroad had the power to take land; some governments took the property and then gave it to the railroad. \n\n2\\) No, railroads didn\u2019t have to use easements because they got to use eminent domain. Railroads had to use easements for the same reason they got to use eminent domain \u2013 they were using their property to serve the \u201cpublic interest\u201d. As a result, they got various subsidies and special deals. In return, they were subject to heightened government control. That control included not always having fee simple ownership of their land. \n\nHere are some details: \n\n1\\) Like many private businesses \u2013 from grain mills to canals to shopping malls and hotels \u2013 railroads got some of their land via eminent domain. Who could take the land, and under what conditions and restrictions, varied from state to state (and over time). \n\nUnfortunately, as far as I know, there is no list online telling which states gave which powers to railroads. There may be such a list in one of the treatises on eminent domain, such as Nichols' \"The Law of Eminent Domain,\" or on railroad law. (By their nature, treatises are exhaustive.) \n\nHowever, there is enough information online that you could make a fairly complete list in a few hours; my search for railroad\\+eminent\\+domain\\+(state name) got plenty of hits for every state I tried, including Hawai'i. \n\nRecent changes to state laws show how much state laws vary. In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Kelo v. City of New London, many states made it harder to use eminent domain for development projects. Some of states (South Dakota) explicitly target railroads, while others (Vermont) explicitly exempt railroads. \n\n2\\) It\u2019s an oversimplification to say railroads either: a) own their land outright (ie, fee simple); or, b) have an easement. Railroads use other forms of property, including fee\\-simple with conditions and licenses. What these forms of property share is reduced railroad control over its property. As mentioned above, the reason is simple. To encourage railroads to serve the public, they got subsidies. In return, their rights over their property was attenuated. Thus, railroads couldn't set rates at will. One of the valuable rights they gave up was the right to sell the property once they were no longer using it for railroading.\n\n3\\) The issues of eminent domain and ownership of railroad rights of way are not merely of academic interest. For example, many people today are interested in what to do with abandoned rail rights of way. Who gets the land, under what conditions, and at what price? Can the land be sold outright, \u201crailbanked,\u201d (using it in ways that allow an easy conversion back to rail in the future), turned into trails, utility rights of way, and so on. Not surprisingly, advocates for each of these uses argues that their use is most consistent with existing rights. \n\nThe growing interest in high speed rail raises again the issue of how to get the land for rail projects. \n\nIf you want to know more, there is a nice short summary of the history of railroad rights to rights of way in this [article](https://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/39-3-07_Wright.pdf) from the Vermont Law Review.

The information provided indicates that the power of eminent domain for railroads varied from state to state, and there is no comprehensive list detailing which states granted this power. Additionally, railroads often held their rights-of-way through various forms of property rights, including easements and fee simple with conditions, rather than always having full fee simple ownership.

Whatever the OiC supposedly contravenes plays no role in that analysis (including your suggestion of \"common law constitutional right,\" assuming that even has a well\\-defined meaning in UK law). This is because the UK has a strong tradition of [Parliamentary supremacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_sovereignty_in_the_United_Kingdom) and courts are not allowed to quash primary legislation of the Parliament.\n\nWhat's unusual here is that Parliament specifically decided to elevate OiCs to the status of primary legislation with respect to the Human Rights Act 1998\\.

It was a very basic course and in order to make the topic digestible more easily for us students, the lecturer was providing some anecdotes. As the course was provided by an Austrian university, some of the examples referred to the Habsburgans and the Austro\\-Hungarian Empire. \n\nThe lecturer told us that before a law could pass, a member of the common people had to read the law text and explain it in his own words. Only if that was possible and purpose of the law could be reflected, a law could become active and valid.\n\nThe idea behind this was to ensure that the population, which received only basic education back in the days of Maria Theresa, could understand the meaning and implications of the law. This person had a specific name, if I remember correctly, it was Hungarian for \"simple person\" or even \"stupid person\". Does anyone know the term for this person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, we use the phrase \"[Reasonable Person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_person)\" which is not to say an average person or a simple man, but an individual who understands the limitations of the situation and would act in accordance with that knowledge. For example, if a doctor improperly rendered help a patient, his actions would be evaluated based on reasonable knowledge of people with his medical knowledge, where as a person practicing medicine without a license would be subjected to a more common\\-man standard.\n\nThe phrase person is therefor substituted for a reasonable individual and thus, a \"Reasonable Landlord/Renter\" could exist in housing cases, or a \"Reasonable Doctor\" in medical torts or \"a Reasonable Woman\" in sexual assault cases, so the \"Reasonable Person\" is often used to allow the jury to put themselves in the shoes of the witnesses and the accused and see how they would react (Historically, the term was called a \"Reasonable Man\" though \"Reasonable Person\" was used to make the term more neutral to what the definition of \"Man\" was (A human male or a member of the Human Species, regardless of gender).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In legal contexts, what term is used to describe a hypothetical person who exercises average care, skill, and judgment in conduct and serves as a comparative standard for determining liability?\n\nA) Reasonable Person\nB) Simple Person\nC) Average Citizen\nD) Common Man\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The \"Reasonable Person\" is a legal concept used in many jurisdictions, including the United States, as a standard to determine liability in various legal situations. This hypothetical individual is not necessarily average or simple, but rather someone who exercises appropriate care, skill, and judgment given the circumstances.\n\nThe term \"Reasonable Person\" is gender-neutral and can be adapted to specific contexts, such as \"Reasonable Doctor\" or \"Reasonable Landlord.\" It allows juries and judges to consider how a prudent individual would act in similar circumstances.\n\nWhile \"Simple Person\" or \"Common Man\" might seem intuitive based on the anecdote about Maria Theresa's law-making process, these are not the standard legal terms used in modern jurisprudence. \"Average Citizen\" is also not the correct term, as the reasonable person standard often requires consideration of specific knowledge or skills relevant to the situation at hand."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77318/is-my-cousin-vinny-dismissal-actually-possible", "docs_id": 77318, "title": "Is &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; dismissal actually possible?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In one of my favorite films of all time, 1992's [My Cousin Vinny](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104952/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), at the end of the trial when it's abundantly *clear* the prosecution will lose, at least that's the conclusion the filmmakers want the audience to surmise, Trotter pronounces... \"the state would like to dismiss all charges.\"\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQBCO.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQBCO.gif)\n\nAnd . . . as per Hollywood, everyone rejoices.\n\nI am fully aware movies are movies and *not* real life and the film is a pure work of *fiction*. Since I have no direct connection to anyone in the legal field, I thought I would ask some knowledgeable users about something that's always had me wondering. (Just saw the film again tonight.)\n\nI am aware that an acquittal means one can not be tried for the same crime again (double jeopardy). But a dismissal *may not* provide such protection. Acquittal meaning the prosecution could **not prove** the defendant committed the crime, whereas dismissal *may* allow for retrial.\n\nSo, is there a *legal* basis for Trotter dismissing a case merely because he'll clearly lose? Common sense leans towards thinking this may be \"Hollywood fluff\" and it could not *actually* happen at the final stages of a trial so close to jury deliberation. But.. again, I don't *really* know.\n\nI *think* this is fluff because if it were *actually* possible, why wouldn't *all* prosecutors merely drop charges if they fear they are going to lose, then go build a better case and retry the defendant.\n\nAre the requirement for an actual dismissal more stringent than the film would have the audience believe or in this aspect, is the film pretty close to reality?\n\n(I am referencing U.S. criminal law in general)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is entirely possible in a number of different motions that could have been made. At this point, Vinny had destroyed the Prosecutor's eyewitnesses by showing they had issues that called their testimony into question (The first has a timeline that doesn't line up with events, the second has poor vision and her prescription glasses were not doing their job, and the third had many obstructions blocking his view of the scene). His first witness tears apart the \"expert\" witness, who was only there to testify that the tires were the same brand (albeit, a popular brand at the time... loads of cars had the same tires).\n\nWhile it might go by a different name in different jurisdictions, the Prosecutor is allowed to make a motion to dismiss at any point prior to the jury goes to deliberation (as is the Defense; Also they might be able to make motions while the jury is in deliberations).\n\nIf properly titled, the Prosecutor should have made a \"motion for *nolle prosequi*\" (not prosecuting). This can mean any number of things including the prosecutor no longer believes the evidence can prove the charges OR even that the prosecutor is no longer convinced that those charged committed the crime.\n\nIn the \"My Cousin Vinny\" case, as the jury was seated the case cannot be retried by the State of Alabama at this point.\n\nThis is possible because the Prosecutor's duty is to uncover the truth behind a crime, no matter what that truth becomes. In this case, despite his previous beliefs, the prosecutor in My Cousin Vinny, upon realizing he was wrong, admitted it and dropped the charges. Given his backstory of having worked as a defense attorney and making the switch after getting a client off some serious charges (and knowing the client was guilty) shows that he was inherently an honest man and dedicated to finding the truth of the matter (as a government employee, he undoubtedly took a pay cut when he switched to prosecution. Private industry almost always pays way more than a government equivalent). With that in mind, it is expected of prosecutors to be perfectly honest with what evidence they have and make the choices in the case based on that evidence. This comes up in another scene when Mona Lisa Vito explains to Vinny that the prosecutor was required to give Vinny all the files he had on the case... because Vinny, by representing the Defendant, is allowed to examine all evidence against his clients. The only dirty trick he pulled was the stunt where his expert witness was not disclosed and while bad, really it's the judge allowing the witness to testify that would have caused a problem with the trial (his response to Vinny's objection could have created a mistrial on appeal).\n\nTo give a real world example, I was charged with driving on a suspended license which I had no idea I was doing at the time. As it turned out, the license was suspended for an unpaid traffic ticket that I had paid in the last minute... essentially the DMV forgot to unsuspend. A quick call fixed that issue but I still had to go to court over the charge. The day of the trial, I show up in the court room and the prosecutor walks over and tells me that they were going to enter a motion of \"*nolle prosequi*\" for the charge... essentially dropping it... because the matter was a clerical error on the state's part and not anything I did wrong.\n\nEdit: Additionally had the prosecutor not motioned to dismiss, Vinny certainly could have. In fact there are two points during the trial where Defense attorneys are expected to make these motions. The first is when the Prosecution rests their case. The second is before the jury is given the case to deliberate.\n\nAs for why it was called a motion to dismiss in the film, it's likely to due with the fact that the audience would not know what a \"motion for *nolle prosecui*\" and it is a type of motion to dismiss.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the film \"My Cousin Vinny,\" the prosecutor moves to dismiss all charges at the end of the trial.

In U.S. criminal law, prosecutors can indeed move to dismiss charges at any point before the jury begins deliberations. This is often done through a motion for \"nolle prosequi.\" If such a motion is granted after the jury has been seated, as in the film, it would prevent retrial due to double jeopardy protections. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the scenario is not purely fictional and can happen in real court proceedings. Option B is false because prosecutors are not limited to dismissing charges only before the trial begins.

Is it legally binding, or just very persuasive advice? Are there any examples of a judge ignoring precedent without setting new precedent, or is that paradoxical?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Precedent in common law is based on a hierarchy of courts. [This](https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-structure/) is the hierarchy in the UK: as they say, it's complicated because it represents 1,000\\+ years of organic growth rather than a system that was planned.\n\nPrecedent is binding on courts lower in the hierarchy than the one who set the precedent. If a judge ignores a precedent (that was argued by one side or the other1) then the decision is **wrong** and would be overturned on appeal.\n\nPrecedent at the same level and in parallel jurisdictions is *persuasive*, if a judge ignores it they better have good reason for doing so (and put those reasons in the judgement) or they will probably have their decision overturned on appeal. A parallel jurisdiction is a common law jurisdiction in another country like Australia, Canada or (rarely) the USA. It is quite common for parliament when drafting new laws to look at similar laws in other jurisdictions as a starting point. When cases are brought under such new legislation it is right that precedent set on similar law in other jurisdictions serves as the starting point for case law in the U.K.\n\nPrecedent turns on the law and the facts involved. If parliament changes the law then many precedents may be invalidated. Similarly, the facts of cases are never exactly the same, argument in court is often not about the facts \\- these may be agreed \\- but about why these facts are the same/different so that this precedent should/should not apply.\n\nIncidentally, precedent is one of the main differences between common law (English) and civil law (European) legal systems: common law has it, civil law doesn't.\n\n1. A judge must decide the case that is argued before them, deciding on a basis that the parties didn't argue is a breach of natural justice: if both sides fail to raise an applicable precedent then it is not something the judge should consider.

Yes. Unintended? Not so much.\n------------------------------------------\n\n[Source](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UTSLawRw/1999/20.html)\n\n**Sources of Parliamentary Privilege**\n\nIn [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\"), Parliamentary Privilege derives from Article 9 of the *Bill of Rights 1688* (no, 1688 is *not* a mistake) which provides:\n\n> ... the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament.\n\n**What are \"proceedings in Parliament\"?**\n\n\"\\[P]roceedings in Parliament\" is defined by case law.\n\nIn Canadian and English jurisprudence, the definition includes things done outside Parliament in the furtherance of Parliamentary business such as correspondence, and press releases. The leading cases are *Roman Corp Ltd v Hudson's Bay Oil and Gas Co Ltd* and *Re Clark and Attorney\\-General of Canada* for Canada, and *Rost v Edwards* for England and Wales.\n\nAustralian case law is split. The leading case is *Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Chatterton* in the Full Court of the South Australian Supreme Court where Zelling AJC held that privilege applies to restatements by an MP outside Parliament of things said inside, possibly including answering questions about those things in an interview. Prior J rejected this and Jacob J didn't address it. That's one win, one loss and one DNF for those keeping score.\n\nFor the Federal Parliament, the *Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987* defines \"proceedings in Parliament\" as:\n\n> ... all words and spoken acts done in the course of, or for purposes of or incidental to, the transacting of the business of a House or of a committee, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, includes:\n> \n> \n> (a) the giving of evidence before a House or a committee, and evidence so given;\n> \n> \n> (b) the presentation or submission of a document to a House or a committee;\n> \n> \n> (c) the preparation of a document for purposes of or incidental to the transacting of any such business; and\n> \n> \n> (d) the formulation, making or publication of a document, including a report, by or pursuant to an order of a House or a committee and the document so formulated, made or published\n\nThe [northern\\-territory](/questions/tagged/northern-territory \"show questions tagged 'northern-territory'\") has similar legislation.\n\nIn *Laurance v Katter*, there was a judicial split in the Court of Appeal in the Queensland Supreme Court about whether this definition was unconstitutional.\n\n> Pincus JA held that s 16(3\\) was incompatible with the implied freedom of political communication. Following the High Court's decision in *R v Richards; Ex part Fitzpatrick and Browne*, Fitzpatrick P held that s 16 could not be invalidated or read down to accommodate the implied freedom of political communication. Davies JA read down s 16(3\\); in his view, the section was enacted merely to make it clear that parliamentary privilege applies not only where a member or witness is sued but also where evidence is sought to be tendered; in both cases, the privilege applies only where the parliamentary proceedings would be impeached or questioned. Davies JA then held that this was not the case in these proceedings.\n\nThe High Court gave special leave to appeal this decision but the matter was settled before the appeal was heard.\n\nSo, the exact boundaries of Parliamentary privilege in Australia remain uncertain. However, a prudent journalist should assume that it extends not just to statements made in the House or before a Committee but to statements about those statements made outside by the MP or their staff.\n\n**Who has the privilege?**\n\nThe privilege belongs to Parliament, not any individual MP, and can only be waived by Parliament. It cannot be invalidated by the courts due to the doctrine of separation of powers. Australian parliaments take the attitude that the waiver of privilege is a procedural matter about their own internal workings and does not require legislation.\n\nIn England and Wales, legislation has been passed that allows an MP to waive privilege over their (and only their) statements but no such law exists in Australia.\n\n**Effect of Parliamentary Privilege**\n\nThere are two limbs to Parliamentary Privilege:\n\n1. It provides **absolute immunity** to the MP (and possibly their staff) for statements made under privilege. That is, following *Barilaro v Shanks\\-Markovina (No 2\\) \\[2021] FCA 950*, anything and everything that is under privilege is completely inadmissible in court.\n2. By legislation in each Australian jurisdiction, **qualified immunity** is provided for the \"fair and accurate reports of parliamentary proceedings. Thus, a media organization is protected from liability for defamation in respect of the publication of a fair and accurate report of parliamentary proceedings unless the plaintiff can establish that, in publishing the report, the media organization was actuated by malice.\"\n\nThe Federal and Northern Territory legislation appears to go further and may provide absolute immunity but that has not been tested.\n\n**Actuated by malice**\n\nMalice in law does not mean what it means in everyday English. It means, with respect to defamation, that a statement was made either knowing that it was untrue or with reckless disregard for its truthfulness. In other words, you were deliberately lying, or you made no effort to find out if you were lying.\n\nWithin the context of Parliamentary Privilege, you cannot rely on the truthfulness of statements made in Parliament to establish that what you reported was the truth. The existence of the statements might be admissible, for example, to establish if privilege attaches to them but the content of the statements themselves has no probative value. In some ways, this is like a hearsay statement: you can testify that the statement was made (if that's relevant) but you cannot testify that there is any truth\\-value to what was said.\n\nTherefore, if you make a nasty remark (that goes beyond \"fair and accurate reports\") and your only reliance on the truthfulness of your statement comes from things under Parliamentary Privilege then you have no defence to a defamation claim. So, accusing someone of perjury for what they said to a parliamentary committee rather than just reporting what they said is clearly actuated by malice: it may be true but you know that you can't prove it's true \\- that amounts to reckless disregard for the truth.\n\n**Consequences**\n\nThe purpose of Parliamentary Privilege is to allow MPs to vigorously advance the interests of their constituencies (i.e. us) without the fear that they will be called to account for what they say in either a civil or criminal court.\n\nIt has been [argued](https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/apr/09/top-judge-attacks-growing-abuse-of-parliamentary-privilege) that some uses of Parliamentary Privilege are an abuse, particularly where they subvert the operations of the judiciary or law enforcement such as by naming suspects, defendants, and witnesses or where the statements would be defamation but for the privilege. However, if they are, it is for the Parliament to discipline the MP by sanction or expulsion, or for the electorate to do so through the ballot box. Such discipline is rare, partly because no one wants to unleash a weapon that could be turned upon themselves but mostly, because Parliament is loath to interfere in the electorate's right to choose their own representatives even if they are wankers.\n\nThis privilege is clearly at odds with the principle of free speech and inhibits the ability of media outlets to editorialise on matters covered by privilege. **This consequence is not unintended**, rather it is a deliberate trade\\-off of one pillar of democratic life against another.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A journalist is reporting on statements made by a politician during a parliamentary session.

The principle of \"freedom of contract\" generally allows parties to set their own terms, even if one party later finds those terms inconvenient or challenging.

What should we know regarding legal ownership and the sale of these guns?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are really two questions embedded in this situation.\n\nThe first would be no different if the property in question were cigars instead of guns. If the stepdad really and truly gave the cigars to his stepson before he died, then that is the end of the story. The presence or absence of a will, and the existence of a power of attorney (which terminates upon death by operation of law) is irrelevant. The question seems to imply that there is some doubt about whether the gift of that property really happened, however. In that regard, it is worth noting that if the gift was made by the step\\-son using the power of attorney to make a gift to himself, that the transfer may have been invalid since most powers of attorney do not confer the power to make gifts.\n\nThe second question, which isn't completely unrelated, concerns issues particular to firearms regulation. \n\nThe first sub\\-question (which the question seems to assume has happened, but which is probably behind some of the uncertainty over whether the guns were actually given as a gift), is whether the stepfather actually complied with any paperwork required in Florida to transfer a gun by lifetime gift to someone entitled to own a gun.\n\nThe second sub\\-question is what is necessary for a legal owner of a firearm to sell a firearm to someone else in Florida.\n\n[The answer to these questions](https://legalbeagle.com/6756222-florida-gun-transfer-laws.html) is that neither the gift nor a private sale of a firearm must be registered or documented in any particular way comparable to what a gun dealer must do in terms of background checks and record keeping in a commercial sale of a firearm in Florida.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal ownership and sale of these firearms in Florida?\n\nA) John must register the transfer of ownership with the state before he can legally sell any of the firearms.\n\nB) As the stepfather's power of attorney, John automatically inherited all the firearms regardless of whether they were given as gifts before death.\n\nC) John can sell the firearms in a private sale without any specific documentation, but it's advisable to create a written record of the transaction.\n\nD) John must conduct background checks on potential buyers, similar to what a licensed firearms dealer would do.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Florida, private sales of firearms do not require registration or specific documentation. However, it's recommended to create a written record of the sale to prove the transaction occurred and to clarify that ownership has been transferred, especially in case the firearm is later used in a crime.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Florida does not require registration of firearm transfers between private individuals.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because a power of attorney terminates upon death, and it doesn't automatically confer inheritance rights. Additionally, if the guns were genuinely given as gifts before death, they already belong to John.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because private sellers in Florida are not required to conduct background checks like licensed dealers do, although it may be a prudent practice."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30791/is-it-legal-to-open-a-museum-of-certain-a-brand", "docs_id": 30791, "title": "Is it legal to open a museum of certain a brand?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My wife is a big fan of a certain toy company and has a huge collection.

Consider each case:\n\n* the foreign nation is a close ally of the US\n* the foreign nation has neutral relations with the US\n* the foreign nation is a bitter rival with cold relations to the US\n* the foreign nation is in a state of open, declared war with the US\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Relevant Law\n============\n\nTreason\n-------\n\nTreason is constitutionally defined as waging war on the United States, or giving aid and comfort to its enemies. The definition doesn't formally say so, but only someone who owes allegiance to the United States (i.e. a U.S. citizen) can be guilty of treason. The federal treason statute states:\n\n> Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, **levies war against\n> them** or adheres to their **enemies**, giving them aid and comfort within\n> the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer\n> death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under\n> this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of\n> holding any office under the United States.\n\n18 USC Section 2381\\.\n\nThe main limitations are in bold.\n\nThe word \"enemy\" has a technical meaning in the area of treason and foreign relations, which means a country or insurgent group with whom the United States is at war. Thus, the following are not \"enemies\" of the United States:\n\n* the foreign nation is a close ally of the US\n* the foreign nation has neutral relations with the US\n* the foreign nation is a bitter rival with cold relations to the US\n\nBut, this one is an enemy of the United States:\n\n* the foreign nation is in a state of open, declared war with the US\n\nHence, a U.S. citizen giving aid and comfort to ISIS (with whom we have a Congressionally authorized war) as it tries to mount a terrorist attack on the U.S. might very well be treason, but assisting Russia (with whom the U.S. is not at war) in assassinating an American would not be.\n\nI don't know if North Korea is a current \"enemy\" of the United States or not. The Korean War is not over, but I don't know if the U.S. declaration of war on North Korea is still in force.\n\nIt is also a lesser felony to failure to report treason in progress to the authorities, with treason itself defined in essentially the same way. 18 USC Section 2882\\. Thus, U.S. citizens have a legal duty enforceable with criminal law to affirmatively report treason.\n\nRebellion or insurrection\n-------------------------\n\nAlso rebellion or insurrection is a crime defined as follows:\n\n> Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages **in any rebellion or\n> insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws\n> thereof**, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this\n> title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be\n> incapable of holding any office under the United States.\n\n18 USC Section 2383\n\nThe bold language greatly restricts the applicability of this crime. This is not something you can really do by yourself, you need to be part of an organized insurgency group actively trying to overthrow the U.S. government by force.\n\nAffiliation with a foreign power is irrelevant to this offense.\n\nSedition\n--------\n\nSedition (actually seditious conspiracy) is defined as:\n\n> If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place\n> subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to\n> overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the\n> United States, or to levy war against them, or **to oppose by force the\n> authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the\n> execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take,\n> or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority\n> thereof,** they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not\n> more than twenty years, or both.\n\n18 USC Section 2384\\.\n\nThe highlighted portions are the least culpable ones that qualify for the offense of seditious conspiracy, which are subject to some significant case law glosses of interpretation. At a minimum seditious conspiracy must involve defiance of the authority of the United States.\n\nSimply committing serious crimes against the United States (e.g assassinating a high government official or blowing up a government building), while acknowledging that the United States is the legitimate government of the United States acting within its authority and not seeking regime change (not just new personnel but a new constitution not adopted by constitutional means), is not sufficient.\n\nYour involvement with a foreign power is neither necessary nor sufficient for conduct to be seditious.\n\nAdvocating the overthrow of the United States government\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdvocating the overthrow of the United States government is also a crime in some circumstances (subject to significant judicial case law glosses):\n\n> Whoever knowingly or willfully advocates, abets, advises, or teaches\n> the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or\n> destroying the government of the United States or the government of\n> any State, Territory, District or Possession thereof, or the\n> government of any political subdivision therein, **by force or violence,\n> or by the assassination of any officer of any such government;** or\n> \n> \n> Whoever, with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such\n> government, prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells,\n> distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter\n> advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability,\n> or propriety of **overthrowing or destroying any government in the\n> United States by force or violence, or attempts to do so;** or\n> \n> \n> Whoever organizes or helps or attempts to organize any society, group,\n> or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the **overthrow\n> or destruction of any such government by force or violence;** or **becomes\n> or is a member of, or affiliates with, any such society, group, or\n> assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof\u2014**\n> \n> \n> Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty\n> years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by the United\n> States or any department or agency thereof, for the five years next\n> following his conviction.\n> \n> \n> If two or more persons conspire to commit any offense named in this\n> section, each shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\n> than twenty years, or both, and shall be ineligible for employment by\n> the United States or any department or agency thereof, for the five\n> years next following his conviction.\n> \n> \n> As used in this section, the terms \u201corganizes\u201d and \u201corganize\u201d, with\n> respect to any society, group, or assembly of persons, include the\n> recruiting of new members, the forming of new units, and the\n> regrouping or expansion of existing clubs, classes, and other units of\n> such society, group, or assembly of persons.\n\n18 USC Section 2385\\.\n\nCollaboration with a foreign power isn't an element of this crime and is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish it. The key limitations and most inclusive provisions are in bold. The First Amendment significantly limits that application of this crime as applied, but it is not unconstitutional in all circumstances.\n\nYour Examples\n=============\n\nNumbers 1\\-2 would never be crimes of any kind as described and not reading anything else into them.\n\nNumbers 3\\-6 are not illegal *per se*, but you may be required to register as a foreign agent and these activities may be illegal for someone holding certain government offices.\n\nNothing in 1\\-6 would constitute treason or sedition or rebellion.\n\nCivil disobedience is a description that speaks more to the reason and motive for the action than the action itself so it is hard to say what you mean by 7\\-8\\. Somebody could call blowing up the Capitol \"civil disobedience\" or could mean protesting in violation of a curfew ordinance. Some of those activities could constitute a seditious conspiracy.\n\nWith respect to 9\\-10, the acts involved are more clear, but the motive and context remain in doubt.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The citizen could be charged with treason, as they are receiving payment from a foreign entity to undermine U.S. interests.\n\nB) The citizen's actions constitute seditious conspiracy, as they are organizing violent protests against the U.S. government.\n\nC) The citizen may be required to register as a foreign agent, but their actions likely do not rise to the level of treason, sedition, or rebellion.\n\nD) The citizen's actions are fully protected under the First Amendment, and no legal consequences can be pursued.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The scenario described does not meet the legal threshold for treason, as the foreign nation is not an \"enemy\" of the United States (neutral relations). It also doesn't clearly constitute seditious conspiracy, as organizing protests (even if they occasionally turn violent) doesn't necessarily equate to attempting to overthrow the government by force. However, receiving payment from a foreign nation to organize political activities within the U.S. may require the citizen to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). While some of the protest activities may be illegal (property damage, violence), the overall act of organizing protests against U.S. policy is generally protected by the First Amendment, though this protection is not absolute when violence is involved."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29749/is-it-possible-to-renounce-your-right-to-divorce", "docs_id": 29749, "title": "Is it possible to renounce your right to divorce", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When you get married, is it possible to enter into a contract renouncing both parties' right to a divorce?

Thus, the perpetuity as expressed in the term *whole lives* preempts the conceiving of an eventual separation.\n\nInsofar as marriage is legally cognizable as a contract (see legal definition), it might specify or imply remedies in the event that one or both spouses decide(s) that substance of marital relationship no longer exists; that is, in the event that a breach of that contract occurs. A court may order to the breaching spouse performance of certain acts (for example, alimony) in accordance to statutory law or common law.

Your attorney's job is to argue that it should not be you (her attorney's job is to argue that it should be you).

The documentation clearly states that when you co-sign a loan, the creditor can collect the debt from you without first trying to collect from the primary borrower. The act of signing or not signing the voluntary surrender form does not change the co-signer's liability.

According to the information provided, when parties sign a contract, it supersedes any prior agreements or discussions, even if those discussions involved material changes to the terms. The signed document is considered the final and binding agreement between the parties. In this case, even though Bob received an email confirmation about travel time compensation, by signing the original unmodified contract, he effectively agreed to its terms, which exclude travel time.

Indeed, typically for a criminal conviction, it is required that the person know (\"or should know\") that the facts of the situation match what the law describes, and knowing that you still do the act.

However, it does not require people to know all facts related to a potential crime. In many cases, ignorance of specific facts can be a valid defense, especially when the law requires knowledge of those facts for an act to be considered criminal.

Are the two approaches applied much outside of the U.S. in other contexts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is generally held that Textualism is a kind of Originalism, which is a set of theories: these theories have something in common, which sets them apart from Minimalism or Living Constitiutionalism. The problem is that it is very difficult to establish a defining canon for Originalism, whereas Textualism is a newer development prominently associated with Scalia. There are three related theories: Original Intent, Textualism, and Original Public Understanding, subsumed under the umbrella of Originalism. The textual difficulty is finding a (somewhat) contemporary advocate of Original Intent or Public Understanding who maintains that theory in the face of Textualism, so that we can see the essential principles that distinguish the theories.\n\nSmith ([\"Why originalism won\u2019t die\u2026\"](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/djclpp/vol2/iss1/3/) says that\n\n> Originalism is the view, embraced by Antonin Scalia, Robert Bork,\n>  Clarence Thomas and many academic legal theorists, that the meaning of\n>  the Constitution should be settled by reference to the original\n>  understanding of those who enacted its provisions\n\nAs characterized by [R.G. Natelson](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2012/05/21/original-intent-original-understanding-original-meaning/), \n\n> The *original meaning* (or *original public meaning*) is how a\n>  reasonably intelligent, involved member of the public would have\n>  interpreted a provision. Primary evidence of original meaning is how\n>  words were used in common discourse and the definitions in\n>  contemporaneous dictionaries and legal sources. Circumstantial\n>  evidence includes the drafting and ratification conventions, public\n>  debates, and so forth.\n\nThe public meaning theory seems to have not gotten much traction, though it might be subsumed under an attempt within Original Intent theory to find evidence for that original intent. Scalia (the arch\\-Textualist) characterizes his \"opponent\" originalism (not textualists) saying \n\n> \"Originalists believe that the Constitution should be interpreted to\n>  mean exactly what it meant when it was adopted by the American\n>  people.\" (quote from Scalia AUSTIN AM.\\-STATESMAN, May 6, 2005, copied from\n>  Smith)\n\nBork (*The tempting of America*) says that under the Original Intent view, \"a judge is to apply the Constitution according to the principles *intended* by those who ratified the document\" (emphasis added)\n\nA variant sub\\-theory is strict constructionism, and in *Common\\-Law Courts in a\nCivil\\-Law System*, \nScalia cites the case of [Smith v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/508/223/), 508 U.S. 223 \nto illustrate the difference between strict construction and textualism. In this case, \ncase where defendant was said to have \nused a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking \ncrime when he offered it in exchange for cocaine.

This approach differs from other forms of originalism, such as original intent theory, which seeks to apply the Constitution according to the principles intended by those who ratified it. Textualists reject the relevance or even the existence of legislative intent, whereas other originalist approaches may consider such factors. Option A is incorrect because textualism doesn't focus on original intent. Option B is wrong because textualism actually rejects the use of legislative history.

If I have two database tables, both encrypted.\n\nOne table is globally available and contains user sessions. For the sake of conversation assume that globally means it's physically hosted in countries that EU might now deem equivalent in terms of protection. It holds no PII, just session status and expiry time. It also holds a user UUID that's been randomly generated but is tied to the lifespan of the user i.e. once assigned to a user it does not change.\n\nThe other table is physically hosted in EU, and holds a UUID to email mapping.\n\nIf a breach results in the first table being leaked the data is anonymous, it is only when joined with the second that that the user session can be tied to PII (email address).\n\nDoes this mean that both tables fall under GDPR and thus must be placed in EU (or equivalent), or is it sufficient that only the table containing PII is located there?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The way you describe this UUID, it is **pseudonymous** data (see [GDPR Art 4(5\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) and Recitals [28](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-28/)\u2013[29](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-29/)). That is, it is not directly identifying, but you have a mapping between pseudonyms and identifiers that can be used to re\\-identify this data. Effective pseudonymisation requires not only that the data is logically separate, but that there are effective organisational and technical measures preventing re\\-combination by unauthorized persons. Alongside with encryption, pseudonymisation is one of the safety measures that the GDPR explicitly requires whenever appropriate (see Art 25, Art 32\\).\n\nPseudonymous data is still personal data, because you can easily re\\-identify the data. The PII concept is US\\-specific and is misleading in a GDPR context, where it is not the inherently identifying characteristics of the information that matters, but the realistic ability of the data controller to single out data subjects to whom this data relates (compare Art 4(1\\) and Recital 26\\).\n\nHowever, were you to irrevocably erase the UUID\u2013email mapping, things are more tricky. There is no longer any connection with directly identifying data, so this data might be anonymous. On the other hand, such a persistent UUID still allows you to recognize/distinguish persons, so it might still be personal data. This might be the case especially when the UUID is used in long\\-lived cookies of website visitors, thus matching the GDPR's concept of an \u201conline identifier\u201d. This conclusion could be avoided by limiting reuse of UUIDs, e.g. creating a new UUID after some context\\-dependent appropriate duration.\n\nThe GDPR does not require all data to be stored in the EU, but requires international transfers of personal data to have sufficient protections. If you're processing these data in countries without adequate legal protections (like the United States), additional safeguards have to be used. Pseudonymisation could be part of such safeguards, and has been suggested by some data protection authorities in the wake of the Schrems II ruling. However, pseudonymisation alone does not make the international transfer legal, it is more of a strategy to reduce remaining risks.\n\nI think that your systems has a good chance of being OK, but not neccessarily so. If in doubt, perform a DPIA and possibly consult your data protection authority under GDPR Art 36\\. If feasible, storing/processing data only in the EEA or in countries with an [adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_enk) will simplify compliance. Safeguards such as pseudonymisation could be strengthened by rotating UUIDs, and by restricting access to the table with identifiers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company has a global user session database containing randomly generated UUIDs tied to user lifespans, and a separate EU-hosted database mapping these UUIDs to email addresses.

Under GDPR, pseudonymous data is still considered personal data. The GDPR does not strictly require all data to be stored in the EU, but it does require appropriate safeguards for international transfers of personal data. Pseudonymisation can be part of these safeguards, along with other technical and organizational measures. However, pseudonymisation alone does not make the transfer fully compliant - additional steps may be necessary. Option A is incorrect because the global database, despite not directly containing PII, is still considered personal data under GDPR due to the ability to link it to identifiable individuals. Option B is too restrictive, as GDPR allows for international transfers with proper safeguards. Option D is not entirely accurate, as even without the direct mapping, persistent UUIDs might still be considered personal data under certain circumstances, especially if used as online identifiers."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30612/is-it-illegal-to-broadcast-stream-music-for-non-commercial-purposes", "docs_id": 30612, "title": "Is it illegal to broadcast/stream music for non-commercial purposes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a simple question that I haven't found any answer on, on the web.\n\nI have a lot of purchase music on Google Play and I want to create a internet radio just for fun, for non\\-commercial purposes.

Since the point of such a journal is just to replicate, it would seems that the aim is to build a freely available copy of the existing (perhaps paywalled, copyrighted) material, that can be freely accessed, and this is different intent than regular articles.\n\nAlso, answers regarding plagiarism aren't much help in this case as the point is to do \"explicit plagiarism\" with proper attribution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright protection exists for the (typeset) image of an equation, so you have to recreate the equation (the final output could be indistinguishable from the original when the object is created automatically by a program and you happen to use the same program). Figures may enjoy a more protection, since they involve both the facts reported and the means of expression (rows and columns, order, subgroup, labels). Explanations and discussion (I don't know what distinction you're getting at there) are text from the original article,and those are indeed protected by copyright, which is moderated by the \"fair use\" exception. There are various claims out there about how much you can quote with the confines of fair use, but nobody really know in the academic context (as far as I know, there is no case law in the US that tests how much quoting you can do in an academic journal). The basic rule of thumb is to quote only when the literal words are required, and otherwise re\\-express the idea.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of replication papers and copyright law, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Equations and their explanations can always be copied verbatim without risk of copyright infringement.\n\nB) Figures from the original paper can be reproduced exactly as long as proper attribution is given.\n\nC) Copyright protection applies to the typeset image of an equation, but not to the equation itself when recreated.\n\nD) Fair use allows unlimited quoting of explanations and discussions from the original paper in academic contexts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the documentation states that \"Copyright protection exists for the (typeset) image of an equation, so you have to recreate the equation.\" This means that while the equation itself (as an idea) is not copyrightable, the specific typeset image is protected. Recreating the equation, even if it looks identical, is permitted.\n\nOption A is incorrect because explanations can be subject to copyright and cannot always be copied verbatim. Option B is wrong because figures may have more protection due to their expression of facts and design elements.

But, they can be successfully sued for enforcing immigration laws when they do not have the legal authority to do so, and usually, state and local government officials do not have the legal authority to enforce federal immigration laws. (State and local governments are also generally prohibited from enacting state or local laws pertaining to someone's immigration status.)\n\nIn general, the only people with the authority to detain someone for violating immigration laws are immigration officers employed by the federal government. They have absolute discretion in how they enforce federal immigration laws and are free to systematically or on a case by case basis choose not to enforce those laws, as are the executive branch politicians to whom they report. \n\nOne of the main reasons that state and local officials cannot enforce immigration laws is that this would interfere with this exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government over immigration and with the absolute discretion of federal officials to decline to enforce the immigration laws or to enforce immigration laws merely on a selective basis.\n\nState and local officials have authority in this regard only if they are expressly authorized to do so by law, and then, only if the state or local government chooses to cooperate by allowing their officials to be used for that purpose. \n\nGenerally speaking, the federal government authorizes state and local jail administrators to detain someone pursuant to an immigration hold if the state and local government authorizes the jail to do so. But, usually state and local officials do not have the authority to arrest someone solely for being in the U.S. without having a valid and current immigration status. This authority is largely reserved to Homeland Security officials, although FBI agents in the Justice Department probably also have this authority.\n\nIn contrast, generally speaking, someone detained by a state and local law enforcement officer who enforces a federal immigration law, despite not having the legal authority to do so, could prevail in a lawsuit against the state or local law enforcement officer for violating the civil rights of a person detained by someone who had no legal authority to do so. Such suits have prevailed repeatedly in Phoenix, Arizona where a rogue sheriff attempted to enforce federal immigration laws despite not having the legal authority to do so.\n\nThus, the assumption that the kind of actions involved, for example, in \"sanctuary city\" policies are intentional violations of immigration law is ill\\-founded (violating a mere \"policy\" that is not actually a law is by definition never illegal). Generally speaking, there are no immigration laws violated. \n\nA \"coyote\" is intentionally violating an immigration law as is someone sneaking over the border when not legally authorized to do so. Someone who doesn't participate in the act of illegal entry, and who does not violate federal employment laws related to immigration (basically requiring an I\\-9 to be filled out and filed with the federal government), is violating no law.\n\nAs a matter of constitutional law, the federal government does not have have the constitutional authority to compel state and local government officials to enforce federal law (although it can authorize and \"bribe\" state and local governments to do so). Subject to applicable state law, for example, a city government has every right to declare itself a \"sanctuary city\" and refrain from actively assisting the federal government's enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n\nAlso, politicians and state and local prosecutors are absolutely immune from legal liability in connection with performance of their official duties, and law enforcement officers have qualified immunity for their acts. \n\nIn particular, law enforcement and prosecutors have essentially absolute discretion to refrain from choosing to enforce any law, and their politician bosses have broad authority to direct how they will exercise this discretion. For example, in general, even if a prosecutor and law enforcement know to an absolute certainty that someone is a serial killer, and can effortlessly arrest that person without any risk of harm to anyone and at minimal expense, they have no enforceable legal duty under U.S. law to try to arrest that person or prosecute that person for any crime. Failing to enforce a known violation of the law is not a crime (unless the failure to enforce is caused by a bribe).\n\nMany millions of people who reside in the United States are deportable but have not committed any crime, so rendering assistance to someone is deportable is not *per se* assisting someone in the commission of a crime, even after the fact, and indeed, many public officials have a legal duty to aid all \"persons\" in protecting their legal rights, including people who are deportable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A local sheriff in a small town decides to arrest and detain individuals solely based on suspicion of their undocumented immigration status, without federal authorization.

Copyright duration is always based on the death of the original author, regardless of any subsequent transfers of copyright ownership. Transferring copyright to a deceased person does not change the fact that the original author's lifespan determines the copyright's duration.

If I make these patterns available for free, I believe it counts as non\\-commercial use.\nWhere can I find out which companies' designs I can use? Google hasn't brought me any good answers yet. I am particularly interested in whether Disney/Marvel, Nintendo and Studio Ghibli accept this. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can freely make any patterns of your own invention: I assume you are asking if you can distribute patterns that are based on other people's products, such as Disney. For example one could crochet potholders with the image of a Little Einstein character. This is generally not possible without the permission of the design's creator (or whoever owns the copyright). There is a widespread belief that non\\-commercial exploitation is allowed, under a \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info)\" analysis: this is only true to a miniscule degree. If you copy without permission, you may be sued, and your attorney could try to raise a fair use defense. One of the factors allowing exploitation is the commercial nature of the use (where a non\\-commercial exploitation would be more consistent with \"fair use\"). Another factor is the \"transformative\" nature of an exploitation, meaning that the more you change the original, the better off you are. Probably working against you would be \"effect on market\", since offering something for free is likely to negatively affect the rights\\-holder's market share. Even if a rights holder does not currently sell a particular version of a product, such as a PDF version of a book, they might potentially wish to exploit a market. Even if there is no current Little Einstein crocheted potholder, your product would clearly have a huge impact on that potential market. Also working against you would be the amount and substantiality of the copying. In text copying, you can usually copy a short paragraph from a book, whereas the designs you are likely to put out there would be pretty much the whole thing.\n\nCounting on a fair use defense is pretty risky, unless it is based on one of the two fairly clearly established types of use (text copying of short illustrative quotes to prove / exemplify a point, and private\\-use copying of 40 pages or less of a publication). As far as I know, Disney is very protective of their property rights. The best way to determine if a particular use is allowed is to describe the use and formally request permission from the rights\\-holder. If they say \"No, absolutely not\", that would be a reason to ask your lawyer if s/he thought that you could mount a fair use defense against infringement.\n\nAnother issue to consider is whether the design enjoys protection as a trademark. Unlike copyright, trademark is not automatic, but you can search the [US trademark database](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database), though actually finding things is not trivial. In US law, there are two types of fair use defenses for trademark infringement. One is \"descriptive\" use, which address the fact that Apple computer company has a registered trademark on \"Apple\", but that doesn't mean that grocery stores have to start calling the tree fruit \"pomme\". Conceivably, some company might register a drawing of a quarter moon as a trademark, but that does not mean that nobody can then use a quarter moon as a graphic element. When someone uses an existing image / design as a trademark, they have much less control over use of that design. Little Einstein Leo would be totally outside the realm of descriptive fair use.\n\nThe other version is \"nominative\" fair use, where you are referring to the product, using only as much of the trademark as is needed to identify the thing, and not implying endorsement by the trademark owner. I could refer to Boeing, the airplane maker, as \"that plane maker with facilities in Renton\", or I could use their trademark. But using their circle\\-swoop\\-plane graphic would be beyond nominative fair use. What you are describing is well beyond any fair use concepts for trademarks in the US.

The Public Records law [\u00a7 25\\-61\\-3](http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2013/title-25/chapter-61/section-25-61-3) defines a public body as\n\n> any department, bureau, division, council, commission, committee,\n>  subcommittee, board, agency and any other entity of the state or a\n>  political subdivision thereof, and any municipal corporation and any\n>  other entity created by the Constitution or by law, executive order,\n>  ordinance or resolution.\n\nThe wording is different, but there isn't a clear difference in terms of what things are covered by one definition versus another. In case you worked for a committee that was created by a city council resolution, that would not obviously be covered by first definition, but it is clearly included by the second; the first definition ties \"public body\" to public funds but the second doesn't. It is therefore difficult to tell what the law says, when the law doesn't actually give a uniform definition of the term. In case of doubt, include everything.\n\nFurther supporting an expansive legislative intent is the definition of \"public servant\" as an elected or appointed official of the government (pretty normal) and also\n\n> Any officer, director, commissioner, supervisor, chief, head, agent or\n>  employee of the government or any agency thereof, or of any public\n>  entity created by or under the laws of the State of Mississippi or\n>  created by an agency or governmental entity thereof, any of which is\n>  funded by public funds or which expends, authorizes or recommends the\n>  use of public funds; or\n> \n> \n> Any individual who receives a salary, per diem or expenses paid in\n>  whole or in part out of funds authorized to be expended by the\n>  government.\n\nIn other words, if the money can be traceable back to a governmental unit, that is probably considered to be a \"public body\". Also, \"public employee\" is defined as:\n\n> any individual who receives a salary, per diem or expenses paid in\n>  whole or in part out of funds authorized to be expended by the\n>  Mississippi State Legislature or by the governing body of any\n>  political subdivision thereof, or any other body politic within the\n>  State of Mississippi\n\nFor example, if I happen to give a lecture, not even in Mississippi, and part of my expenses are paid in part by U. Miss, then I am a \"public employee\" \u2013 not the ordinary interpretation of the term, but they can define terms as they want. \n\nThe really tricky part is that the payment does not have to be directly from a public body.

The bookstore received a $5,000 grant from the state library commission to promote literacy. The brother's annual salary was $3,000. How should the candidate respond?\n\nA) Do not list the brother's employment, as it was with a private company.\nB) List the state library commission as a public body from which compensation was received.\nC) Only list if the brother's salary exceeded $1,000 from the grant money specifically.\nD) This information is not relevant to the question and should be omitted entirely.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The question asks for compensation received \"directly or indirectly through another person or business\" from public bodies. The state library commission is a public body, and although the brother worked for a private bookstore, part of his compensation can be traced back to public funds through the grant. The law takes an expansive view of what constitutes compensation from public bodies, including indirect payments. Therefore, to err on the side of caution and full disclosure, the candidate should list the state library commission as a source of compensation for a household member."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58446/treason-vs-being-an-enemy-combatant", "docs_id": 58446, "title": "Treason vs being an enemy combatant", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What distinguishes a civilian charge of treason versus being an enemy combatant?

Someone who is not a US national cannot commit treason against the US, because treason is a breach of allegiance, and non\\-nationals do not owe allegiance. The ruling you mention is not concerned with treason because the defendant is not a national of the United States.\n\nIf a US national meets the definition of enemy combatant then that person has committed treason, the definition of which is limited in the constitution to \"giving aid or comfort to the enemy.\" It is also possible to commit treason without being a combatant, for example by giving indirect support to an enemy where that indirect support is found to constitute \"aid.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a U.S. citizen, is accused of providing financial support to a terrorist organization that is engaged in hostilities against the United States.

As a U.S. citizen, John can potentially be charged with treason for \"giving aid or comfort to the enemy,\" which could include financial support to a terrorist organization.\n2. John could also be classified as an enemy combatant based on the definition provided by Judge Richard J. Leon, which includes individuals who have \"directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces.\" Financial support could be considered direct support, depending on its nature and extent.\n3. Answer A is incorrect because U.S. citizens can be classified as enemy combatants if they meet the criteria.\n4. Answer B is incorrect because treason does not require direct participation in combat, and enemy combatant status can be applied to those who support hostilities without engaging in combat themselves.\n5.
