I don't believe I'm at fault and am considering challenging it in court. I don't want to get an attorney or deal with any of that, so I'm partially counting on the other guy not showing up. At the scene of the accident, the officer told me that if the other guy does not show when subpoenaed that it would be \"a no\\-go\". Am I correct in interpreting this to mean that the ticket will be dropped?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not necessarily. Your own statements and the statements of the officer would be legally sufficient to convict you. \n\nAlso, your statement that you don't believe you are at fault is strongly at odds with a widely held interpretation of the traffic laws (not stated in the formal language of these statutes). The prevailing interpretation of the traffic laws is that you are always at fault if you rear end someone because you failed to maintain a safe distance, pretty much as a matter of strict liability and regardless of the circumstances, because a safe distance is almost by definition a distance that it is possible for you to come to a full stop from if the care in front of you suddenly comes to a stop for any reason. The only situation I can imagine where there wouldn't be liability for rear ending someone would be if you were at rest behind them at a stop light and they actively backed up into you.\n\nIn practice, almost any judge and almost any jury, would convict you of failure to maintain a safe distance if you rear ended someone absent the most extraordinary of circumstances. I honestly don't know any lawyer or likely potential juror who wouldn't convict you under these circumstances with only the testimony of the police officer and your own testimony (which you would have to offer to have any shot at avoiding a conviction) to establish that you did indeed rear end someone.\n\nPolice are allowed to lie to suspects of crimes, and often simply do not have an accurate understanding of how the legal system works. So, you are not entitled to rely on a statement made by a police officer.\n\nOf course, it is also certainly possible that his statement is consistent with local practice in your neighborhood traffic court. So, showing up to contest the charge might still make sense, and it wouldn't be uncommon to receive a plea bargain with fewer points against your license, just for showing up to court."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A driver rear-ends another vehicle and receives a citation for \"failure to maintain safe distance.\" The police officer at the scene tells the driver that if the other party doesn't show up when subpoenaed, it would be \"a no-go.\" Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The driver can be confident that the ticket will be dropped if the other party doesn't show up in court.\nB) The driver's own statements and the officer's testimony are insufficient to convict without the other party present.\nC) The driver has a strong case to challenge the citation since they don't believe they're at fault.\nD) The driver can still be convicted based on their own statements and the officer's testimony, even if the other party is absent.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the documentation, the driver's own statements and the officer's testimony would be legally sufficient to convict them, even if the other party doesn't show up in court. The police officer's statement about it being a \"no-go\" if the other party doesn't appear is not legally binding and may be inaccurate. Additionally, in rear-end collisions, the driver behind is typically considered at fault for failing to maintain a safe distance. The driver's belief that they're not at fault doesn't align with the common interpretation of traffic laws in such cases. Therefore, challenging the citation based on this belief is unlikely to be successful, and the absence of the other party does not guarantee that the ticket will be dropped."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58047/who-would-have-won-the-2020-election-if-did-not-vote-was-a-candidate", "docs_id": 58047, "title": "Who would have won the 2020 election if &quot;did not vote&quot; was a candidate", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This infographic was posted in 2016:\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0mlrx.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/0mlrx.png)\nThe image takes the assumption that all eligible voters (registered or not) in the US who did not vote instead voted for a hypothetical \"did not vote\" candidate.

Chapter 10 deals with witnesses. Here are some relevant sections:\n\n> \u00a7 108\\. Unless otherwise provided by statute, every person summoned to attend as a witness is bound to do so and to give evidence before the court.\n\nThere follow a number of exceptions (spousal privilege, attorney\\-client privilege, state secrets, etc). None of them seem to apply to your example.\n\n> \u00a7 115\\. The court may decide that a witness who fails to attend or who leaves the place of sitting without a valid reason shall be brought before the same or a subsequent sitting of the court. In special cases the court may decide that a witness shall be detained in custody until he can be examined. \n> \n> \n> \u00a7 128\\. Before the examination the president of the court shall admonish the witnesses to tell the whole truth without concealing anything. He shall inform the witnesses of the liability consequent on giving false evidence or making a false affirmation. \n> \n> \n> \u00a7 137\\. If a witness refuses to give evidence after being ordered to do so by a legally enforceable court order, the court may by a new order decide that the witness shall be kept in custody until he fulfils his obligation. Nevertheless a witness may not be kept in custody for more than three months altogether in the same case or in another case relating to the same matter.\n\nSo effectively, if the witness fails to show up voluntarily, he can be brought in forcibly. He can be ordered to testify, and if he refuses, he can be held in custody (probably a jail) for up to three months.\n\nHowever, the authority to compel testimony is limited to courts; the police cannot compel statements from witnesses.\n\n> \u00a7 230\\. The police may take statements from suspected persons, witnesses and experts but may not order any person to make a statement.\n\nSo in your example, it appears that the witnesses would be free to refuse to speak to the police.

Whatever you plan to do, a first step is to *request* to be considered, [here](https://redcap.doh.wa.gov/surveys/?s=KMXJHMALX3) (a \"please contact us\" form). The government may contact you and ask more questions: [here](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/COVID-19-Provider-Enrollment-Guide.pdf) is the enrollment guide (questions you have to be able to answer). I will assume that the parties undertaking this scheme are complying with the law and providing truthful answers. There does not seem to be a question designed to figure out if the facility plans on hiring a thousand temporary workers to get a vaccine. They will ask about number of patients and staff, which would be a problem if the request for 300 doses suddenly became a request for 1,300 doses. There is also a triage system which assigns highest priority to e.g. bronchoscopy specialists in direct contact with infected patients. If people play by the rules, the Washington state system is designed to assure that only those at greatest risk in the health\\-care industry are eligible for Phase 1A doses.\n\nBecause I do not [have a license](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=18.64), I cannot order vaccine from the Dept. of Health, and the DoH information makes it clear that you have to have licensed staff. DoH is constantly suspending credentials for unprofessional conduct, and the above scheme would very likely fall within the sphere of bad behavior that would allow then to pull one or more license. The written guidance is clear enough that your plan is contrary to their requirements that it's not reasonable to say \"But we thought it would be okay\". There may be even stronger reasons that emerge once you apply for vaccines and have to sign some paperwork.\n\nIt is also unclear if nursing homes will even qualify to directly order the vaccine given the storage requirements, instead Walgreens and CVS are administering doses.

At the outset, it would be unreasonable to allow the employer to explicitly state his criteria for hiring and yet be prohibited to implement them.\n\nBut a more important reason for that exception is the premise of *bona fide occupational qualification*. That premise indicates that the legitimate purpose of the employment at issue takes priority over the general intent of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe actual \\& occupational purpose of cheerleading in the NFL context is not to shake pom poms and do choreography on field grass, but to *amuse* men, who comprise the vast majority of the customer base in the football business. Accordingly, the issue is not whether males are fit or unable to cheerlead, but that male cheerleaders simply would not *amuse* the average football fan. The occupational purpose would be frustrated if females were replaced with males.\n\nThe legislative intent of the Civil Rights Act is to preclude discrimination for employment where the protected category (be it sex, religion, etc.) is *irrelevant to the actual fulfillment* of the occupational purpose."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under the Civil Rights Act, which of the following statements best explains why NFL teams can legally hire predominantly female cheerleaders despite the Act's prohibition on sex-based discrimination?\n\nA) The Civil Rights Act does not apply to private organizations like the NFL.\nB) The Act includes an exception for bona fide occupational qualifications where sex is relevant to job performance.\nC) Cheerleading is considered an artistic performance, which is exempt from equal employment laws.\nD) NFL teams have obtained special waivers from the government to maintain gender-specific cheerleading squads.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The Civil Rights Act includes an exception for \"bona fide occupational qualifications\" where sex (or another protected category) is legitimately relevant to job performance. In the case of NFL cheerleaders, it can be argued that female cheerleaders fulfill the occupational purpose of amusing the predominantly male fan base, making gender a bona fide qualification for the role. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Civil Rights Act does apply to private organizations. \nAnswer C is incorrect because while cheerleading may have performative aspects, it is not specifically exempted as an artistic performance. \nAnswer D is incorrect because there's no evidence of special government waivers for NFL cheerleading squads."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86093/can-a-writer-write-a-novel-about-a-fictional-dota-player", "docs_id": 86093, "title": "Can a writer write a novel about a fictional Dota player?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can a writer/author write a novel about a fictional Dota (or any other video game) player, mentioning the game's name and possibly names of the fictional characters of the game?

There is no general law making it illegal to lie about debts, or anything else. It is illegal to lie to a law enforcement officer **in the course of an investigation**. (And of course it is illegal to lie in court testimony or when otherwise under oath.) But it is in no way unlawful to decline to answer, unless a proper court order has been obtained, or other lawful means of compelling an answer. I would expect any law office to respond to such a question with something like \"Am I/we being investigated? If so, send the appropriate notice and our lawyer will consider what we should tell you. If not, tell us what information you want, and we will consider and provide a written response in due course.\"\n2. If a taxpayer has been **found** to be delinquent in paying taxes, in some cases a court order may be obtained seizing assets, including unpaid debts. But no IRS agent can make such a claim on the spot, and indeed for a client to make such a payment without such a court order, or the order of an IRS tribunal (or the creditor's written consent) would itself be unlawful and would subject the lawyer to a suit by the PI (Private Investigator).\n\nWhen the lawyer pays a service provider, a 1099 must be filed with the IRS. If the PI is a corporation, a different form is used, but a record of payment is still required. As failure to timely file such a form is a violation of the tax code, an accusation of paying without filing would permit the lawyer to decline to answer under the Fifth amendment. If the lawyer did pay and did file a 1099 or other documentation, the IRS would know what had been payed, and would not need to confront the PI.\n\nAlso, as the comment by Hilmar points out, a PI would be likely to use the cash accounting method, and so would own no tax on work performed but unpaid (as yet). So unless the IRS agent thinks the PI was paid \"off\\-the books\" and is intentionally failing to report the payment, there would be no point to such a question. And if that were he case, the lawyer would be very likely to decline to answer.\n\nI find the story quite implausible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A private investigator (PI) owes back taxes to the IRS.

One aspect is that by the age of criminal responsibility people have a sufficient awareness of societal norms and understanding of the wrongfulness of their conduct that they be eligible for criminal charges.

The age of criminal responsibility is set based on when a child is believed to understand societal norms and the wrongfulness of their actions, as well as when they might effectively respond to the criminal justice system.

We asked him to ship the \"found\" package back and he did. He persists in getting a \"reward\" for getting the package back from the tenants. Legally, what should we do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This post is tagged \"fraud\", but it doesn't appear to me that there is any fair indication of fraud in this situation. There is no indication that the customer tried to have the first package delivered to the wrong address. There is also no indication that it was the customer, rather than the new resident of the former address, who was not straight forward in their first communications with each other regarding the first package. And, the customer didn't try to keep the first package for himself.\n\nSo, this is not even remotely a case of fraud.\n\nThe issue seems to be that the customer feels entitled to compensation for benefiting you (a benefit you accepted) by taking efforts that he had no obligation to engage in, in order to cause the first package to be returned to you, on basically a theory of unjust enrichment.\n\nThere is a colorable argument that the customer is entitled to whatever he spent to mail the first package back to you and some nominal amount for his effort in doing so.\n\nIn the law of unjust enrichment, if someone does work with a reasonable expectation of getting paid, in the absence of a contractual agreement, and you allow that person to proceed with working and accept the benefit of his work, he is entitled to the fair market value of his efforts.\n\nThe classic case is that of a house painter who paints your house, rather than the house of a neighbor with whom he actually had a contract, by mistake. In that situation, if you know he is mistaken but allow him to paint your house anyway without objection, you have to pay him for doing so, even in the absence of an agreement to do so.\n\nThe reason that the customer's claim is only colorable, rather than clear, in this case, is that it isn't obvious that the customer had a reasonable expectation that he would be paid or rewarded for his efforts to get the first package returned to you. He clearly did have that expectation, but it isn't obvious that his expectation was reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nMost likely, he would not prevail in a lawsuit against you for a reward and would not even try to bring one unless the first package was extremely valuable (if he managed to cause a $10,000 item to be returned to you the case \"feels\" different than if he managed to cause a $100 item to be returned to you).\n\nBut, while he is unlikely to sue you, so you could just say \"no\", he did do you a good turn and clearly would be quite upset if you said \"no\", which could lead to be reviews and/or publicity about your business. So, to preserve your reputation, you might want to pay him a reward equal to any cost he incurred to ship the first package back to you and some nominal amount of money relative to his efforts and your benefit from his actions.\n\nThis would maintain goodwill, the amount of money involved would be tiny in the larger scheme of things, it isn't likely to bind you to major expenses in the future, and to the extent anyone learns about it, it would encourage future customers to take action that leaves you better off than it they did nothing as the customer could have done."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer receives a package at their new address after initially failing to receive it at their old address.

While the company isn't legally obligated to provide a reward, the customer's actions benefited the company. Under the principle of unjust enrichment, there's a colorable argument for compensation, though it's debatable whether the customer's expectation of a reward was reasonable. To maintain goodwill and encourage positive customer behavior, offering a nominal reward (covering shipping costs plus a small amount) is a prudent approach, even though it's not legally required.

I received a request from a documentary filmmaker about wanting to use a portion of a live\\-streamed footage of our concert. The clip lives on our YouTube channel, which is where the filmmaker came across it. In the contract with the performing band, it stipulates that the festival reserves to right to live stream the performance and place on YouTube in perpetuity, and also that media outlets may use record and use 2 minutes of the performance (doesn't say of the 'livestreamed' performance). It doesn't say anything about allowing a third party to use it for another type of a production (\\=documentary). \n\nMy question is: who owns rights to this footage? The festival, the company that did the livestreaming, the band, the band's label? Do I (as the festival) have a right to give permission to use the footage to this filmmaker? If I should refer them to someone else, who should it be?\n\nIf it helps, I am in Canada, the artist from Columbia, as is the filmmaker who made the request.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, copyright flows from the end of a pen (or at the A/D converter of a digital recording device). However, owning the copyright to a specific artifact, such as a digital video clip, does not trump all the other rights and claims that may be made regarding the materials captured within that clip. Which means that there are several rights all in play at the same time, and those rights may conflict. The legal term for getting enough rights so that you can do what you want with the rights you own is called \"clearance\" by those in the industry, and \"collective rights management\" by Wikipedia (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_rights_management>).\n\nThe long and short of it is that it is not enough for you to \"own\" your video clip if you want to use it somehow. Depending on how you want to use it, and your tolerance for risk, you need to get every party who might lay a claim to any copyrighted or trademarked material within your video clip to agree that they are OK with you using it in whatever way you say you want to use it.\n\nSometimes you can ask for, and receive, a \"worldwide, perpetual, royalty\\-free license to use XYZ material in any way, imagined or not yet imagined\". Other times, you might have to settle for more limited rights \"a performance of the video at the ABC Bar in New York City, on December 31, 2015 only, for a fee of $10,000 paid to XYZ Rights Holding Company,\" and agree to a whole bunch of other stipulations to boot.\n\nThere are entire industries that make furniture and automobiles for Hollywood studios so that they don't have to ask for the rights to feature an IKEA kitchen table or a Ford station wagon in a movie. That's how bad/hard the clearance problem can be.\n\nIf you are lucky (and risk\\-tolerant), you might only need permissions from the band and the film maker. If you are unlucky or not risk tolerant, you might need permission from every person captured on camera, and from every company that made every item that appear anywhere in the film.

As explained in the documentation, owning the copyright to a video clip doesn't override all other rights related to the content within that clip. The festival may have certain rights based on their contract with the band, but these rights are limited (e.g., live streaming and YouTube hosting). The contract doesn't explicitly cover use in a documentary by a third party. Therefore, the festival would likely need to consult with the band and possibly other stakeholders (such as the band's label or individual performers) before granting permission for use in a documentary.

But since you ask in terms of a user's \"*right to try*\", I needed to clarify this.\n\n> Is a software developer responsible for source code they give away for\n>  a tutorial?\n\nNo. You (or any developer sharing his or her code) are not liable for others' misunderstanding and/or lack of scrutiny of any tutorial code they use in Production, even if that source code was released by yourself. The legal jargon for this would be that the user(s) *unreasonably relied* upon the source code at issue.\n\nMoreover, the fact that others need to copy/paste code from a tutorial suggests that they probably shouldn't be tweaking Production yet. It is widely known that code needs to be thoroughly tested in a non\\-production environment prior to moving it to Production. It is not the tutorial author's responsibility to foresee or prevent that chain of deficits of the person(s) who are in charge of that system.\n\nThe developer does not even need to include the disclaimer of \"*availability as is with no warranty*\".

According to the documentation, software developers are not responsible for how others use code provided in tutorials. Users who implement tutorial code in production environments without proper testing are considered to be unreasonably relying on the code.

For example, you offer every person $1 million if they refrain from discussing peanut butter with you.

Also, the contract needs to have a clause where you are forced to pay out (is this a lifetime restriction \u2013 whose lifetime?).

I presume attainder means detention, but I can't work out what \"corruption of blood\" or \"forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted\" means or why it's prohibited.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In English law during the late Medieval and early modern period (from 1321 to 1798\\), it was possible for Parliament to pass a \"Bill Of Attainder\". This declared a person guilty of a crime, often treason, by legislative act, without any trial or other legal process. See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder) for more detail.\n\nOften a Bill of Attainder not only decreed that a person (or people) was guilty, but also confiscated the convicted person's property, preventing his (or rarely her) heirs from inheriting, and possibly rendering those heirs ineligible to hold public offices or peerages. The heir would also be prevented from inheriting **through** the attainted person. For example, property held by the father of the attainted person would not pass to the child of the attainted person. This was called \"corruption of the blood\", and was viewed with particular horror by many during the colonial period and before. It effectivly treated the heirs of the attainted person as illegitimate.\n\nAttainder was usually followed by execution, possibly by torture. The bill might specify the specific fate of the person attained.\n\nThe US constitutional provision prohibits declaring people guilty of crimes by legislative act, and prohibits sentences for crimes that take property or rights from the family or heirs of the convicted person, even in cases of treason. At least that is how it has been interpreted. Fines may be levied, but may only fall on the actual property of the person convicted. \n\nThe US Supreme Court has dealt with this clause in several cases:\n\n* *Ex parte Garland*, 71 U.S. 333 (1866\\) (law requiring lawyers to swear that they had not supported the confederacy held unconstitutional);\n* *Cummings v. Missouri*, 71 U.S. 277 (1867\\) (Law requiring an oath that the person had not supported the confederacy for a professional license held unconstitutional);\n* *Hawker v. New York*, 170 U.S. 189 (1898\\) (a state law barring convicted felons from practicing medicine upheld);\n* *Dent v. West Virginia*, 129 U.S. 114 (1889\\), (a state law newly requiring that practising physicians must have graduated from a licensed medical school upheld);\n* *United States v. Lovett*, 328 U.S. 303 (1946\\) (federal law which declared three specific persons \"subversive\" and barred them from federal employment overturned);\n* *American Communications Association v. Douds*, 339 U.S. 382 (1950\\) (federal law which required elected labour leaders to take an oath that they were not and had never been members of the Communist Party USA, and that they did not advocate violent overthrow of the U.S. government upheld);\n* *United States v. Brown*, 381 U.S. 437 (1965\\) (law which made it a crime for a former communist to serve on a union's board overturned);\n* and *Nixon v.

Specifically, it prohibits the practice of taking away inheritance rights or property from the heirs of someone convicted of treason. This was a common practice in English law through \"Bills of Attainder,\" which could not only punish the person convicted but also their descendants. The U.S. Constitution explicitly forbids this, ensuring that only the person convicted of treason can be punished, and that their punishment cannot extend to depriving their heirs of property or rights. This is what is meant by prohibiting \"corruption of blood.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the provision doesn't directly address execution. \nOption C is incorrect as it doesn't relate to jury trials. \nOption D is incorrect because while the Constitution does define treason, this specific provision doesn't limit Congress's ability to further define treasonous acts."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73977/what-are-the-laws-around-punching-someone-for-calling-you-a-name", "docs_id": 73977, "title": "What are the laws around punching someone for calling you a name?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am looking to learn about something I know nothing about, please excuse my terminology, I am looking for leading answers to learn.\n\nIf I call someone a name \"you dumbass\" and they punch me in the face, and we end up fighting, how would a court handle that?

By and large, name calling is not a justification for violence.\n\nSubsequently, the word \u201cfight\u201d is too broad to to decide if either of you have committed further offences. If \u201cfight\u201d means a minor scuffle that ends quickly with no serious injuries then probably no further offences have occurred: you are entitled to defend yourself using reasonable force. However, self\\-defence stops as soon as you are no longer at risk of imminent harm \\- if you strike your assailant and knock them down (perhaps even killing them), that can be self\\-defence. If you knock them down and then beat their head with a piece of timber \\- that isn\u2019t.\n\nOf course, context matters. If you yell \"you dumbass\" while charging at the person with your fists raised, you have probably committed assault and *they* are entitled to defend themselves, including hitting you first. However, it is not the words alone that make this assault \\- it is the words as part of the whole situation and if that puts the other person in reasonable apprehension of imminent harm.\n\nThere is a concept of [fighting words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_words) but those are **not** words that justify fighting \\- they are words that fall outside the particular jurisdiction\u2019s free speech protections.

According to the information provided, name-calling alone is generally not considered a legal justification for violence. Person B's act of punching Person A in response to being called a \"dumbass\" would likely be considered assault and battery. The concept of \"fighting words\" does not justify violent responses, but rather refers to speech that governments may criminalize. Person A's verbal insult, while rude, does not typically constitute a crime or justify a physical attack.

As buses pulled into the stop, TfL inspectors would check the tickets of those onboard and also those getting off.\n> \n> \n> \u201cAnyone without a valid ticket is required to provide their details to a TfL inspector so a penalty fare can be issued. This is not a policing matter. **Officers only become involved where details are not provided or where someone tries to leave when challenged.**\n> \n> \n> **\u201cThe woman involved in this incident was asked to provide her ticket as she got off the bus, but did not do so. She was spoken to by a TfL inspector, then by a PCSO and finally by a police officer. She continued to try to walk away and did not provide her ticket for inspection.**\n> \n> \n> **\u201cShe was arrested on suspicion of fare evasion and was handcuffed. When officers were able to take her ticket from her so that the TfL inspectors could check it, they were able to confirm it was valid. She was immediately de\\-arrested and her handcuffs were removed.**\n> \n> \n> \u201cThroughout the incident, the child was comforted by a PCSO who immediately recognised his distress. Anyone seeing how upset he was would be moved by this, and we regret any impact it may have on him.\n> \n> \n> \u201cWe recognise that the use of handcuffs can be a cause of concern, particularly given the context of this incident and the type of offence involved, but when a person is trying to physically leave an incident it is an option officers can consider. All uses of force must be proportionate and necessary in the circumstances.\n> \n> \n> \u201cTicket inspection operations of this nature are difficult. They place police officers in direct confrontation with frustrated members of the public and could escalate what would otherwise be civil matters to a different level.\n> \n> \n> \u201cThis incident raises questions about the extent to which officers are having to intervene in this way when supporting TfL in their operations. We will now work with TfL to ensure that the balance is right between officers tackling the most serious crime on the transport network and supporting their own operations to ensure revenue protection.\n> \n> \n> \u201cAn initial review of the officers\u2019 actions did not identify any conduct matters but we will reflect on it carefully, in discussion with communities locally, to urgently identify any opportunities to do things differently.\n> \n> \n> \u201cGiven the level of community concern generated we believe it is in the public interest to voluntarily refer the matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct to review.\u201d\n\n---\n\n**ORIGINAL ANSWER**\n\n**YES**\n\nA breach of the Regulations is a summary offence.

Based on the legal information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal basis for her arrest?\n\nA) The arrest was illegal because fare evasion is a civil matter, not a criminal offense.\n\nB) The arrest was legal only if the woman refused to provide her name and address when asked by the ticket inspector.\n\nC) The arrest was legal if the woman failed to produce a valid ticket when requested by the driver, inspector, or conductor, as this constitutes a summary offense under the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981.\n\nD) The arrest was legal only if the woman physically assaulted the ticket inspector or police officer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, fare evasion can be considered a summary offense under Section 67 of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981, when combined with the Public Service Vehicles (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations 1990. Specifically, Paragraph 7(2)(e) of the Regulations requires passengers to produce their ticket for inspection when requested. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in a summary offense, which allows for arrest under Section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, provided all relevant conditions are met.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fare evasion can be a criminal offense, not just a civil matter. Option B is too narrow, as the offense isn't limited to refusing to provide personal details. Option D is incorrect because physical assault is not necessary for the arrest to be legal in this context."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37080/if-someone-tells-you-to-trespass-can-you-trespass", "docs_id": 37080, "title": "If someone tells you to trespass, can you trespass?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sometimes I watch encounters where a person tauntingly but clearly telling another person to come here,\\[here as in his own property], or come here if you are a man, etc etc..\n\nIs it legal to go on to his property as you have his permission?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, although that strictly speaking that would depend on the precise, statutory definition of trespass.

In Australia, courts have specific expectations for juror attire, emphasizing neat and respectful clothing. Wearing an outlandish costume would likely be seen as disrespectful to the court. This behavior could be interpreted as contempt of court, which is a serious offense. As per the information provided, contempt of court can result in expulsion from court, fines, or even jail time.

The consensus at the time was that a \"traditional\" i.e. non\\-half\\-hourly (NHH), non\\-smart meter reading itself was not considered personal data \\- they are conceptually tied to a metering point (which may or may not be a physical meter), not to an individual and don't represent an individual's energy consumption (the granularity of the reading is insufficient to tell anything about the usage profile)\n\nBut this information, while all around the implementation of GDPR it was a couple of years back and to be honest it was bugging me that I might be out\\-of\\-date on the current practices so I reached out to a former colleague who was the Data Protection Officer at the supplier I worked at to try and get a more up\\-to\\-date take. He's since moved on but was there until recently so has more experience with the topic since GDPR actually went into effect.\n\nI asked him whether a) estimated opening reads were considered \"personal data\" and b) what would happen with a request to change one under article 16 and he had this to say, I've translated industry\\-speak in square brackets:\n\n> a) for NHH \\[\"Non Half Hourly\" \\- meters that are read ad\\-hoc, essentially all non\\-smart domestic meters will be this] an estimated reading wasn't personal data automatically until the billing flag was set in CRM and those would be the only ones we'd include on an SAR \\[Subject Access Request], any others are internal data not personal. HH \\[\"Half Hourly\" \\- meters for higher consumption users, typically larger business premises are billed on increments for each half hour so have readings for each] and remote \\[smart meter] readings are always personal for domestic and microb \\[micro\\-businesses are a certain class of non\\-domestic energy customer see [condition 7A](https://epr.ofgem.gov.uk/Content/Documents/Electricity%20Supply%20Standard%20Licence%20Conditions%20Consolidated%20-%20Current%20Version.pdf)]\n> \n> \n> b) erm no! we'd only change it if the value in CRM didn't match the value in the D10 \\[industry Data Flow used to transmit meter reads] for some reason. if they match it's an accurate representation of what we estimate the reading to be so it's just a vanilla billing dispute not a data protection issue so i'd have punted it to \\[name of person who was head of metering]\n\nFrom that it would sound as though the estimated read **would** count as personal data \\- *so long as it's being used for billing purposes*, but that doesn't mean they *have* to accept your read in it's stead. \n\nIt all comes down to accuracy \\- GDPR requires that personal data be \"accurate\" but provides no definition as to what \"accurate\" means (which makes sense since you can't give a one\\-size\\-fits\\-all answer that isn't an encyclopedia) and while The Electricity Directive 2019 confirms the need for accuracy in billing again it doesn't tell us what that means. The implementation is left to member state regulators.\n\nIn the UK this is OFGEM and all opening meter readings are validated through third parties (so you don't end up with the foxes guarding the hen house!) and are calculated using the following formula:\n\n> Last validated reading for the meter point \\<\\= supplied reading \\<\\= (expected daily usage x number of days since last validated reading x 2\\.5\\)\n\nwhere \"expected daily usage\" is obtained from a database maintained by the regulator \\- it's calculated off meter type, property type, property use, previous validated reads etc.\n\nSo if the customer provides a reading that falls outside the above the supplier can (and in practice invariably will) reject it as being inaccurate.\n\nNow this is why the *when* a meter reading is provided matters \\- reads you provide are always assumed to be the read on the day you give them. With opening reads there's some leeway, I can't remember the official rule on how much but usually they give you up to the *next* estimated read is generated but more on that later.\n\nNow if the reading you're trying to submit is a \"now\" reading and it's failed the validation criteria and you aren't happy with the rejection you can force the issue by demanding the supplier come read the meter.\n\nYou don't say how long has passed since the opening read \\- more than the week from what you've said so presumably at least a month (guessing you've had at least your first bill).\n\nNow if they are saying the opening read was X (based on the estimated usage) and you're it should have been X \\+ Y and the current reading is X \\+ Y \\+ Z you want to pay your *actual* usage Z not Y \\+ Z. What you need to do is dispute the opening read, which you're entitled to do, arguably GDPR of Article 16 gives you this right, but on it's own it's a weak argument. There's established means by which an estimated read's \"accuracy\" is determined and assuming they followed that they're going to just tell you that as far as they are concerned it is accurate. Any challenge to that accuracy is going to have to be done within the legal/regulatory frameworks for assessing accuracy, that's what they're there for, if they won't accept your reading escalate that to the regulator \\- and as soon as you can. OFGEM for example allow disputing of opening reads for 12 months \\- it doesn't have to be resolved within that 12 months it just has to be lodged with them within that time.\n\nIf you try and use the GDPR angle to pursue this IMHO it's going to muddy the waters and not help you get what you need \\- pursue this on billing accuracy."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the expert's response, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding estimated meter readings and GDPR in the context of energy billing?\n\nA) Estimated meter readings are always considered personal data under GDPR, regardless of their use.\n\nB) Article 16 of GDPR gives customers the absolute right to change estimated meter readings at any time.\n\nC) Estimated meter readings are considered personal data only when used for billing purposes, but this doesn't guarantee the right to change them under GDPR.\n\nD) Energy companies are required by GDPR to accept customer-provided meter readings, even if they fall outside the validation criteria.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert's response indicates that estimated meter readings are considered personal data only when used for billing purposes.

I am fairly sure that posting a copy of a contemporary book in the open is not \"fair use\" even if the intent is to make it possible for dummies to study chemistry: such copying is not at all transformative, totally unlimited, and provides a significant market substitute for the protected work."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of downloading and sharing copyrighted books online under U.S. copyright law?\n\nA) Downloading and sharing entire copyrighted books online is generally protected under fair use (Section 107) if the intent is educational.\n\nB) Libraries can make unlimited copies of copyrighted books available online under Section 108 of the Copyright Act.\n\nC) An individual downloading a copyrighted book from the internet is not granted any permission under Section 108, as this section primarily applies to libraries and archives.\n\nD) Posting a full copy of a contemporary copyrighted book online is typically considered fair use if it's done to make the information more accessible to the public.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided clearly states that Section 108 of the Copyright Act primarily applies to libraries and archives, not to individual internet users downloading copyrighted material. The text specifically mentions that \"The internet downloader is not a library or an archive, so the downloader is not granted any permission under 108 to make a copy.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because fair use (Section 107) is unlikely to protect the downloading and sharing of entire copyrighted books, even for educational purposes. The text states that posting a copy of a contemporary book openly is likely not fair use, even with educational intent.\n\nOption B is false because Section 108 does not allow libraries to make unlimited copies available online. The text mentions that under 108(a), a library can make no more than one copy available.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the information explicitly states that posting a full copy of a contemporary book online is not considered fair use, even if the intent is to make it more accessible. The text notes that such copying is \"not at all transformative, totally unlimited, and provides a significant market substitute for the protected work.\""}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77613/did-i-commit-sexual-harassment-by-asking-a-spam-caller-when-they-would-sleep-wit", "docs_id": 77613, "title": "Did I commit sexual harassment by asking a spam caller when they would sleep with me, to stop the calls?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend used to complain that he gets phone calls from credit card companies many times (about 1\\-2 times per day). I had noticed the same, we would be chilling and he would get such calls and it was pretty irritating. They would change their phone numbers so frequently that blocking the numbers was useless.\n\nOne day when we were watching a movie such a call comes and he gets furious. I tell him that I will handle it and I take the phone. I talk to the credit card selling woman for some time asking things I am not at all interested in and then I state that sure I will take it, but when will you sleep with me. She thought she probably misheard and asked me that she didn't get me the last time and I repeated the exact same thing again to her. She paused for around 10 secs and then disconnected it herself and my friend never ever got a phone call from those credit card companies again.\n\nHowever as I was narrating my story to another friend, I was informed that this probably constitutes sexual harassment. Even though it has been months since the incident, I am a bit concerned. Did I actually do something illegal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The legal answer is that it depends on where in the world you are. In the US, \"sexual harassment\" is legally subsumed under laws against illegal discrimination, which can exist at the federal level and the state level. You cannot discriminate on the basis of race for employment, housing, public accomodations and so on. You cannot discriminate on the basis of sex in employment. However, you are not employing anyone, so that law does not apply to you. In general, being a customer or potential customer, or a person in possession of a phone, is not a federally\\-regulated activity.\n\nThe First Amendment to the US Constitution protects your right to expression, regardless of whether they may be found to be offensive. It is legal in the US to be rude."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of making an offensive or sexually suggestive comment to a telemarketer?\n\nA) It always constitutes sexual harassment and is illegal under federal law.\nB) It is protected speech under the First Amendment, regardless of content.\nC) It is only illegal if the caller is employed by the person making the comment.\nD) It may be considered rude but is generally not illegal due to First Amendment protections.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, in the United States, making offensive or sexually suggestive comments to a telemarketer is generally not illegal due to First Amendment protections of free speech. While such behavior may be considered rude or offensive, it does not typically fall under legal definitions of sexual harassment, which are primarily concerned with workplace discrimination. The First Amendment protects various forms of expression, even if they may be deemed offensive by some. Options A and C are incorrect because sexual harassment laws primarily apply to employment contexts, not to interactions between customers and telemarketers. Option B is too broad, as there are some forms of speech not protected by the First Amendment, but this situation likely does not fall into those categories."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42160/how-to-find-audio-of-us-supreme-court-oral-arguments", "docs_id": 42160, "title": "How to find audio of US Supreme Court oral arguments?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The newer audio (starting with 2010\\) are available on the Supreme Court's website.
