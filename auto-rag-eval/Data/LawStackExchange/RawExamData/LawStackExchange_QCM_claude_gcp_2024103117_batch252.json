Landlord pays utilities. Non\\-signatory pays tenant for their stay in the apartment.\n2. Landlord pays utilities. Non\\-signatory lives for free in the apartment.\n3. Landlord pays utilities. Non\\-signatory doesn't pay money to live in the apartment, but is obliged (through oral agreement or contract) to pay in other ways, e.g. cleaning the apartment.\n4. Landlord doesn't pay utilities. Non\\-signatory pays tenant for their stay in the apartment.\n5. Landlord doesn't pay utilities. Non\\-signatory lives for free in the apartment.\n6. Landlord doesn't pay utilities. Non\\-signatory doesn't pay money to live in the apartment, but is obliged (through oral agreement or contract) to pay in other ways, e.g. cleaning the apartment.\n\nIn all scenarios, the landlord has been unaware of the non\\-signatory's stay. Also, I'd like to consider another conditional to the \"landlord doesn't pay utilities\", dividing all those scenarios into two, some of which the landlord only pays for water bills. This is because it seems to me, from experience, that water bills are special (perhaps very cheap or subject to different laws), as I've never seen an apartment listed where the water bills aren't paid for.\n\n---\n\n**Reflections on the scenarios' legality:**\n\nI assume 1\\. is obviously illegal. The landlord receives an increase in their expenses without their consent, and the tenant is making money off of the landlord's property, again, without the landlord's consent. In scenario 4\\., the latter part also applies. I think maybe both 1\\. and 4\\. would be considered theft?\n\nNumber 2\\. is problematic, as the landlord still receives an increase in their expenses. However, if the tenant decides to simply shower more and to live more luxuriously all of a sudden, the landlord's expenses would increase due to the tenant's decisions. Surely, the tenants decisions aren't illegal in this scenario, and the landlord's only option is to crank up the lease. So, why would then the scenario be different, if the decision causing the landlord's increased expenses, is the decision to allow a non\\-signatory to live in the apartment? Just like how the tenant choosing to live more luxuriously is their right, a right uninfringed by the fact that it leads to increased expenses for the landlord, surely allowing someone else to stay in the apartment for free is also within the tenant's rights? Maybe the difference is that one expense increase is caused by the intensity of use of the product of the product's legal leaser, whereas the other is caused by the addition of an illegal leaser?\n\nNumber 5\\. is still problematic for those same reasons. For example, if the landlord pays the water bills, their expenses will increase a little. Also, the wear and tear of the apartment will be worse, thus increasing the expenses. Not sure if this is impacted by the existence of a deposit. Then again, wearing that isn't covered by the deposit will still be worsened by more people living in the apartment.\n\nIf say, number 2 and/or 5 are legal, I could see that 3\\. and/or 6\\. would still be illegal. I guess it depends on what is legally considered payment or not.\n\n---\n\n**What counts as staying at an apartment:**\n\nIs the difference between *staying at an apartment* and *frequently visiting and sleeping at an apartment* of a quantitative and/or qualitative kind?

Categories \\#1 and \\#4 are subleases. The other categories are species of guest arrangements.\n\nThose provisions, when they are present, typically prohibit occupancy by anyone other than the adults who are signed tenants and their children, and typically prohibit subleasing without landlord permission which shall not be unreasonably withheld (with the original tenant as a guarantor of the subtenant's obligation).\n\nIn most jurisdictions, the default rule of law is that you may sublet or have a guest who doesn't violate building code requirements unless the lease provide otherwise, but landlord\\-tenant law isn't entirely uniform from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

Businesses generally have the right to refuse service based on their own criteria, as long as those criteria don't constitute illegal discrimination (such as discrimination based on race, gender, or religion). In this case, refusing service to people in school uniforms is not illegal discrimination, as it's not targeting a protected class. The store may have this policy to avoid potential issues with local schools or to reduce the risk of inadvertently selling to underage customers. While it might be good practice to display signage about such policies, it's not legally required.

For example, you might reasonably want to have written comments on assignments given within a week: but there is no rule guaranteeing that you will ever get written comments. (You need to look at the university rules to see what is an actual rule, as opposed to a \"goal\" for an academic unit). Since there is no such rule, the chairman has limited authority to penalize the instructor (he might for example decide to not assign that class to Prof. X in the future).

Based on the residency requirements, what is likely to be the outcome of his application?\n\nA) John's application will be automatically approved because his work in the BVI is considered an extension of his UK residency.\n\nB) John's application will likely be rejected because time spent in British Overseas Territories does not count towards UK residency requirements.\n\nC) John's application may be approved if he can provide compelling evidence that his absence was an unavoidable consequence of his disaster relief work.\n\nD) John's application will be automatically rejected because he has not yet lived in the UK for a full 5 years.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: British Overseas Territories, including the BVI, do not count as part of the UK for citizenship residency requirements. However, the Home Office may consider exceptions for absences that are an \"unavoidable consequence of the nature of your work.\" As a disaster relief worker responding to a hurricane, John may be able to justify his 85-day absence if he provides compelling evidence. This falls within the 90-day limit for absences in the last 12 months. While option C is not guaranteed, it represents the most likely positive outcome based on the information provided.

This seems to fit the public definition quite nicely. It's also arguable whether the chatroom members have reasonable expectation of privacy, a la the Wiretap Act.\n\nIf, say, someone were to record conversations on such a server and later disclose them, would this be considered recording in a public space? Does the size of the server matter? Has this happened before, and if so, is there any precedent I might be missing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two kinds of jurisdictions in this matter, one where some participant must consent to the recording, and thise (a minority) where all must consent. California is an all\\-party consent state, so we can take that as the highest hurdle that you have to clear. [Cal. Penal \u00a7632](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&part=1.&title=15.&chapter=1.5.) say (emphasis added)\n\n> A person who, intentionally and without the *consent of all parties*\n>  to a confidential communication, uses an electronic amplifying or\n>  recording device to eavesdrop upon or record the *confidential\n>  communication*, whether the communication is carried on among the\n>  parties in the presence of one another or by means of a telegraph,\n>  telephone, or other device, except a radio, shall be punished by a\n>  fine not exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500\\) per\n>  violation, or imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or\n>  in the state prison, or by both that fine and imprisonment.\n\nThe definition of confident communication is important:\n\n> For the purposes of this section, \u201cconfidential communication\u201d means\n>  any communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably\n>  indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined\n>  to the parties thereto, but excludes a communication made in a public\n>  gathering or in any legislative, judicial, executive, or\n>  administrative proceeding open to the public, or in any other\n>  circumstance in which the parties to the communication may reasonably\n>  expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.\n\nThere have been two standards regarding the reasonable expectation of privacy, one that is about recording, and one about disclosure (which would allow recordings if not disclosed). The California Supreme Court found in favor of the \"no recording\" interpretation\n\n> Under the construction adopted here, the Privacy Act is a coherent\n>  statutory scheme. It protects against intentional, nonconsensual\n>  recording of telephone conversations regardless of the content of the\n>  conversation or the type of telephone involved. In contrast, the\n>  O'Laskey standard urged by Honorine and adopted by the Court of Appeal\n>  would provide significantly less protection from surreptitious\n>  eavesdropping or recording when both telephones are landline\n>  telephones, a distinction that lacks any justification in terms of the\n>  purpose of the Privacy Act.\n\nInternet \"chat\" communication poses some interesting problems regarding objectively reasonable expectations, and we don't want to get bogged down in OT technical questions. The public / private distinction could be relevant because communications made in a public gathering are statutorily excluded. The law does not define \"public\" or \"gathering\", but it is unlikely that the court would hold that a gathering can only exist when the bodies involved are in a single location. There does not seem to be any precedent that tells us whether an openly accessible online chat room is a \"public gathering\", so the courts may need to look into legislative intent to see whether a chatroom is or is not one (it's hard to see how they would *not* find a chatroom to be just like a physical gathering).\n\nEven without such a determination, the question is whether a person has an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy. I don't see how one can have such an expectation in an open\\-to\\-all chatroom. Anyone can drop by; you probably are announced when you enter and leave; you know, or should know, that the internet keeps track of everything. It would be possible to create a chatroom with a privacy expectation, but if we take SE chatrooms as a model, there is zero expectation of privacy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of recording conversations in online platforms like Discord or Skype, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of such recordings in California?\n\nA) Recording conversations in any online chatroom is always legal as long as one party consents.\n\nB) Recording conversations in a public Discord server with an open invitation link is legal without consent, as it's considered a \"public gathering\".\n\nC) Recording conversations in any online platform requires consent from all parties involved, regardless of the platform's accessibility.\n\nD) Recording conversations in an open online chatroom may be legal without consent, but it depends on whether participants have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In California, an all-party consent state, the legality of recording conversations depends on whether the communication is considered \"confidential.\" The key factor is whether participants have a reasonable expectation of privacy. In an open online chatroom, especially one with public access, it's difficult to argue for a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, the law doesn't explicitly define online spaces as \"public gatherings,\" so there's some ambiguity. The courts would likely consider factors such as the chatroom's accessibility, the number of participants, and how the platform operates to determine if there's a reasonable expectation of privacy. Therefore, while recording in an open chatroom may often be legal without consent, it's not a blanket rule and depends on the specific circumstances."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/94253/is-an-employer-permitted-to-use-images-of-employees-for-marketing-without-their", "docs_id": 94253, "title": "Is an employer permitted to use images of employees for marketing without their consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Paul works in a restaurant, sometimes as a chef and sometimes as a bartender.

In the case in the question, the economic damages are unlikely to exceed the $750 amount unless the employer is a massive chain of restaurants.\n\nThere are arguments that could be made against liability in this case, so it wouldn't be a sure recovery, but it would have a decedent chance of success.\n\nThe goal of the statute in this context is to have the employer separately pay a small fee, perhaps a few hundred bucks, to employees who serve as models for advertisements in addition to being employees doing their ordinary work. Of course, if your occupation is to be a promotional model (my wife's line of work for many years), your consent is inferred from the circumstances.\n\nThe statute states, in the pertinent part:\n\n> (a) Any person who knowingly uses another's name . . . photograph, or\n> likeness, in any manner, . . . for purposes of advertising or selling,\n> or soliciting purchases of, products, merchandise, goods or services,\n> without such person's prior consent, . . . shall be liable for any\n> damages sustained by the person or persons injured as a result\n> thereof.

What does it accomplish?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A subpoena is nothing more than court process compelling someone to testify as a witness or to produce documents in their possession, custody and control, or both, usually in connection with a court case.\n\nMost people who are subject to a subpoena are not being asked to offer testimony that could implicate them in a crime. They simply have evidence relevant to a case.\n\nFor example, bank records are routinely subpoenaed to generate evidence that can be used in a civil or criminal case against someone, even though no one accuses the bank of doing anything improper.\n\nMany witnesses are also just not bothered to testify or actively don't want to testify, even though the evidence would not personally reflect poorly on them in any way, if they are not compelled to do so. \n\nFor example, they may simply be very busy at profitable activities, or may fear retaliation from people involved in the case.\n\nAlso, subpoenas are not infrequently issued where the witness is personally happy to testify but needs court process to get permission to be away from work or other obligations.\n\nA subpoena can also overcome legal obligations to not voluntarily provide information even when it is not legally privileged. For example, a lawyers ethical obligation not to voluntarily share information about a client (even information that isn't attorney\\-client privileged like the existence of an attorney\\-client relationship or the amount of money that the attorney holds in a trust account for the client's benefit) is broader than the attorney\\-client privilege and a lawyer can be compelled to provide such information by subpoena.\n\nTo invoke the 5th Amendment in a case where you are not a defendant, you must have some good faith belief that your testimony would expose you to criminal liability, something that the vast majority of witnesses under a subpoena do not.\n\nYou cannot invoke the 5th Amendment, for example, to protect yourself from having to testify regarding something that may be highly embarrassing and may even constitute a violation of the law, but is not a crime.\n\nFor example, you can't invoke the 5th Amendment to prevent yourself from having to admit under oath in court testimony that you cheated on your boyfriend with someone else, or that you forgot to lock up the office the night before it was burglarized, or that you lied about having won a military decoration that you publicly claimed to have won but really didn't, or that you are in default on your mortgage, or that you are out of legal immigration status.\n\nThe 5th Amendment can also not be invoked to prevent you have having to testify about violations of professional ethics that are not crimes. For example, an attorney could be compelled to testify that she failed to keep confidential information private by telling her bartender client secrets.\n\nA subpoena is basically useless against a defendant in a criminal case, who has the right not to be compelled to testify in his or her own case. \n\nBut, in a civil case, you can subpoena someone to testify against themselves and they then have the choice of invoking the 5th Amendment and having an adverse inference entered against them (usually resulting in them losing the case if they are a party to it), or not invoking the 5th Amendment and testifying even though truthful testimony on the subject may be incriminating and may be used against you in a criminal prosecution.\n\nSomeone can also be compelled to testify regarding matters that could be self\\-incriminating in a civil or criminal case if someone with authority to do so (generally the relevant prosecuting attorney) grants the person compelled to testimony immunity from prosecution (usually all that must be granted is immunity from prosecution based upon the testimony offered, called \"use immunity\", which is still less than someone admitting to criminal conduct might need to feel comfortable if testifying voluntarily).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A corporate whistleblower has been subpoenaed to testify in a civil case against their former employer.

The whistleblower can invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination, but in a civil case, this can lead to adverse inferences being drawn against them. This aligns with the documentation stating that in civil cases, invoking the Fifth Amendment can result in \"an adverse inference entered against them (usually resulting in them losing the case if they are a party to it).\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because invoking the Fifth Amendment in a civil case does have potential consequences, namely adverse inferences.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination does apply in civil cases, not just criminal ones.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while immunity can be granted to compel testimony, it's not the only circumstance under which someone can be compelled to testify.

Taking a screenshot is copying, and all copying requires the permission of the copyright owner.\n\nThings are very cut\\-and\\-dried when you put things up on a personal web page, but less clear when you use some social media platform, because then you have to navigate their terms of service to see what you have legally done by posting some content. There is generally (i.e. universally, with any serious SM platform) some license that you grant to the platform, and they also grant users some permissions.

Right below this, they start to address third parties (by putting \"you\" in the position of the third party), and they state that they can take action against you (anyone) who violates the rules or \"if you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights\". They do not at any point say \"It's okay to copy stuff from another person's account without their permission\", though they do not directly say that this is forbidden (see their section on [copyright](https://help.instagram.com/126382350847838?helpref=page_content)) \u2013 they come pretty close by saying \"It's possible to infringe someone else's copyright, even if you don't intend to do so.

Even if users provide their consent and credentials, automated scraping is typically prohibited by the Terms of Service (ToS) of most websites.

According to the information provided, the board owner can process email addresses under Article 6.1b of GDPR, as it's necessary for the performance of a contract (user registration and account management). The email is required for essential functions like password resets and potential security breach notifications. However, the board owner must document the rationale for processing this data, as required by Article 30 of GDPR.\n\nOption A is incorrect because explicit consent isn't required in this case, as the processing falls under the contract performance basis. Option C is incorrect because GDPR applies regardless of whether the activity is commercial or not. Option D is incorrect as parental consent isn't necessarily required for all users under 18, especially when the processing is based on contract performance rather than consent."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1041/what-is-the-penalty-for-illegitimate-quoting", "docs_id": 1041, "title": "What is the penalty for illegitimate quoting?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently saw [this Tweet](https://twitter.com/duncanwrites/status/514463649235472385) and it made me wonder, in general, can a person be penalized for attributing a false quote to another person?

This includes lying about someone: it's not illegal *per se* to lie about them. What *is* illegal is slander and libel: lying about someone in a way that hurts their reputation. The defamation doctrine in the US is generally a common\\-law doctrine (i.e. the rules and limits are based on court decisions, rather than on laws passed by legislatures), although it may differ state\\-by\\-state. Depending on the state, some defamation may be criminal; there is no federal criminal defamation.\n\nUS defamation law is largely defined through its interaction with the First Amendment. While libel is not constitutionally protected, *punishment* for libel is seriously limited by the need to avoid either punishing protected speech, or chilling potential protected speech (i.e. discouraging people from saying something that would in fact be protected, because they aren't sure whether or not it's protected).\n\nLibel in the US only applies to a false statement of *fact*, or an opinion which implies some false fact. If it can't actually be proven incorrect, it can't be libelous in the US. The question of whether it's a statement of fact doesn't just depend on the literal speech; it includes things like the context, and is a question about what a *reasonable person* would think. If I were to claim that someone was \"literally Hitler,\" for instance, no reasonable person would think I was seriously claiming that the person was the former leader of Nazi Germany.\n\nNow, no reasonable person who is familiar with Twitter would ever assume that the tweet meant Obama literally stood up in front of the UN and said \"Please accept this nothingburger in place of a respectable climate plan.\" So, it only counts as libel if a reasonable person would think it implies some fact. But a reasonable person familiar with Twitter would most likely think Miesel is saying \"The president's pollution plan is a pointless piece of political puffery planned to placate principalities and potentates.\" This is basically a matter of opinion.\n\nEven to the extent that it's *not* a matter of opinion, public figures in the US cannot win a defamation suit unless they show \"actual malice:\" the speaker must *actually know* or *actually strongly suspect* that their statement is false in some material way. It's not enough that a reasonable person would think \"this might not be true;\" the speaker themselves must doubt the truth of it (they must be reckless, not just negligent). Courts are also extremely deferential to defendants in these cases. While it is *technically* possible for a public figure to prove defamation, it is exceptionally difficult. If the person didn't know they were falsely attributing the quote, and honesty thought it was correct, they're in the clear. If the quote isn't supposed to be a statement of fact, but it implies false facts, but the speaker honestly thinks those facts are true, they're in the clear.\n\nPrivate figures don't have to meet the actual malice standard to prove defamation. They still need to show that the statement is a statement of fact or something implying false facts; if it's obviously a summary of something they really said, possibly with added editorial comment, they can't prove defamation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A popular political commentator tweets: \"President Smith at the G7 Summit: 'I prioritize corporate profits over environmental protection.'\" This quote is not verbatim but rather the commentator's interpretation of the President's speech. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences in the US?\n\nA) The commentator could be charged with federal criminal defamation for falsely attributing a quote to the President.\n\nB) The President could easily win a libel case against the commentator if he can prove the quote is not verbatim.\n\nC) The commentator is likely protected from defamation claims due to the context and nature of the tweet.\n\nD) The commentator would be liable for defamation unless they can prove the President actually holds this view.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The commentator is likely protected from defamation claims due to several factors:\n\n1. Context: On social media platforms like Twitter, reasonable users understand that such \"quotes\" are often paraphrases or interpretations, not verbatim statements.\n\n2. Opinion vs. Fact: The tweet appears to be the commentator's opinion or interpretation of the President's stance, rather than a statement of fact.\n\n3. Public Figure: As a public figure, the President would need to prove \"actual malice\" - that the commentator knew the implication was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth.\n\n4. First Amendment protections: US law strongly protects political speech and criticism of public officials.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no federal criminal defamation law in the US.

The author or authors, or the heirs of the author or authors, or a majority of them, have the right to terminate copyright transfers an license grants. This termination must be effective on a date within a five\\-year period starting 35 years after the transfer or grant was made, or 35 years after publication.

Open source and copyleft licenses generally do not mention this legal right of the author. Derivative (modified) works created under a canceled license may continue to be used, but the right to create new derivative works is withdrawn.\n\nIt is not clear how an author goes about sending the required notice when a work was distributed widely to the general public under a permissive license.\n\nOpen source licenses have been around long enough that early license grants could be subject to such terminations. But I have found not news reports or court cases about such terminations or attempted terminations and their effects. Probably most authors of open source software will not want to terminate the licenses they once granted. But some may, and US law gives them the right to do so.

The termination must be preceded by a notice sent between 2 and 10 years before the effective date. It's important to note that this right cannot be waived by any agreement, including the terms of the open source license.

That is, even if it would not be possible for you to perform all of your agreements, you are still contractually bound to do so, and legal remedies may be sought if you fail to do so.\n* However, if it is an implicit or explicit term that your employer provide a specific premises at which you would work, and there were no provisions that they could change it without your agreement, then you may be entitled to sue for damages when they no longer do so.\n\nBasically, my (unlicensed and completely general information\\-based) view is that the variation, even if you were to agree to it, would not be enforceable; there is no consideration.\n\n---\n\n1\\.

In contract law, especially regarding variations to existing contracts, several key principles apply:\n\n1. Consideration: For a contract variation to be legally binding, fresh consideration is typically required. The company merely changing terms without providing new benefits to the employee may lack proper consideration.\n\n2. Acceptance: While signature is a common form of acceptance, conduct can also indicate acceptance of new terms. If the employee continues to work under the new conditions (e.g., at the new location), this could be construed as acceptance by conduct.\n\n3.

The employee remains bound by the old contract until they accept the new terms, either explicitly (by signing) or implicitly (through their conduct).\n\n4. The company cannot unilaterally impose new terms without the employee's agreement, despite their claims.\n\nOption A is incorrect because implicit consent is not automatically assumed, and the company cannot unilaterally impose new terms.

In any of those circumstances, you would not have intended or known that you were going to cause someone's death. If you reasonably believed your gun was unloaded, you would not have known you were going to kill someone if you pulled the trigger.\n\nIn Guyger's case, Whether she was in her apartment or someone else's, she still knew that putting two bullets in a man eating ice cream would cause his death or serious bodily harm.\n\nIn the Guyger case, the defendant claimed she was mistaken about what apartment she was in, but that doesn't change whether she had the intent to kill Mr. Jean.\n\nThat mistake *does* implicate the Texas \"Castle doctrine\" statute, [Penal Code section 9\\.32](https://codes.findlaw.com/tx/penal-code/penal-sect-9-32.html):\n\n> A person is justified in using deadly force against another ... when and to the degree the actor reasonably believes the deadly force is immediately necessary ... to protect the actor against the other's use or attempted use of unlawful deadly force.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The actor's belief ... that the deadly force was immediately necessary ... is presumed to be reasonable if the actor ... knew or had reason to believe that the person against whom the deadly force was used ... unlawfully and with force entered ... the actor's occupied habitation\n\nIf her mistake was reasonable, that would give her reason to believe Mr. Jean had unlawfully and with force entered her home, making it presumptively reasonable that she used deadly force.\n\nBut the mistake of fact defense only looks at mistakes that change whether you committed the offense, not whether an affirmative defense is available to you, so it doesn't really change whether the defense is available.\n\nNonetheless, it's generally accepted that a person can use self\\-defense doctrines like this even when they're mistaken about whether they're in danger.

The question mentions:\n\n> **Taxes**, which I presume must be authorized and regulated by the US Constitution, but I don't know the details\n\nNot exactly. The states existed before the Federal government. They are not created by the Federal Constitution, nor authorized by it. A number of restrictions on state powers and actions are specified by the Federal Constitution, and a number of others are imposed by Federal law. (the Federal courts have found implied restrictions beyond the explicitly stated ones.) But there is no Federal provision granting states the power to impose taxes, only restrictions on that pre\\-existing power.\n\nStates cannot impose taxes so as to violate rights federally guaranteed, or to place *unreasonable* burdens on the exercise of those rights. For example, states cannot impose different taxes or tax rates on a racial basis. States cannot impose different taxes on residents of other states temporarily present in, or doing business in the state. States cannot impose different taxes on people newly moved there from other states, compared to long\\-established residents. State taxes must not violate the Equal Protection clause. However, states may choose the type and amount of taxes to impose. They can use sales tax, VAT tax, property tax, income tax, excise tax, flat tax, or any combination that their legislatures pass. Different taxes may be imposed on different professions or kinds of businesses.\n\n> Does the US Constitution guarantee all citizens have the natural right to conduct their own business affairs?\n\nNot as such, no. The Due Process and Equal Protection clauses limit to some extent the ability of a state to prohibit a particular business on a whim. But when a state asserts that a particular business is harmful, and demonstrates a plausible basis for that view, so that the law passes \"Rational basis\" review, the state can prohibit it, or heavily regulate it, or license it. \n\n> If so, does a citizen lose the right to legally own and operate a business if they cannot afford requisite state or local business license fees?\n\nA state may require a license to engage in a particular occupation, and may require a fee, one\\-time or recurring, high or low, for that license. In addition, a tax may be imposed on those in a particular business or profession, which is not imposed on other kinds of business. For example, in many states, lawyers must pay an annual license fee, or they are not allowed to practice. So must many other regulated professions, such as hairstylist. One who cannot afford the fee may not engage in the business or profession. The state may waive or reduce fees for those too poor to afford them, but need not do so, and many states do not so so.\n\nSimilarly, the state may charge a fee for a driver's license, and one who cannot pay it may not legally drive. \n\n> Likewise, does a citizen lose the right to utilize the court system to petition for a redress of grievances, if they cannot afford the requisite court fees?\n\nMany states have provisions waiving or lowering court fees for those who cannot afford them, but in most cases this is applied only in severe cases, say where a person would have to go without food to afford court fees. There have been a few federal cases requiring fee waivers for those who cannot afford court fees, mostly in connection with criminal defendants. There is not currently a general federal rule requiring court access for those who cannot afford court fees. Perhaps there should be. A case could be made that Equal Protection requires this, but Federal Courts have not so held.\n\nFederal courts **have** held that holding people in jail or prison because they truly cannot afford fines, bail, or court fees is an unconstitutional denial of Equal Protection. But states need not waive such fees; they can be deferred and charged should the person earn enough money to (just barely) afford them. Even this rule is not yet invariably enforced, and many state courts routinely ignore it.\n\nBy the way \"petition for a redress of grievances\" doe snot normally refer to bringing a court case, but to asking a legislature to change a law, or asking an administrator or executive to exercise permitted discretion in a particular way. \n\n> And lastly, if a citizen is convicted of a crime or infraction, and the sentence requires the convict to utilize government services (e.g. prison services, probation services, registration services, etc.); under the US Constitution, can state government agencies providing these services legally require the convict to pay fees for these services (e.g. prison service fees, probation service fees, registration service fees), if these fees were not explicitly included in the sentence as fines?\n\nYes it can impose such fees, but usually only when neither the convict nor his or her dependents will be impoverished by such fees, as I understand it. \n\n> If a state attempts to pass or enforce state legislation dictating such fees, should this legislation generally be struck down as unconstitutional?\n\nSuch laws will not be held unconstitutional by US Federal courts under the Federal Constitution, unless they are found to violate Equal Protection, Due Process, or other specifically imposed restrictions on the state. For example, fees which were in practice imposed on people of one religion, but not those of another, would be struck down. But a fee imposed on everyone will not usually be overturned.\n\n\"The law in its majestic equality forbids the rich as well as the poor to steal bread from shops, beg in the streets, and sleep under bridges.\" \\-Anatole France", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about state fees and taxes in the United States is most accurate?\n\nA) States must obtain explicit authorization from the US Constitution to impose any form of taxation on their citizens.\n\nB) Federal courts have consistently ruled that states must waive all court fees for individuals who cannot afford them, regardless of the severity of their financial situation.\n\nC) States have broad authority to impose various types of taxes and fees, but they cannot impose different tax rates based on race or state of origin.\n\nD) The US Constitution guarantees all citizens an absolute right to conduct their own business affairs without any state interference or licensing requirements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

Some laws target races by saying \"we will compensate for X past action\", but then the law is for people who suffered from the action, like discriminatory housing policies, which Hispanic and other residents suffered from too.\n\nIs it legal for Evanston to give grants to black residents and not, say, Asian residents?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a starting point, and because it is a common occurrence, we can conclude that the government *can* give a benefit to someone without having to give the same benefit to everyone. It is a political matter that a divorced spouse is entitled to Social Security benefits based on a marriage that lasted at least 10 years, and not 9 years. More such restrictions on benefits are listed [here](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10035.pdf). Equal protection does not \"everybody gets the benefit\".\n\nSecond, the government can give benefits to people whom it has harmed, again a point that hopefully does not require extensive justification. Third, and this leads to a concrete example, under the Japanese\\-American Evacuation Claims Act of 1948, $37 million was paid by the federal government to 26,000 who were sent to the Japanese\\-American concentration camps during WWII, so there is an \"effects\\-based\" racial discrimination that this benefit was only given to a specific racial group, because the underlying wrong was also racially\\-based, and likewise Aleut residents of the Aleutian Islands and the Pribilof islands were likewise compensated for harm done to them by the government. A person is not barred from compensation by wrongful government action just because the persons and others who are compensated for governmental wrong were the victims of a racially discriminatory wrong (therefore there is a racal correlate to the class of victims).\n\nVictims of government harm can be conceptually divided into two groups: direct victims, and indirect victims. There is no controversy over the legality of the government compensating individuals for its wrongful actions. The only plausible point of legal objection would be over compensating people who descended from victims of government harm. There is a legal difference between lineage\\-based discrimination and race\\-based discrimination, simply because lineage\\-based discrimination is *not* racial discrimination, which is forbidden. There is a greater chance that lineage\\-based reparations could pass strict scrutiny, in that it more narrowly tailors the benefit to exactly reach the compelling government interest, as opposed to a policy that broadly gives a compensatory benefit to anyone who self\\-identifies as being of a particular race.\n\nFinally, the question might be asked whether a program of government compensation for wrongful acts can be selective, in which victims it identifies for compensation. Yes, it can, for example the [Radiation Exposure Compensation Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_Exposure_Compensation_Act) for specific classes of persons harmed by government in connection with atmospheric A\\-bomb tests and uranium mining \u2013 it does not compensate *all* individuals who were harmed by government action.

It focuses on lineage-based compensation rather than race-based, which is less likely to be seen as racial discrimination.\n2. It narrowly tailors the benefit to those who can prove a direct connection to the historical harm, meeting the \"strict scrutiny\" standard more effectively.\n3. It doesn't exclude victims of other racial groups who may have been affected by the policy, making it more inclusive and less likely to be challenged on equal protection grounds.\n4. It follows the precedent of other government compensation programs that have been deemed legal, such as those for Japanese-American internment camp survivors.\n\nOptions A and C are problematic because they base eligibility solely on race, which is more likely to face legal challenges under the 14th Amendment and Civil Rights Act.

If a certain police act is prohibited by the Constitution, Congress cannot legislatively allow that act, whether in a single state or uniformly across all states.

They did not attend 3 years of law school after attaining a college degree, which lawyers ***DO***. Police get as little as *3 months training* (in some states like Arkansas they can be put on duty without ANY training for up to a year (!) before attending the academy).\n\n**THAT SAID, REGARDING CALL RECORDINGS:**\n\nThere are single and two party states. In single party states, any single person who is part of a call or communication can record it. In \"two party\" states, everyone that is part of the call must be **informed**.\n\nThere are numerous exceptions and stipulations however.\n\n**GREAT EXPECTATIONS**\n\nFirst off, is there an \"expectation of privacy.\" Again this varies by state and case law. Generally, if there is no expectation of privacy, then there is a clear exception to record. For instance, if you are in a busy restaurant, and people around you can hear or eavesdrop, you have no expectation of privacy.\n\nCourts have also ruled that if you are in the presence of a police officer performing official duties, there is also no expectation of privacy (not for either of you).\n\n**IS IT LIVE OR IS IT MEMOREX**\n\nAre you being recorded? If you are in a two/all party state, and you have an expectation of privacy (a phone call made in your home) then one of the following **must** occur:\n\n1. If the police are recording you without your knowledge, they must have a court order permitting them to do so as part of an investigation.\n2. Otherwise you must be notified with a statement at the beginning of the call that the call is being recorded. (Typically your option is to hang up or continue. Continuing the call implies your consent.)\n3. In *some states* the notification can be in the form of a \"duck\" or a beep every 15 seconds (time period varies, this is also different per state).\n\n**OPINION NOT ADVICE BELOW**\n\n***I would think*** that being notified that a call is being recorded ends any expectation of privacy for any involved party. Assuming the state law and related case law supports recording when there is no expectation of privacy, this circumstance would seem to permit recording legally.\n\nDoubly so if your were talking to police in official capacity (did you notice a beep every xx seconds?)\n\n*CAUTION:* Because this varies so much by state, and because even the various Federal District Courts are not in unanimous agreement on the minutiae, there may be other factors to consider.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a two-party consent state, you receive a call from a state official that begins with a notification that the call is being recorded. You inform the official that you are also recording the call, and they claim it's illegal for you to do so. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The official is correct; it's illegal for you to record the call even if they are recording it.\n\nB) You can legally record the call because the official's notification eliminates any expectation of privacy.\n\nC) You can only record the call if you get explicit verbal consent from the official.\n\nD) The legality of your recording depends on whether the official is a law enforcement officer or not.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In a two-party consent state, all parties must typically be informed of the recording. However, when the state official notifies you that the call is being recorded, this effectively eliminates any expectation of privacy for the conversation. The notification serves as implied consent for recording, and it would likely extend to both parties. Therefore, once you've been informed that the call is being recorded, you can generally record it as well, regardless of the official's claim.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the official's claim doesn't necessarily reflect the law accurately. Police and officials may not always understand the nuances of recording laws.\n\nAnswer C is overly restrictive. Explicit verbal consent is not typically required if there's already been a notification that eliminates the expectation of privacy.\n\nAnswer D is not the most relevant factor here. While there can be different rules for recording law enforcement in some contexts, in this scenario, the key factor is the initial notification of recording, not the official's specific role."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78113/is-it-legal-to-break-into-a-property-from-which-you-are-unlawfully-evicted-by-th", "docs_id": 78113, "title": "Is it legal to break into a property from which you are unlawfully evicted by the landlord while they are currently inside if you don\u2019t threaten/harm?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The landlady gave no formal notices or court processes to end my lease or repossess the property.

A plea of guilty or not guilty is entered at an arraignment, which sometimes is combined with a first court appearance and sometimes is conducted separately.\n\nA preliminary hearing happens much later in the criminal justice process, after an arraignment (which is sometimes combined with a first court appearance), and after counsel is assigned to represent the person who is charged. A preliminary hearing is an adversarial mini\\-trial before a judge at which the prosecution presents evidence sufficient to establish probable cause on previously disclosed charged in a somewhat summary fashion (not necessarily everything to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt), and the attorney for the defendant can cross\\-examine witnesses, object to questions improper under the rules of evidence, and introduce exonerating evidence (although this last option is only rarely utilized). A preliminary hearing is a substitute for a grand jury indictment as a means to screen whether charges are supported by probable cause.\n\nUsually, but not in absolutely all cases, if the arrest is pursuant to an arrest warrant, the arrest warrant will be presented to the person being arrested immediately prior to, at the time of the arrest, or immediately after the arrest is made, and the arrest warrant will provide some insight into the charge.\n\nBut, unless a state statute or court rule provides otherwise, a charge does not usually need to be disclosed during the actual process of making an arrest, or while the person arrested is being transported to a police station or jail for booking, although the charge often is disclosed at that time or even before the arrest is made.\n\nFrequently, someone is read their *Miranda* rights before the charge is identified.\n\nSome of the fine details are a matter of state specific court rules and statutes, but the general outline of the process described above is the U.S. constitutional requirement.\n\nThe process for arresting a minor is not very different from the process for arresting an adult, but usually, when a minor is arrested, a parent or guardian must be promptly notified of the arrest and the charge, if possible.\n\nMany states have a minimum age for arresting a minor for committing a crime or juvenile delinquency offense, which is typically somewhere in the range from age seven to age twelve, although there is considerable variation on this point. This is an area of the law where active efforts to pass reform legislation to take a less punitive approach with younger minors are underway.\n\n**Minors Taken Into Custody For Other Reasons**\n\nAlso, while adults are overwhelmingly arrested on suspicion of having committed a crime, a minor is sometime placed under law enforcement or social services custody in a manner that looks like an arrest, but isn't, for a reason other than a charge that the minor is actually believed to have committed a crime.\n\nFor example, suppose that a five year old child is found in an apartment at which two adults presumed to be the child's mother and father, are found dead (the reason for their deaths doesn't really matter). In that situation, the law enforcement officer at the scene would generally take physical custody of the child pending the arrival of a social services officer at the scene who would then take physical custody of the child from the law enforcement officer until another suitable guardian could be located, even though there is no suspicion that the child committed a crime.\n\nThe name for this process varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nIn New York State, for example, this is called \"person in need of supervision\" case (PINS for short), which is sometimes thought of as a civil custody matter and is sometimes classified as what is called a \"status offense\" that justifies the government taking custody of a minor even though the minor has not committed a crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States criminal justice system, at which stage must a charge against a defendant be definitively identified?\n\nA) Immediately upon arrest\nB) During transportation to the police station\nC) At the preliminary hearing\nD) At the first court appearance or arraignment\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because charges do not necessarily need to be disclosed during the actual process of making an arrest.\n\nB) is incorrect as charges are not required to be disclosed while the person is being transported to a police station or jail.\n\nC) is incorrect because a preliminary hearing happens much later in the criminal justice process, after charges have already been identified and after counsel has been assigned.\n\nD) is correct.

According to the IRS, using cryptocurrency to pay for goods, services, or in this case, taxes, is considered a taxable event under federal law.

Acuff\\-Rose Music, Inc. The Court's opinion emphasized the importance of transformativeness in its fair use analysis of the parody of \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" involved in the Campbell case.

A person is suspected of some crime like selling drugs, not arrested, but told by a police officer to go away and never come back. This is way beyond the power of the police. After due legal process, a proven (not just suspected) public menace could be ordered by the court to stay away from the park.\n\nA police officer can, of course, order a person to leave a park when they violate a [park rule](http://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=672), in fact rule number 1 is \"It is unlawful for any person to do or *to allow or permit* any of the acts prohibited by this chapter in any park in Salt Lake City\", so the police cannot legally turn a blind eye to rule violations. Violation of park rules is an infraction which can earn you a ticket of up to $299\\. However, the officer can tell you to go away, rather than giving you a ticket or arresting you. But an police order cannot issue a unilateral restraining order.\n\nApart from city laws, there are general [state laws](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title76/Chapter6/C76-6_1800010118000101.pdf) regarding trespass and destruction of property. The state criminal trespass law says that \n\n> A person is guilty of criminal trespass if...knowing the person's...\n>  entry or presence is unlawful, the person enters or remains on to\n>  which notice against entering is given by...personal communication to\n>  the person by the owner or someone with apparent authority to act for\n>  the owner\n\nIn this case, the owner is the city, and the officer has apparent authority to act for that owner.

So, she stuck with their plans and she continued to see him over the weekend. She testified that she kept her distance and certainly did not do anything intimate with him. **Having firmly committed herself to this position, she was then confronted with a photograph of herself cuddling affectionately in the park with Mr. Ghomeshi the very next day.**\n\nThe judge then uses this, among other arguments, to support the position that the witness is not trustworthy, which ultimately causes the case to fail:\n\n> \\[94] Let me emphasize strongly, it is the suppression of evidence and the deceptions maintained under oath that drive my concerns with the reliability of this witness, not necessarily her undetermined motivations for doing so.

They could have talked to the witness beforehand and could have told her that this photograph exists and therefore that lying about it would certainly fail. If they did so, then perhaps the witness wouldn't commit herself to the position if she knew defense had evidence against it, and would thus appear more trustworthy.\n\nThere are several similar paragraphs in the file for other witnesses: the defense asks the witness, notes the answer, then presents evidence contradicting the answer and concludes that the witness is deceptive.\n\nWhy wouldn't the Crown tell the witnesses beforehand that defense has all this evidence so that the witnesses wouldn't fall into this 'trap'?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The defence sees the prosecution evidence; witnesses don\u2019t\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom context, it appears that Ms. DeCoutere was a prosecution witness, not the defendant.

It is considered misconduct for the prosecution to reveal defense evidence to their own witnesses before testimony primarily to ensure that witnesses recount facts as they naturally recall them, without being influenced by knowledge of other evidence.\n\nOption A is partially correct, but it's more of a consequence rather than the primary reason.

The images you've added don't seem alike enough to be confusing to me (I don't think I'd be mistaking one for the other), but in a lot of settings the app name will have only text, not an image. Then you get at the trademark issue for the term \"NFL\" itself. \n\nNFL can trademark that three\\-letter sequence, and there are good reasons for them being able to keep control of that trademark to authenticate sourcing. For example, if I said \"this hamburger is from McDonalds\" you have certain expectations about it based on the brand, and McDonalds the company has a legally protected interest in preventing me from saying that if it wasn't true. I have no right to put that 9\\-letter sequence on my burger joint without a license from the corporate giant. \n\nSimilarly, The NFL has a legally protected interest in preventing somebody from advertising or implying that an information source or the information contained therein is licensed and/or an official source of information, if that's not true. A reasonable person might expect that an information source about NFL player injuries, with \"NFL\" in its name, would be an official licensed source of that information; the real NFL can seek an injunction and/or penalties if that's not actually the case. \"Pro Football Player Injury Tracker\" might not carry the same expectation. \n\nAt the bottom of [NFL.com](http://www.nfl.com/), they claim, emphasis added, that \"**NFL and** the NFL shield design are registered trademarks of the National Football League.\" So they have put folks on notice they intend to defend that three\\-letter sequence as theirs, at least for all subjects related to professional American football. \n\n[Sean Mullin says](http://www.ehow.com/list_6647869_nfl-super-bowl-trademark-regulations.html) \"The NFL is notorious for guarding its intellectual property rights to the full extent of the law.\" X should probably spend some time with an IP lawyer. \n\nIf you're asking if it's *possible* for X to legally use the NFL's trademark, the short answer is **yes**.

But it does provide constitutional protections that are enforced more strictly (which is to say that the laws possibly violating a right are subject to \"strict scrutiny\" in \"intermediate scrutiny\") in some circumstances, and more leniently with more deference to the legislature in other circumstances (which is to say that the laws are subject to \"rational basis\" review). These standards of review, including rational basis review, are the product of court interpretations of the U.S. Constitution in case law.\n\nOften a law will colorably violate equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protections in U.S. law. If the law does so, but the non\\-equal treatment does not involve a 'protected class\", it is subject to \"rational basis\" review for constitutionality, which is very lenient.\n\nFor example, the law might say that people on the north and west sides of their streets get to vote in the morning, and people on the south and east sides of their streets get to vote in the afternoon. People on different sides of the street are not treated exactly equally. But, the side of the street that you live on is not a protected class, so this law would be upheld against a constitutional equal protection challenge if there was any rational basis for it. In this case, it would probably be upheld on the grounds of administrative convenience and managing scarce election administration resources.\n\nOn the other hand, a law that said that black people vote in the morning and white people vote in the afternoon, since it involves race, a protected class, are subject to strict scrutiny and a law that made that distinction would be struck down.\n\nSo probably, would a law that said that women vote in the morning and men vote in the afternoon, since sex distinctions are usually subject to intermediate scrutiny. And, while the intermediate scrutiny standard wouldn't be met under modern U.S. law in modern U.S. conditions of society, in the circumstances of daily life of the 1880s, when women were overwhelmingly home makers in some localities, and many men worked at 9\\-5 jobs away from home in those localities (perhaps a mining town), the law might even have been upheld under an intermediate scrutiny standard. In reality world, cases like that more often come up, not in election law cases, but in cases where there is discrimination on the basis of gender in tee time allocations at public golf courses.\n\nAlso, when a law is subject to rational basis review, the reasons that the legislature passes the law, if they would be rational if true, are sufficient to validate a law even if the reasons that would make the legislation rational are not, as the legislature believed them to be, actually true as a factual matter, unless it is physically impossible for what is described to happen under a law of nature, for example (e.g., it the prison warden is ordered to hold a prisoner in a cell in which the law of gravity does not exist).\n\nFor example, if the law says that school children must have their route diverted if a black cat would otherwise have crossed their path, because otherwise they will have bad luck, that law could be upheld in a rational basis analysis, even though crossing the path of a black cat does not, in fact, give you bad luck.\n\nLikewise, a law doesn't have to be the best or most accurate way to make a rational distinction to meet the rational basis. The fact that a better alternative way to handle the issue that the law addresses doesn't mean that it fails to survive rational basis review.\n\nBut if a law truly is, as the question has assumed by definition, completely irrational, it will not be found constitutional even under a rational basis test. So, if there is any colorable equal protection violation or other colorable constitutional violation subject to rational basis review, a completely irrational law will be struck down.\n\nThere are maybe half a dozen or a dozen cases in all of U.S. case law since the adoption of the 14th Amendment that have been found not to meet that test out of hundreds or thousands of challenges on grounds where the rational basis test applies. But on rare occasions, it does happen.\n\n**Canons Of Statutory Construction**\n\n*The Canon Against Absurdity*\n\nAlso, there is a canon of statutory construction against absurdity. Generally speaking, if a plain reading of a statute leads to an absurd result, a court will apply this canon of statutory construction to determine that the legislative intent was something other than what the law actually literally said even if that is the clear plain meaning of a statute.\n\nThis often comes up when the word \"not\" gets omitted in a complex sentence, reversing the clear intent of the law. In this situation, the canon of statutory instruction against absurdity will often supply the missing word giving the law the opposite meaning of what it irrationally actually says.\n\nThe canon of statutory construction against absurdity is often applicable if the statute read as it was actually adopted is irrational.\n\n*The Canon Against Interpretations In Degradation Of The Common Law*\n\nAnother canon of statutory interpretation that sometimes comes into play pertinent to \"customary\" law or \"common law\" established by cases rather than a statute in the U.S., is that statutes will not be deemed to be \"in degradation of the common law\" (i.e. to override a common law rule of law) unless the legislative intent to do so is clear. So, often a law that seems odds with be interpreted in the context of a way to simultaneously honor it (even if it isn't the most natural interpretation of the language) while leaving the existing common law and equity jurisprudence established by case law in place.\n\nFor example, if a statute holds that someone who signs a document is bound by it, this statute would usually not be held to override the common law rule that a signature obtained through fraud about what someone is actually signing (e.g. substituting a check when someone thinks that they are signing a receipt), called fraud in the factum, would usually held not to be pre\\-empted and contradicted by the statute, even though the statutory does not expressly identify this common law exception to its plain language.\n\nOn the other hand, the degradation of the common law canon of statutory construction is usually not applied, often with irrational or absurd result, in the case of a federal statute related to employee benefits called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which has been held to have extraordinarily broad pre\\-emptive effects.\n\n**The General Rule Is That Stupid Or Unwise Laws Are Valid**\n\nThis said, there is a difference between irrational, and merely stupid or unwise. The legislature is free to pass otherwise constitutional law that are stupid or unwise. And, if there is no doubt, given the legislative history and the language of the statute, that the legislature really did mean what the statute says, and the statute doesn't colorable violate any constitutional right, even equal protection, it will be upheld, even if it seems bizarre or irrational.\n\nFor example, if it is absolutely clear that you can convict dead people of crimes and that the legislature really meant what it said when it said that if you do, the corpse of the dead person needs to be kept in a prison cell for the duration of the prison sentence, then that law would probably be upheld and enforced by a court, even though it is bizarre and crazy.\n\nThere are probably at least half a dozen or a dozen decided cases in which a court has said, that a law is completely stupid or unwise, but it is not colorably unconstitutional or complete irrational, and so the court upholds the law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A state legislature passes a law requiring all left-handed people to wear red hats while in public spaces.

Based on copyright law and fair use doctrine, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The guidebook is automatically protected under fair use because it is commentary on a fictional work.\n\nB) Fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, and the inclusion of commentary does not guarantee protection.\n\nC) As long as the guidebook does not reproduce any direct quotes from the novels, it is considered fair use.\n\nD) The novelist has no grounds to challenge the guidebook because fictional worlds cannot be copyrighted.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis using a multi-factor test. The mere presence of commentary or analysis does not automatically guarantee fair use protection. As seen in the Ty, Inc. v.

That'll get you close, but it's not a title or section of code like you're hoping. Also, cases only get filed with one nature of suit code, so if it touches on multiple areas of the law, this can be a pretty terrible way to go.\n\nThe other approach you can look into, if you're looking for bulk data is to check out the [Integrated Database](https://www.fjc.gov/research/idb) provided by the Federal Judicial Center. It provides a CSV about all civil cases for the past decade or so that you can dig into. Check out the title, section, and subsection fields. The only issue here is that they're largely blank. My organization has a [cheat sheet](https://free.law/idb-facts/) for the IDB if that's helpful. \n\nFinally, if you want to be *really* thorough, the trick is to cast a really wide net, and to them filter the results somehow. So, for example, you could download the docket and initial complaint for all cases in a particular Nature of Suit code, and then search within those initial complaints for the particular law you're looking for.

Also keep in mind that the only thing I will be doing is using software. I am wondering first about copyright in free software. If I make a public video with me using free software can that be flagged as copyright?\n\nI am sure different software have different policy's but how about open source or more specifically , GNU public license v.3\\.0\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is, **it's complicated.** Now for the long answer:\n\nIn principle, if portions of the software are being directly included in the video (e.g. the art assets of a video game), then this can give rise to liability as a derivative work. This is true regardless of the license, unless the software is in the public domain.\n\nIn practice, allowing fans to upload videos of video games (colloquially called a \"Let's Play\" because the title is often \"Let's Play \\[name of game]\") is a commonly\\-accepted norm in the video game industry, regardless of what the law has to say about it. This is the case for a variety of social and economic reasons which are out of scope here, but in short, video games are hard to objectively review, and Let's Plays are usually a poor substitute for them, so an LP is more likely to encourage sales than suppress them. You should not assume that every publisher will always respect this norm, but it is commonly accepted by most publishers. It is commonly, but incorrectly, believed that these videos are categorically fair use; this is not necessarily the case because fair use is an intensive, fact\\-bound inquiry. It might be true, but there isn't case law to that effect, so it would be imprudent to make such a categorical claim at this time.\n\n(Videos which consist mostly or entirely of cutscenes, with no gameplay or commentary, are more of a gray area. Some publishers may not be happy if you post something like that, although in my experience, enforcement tends to be either lax or nonexistent.)\n\n> I am sure different software have different policy's but how about open source or more specifically , GNU public license v.3\\.0\n\nThe subset of people who release their software under an open source license are (usually) not very interested in suing people for this kind of secondary use. As a courtesy, I would suggest linking to the public repository or website where you downloaded the software, identifying it by name in the video, and taking any other reasonable attribution steps which the authors have publicly requested. This is not a legal requirement, but most projects would likely appreciate it.\n\nAs described above, they *could* construe your video to be a derivative work of the software and ask that you license it under the GPL. But I've never heard of that actually happening, and people do upload Let's Plays of (for example) [Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.google.com/search?q=battle+for+wesnoth+let%27s+play&tbm=vid) all the time without getting into legal trouble. All content in Battle for Wesnoth is under [a copyleft license](https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Wesnoth:Copyrights#The_Battle_for_Wesnoth_-_Code_Contributions) (either GPLv2 or CC\\-BY\\-SA 4\\.0\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A content creator plans to make a public video showcasing their use of an open-source software licensed under GNU Public License v3.0.

The video could potentially be considered a derivative work of the software, which theoretically could lead to copyright issues. However, in practice, developers of open-source software, especially those using GPL, are generally not interested in pursuing legal action for such uses. \n\nOption A is incorrect because fair use is not automatically applied and is subject to case-by-case evaluation. Option B is overly restrictive; explicit permission is not typically required for showcasing open-source software use. Option D is incorrect because while the software developers could theoretically request the video to be licensed under GPL, this is extremely rare in practice and not a legal obligation.\n\nThe content creator should, as a courtesy, provide proper attribution to the software, such as linking to its repository or website and mentioning it by name in the video.

While the county can charge fees for providing the Parcel Map data, a California Public Records Act (CPRA) request could potentially be used to obtain the data without signing the restrictive license agreement.
