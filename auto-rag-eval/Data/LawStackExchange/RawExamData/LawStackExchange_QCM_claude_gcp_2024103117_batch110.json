I am not sure if bullying is a crime or not. It seems that some violence is involved. I think we have a crime for that, called battery or something.\n\nYet, despite the complain of the mom, nothing was done.\n\nSo the mom collect evidences for bullying. \n\nAnd she got charged instead.\n\nTo me, the result is not \"intuitive\". To me, what should have happened is that the Mom shouldn't even bother doing the recording. She reports to school. School reports to cops. Cops do investigating and do the recording. We have evidence. The bully sent to jail. I think that \"should have been\" what happened. It's not.\n\nIt's as if the society as a whole \"approve\" and \"promote\" the bullying by making sure there is no way the bully faced justice. The cops don't get involved. And the only way to get evidence is criminalized.\n\nIf I were a DA, and say I want to get elected, I would throw the bully in jail. And if a bully is thrown in jail, then the \"recording\" event wouldn't have happened in the first place.\n\nI understand that DA does not have obligation to prosecute any crime. However, repeated battery seems like a reasonably obvious crime. If that's not crime, what is?\n\nNow, usually, if people have a few legal options, they pick the one that's the most profitable.\n\nWhat \"profit\" does DA have in prosecuting the mom instead of the bullies.\n\nAs someone beaten up when I was a kid, I am wondering about this for a long time. Why do society more interested in protecting something I perceive as more trivial, like recording, compared to something far more substantial, like beating.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This isn't about bullying at all, this is about Virginia being a \"one\\-party\" state. [Virginia Law 19\\.2\\-62](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title19.2/chapter6/section19.2-62/) outlines that:\n\n> B.2 It shall not be a criminal offense under this chapter for a person to intercept a wire, electronic or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception.\n\nHowever what is not said in the article is that the daughter didn't know that the recording device was in the backpack. This means that the mother did not get consent from either party being recorded (it isn't clear that a minor could give consent anyway), and is therefore in violation of 19\\.2\\-62\\.\n\nThe (US) law has been quite clear on \"two wrongs don't make a right\", the mother was not getting satisfaction through other channels, but that does not mean she is right in violating the law in pursuit of justice. \n\n---\n\nThis is still very much in the early stages of this particular case, but I'm willing to bet that the mother will see very little if any punishment in this matter.\n\nAs for why the DA doesn't prosecute the children (or their parents) for the bullying, this really depends on what kind of bullying is subject here. If the children are verbally bullying, this may not be a crime (yes, it is morally wrong, but may not be a crime). It isn't to say though that the children in this case haven't been reprimanded according to State law, at least the subject of the bullying has been moved to a different class as a result. Unless the bullying reaches a physical level, most State laws require the schools to deal with the bullying directly (through moving children to different classes, suspensions, expelling, etc), so the DA doesn't typically get involved until physical injury occurs.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a mother secretly recording her daughter's bullies in Virginia, why was the mother charged with a crime instead of the bullies being prosecuted?\n\nA) The bullying was not severe enough to be considered a crime\nB) Virginia law prohibits recording conversations without consent from at least one party\nC) The district attorney had a personal bias against the mother\nD) Recording bullying incidents is always illegal, regardless of circumstances\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Virginia is a \"one-party consent\" state, meaning at least one party in a conversation must consent to being recorded for it to be legal.

The two parties appear in court and the judge rules that the arbitration agreement is invalid.\n\nThe party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement appeals the decision to the Appellate Division. However, at the same time they are forced to act in a way that is inconsistent with the enforcement of the arbitration agreement. For example, suppose Party A sues Party B for a breach of contract for $50,000\\. Party B attempts to compel arbitration but the court denies the request. While the case is pending appeal, Party B counter sues Party A for $25,000 for breach of the same contract with the logic that until the higher courts reverse the decision of the lower courts, Party B wants the courts to get a full picture of their version of the story.\n\nCould it be argued that Party B now forfeited their right to appeal by filling a suit in court against Party A and not waiting until the appeal is either accepted or denied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No... I forget the specific term but in court you can bring in multiple points of contradiction that are all contradictory to your other arguments, but would not be contradicting to your case, because they all contradict your legal adversaries case. The example as I heard it is A man is bitten by a neighbor's Pit Bull and the man takes takes his neighbor to court for damages. The neighbor mounts his defense by saying 1\\.) I don't own that dog. 2\\.) If I did own a dog, I wouldn't own that breed of dog. 3\\.) I always keep my dogs on a leash when I take them out of the house and would pull it away before it bit someone. 4\\.) On the day in question my dog was in the kennel.\n\nIn this case, the defense would be valid because the Plaintiff would have to disprove all 4 statements, any one of which would impact the case against the neighbor. In a criminal case, the defendant doesn't have to prove his story is true, he just has to prove that the Prosecution's story isn't. In a civil case, both sides merely have to prove their story is more likely to be true than the other side's. What's more, none of those statements is contradictory, they only seem so (Neighbor doesn't own that dog (he dog sits for his sister). If he did own a dog, it would be a different breed (He doesn't like Pitt Bulls). He never takes a dog out of his house without putting a leash on the dog and maintains control of the dog (Because that's what any dog owner would do). The dog was in the kennel on the day of the incident (because for his own reasons, he can't dog sit for his sister.)).\n\nIn effect, to avoid damage, the argument of \"That's not my dog\" is to argue that the neighbor isn't the responsible party for the dog's behavior. The second argument is that the neighbor would never own a pit bull even if he did own a dog, the third would demonstrate that even when there is a dog that the neighbor is caring for, he does so in a responsible way AND the dog being in the kennel shows that the dog couldn't possibly have been the one who bit the plaintiff.\n\nWhat's more, the defendant can counter sue his neighbor for harassment, who just plain hates Pit Bulls and has been shouting at defendant for daring to care for his sister's dog even on days where the dog is not on the man's property and instantly blamed the Defendant in court without considering the possibility that there could be another Pit Bull owner in the area and their Pit Bull got loose.\n\nIn OP's case, the filing of a countersuit is just \"Hope for the Best, prepare for the worst\". They could be filing because the appellant court's decision may not come out in the window of time they have before they lose the ability to file counter claims. In that case, if the appeal goes in their favor, the suit is dismissed as well as the countersuit and goes to arbitration. If it goes against them, they will be arguing their claim at the trial.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Party A sues Party B for breach of contract. Party B attempts to compel arbitration, but the court denies the request. While appealing this decision, Party B counter-sues Party A for a related breach. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of Party B's actions?\n\nA) Party B has forfeited their right to appeal by filing a counter-suit, as this action is inconsistent with seeking arbitration.\n\nB) Party B's counter-suit invalidates their appeal for arbitration, as they have now accepted the court's jurisdiction.\n\nC) Party B can maintain both their appeal for arbitration and their counter-suit without legal contradiction.\n\nD) Party B must withdraw either their appeal or their counter-suit, as these actions are mutually exclusive.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the principle of pleading in the alternative, Party B can maintain both their appeal for arbitration and their counter-suit without legal contradiction. This approach allows Party B to \"hope for the best, prepare for the worst.\" If the appeal for arbitration is successful, both the original suit and counter-suit would likely be dismissed and sent to arbitration. If the appeal fails, Party B's counter-suit ensures their claims are heard in court. This strategy doesn't forfeit their right to appeal or invalidate their desire for arbitration, as courts recognize the need for parties to protect their interests through multiple, sometimes seemingly contradictory, legal actions."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83816/what-is-the-timeframe-for-mastercards-zero-liability-policy", "docs_id": 83816, "title": "What is the timeframe for Mastercard&#39;s &quot;zero-liability&quot; policy?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Other types of transaction disputes such as \"product not received\" has a clear reporting timeframe of 120 days or 540 days.

Option D introduces a timeframe (540 days) that's mentioned in the context of other types of disputes but not specifically for unauthorized transactions on Mastercard. \n\nOption C is correct because it accurately summarizes the federal law's tiered liability structure (as described in the Reuters article referencing 12 CFR \u00a7 1005.6) while also noting that most card issuers, including Mastercard, typically offer more generous protection than the federal minimum.

The vast majority of US's international agreements are done as executive agreements, and not treaties; and the power of the executive branch to make executive agreements has been repeatedly upheld in the courts.\n\nSpecifically, there are two types of executive agreements:\n\n1. \"**Congressional\\-executive agreements**\". These are the ones that require changes to legislation to be implemented. Congress passes the needed legislation just like any other normal legislation, i.e. a majority of both houses of Congress. Most trade agreements are passed as congressional\\-executive agreements.\n2. \"**Sole executive agreements**\". These are the ones that do not require changes to legislation to be implemented. Congress is not involved at all.\n\nThis Iran nuclear agreement is a \"sole executive agreement\" because it does not require Congressional action to be implemented. (So it doesn't need to be passed by a simple majority by Congress.)\n\nThe President already has the legal authority to implement all of the US's obligations under the agreement, which are the relief of certain Iran sanctions. Some of those sanctions were implemented by the President, and which the President can remove by himself. Some of these sanctions were implemented by Acts of Congress, but those Acts specifically give the President the authority to waive them.\n\nThe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (the \"Corker bill\"), passed by Congress in May 2015, also confirms that \"It is the sense of Congress that: \\[...] this Act does not require a vote by Congress for the agreement to commence;\"\n\n---\n\nAs to your question about whether something can \"have the effect of a treaty if it's passed by a simple majority\". The answer is yes (in the other way around). The Supreme Court ruled in the [Head Money Cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_Money_Cases) that \"treaties\" (ratified by 2/3 of the Senate as specified in Article II) have the same legal effect in US law as regular legislation passed by Congress (by a simple majority of both houses), which means that Congress can modify or repeal (insofar as US law is concerned) any \"treaty\" that is ratified by the Senate, by passing a later law that contradicts it, just like it can with regular legislation.

Thus, the nature of the removal obligation itself contemplates knowledge or awareness of **specific infringing material**, because **expeditious removal is possible only if the service provider knows with particularity which items to remove**...\n\nThus, *actual knowledge* must be knowledge that is specific enough to allow a service provider to take action against specific infringing content. \"General\" knowledge of infringement is not specific enough to be actionable, so it cannot qualify as \"actual knowledge\". (e.g., The general knowledge, \"In the past, about 5% of the videos uploaded to our site were infringing, and we expect that trend continues into the present, so some of our videos right now are probably infringing,\" is not actionable to specific videos, so it does not quality as \"actual knowledge\".)\n\nThat ruling also clarifies the distinction between *(i)* and *(ii)*, which are respectively termed the \"actual knowledge\" provision and \"red flag\" provision:\n\n> In other words, the actual knowledge provision turns on whether the provider actually or \u201csubjectively\u201d knew of specific infringement, while the red flag provision turns on whether the provider was subjectively aware of facts that would have made the specific infringement \u201cobjectively\u201d obvious to a reasonable person.\n\n---\n\nActual knowledge is different from a notification, which the service operator must respond to according to section (c)(1\\)(C) (whereas your quote is from (c)(1\\)(A)):\n\n> (C) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph (3\\), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.\n\nExpeditious removal is required in *either* event: the operator has actual knowledge of infringement, per (c)(1\\)(A)(i), ***or*** the operator gets a notification, per (c)(1\\)(C).

Options A and D represent general knowledge of infringement, which the court deemed insufficient for \"actual knowledge.\" Option B is too vague to qualify as \"actual knowledge\" or even as a proper notification under the statute.

There are 40\\+ apps on Android alone which share this name as well. There was software prior to both apps with this name.\n\nI admit that both apps have a similar main UI (same color, same input elements) which however noticeably differ in design choices, user experience, and scope. But apart from that (the main view), the UI differs completely.\n\nIs there any grounds for copyright infringement, if the apps look similar, but the actual sources aren't derived from any sort of original work?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Disclaimer: I'm from the US and don't claim to know German or Turkish law. So let me discuss some general principles here, but details may well be different in Germany and Turkey.\n\nYou're mixing together three very different things: trademark, copyright, and patent. \n\nCopyright protects the expression of an idea, in this case, the exact computer code, images, etc. If you didn't copy his code, the chance that you would coincidentally write identical code is remote. The fact that you both have a line of code that says `x=x+1` wouldn't give him any grounds for a lawsuit. He'd have to show substantial portions of the code were identical. If you didn't deliberately copy his code, this isn't going to happen. Barring some extraordinary and unbelievable coincidence, you can't violate copyright accidentally.\n\nTrademark protects names and symbols used to identify a company or a product. If you decided to call your software company \"Microsoft\", then that other Microsoft could sue you for trademark infringement. Likewise if you copied somebody else's logo or other distinctive graphics. This is very different from copyright. It is quite possible to violate someone's trademark accidentally. Especially if he gave his company or product a rather generic name. Like if someone called his product, say, \"Password Manager\", someone else might make a product with the same name without ever having heard of the original. Ditto if he has some simple logo or other graphics. If you did accidentally duplicate a name or graphic elements, well, in the US a court would likely order you to change your name or graphics and that would be the end of it, unless you refused, in which case you'd end up in court. US Courts have ruled that very generic names have limited trademark protection. An example I saw recently was \"Main Street Auto Repair\". A court said that the owner of that name could prevent someone else from opening a shop in the same town with the same name, but he couldn't sue someone in another town who happened to use the same name. This is why, by the way, companies often use made\\-up words for their product names. In your case, this should be a trivial issue. If he is claiming trademark to the look of the main menu screen, just change the colors or move some buttons around. If it actually went to court, you should be able to argue that the similarity was accidental and when you were informed you promptly changed it, and that should be the end of it. Depending, I guess, on how hard\\-nosed the judge is, etc.\n\nPatents are different still. A patent gives the owner the exclusive right to use an invention or process for a specified period of time. It doesn't matter if you invented the same thing entirely independently. Whoever filed the patent first has exclusive rights. There have been cases where an inventor lost out to someone with a similar invention because he submitted his patent application one day later. If this other person has patents that you are infringing, you are pretty much out of luck.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A German app developer receives a copyright infringement claim from a Turkish developer regarding a similar app. Both apps have comparable functionality and a very similar name, which is also shared by about 40 other apps. The German developer created their app independently in 2017, while the Turkish developer's app was published in 2015. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The German developer is likely guilty of copyright infringement because their app has similar functionality and was created after the Turkish developer's app.\n\nB) The Turkish developer has a strong case for trademark infringement due to the similar names, regardless of the existence of other apps with the same name.\n\nC) If the German developer didn't copy any code or assets directly, they are likely not infringing on copyright, but may need to address potential trademark issues.\n\nD) The Turkish developer automatically has international copyright protection, so the German developer must cease distribution of their app immediately.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Copyright protects the specific expression of an idea, such as exact code or assets. If the German developer created their app independently without copying code or assets, they are unlikely to be infringing on copyright. However, trademark issues may still exist due to the similar names, even if many other apps share the same name. Trademark protection can be more complex and may require changes to avoid confusion, especially in cases of similar products. The existence of prior apps with the same name and the generic nature of the name may weaken the trademark claim, but it's still a potential issue that may need to be addressed. Options A and D are incorrect because they misunderstand the nature of copyright protection. Option B overstates the strength of the trademark claim given the circumstances described."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91328/what-does-florida-state-law-say-regarding-probate-in-real-estate-transactions", "docs_id": 91328, "title": "What does Florida state law say regarding probate in real estate transactions?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Does Florida state law require that an estate go into probate in the event the seller in a real estate transaction passes away prior to closing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does Florida state law require that an estate go into probate in the\n> event the seller in a real estate transaction passes away prior to\n> closing?\n\nYes, if the seller is the owner of the property which is not in joint tenancy with right of survivorship or something similar (such as a transfer on death deed).\n\nA will is meaningless until it has been admitted to probate (which is a term that in the narrow sense means \"validating the authenticity and validity of a will). Likewise, an adjudication that someone had no will cannot be made without a probate proceeding. There is no exception for a clear an uncontested will. \"Will\" means \"probate\" pretty much by definition.\n\nThis doesn't mean, however, that the closing of the property has to waive until the probate proceeding including a full administration of the probate estate and closing of the probate estate is required. Often, a will can be admitted to probate and an executor can be appointed to manage the estate in a matter of a few weeks to a few months if there is no contest to either the validity of the will or the appointment of a particular person as an executor.\n\nGenerally, once the executor is appointed in the probate case, the real estate closing can go forward, sometimes with some additional uncontested motion practice. Once the property is sold, the proceeds are put in an estate bank account pending further administration of the estate's assets and liabilities. Indeed, even if the will is contested, as long as a consensus can be reached among the interested parties regarding who the executor should be, the real estate closing could go forward despite the fact that the will is contested.\n\nPowers of attorney are sometimes granted to real estate agents to complete a transaction in the event of a seller's incapacity. But powers of attorney are void no later than the point at which the person with the power of attorney learns of the death. (The common law rule was that a power of attorney was void at the moment of death, even if no one involved in the transaction knew that fact yet.)\n\nThe only person with authority to sign the deed to sell the property, if the property is titled in the name of the seller individually, with no co\\-owner (or with a tenant\\-in\\-common co\\-owner), is the probate estate's executor.\n\nThe real estate contract is a claim in the probate estate, which the probate estate is required to carry out if it is able to do so. But a real estate contract, in and of itself, doesn't transfer the property by operation of law at closing. Until the probate estate is opened, the buyer doesn't even have anyone who can be sued to demand that the real estate contract be performed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a Florida resident, entered into a contract to sell his solely-owned house to Sarah.

In Florida, when a property owner dies before closing on a real estate transaction, the estate must go through probate if the property is solely owned by the deceased. The will must be admitted to probate and an executor appointed before the sale can proceed. This is because:\n\n1. A will has no legal effect until it's been validated through probate.\n2. Only the probate estate's executor has the authority to sign the deed and complete the sale.\n3.

It means that the executor of the probate estate (in an official capacity), who takes title by operation of law upon appointment, is directed to sell the property rather than to distributed it in kind.\n\n> Will there be legal or financial problems with a foreign executor?\n\nNot necessarily.

Hands on administration of the estate and dealing face to face with a local probate lawyer is easier for a resident of the state where the assets are located and the decedent resides, but in these days of telecommunications this isn't a decisive factor. The relative competencies of the prospective executors is more important.\n\n> If both offspring agreed, can the overseas offspring easily transfer\n> executorship to the American offspring, or will there be legal or\n> financial consequences?\n\nAssuming that they are the only interested parties in the estate, they can do so. You can't be compelled to serve as an executor just because you are nominated by a will to do so. If one person declines to serve, the person with next highest priority which would likely be the other sibling, may apply to the probate court to be appointed. The main financial consequence is that typically, whoever does the job is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate for their services.\n\n> Would there be legal or financial deed ownership issues, since neither\n> offspring specifically inherited the property?\n\nNo.\n\n> Could a court order the property to be auctioned out from under the\n> offspring?\n\nIf all interested parties agree, they can defy the will. The normal process, however, is for the executor to follow the will and to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner, typically by engaging a real estate agent to handle the sale. If the executor fails to take action, and an interested party objects, it would be more common for a probate court to remove the executor and appoint another one, than to order a sale at auction, which would typically be a course of last resort.\n\nThis said, under appropriate circumstances, the court of probate jurisdiction would have authority to order an auction of the house. Most commonly, a court order to sell a decedent's house at auction would arise when the decedent (i.e. the dead guy) only owned an undivided partial interest in the house (called a tenancy in common interest) and the non\\-deceased third party co\\-owner of the house (perhaps a brother or ex\\-wife of the decedent) declined to cooperate in selling it.\n\n> If a court determines the overseas executor offspring receives the\n> property deed, the overseas executor wants to remain executor but give\n> deed to American offspring for easier selling of the property, would\n> the property have to go through titling and closing costs for the\n> transfer, and then again for property sale to a third party?\n\nThis question reflects a fundamental misunderstanding about how probate works. Title to the property vests in the estate by operation of law upon the death of the decedent. The executor has authority, once appointed, to take actions such as signing a deed to a third\\-party buyer, on behalf of the estate. There is no intermediate closing and transfer of title to vest title to the property of the decedent in the name of the estate before it goes from the estate to the third party. The net proceeds of the sale to the third party (after costs of sale and prorations of things like property taxes and prepaid insurance) are then placed in a bank account for the estate and paid to the heirs after expenses of administration are paid.\n\nThere is nothing that makes it significantly harder for an overseas executor to close than a domestic one. The title company handling the sale emails the deed (and any other paperwork that needs to be signed) to the executor. The executor prints the documents to be signed, signs the non\\-notarized documents, and signs the deed in the presence of his friendly neighborhood notary in the foreign country where the executor lives, who notarizes the deed. The executed deed, together with a document called an apostille proving that the notary is really a notary, is sent back to the title company (probably with a scanned copy by email and a hard paper copy following by express delivery). Coordinating time zones may be a pain depending on the location of the particular foreign country in question (but the closing does not have to happen for all parties at exact the same time), and if the overseas executor is someplace primitive and remote with no internet access or computers or printers or faxes and no notaries, that could be a problem.

According to the documentation, when the will instructs the property to be sold and proceeds split, this is an instruction regarding who inherits the property. The executor of the probate estate takes title by operation of law upon appointment and is directed to sell the property rather than distribute it in kind. There's no need for intermediate transfers or multiple closings. The executor has the authority to sign a deed to a third-party buyer on behalf of the estate once appointed.

See [this article](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/200845E) for some information about the treaty making process:\n\n> In Canada, the treaty\\-making process is controlled by the executive branch of the federal government, while the Parliament of Canada (\u201cParliament\u201d) is often responsible for passing legislation to implement international treaties at the federal level.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Although this entire process is controlled by the executive branch, the federal government does involve Parliament in this stage of the treaty\\-making process by tabling treaties and relevant explanatory documents for debate in the House of Commons.\n\nSo while the executive branch can enter into treaties at will, they can't create or alter domestic laws without legislative approval. For example, if a treaty required that Canada make certain things illegal, then the legislature would have to pass legislation making that thing illegal to make Canada compliant with its treaty obligations.\n\nApproving a new NATO member wouldn't affect domestic law at all, as there is no bill the legislature would need to pass to implement it. It would effect military operations, but the executive branch already has the power to decide military strategy (the King is the commander\\-in\\-chief of the military, he delegated those powers to the governor general, and the governor general by convention only acts on the advice of the Cabinet).\n\nNote that unlike many other countries (such as the US), the Canadian constitution is mostly silent on the topic of international treaties, only mentioning treaties agreed to by the UK on behalf of Canada (at the time the constitution was written, Canada couldn't agree to treaties itself), so there are no constitutional requirements for the legislative branch to approve any treaties.\n\nAlso note that treaty implementing legislation is almost always passed, since the executive branch needs to maintain the support of a majority of the legislature. If the legislature doesn't pass implementing legislation, then the legislature would also be very likely to pass a no\\-confidence motion, which would usually trigger a new election.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Canada, which of the following statements most accurately describes the process of ratifying international treaties and agreements?\n\nA) The executive branch has full authority to enter into treaties, but requires parliamentary approval for all international agreements.\n\nB) The legislative branch must approve all treaties before they can be ratified by the executive branch.\n\nC) The executive branch can enter into treaties independently, but often requires legislative action to implement treaty obligations that affect domestic law.\n\nD) The Canadian constitution explicitly requires both executive and legislative approval for all international treaties and agreements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Canada, the executive branch (the government) has the authority to enter into international treaties without requiring formal approval from the legislative branch (Parliament). However, if a treaty requires changes to domestic law for implementation, the legislative branch must pass the necessary legislation. This system allows the executive to act swiftly in international affairs while maintaining a check on domestic impacts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because parliamentary approval is not required for all international agreements. Option B is false as the executive can enter into treaties without prior legislative approval. Option D is incorrect because the Canadian constitution is largely silent on the treaty-making process and does not explicitly require legislative approval for international agreements.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the separation of powers in Canada's treaty-making process and the interplay between executive authority and legislative implementation."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87962/processing-screenshots-of-peoples-browser-windows-on-a-web-server", "docs_id": 87962, "title": "Processing screenshots of people&#39;s browser windows on a web server", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that a software developer (April) living in the UK,has created a simple browser plug\\-in that takes screenshots of a user's browser windows and allows the user to enhance and \"prettify\" these screenshots in various ways.\n\nThe \"enhancing\" part of the screenshot processing is done on April's server, which means that all screenshots are uploaded from people's computers to April's over the internet. April has no control over the data that people take screenshots of: it can be their personal email messages, or some copyrighted material, or even their nude pictures. And all this data ends up on the web server that April owns and contrtols.\n\nAre there some specific kinds of data processing agreement or privacy policy that April needs to offer to users so that she doesn't end up in any kind of legal trouble (with GDPR or any other privacy laws)? Maybe a disclaimer saying something like \"by installing this plug\\-in, you agree not to take screenshots of any illegal/copyrighted material\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the developer is also said to be running the website where screen shots to be edited are stored, and is resident in the UK, it would seem that the GDPR\\-UK applies. (The EU version may also apply when a user is in the EU.) This means that the Data Controller (DC) must have a lawful basis under [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)\n\nThe most plausible basis would seem to be point (b) of article 6 paragraph 1\\. That reads:\n\n> (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n\nFor this to apply, the DC would need to include in a ToS document or in some other relevant document that a user must accept, contractual language in which the Data Subject (DS) agrees to submit data for processing, and the DC agrees to recive, process, and return it. There would probably be other provisions as well. One of them might be that the content could not itself be unlawful, another that the DS has all needed rights to submit the content for creation of a modified version, yet another that the service could not be used for any unlawful purpose.\n\nHowever, other GDPR provisions would also apply. In particular, [Article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/), paragraph 1 point (e) reads in relevant part\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed ...\n\nthis suggest that such screen shots should not be retained indefinitely, but rather deleted securely as soon as the modified versions have been transmuted to ther users who have requested them. While 5\\. (b) does permit retention for archiving purposes, it is better practice to retain no more thasn needed. Furthermore, if such information is to be retained as an archive, that should be disclosed to the user under [Article 13](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-13-gdpr/) specifically 13\\.1(c) and 13\\.2(a). Those require disclosing the purpose and lawful basis of procession, and the expected time of retention or the criteria used to determine the retention period.\n\nOthre disclosures liosted in article 13 would also apply.\n\nThe idea of consent on the basis of \"by using this app/site you consent to ...\" is not valid consent under the GDPR. Specifically [Article 7](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/) requires that consent can be withdrawn at any time, and be easy to withdraw. [Recital 32](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-32/) states:\n\n> Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject\u2019s agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. ... Silence, pre\\-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent.\n\nThus contractual language, explicitly agreed to by the DS, is a much better basis than such implied consent.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: April, a UK-based software developer, creates a browser plugin that allows users to enhance screenshots.

The agent showed some houses which I had done the research for. **So I had found the house and asked them to show it to me**. Later one of the houses got pulled out of the market which was listed by another agent. I later learned that the seller was going to advertise the home as 'Sale by Owner'. I contacted the seller directly and we negotiated the final price of the house. The seller wanted a letter from my agent stating that she will be waiving off her commission as the house is no longer on the market. I contacted my real estate agent asking for the letter, but she spoke to the seller and upped the home price to include her commission.\n\nI have not signed anything with neither the relocation company nor the real estate agent agreeing to work with them. \n\nIs it still right for the agent to ask for commission since the house has been pulled out of the market since my agent showing it to me.She spoke with the owner, added her commission and came back to us with the new updated higher price.

This right often persists even if the property is later pulled from the market. However, the agent's action of unilaterally increasing the already negotiated price to include their commission without the buyer's input is unprofessional and not in the best interest of the buyer. While the agent has a legal claim to commission, they should have addressed this with the seller separately or sought alternative solutions rather than altering the agreed-upon price between buyer and seller.

They say that Waters 'should' be brought to trial for this.\n\n**Question**\n\nIn such a case, what are the steps? As a non\\-lawyer, non\\-US\\-citizen, my guess is the following:\n\n1. Someone (anyone?) complains to the police.\n2. The police are obliged to investigate (?)\n3. The police seek evidence, such as the accused person talking on video\n4. They forward this evidence to someone for a decision on whether the case is strong enough\n5. The case is brought or dropped\n\nAre my guesses correct? What details have I missed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The steps listed in the question are not far off, but not quite correct. A more correct list would be:\n\n1. Indications that a crime has been committed, or is in progress or planned come to the attention of the police. This might be via a complaint, or the report of an informant, or through the police's own observations.\n2. The police decide whether the matter warrants investigation. They are never **required** to investigate, although credible allegations of serious crime will usually be investigated. The police may consult the office of the prosecutor.\n3. The police seek for and assemble evidence, if possible. They may interview suspects and possible witnesses. This may last anywhere from hours to years. They may seek warrants for searches or wiretaps or arrests.\n4. The police decide whether or not to forward evidence to the prosecutor's office, seeking a charge. They may choose not to do so.\n5. The prosecutor's office reviews evidence submitted by the police, and decides whether to file charges. A prosecutor has wide discretion to proceed with or drop a case. The prosecutor may direct the police to make further investigation if additional evidence is needed or wanted. The decision to file charges will be based on the seriousness of the matter, and on the prosecutor's judgement as to whether a conviction can be obtained, and the available resource of the office. Political factors may come into play.\n6. There may be a grand jury proceeding to review the evidence and produce an indictment. The Grand Jury can hear witnesses. Usually its proceedings and the list of witnesses are tightly controlled by the prosecutor. It has been famously said that any half\\-way competent prosecutor can get a Grand jury to \"indite a ham sandwich\". However, the Grand Jury has the power to push inquiry in directions not approved by the prosecutor, although this is quite rarely done in practice. In some states a \"preliminary hearing\" may be held instead. In either case the question is whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, and that the defendant(s) committed it. If the crime is a misdemeanor then the prosecutor can file charges without a Grand Jury or a preliminary hearing.\n7. Charges are filed with the court that has jurisdiction. The defendant(s) may be arrested, or agree to attend court. The defendant(s) will appear to respond to the formal charges, usually with a \"Guilty\" or \"Not Guilty\" plea.\n8. The Judge of the court will set the schedule for further proceedings, including a trial if things get that far. The defense may ask the Judge to dismiss the charges, which the Judge may do if they do not appear to be legally well founded.\n\nThis process could stop at any stage, and several people have authority to determine if it proceeds or not. The senior police officer(s), involved, the prosecutor, and eventually the judge all can halt the process, at one point or another.\n\nAs was mentioned in a comment by Paul Johnson , the supreme court in the case of [*Brandenburg v. Ohio*, 395 U.S. 444 (1969\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) has significantly limited prosecutions for incitement to situations involving speech that is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action\". Otherwise the protections under the First Amendment to the US Federal Constitution protect the speech and prevent any prosecution. Prior to that case the case of [*Schenck v. United States*, 249 U.S. 47 (1919\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States) allowed prosecution for speech that \"creates a clear and present danger\". The very well\\-known passage is:\n\n> The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. ... The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.\n\nWhether prosecution in a given case is allowed under the First Amendment is a question of law for the Judge and perhaps for an appeals court. But I doubt that the reported speech would pass the *Brandenburg* test or even the earlier \"clear and present danger\" test. If not, no valid prosecution could be brought.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the process of initiating a criminal prosecution in the United States?\n\nA) The police are legally obligated to investigate all complaints from citizens, and must forward all evidence to prosecutors for charging decisions.\n\nB) A grand jury indictment is required for all criminal prosecutions, regardless of the severity of the alleged offense.\n\nC) The process typically involves police discretion in investigating, prosecutorial discretion in charging, and potential grand jury proceedings, with multiple points where the case could be halted.\n\nD) Once police gather evidence of a potential crime, they are required to arrest the suspect and file charges directly with the court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate description of the criminal prosecution process in the U.S. It correctly notes that both police and prosecutors have discretion in how to proceed with a case, and that grand jury proceedings may be involved (though not always required).

Australia, for one, has made them illegal in certain kinds of cases, passing laws that forbid disclosing the \"existence or non\\-existence\" of certain types of warrants issued to a subject. (See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_canary#Usage).)\n\nHowever, in the US, an order to falsely update an existing canary would probably fall afoul of the prohibition on compelled speech stated in *West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette* (the 2nd flag salute case) and *Wooley v. Maynard* (state cannot mandate a motto on a license plate that some find offensive). The case of *New York Times Co. v. United States* (the Pentagon papers case) might also be relevant.\n\nHowever, before asking if a government order would shield a business from liability for falsely updating a canary, one must fist ask if they would have any liability in any case. It is generally not a crime, or even a tort, to make a false statement unless it is under circumstances where the statement constitutes fraud.\n\nTo prevail, a plaintiff A would need to show that it reasonably relied on the statement from B, and suffered measurable damage from that reliance. It would also need to show that the person or firm B falsely updating the canary knew or should have known that the statement was likely to be relied on, and possibly that B intended A to rely on the false statement to A's detriment.\n\nIt is hard to see what actionable damage to A this might include, as being discovered in unlawful acts is not actionable.\n\nIf a court did rule that A was damaged by B's false statement, then the question of a government order might be raised. In general it is a defense against a civil lawsuit that one was complying with a valid law or government regulation or order. Of course, this could raise the further question of whether such an order was valid, which might have different results in different jurisdictions.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn short, this is a situation untested in any actual court case that I know of, and not highly likely to be tested any tiem soon.

This is called *fair use* and it varies around the world. But a commercial work won't be able (probably) to depend on the same exception to copyright law and you still have to find the copyright holder. \n\nMoreover, even if the authors have a proper license (explicitly), that license (a) may not be transferrable and (b) might be for non\\-commercial use only. \n\nAcademic copyright holders often (not universally) issue their work under a fairly permissive license but that is restricted to non\\-commercial use. Since they hold the copyright they can also issue additional licenses against it if they like, but need to do so explicitly. \n\nUltimately, to use the work of others you have to deal with the copyright question. It is further complicated by the fact that a figure may be considered under the law as a \"complete work\" even if it appears within another work. So, replicating it is less likely to fall under fair use rules \\- though they vary. \n\n---\n\nAnd, there is one other question you should ask yourself. Is your talk really a commercial use?

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the customers' legal options?\n\nA) The customers can easily bypass the arbitration clause by proving the company's fraudulent practices in court.\n\nB) State laws can be enacted to declare such arbitration clauses unconscionable, allowing customers to proceed with a class action lawsuit.\n\nC) The arbitration clause is likely enforceable, but customers may still challenge the validity of the contract itself on grounds such as duress or unconscionability.\n\nD) The Federal Arbitration Act does not apply to this situation if the company only operates within one state.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct based on the information provided. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) generally makes mandatory arbitration clauses enforceable, and federal law preempts state law in this regard. However, customers may still challenge the validity of the entire contract on grounds such as duress or unconscionability. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the FAA allows for vacating an arbitration award if the arbitration process itself was corrupt, not if the subject matter of the dispute involves fraud.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, as established in AT&T Mobility v. Concepcion, states cannot declare mandatory arbitration clauses unconscionable as a matter of law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, following Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v.

For example, think the [muppets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muppets), a famous set of characters which are famous, representative of personalities, but are **not real living human beings**.\n\nIf a muppet were to be subjected to scrutiny, is the muppet responsible? Is the ventriloquist responsible? Who answers to a muppet if a muppet may not be the work or being of one person?\n\nAlas, what are laws that subject famous characters/personalities/etc. which are not immediate, living humans? Some people run super famous Twitter/social media accounts that represent some visage, likeness or purported being, that of which may not actually be subjected to a real, specific human. As an example, think of a social media account of someone like Elmo, The Annoying Orange, or etc.\n\nMany people can run the account and as such their image or likeness can vary to the public.\n\nWho is responsible though? Assuming we already established that a non\\-human can still be a public figure or celebrity, who is ultimately responsible for the actions of a fictional or semi\\-fictional person?\n\nAlso, what about a smart agent or robot that does machine learning and threatens to kill a major figure, like an official? The programmer didn't do this \\-\\- the program \"learned\" words and made that threat via social media/etc. In short, the program COULD in theory be wholly responsible.\n\nThis same analogy can apply to a semi\\-fictional figure that may not be wholly dictated by the control or means of a human being, or the likeness of one human being either.\n\nBy \"semi\" I mean someone who can partially represent themselves in the form of another likeness/entity they may have made up, but do not fully represent their real personality to such likeness? For example, I could pretend to be \"Joe Shaqqa\" and use part of my personality to do so, but do not consider myself to be \"Joe Shaqqa\" and do not associate my real image with this fictional, famous character.

Under this system, the first company to file a patent application is generally granted the patent, regardless of who conceived the idea first.

A *lot* of information on their clients has been divulged due to the nature of mortgage applications. \n\nAfter the breach, when the company was questioned about what information was actually in the breach, it was found that full card details were retained for a payment made, and not destroyed afterwards.\n\nA formal request was made as to the reason the card details were retained. A letter has been sent apologising for the delays in processing the request. It has a lot of fluff about how to stay secure, what they have done since, and apologising for a late reply due to the large number of requests (My original request was more than 30 days before the letter). It specifically doesn't answer the question of *why* my card details would have needed to be retained, nor does it admit explicitly that they should not have been. \n\nInstead, the letter includes an offer of \u00a3100 in \"apology\", and comes with a form requesting the \u00a3100 that will \"be final settlement of any and all claims I have out of or in connection with the matters referred to ... \\[in this letter]\"\n\nThis to me seems a clear \"get out of jail for \u00a3100\" attempt, relying on the fact that next steps and severity aren't known. I am a software engineer and I know from that angle how strict GDPR is, and I also know that this mortgage broker company have been the \"recommended\" broker for our new housing estate of nearly 200 homes.\n\nSo I am curious as to what a next step could be. It seems that taking the \u00a3100 would be foolish, knowing how strict the GDPR rules could be, but I am somewhat out of my depth on next step.

That is to say, accepting it will create a binding agreement between you and the company. There is no reason yet for the company to believe that you have suffered more damages, and you do have reasonable options to prevent them (ask bank for a new card \\- that's not going to cost you \u00a3100\\).\n\nThe second observation is that the GDPR does not really affect the first observation. The GDPR itself does not give rise to additional civil claims or special damages. Yes, the GDPR states that the company is in the wrong, but parties can make agreements how a wrongful deed is made right again.

Just as your brother has to pay rent at the market rate. \n\nIf rent at market rate is $1,000 and the monthly cost (taxes, maintenance etc.) is $400, then your brother should pay $1,000 a month, the $400 is paid from rental income, and the $600 profit shared, so you get $300 and he gets $300\\.

If he doesn\u2019t like it, he can pay more. Remind him that he isn\u2019t paying rent, so if he wants all cost precisely shared then he must pay rent. \n\nIf you have no problem with him living there (he\u2019s your brother after all) then you should also take into account that he is paying off the mortgage, once the house is sold.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: In a situation where two siblings inherit a house equally, but only one sibling lives in the property, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the financial responsibilities and rights of both parties?\n\nA) The sibling living in the house should pay all expenses and mortgage payments, with no obligation to the other sibling.\n\nB) Both siblings should split all expenses equally, regardless of who is occupying the property.\n\nC) The sibling living in the house should pay fair market rent, with expenses and profits shared equally between both siblings.\n\nD) The sibling not living in the house has no financial responsibilities and should receive half of the property's value upon sale, regardless of expenses paid by the occupying sibling.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most equitable arrangement in this situation is for the sibling living in the house to pay fair market rent.

I know mine from when I was a child expired a long time ago, but can I just go to the consulate and apply for a new one?\n\nI did some searching online, and I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned this as a path to holding both US and Chinese citizenship, as I'm sure Chinese national children gaining derived US citizenship from their parents after they move to the US as a minor is pretty common. Does anyone have any real\\-world experience with how China treats automatic acquisition of US citizenship through INA 320 under the Chinese nationality law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does anyone have any real\\-world experience with how China treats automatic acquisition of US citizenship through INA 320 under the Chinese nationality law?\n\nWhile not exactly the same, there are many children who have both nationalities are that recognized as special cases by the Chinese government, i.e. conflict of nationality, often as a result of jus soli laws (e.g. the recently newsworthy Eileen Gu) (but jus sanguins can also apply if one of the parents is not Chinese and transmits another nationality).\n\nChina is still developing its administrative legal system and things are more practicalities than legalities.\n\nAlthough recognized as Chinese national and having the same rights as children with only Chinese nationality in China (e.g. education, household registration), a child in this case does not benefit from a Chinese passport. The consulates or immigration authorities only issue a travel document to such persons, until they reach 18 years of age. Once they become adult, a passport would only be issued upon the presentation of the renunciation of the other nationality (unless no renunciation process is available).\n\nNow, if this person is living in China when they become adult and they do not want to travel abroad, they do not have to renounce the other citizenship to e.g. renew their national ID card, register for social insurance or seek employment.\n\nEven if you obtained another nationality voluntarily, resumption of Chinese nationality is also an option available that in practice is routinely granted (barring criminal histories etc.).\n\nThe Chinese consulate would not issue you a passport, but may issue you a travel document if you present a renunciation of your U.S. citizenship. They may process it as if you never lost the Chinese nationality, or they may consider it a case of resumption.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the citizenship status of a person who acquired U.S. citizenship through derived citizenship (INA 320) as a child of Chinese nationals?\n\nA) They automatically lose their Chinese citizenship upon gaining U.S. citizenship.\nB) They can easily obtain a Chinese passport from a Chinese consulate if they still consider themselves Chinese.\nC) They are in a legal grey area where China may still consider them a Chinese national, but with limited rights.\nD) They definitively retain dual U.S. and Chinese citizenship without any restrictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the situation described falls into a complex legal area. While China generally does not recognize dual citizenship, the specific circumstances of derived citizenship may not strictly fall under the conditions for losing Chinese nationality as per Article 9 of the Chinese Nationality Law. However, China's practical approach to such cases is nuanced. They may still consider such individuals as Chinese nationals but with limitations, such as not issuing them full Chinese passports. Instead, they might only provide travel documents until age 18, after which the individual would need to choose one nationality. This reflects a \"legal grey area\" where the person isn't fully recognized as having dual citizenship, but also isn't completely stripped of their Chinese national status."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89696/in-us-courts-has-a-strong-alibi-ever-been-excluded-based-only-on-untimely-notice", "docs_id": 89696, "title": "In US courts has a strong alibi ever been excluded based only on untimely notice?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a question [Can I surprise the prosecution with an alibi defense at trial?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58778/can-i-surprise-the-prosecution-with-an-alibi-defense-at-trial) which asks a similar thing and the answer there seems to be yes, but the evidence presented seems to me to be inconclusive at best.

A couple years ago I had been seeing a specialist doctor. I had been a victim of a crime, so the city/police department was paying for my treatment. It had been my understanding that the city/police would fully pay for a set number of visits, but it appeared that was based on the assumption the doctor's office was charging a lower rate (i.e. normally it was $200/hr but for low income or people who were victims of a crime it was $125/hr).\n\nAnyway, I had stopped seeing the doctor and I'm better now, but the office sent me an email reading:\n\n\"Could we please get your police case number, so we can bill them for a outstanding visits?\" \n\n* First, I don't know how I missed payments, as I always paid in person before I left.\n* Second, I noticed they had been inconsistent in the amount they were charging me per session (sometimes $200, sometimes $125\\).

If I recall correctly, in Canada, the relevant statute of limitations would be determined at the provincial level. Given that this was \"a couple of years ago\" realistically, it is probably not barred by the statute of limitations yet.\n\nAre Interest Charges Allowed.\n=============================\n\nGenerally yes.\n\nMost jurisdictions allow for pre\\-judgment interest at a statutory rate from the date due in the absence of a contrary agreement and if the provider's paperwork with you provided for another interest rate, that would apply instead. So charging interest is allowed.\n\nThe existence of a dispute wouldn't change this result, although it would, of course, mean that if some portion of the bill was disallowed in a later lawsuit that interest would be owed only on the portion that the court found was actually owed.\n\nThe Provider's Remedies\n=======================\n\n*A Lawsuit*\n\nIf these bills are not paid, they can sue.\n\nStatute of limitations, or errors in billing, or failure to seek reimbursement from the police as arranged with them, would all be legitimate defenses in lawsuit brought by the provider.\n\nGiven the modest amount allegedly owed and the existence of defenses, this might not be a very attractive one for the provider to choose to bring suit to collect.\n\n*Credit Reporting*\n\nOn the other hand, in lieu of suing, the provider could simply report it as a bad debt with a credit reporting agency through their collections company.\n\nThis would look bad on your credit (for up to seven years in the U.S., although you could insist on filing a rebuttal statement as part of your credit report, I don't know how disputes about credit reporting work in Canada).\n\nPaying them would almost admit that there was a late payment for credit reporting purposes, but also might prevent the incident from entering the credit reporting system at all.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A patient received medical treatment for injuries related to a crime, with the understanding that the city/police would cover the costs.

Seyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesmann_v._Seyer), which asserts that in Kansas, \"a woman is entitled to sue the father of her child for child support even if conception occurred as a result of a criminal act committed by the woman\". However, the text of the article seems to say that although Seyer (the man in the relationship) was underage and therefore incapable of providing consent under statutory rape law, he had actually given consent to the acts under civil law since he didn't complain to his parents. In the hypothetical scenario described above, Bob did not consent to the acts since he was raped.\n\nI'm interested in all jurisdictions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nThe treatment of how paternity is handled in cases of rape, from which child support and child custody determinations flow, varies by U.S. state in the United States as a result of an ongoing and recent wave of legislative innovation, prompted by cases in which convicted male rapists sought child custody in connection with children conceived in acts of rape for which they were convicted. A state by state summary of the applicable laws as of January 2020 (which oversimplifies the situation in which there are additional distinctions not noted, some of which are differences in wording that could be relevant to how these statutes apply in the OP case) can be found [here](https://www.mylifetime.com/movies/you-cant-take-my-daughter/articles/how-parental-rights-for-rapists-vary-by-state).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/30rZL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/30rZL.jpg)\n\nAll of these laws are targeted at the case of a woman raped by a man who becomes pregnant, which is factually predominant, something that happens many thousands of times each year in the United States as a whole, and not at the case of a man who, in the course of being raped by a female, causes the female to become pregnant as a result.\n\nCases of men being raped that are handled by the legal system, and do not involve statutory rape, predominantly involve sexual interaction that is not reproductive, i.e. something other than a man involuntarily having vaginal sex with a woman, often prison rape by a same sex inmate or rape with an object, and also, as in other cases of rape, often doesn't result in a conception of a child due to random chance. Likewise, many women convicted of rape are convicted as co\\-participants in a crime that involves physical penetration of a victim by a man or an object, rather than sexual intercourse with the woman convicted of the crime. So, the number of cases that could potentially be litigated with respect to this issue is much smaller.\n\nIt is also worth noting that under U.S. criminal law, sexual intercourse procured by deception (other than deception regarding the person with whom one is having sex, for example, because of a blindfold or darkness, or deception regarding one's status as a medical practitioner making a medical examination, or as a law enforcement officer making a legally authorized cavity search) is not a crime and does not constitute rape.\n\nAlso, generally speaking, having sex consensually in a manner not intended to lead to conception, which, in fact, does result in conception with consent to the sex giving rise to conception (e.g. where there is an agreement to \"pull out\" that isn't performed due to the acts of one or both parties involved), will almost never be prosecuted criminally as rape, whether or not a jury with perfect knowledge of the facts of the interaction could convict under the law of the minority of U.S. states where this might be possible.\n\nAs @user6726 notes, the primary fact pattern related to the OP historically has involved instances of intercourse that are consensual in fact, but constitute statutory rape due to the age of the father which makes it impossible for him to legally consent, and in those cases, the default rule that the biological father of a child is recognized as the father for custody and child support purposes has been the predominant rule.\n\nBut much of that case law predates modern rapist\\-paternity statutes and there is an equal protection argument that those statutes should have a parallel construction, although to the best of my knowledge, there are no reported appellate cases that have tested that issue. It remains an open issue of first impression in most, if not all, jurisdictions that have adopted rape\\-paternity statutes.\n\nIn Minnesota, which had not adopted such a statute as of January 2020, being raped would not be a defense to a paternity, child custody, or child support claim.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, if a woman rapes a man and becomes pregnant as a result, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the man's legal obligations?\n\nA) The man is automatically exempt from child support obligations in all states due to being a victim of rape.\n\nB) The man's obligation for child support varies by state, with some states having laws that may protect him from paternity claims in rape cases.\n\nC) The man is always legally obligated to pay child support regardless of the circumstances of conception in all 50 states.\n\nD) Federal law uniformly protects male rape victims from child support obligations resulting from their assault.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The legal landscape regarding paternity and child support obligations for male victims of rape is complex and varies significantly by state. While many states have enacted laws addressing parental rights in rape cases, these laws primarily focus on scenarios where men rape women. The application of these laws to cases where women rape men remains largely untested in court. Some states may offer protections to male victims through equal protection arguments based on existing rape-paternity statutes, but this is not universal. In states without specific protections, like Minnesota as of 2020, being raped might not serve as a defense against paternity or child support claims. Therefore, the man's obligations would indeed vary by state, with some potentially offering protection while others may still hold him liable for child support."}}
