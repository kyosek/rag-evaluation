According to contract law principles, the couple is likely responsible for the 25% fee, even if they didn't read the clause on the back of the contract. As long as they had the opportunity to review the entire document, including both sides, they are generally bound by its terms. The fact that only one spouse signed doesn't necessarily invalidate the contract if both names were on it and they were acting as a unit.

There are certain exceptions, particularly if you are enrolled in a public school, which has some latitude to impose speech restrictions to \u201cavoid substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others\u201d [*Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist.*, 393 U.S. 503, (1969\\)](https://casetext.com/case/tinker-v-des-moines-independent-community-school-district).\n\nWhile you are a minor, though, your *parents* have virtually unlimited freedom to limit your freedom of speech. If they want to punish you for buying a hat or saying things they disagree with, they can generally do that.\n\n**EDIT:** The hat you've linked to probably would not fall within the *Tinker* exception. A similar case arose in [Schoenecker v. Koopman, 349 F. Supp. 3d 745 (E.D.

Des Moines and Schoenecker v. Koopman), schools must show that speech restrictions are necessary to avoid substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others. Merely wearing a hat supporting the 2nd Amendment, without evidence of actual disruption, is likely protected speech. The school would need to provide substantial evidence of disruption to justify restricting this form of political expression. \n\nOption A is incorrect because minors do have First Amendment protections in schools, albeit with some limitations. Option B is incorrect because parents cannot override school policies that are constitutionally applied. Option D is incorrect because while parents have broad authority over their children's speech, schools do not have unlimited authority and must justify speech restrictions."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32086/hetzner-is-trying-to-charge-me-for-bandwidth-overuse-and-will-not-respond-when-i", "docs_id": 32086, "title": "Hetzner is trying to charge me for Bandwidth overuse and will not respond when I use the contact form", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A few months ago, I was using Hetzner Cloud for my VPS, and they blocked a server because someone seems to have DDoSed it.

I was surprised to learn that there hasn't been much activity in this area since [*Obergefell*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-556/opinion3.html), at least not a lot that has led to development of the arguments you're asking for.\n\nThe most on\\-point case I can find is [*Collier v. Fox,* No. CV 15\\-83\\-BLG\\-SPW\\-TJC, 2018 WL 1247411 (D. Mont. Feb. 22, 2018\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20180312b26), where a married couple and another woman sued the state because its criminal and civil laws prohibited the second woman from entering into the marriage. The court tossed the challenge to the criminal prohibition based on the parties' standing, saying that there was not a sufficient threat of criminal prosecution, and it dismissed the challenge to the civil restrictions based on [*Reynolds v. U.S.*, 98 U.S. 145 (1878\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/98/145/case.html), where the Supreme Court said that each state has the right \"to determine whether polygamy or monogamy shall be the law of social life under its dominion.\"\n\nThere was no appeal, so the decision was never reviewed.\n\nThe only other case I've seen directly challenging the laws was [*Sevier v. Thompson*, No. 2:16\\-CV\\-659\\-DN\\-EJF, 2018 WL 1378803 (D. Utah Jan. 26, 2018\\)](https://ecf.utd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?216cv0659-109), where some anti\\-gay activists tried to overturn *Obergefell* by suing to force Utah to let one of them marry a computer and three of them marry each other. If you can't guess how this ends, I'll tell you that it does not end well. The plaintiffs all admitted that they didn't actually want the relief they were asking for, so the court threw the case out on standing.\n\nThe same dude also tried to intervene in a lawsuit ([*United States v. North Carolina*, No. 1:16CV425, 2016 WL 7335627 (M.D.N.C. Dec. 16, 2016\\)]](https://ecf.utd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?216cv0659-109)) over the North Carolina bathroom bill, saying that a man trying to marry a machine or marry multiple people belonged in the same category as a man trying to marry a man or a man who identifies as a woman. I'm sure you won't be surprised to learn that the court told him to go to hell again. \n\nBecause these were all tossed at the very early stages, there wasn't much development of the arguments for or against polygamy, though it was clear that everyone was basically talking about an extension of *Obergefell*'s recognition that \"the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person.\" \n\nThere have been several scholarly articles, though, addressing the issue. A few that popped up include:\n\n* A [Yale law professor](https://www.cardozo.yu.edu/sites/default/files/Stein.UMKC_.2016_0.pdf) considering whether plural\\-marriage bans could survive a challenge based on equal protection rather than due process;\n* A [Loyola Marymount professor](http://docplayer.net/69251569-Down-the-slippery-slope-does-the-fundamental-right-to-marry-protect-polygamous-marriage.html) reviewed several post\\-*Obergefell* books considering the future of plural marriage and concludes that (1\\) Western condemnation of plural marriage is strongly informed by racism and xenophobia, (2\\) legal reactions against plural marriage may do more to harm the people they are meant to protect, and (3\\) whatever benefits may accompany plural marriage, banning it does not entail the same kinds of harms as bans on gay marriage; and\n* A William \\& Mary law student [published an article](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol24/iss2/7/) running through the different ways a court might analyze the question and argued that Obergefell should generally permit polygamy, regardless of which test a court applies."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the legal challenges and scholarly articles discussed regarding polygamy post-Obergefell v.

Likewise, the historical rule for transfer of real property before ownership registration was established for it, was \"signed, sealed, and delivered\" meaning that a deed had to be signed by the seller, notarized, and delivered to the buyer or the buyer's agent, for title to be transferred.\nGenerally speaking, when property is represented by an ownership certificate or is intangible, transfer of the certificate or relevant document, rather than physical possession, governs transfer of title (before real property records were formalized and bureaucratized, one had to deliver constructive possession of real property with \"livery of seisen\" by handing over a rock or dirt or twig from the real property to the buyer to signify delivery of possession of real property, the modern equivalent of which would have been to hand over keys to a building).\n\nBut, the Finance Act and the associated regulations and forms seem to make clear that you need to have both parties, rather than merely the seller (under this historical rule and the rule in most U.S. jurisdictions), sign the relevant form to transfer title.\n\n> The question is, at what point does the car actually become mine?

But, I don't have the full text of an Irish car insurance policy contract at my disposal to review in order to confirm that fact.\n\nYou could probably read the terms of your current car insurance policy contract, if you have one, and determine the answer, as this is likely to be effectively uniform for all car insurance policies in Ireland.\n\nOr, as @chepnor notes in the comments, \"if you call your insurance company ahead of time and tell them you will be purchasing the car.

This is based on the interpretation of Section 140(2) of the Finance Act (1992) and associated regulations. While registration with the government provides prima facie evidence of ownership, it is a rebuttable presumption. The act of both parties signing the relevant form appears to be the key moment of transfer, rather than the payment, physical handover, posting of forms, or government processing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely paying and receiving keys doesn't constitute an official transfer according to Irish law. Option B is incorrect because posting the form is a step that occurs after the ownership has already transferred. Option D is incorrect because government processing is not the moment of transfer, but rather a record of the transfer that has already occurred.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the specific legal requirements for transferring car ownership in Ireland, distinguishing between the actual moment of transfer and the subsequent administrative processes."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11579/is-pokemon-go-legal-at-all-in-the-uk", "docs_id": 11579, "title": "Is Pokemon Go legal at all in the UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Vagrancy Act 1824 has this to say \n\n> every Person playing or betting in any Street, Road, Highway, or other open and public Place, at or with any Table or Instrument of gaming, at\n>  any Game or pretended Game' of Chance\n\noutdated or not, I believe this is the law.

The list instead seems focused on preventing dissemination, or more broadly preventing someone from \"spreading,\" or potentially spreading the original recording.\n\nIn that sense, I don't think (1\\) is illegal since you aren't actively spreading the original recording, the fact that a transient copy is being made is an incidental technical detail and I think doesn't fit the legislative intent as demonstrated by the other actions in the given list (though the internet host is clearly distributing a recording to you and is themself committing a 162(4\\) offence).

Challenging a past involuntary commitment is extremely difficult without concrete evidence of mistakes or misconduct at the time of the commitment. Current mental state or circumstances are generally not relevant to the legality of a past commitment decision. Option A is incorrect because articulating one's current mental state does not address the conditions at the time of commitment.

For example, [this page from Shelter](http://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/security_of_tenure/assured_shorthold_tenancies/ending_an_assured_shorthold_tenancy/how_to_end_an_assured_shorthold_tenancy) says:\n\n> The general rule is that the tenant can leave on the last day of a fixed\\-term tenancy without giving notice, and this will end the tenancy.\\[2] If the tenant remains even a day longer than the last day of a fixed\\-term tenancy, a statutory periodic assured shorthold tenancy will arise, which the tenant can end by serving a valid notice to quit.\n> \n> \n> \\[2] Right d. Flower v. Darby (1786\\) 1 T.R. 159; Cobb v Stokes (1807\\) 8 East 358\\.\n\nThis is extremely bad news for landlords, who don't (necessarily) get any notice that they have a void. In general, I would say you ought to give a month's notice (full disclosure, I am a landlord), on the other hand, if they haven't fulfilled their responsibilities perhaps not (but you may have an exaggerated idea of their responsibilities).\n\nIf you do this, don't expect to get a good reference from your landlord! (Which is going to make it harder to find somewhere else to live). You should also anticipate difficulties in recovering your deposit (you are legally entitled to it back, but that doesn't mean your landlord can't be difficult about it \\- possibly even requiring you to sue for it).\n\n---\n\nI have just noticed the second part of your question.\n\nIf you do nothing (in other words, stay in residence), at the end of your Assured Shorthold Tenancy you will switch to a periodic tenancy. The landlord can't force you to switch to another six\\-month contract, but on the other hand, if you *don't*, they are perfectly entitled to give you two months notice. If they are smart, they will give you this notice *now*, so that you can only stay for two months on the periodic tenancy.\n\nNote that the letting agent has an incentive to get you and the landlord to sign another contract (they can charge the landlord a fee for it), so they may not be being entirely honest about whether a periodic tenancy is an option.

Nothing prevent Algeria, for example, from deporting a U.K. citizen who is wanted for a serious crime in the U.K. to the U.K. despite not violating any Algerian immigration laws, because Algeria doesn't want that individual and they would like to do a diplomatic favor for the U.K. to redeem at some future date when Algeria requires some assistance.\n\nLikewise, Algeria could trade someone wanted for a crime in Algeria held in the U.K. for someone in Algeria wanted for a crime in the U.K. in an exchange negotiated on a case by case basis.\n\nWhile it isn't strictly analogous legally, the diplomacy involved in such a one off extradition agreement would be not unlike diplomacy involved in the [December 8, 2022 prisoner swap](https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/08/politics/brittney-griner-released/index.html) between Russia and U.S., of Brittney Griner, an American woman convicted of a marijuana crime in Russia, for Viktor Bout, a Russian man convicted of illegal arms dealing in the U.S."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding extradition policies and practices between the United Kingdom and other countries?\n\nA) All countries without formal extradition treaties with the UK will automatically prosecute UK nationals for crimes committed in the UK.\n\nB) Countries like Egypt and Namibia represent the norm in how most nations handle extradition requests from the UK.\n\nC) The absence of an extradition treaty guarantees that a country will never cooperate with the UK in returning a wanted individual.\n\nD) Even without formal extradition treaties, countries may engage in ad hoc arrangements to return individuals wanted for serious crimes to the UK.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

Assured shorthold tenancies are subsets of assured tenancies, so first we need to look at the latter.\n\n**1\\. Is the tenancy an assured tenancy?**\n\n* [Section 1(1\\)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/1): tenant(s) must be individual(s).\n* [Section 1(1\\)(b)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/1): at least one of the tenants must occupy the dwelling\\-house as their only or principal home.\n* [Section 1(1\\)(c)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/1): the tenancy must not be excluded by in Section 1(2\\) or 1(6\\). Section 1(2\\) in turn refers to [Part 1 of Schedule 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/1) which contains a list of exceptions. They are quite detailed but, briefly, the following are excluded: tenancies with high rateable values, tenancies at very low rents, business tenancies, licenced premises, agricultural tenancies, student accommodation provided by universities etc., holiday lets, tenancies with resident landlords, crown tenancies, some local authority lets.\n\n**2\\. Is the assured tenancy an assured shorthold tenancy?**\n\n* [Section 19A](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/19A): the tenancy must either have come into existence after Section 96 of the Housing Act 1996 came into force (the vast majority of cases) **or** it falls under [Section 20](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/20).\n* [Section 19A](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/19A): the tenancy does not fall within one of the exceptions in [Schedule 2A](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/2A).\n\nTurning to your scenarios:\n\n**Tim rents an entire flat or alternatively a single bedroom through Airbnb for a week. (The landlord doesn't live in the same house.) Is he an AST?**\n\nNot an AST; excluded by Schedule 1 as a holiday let.\n\n**Suppose he rents it for a month, or two months. At what point does he become an AST with corresponding PFE?**\n\nAs long as it is a holiday let, it will not be an AST. It would only be an AST if it were Tim's only or principal home (and all the other criteria apply). There is no magical \"point\" at which it changes from one to the other; it's down to the reality of the facts.\n\n**Larry goes to Berlin for a week\\-long holiday and sublets his HMO room on spare room.com to Theodore for the week. Upon returning Theodore declines to leave.**\n\nThis depends on the specifics of how it was let to Theodore. It sounds like a holiday let on the face of it though.\n\n**Now what if Larry instead goes away for one month or three months and sublets his room (or flat if it makes a difference) for those periods. Again at what stage does it become AST?**\n\nAs above, it becomes an AST when all the criteria for an AST are met per the statutory definition.\n\n**Further, let us suppose that for Larry's fortnight holiday he collects a \u00a3300 deposit. Must this be accordingly protected given how casual the tenancy is?**\n\n[Section 213(1\\) of the Housing Act 2004](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/34/section/213) only requires a deposit to be protected if the tenancy is a shorthold."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Sarah rents out her spare bedroom to John for 3 months while she's on a work assignment abroad.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal status of this arrangement?\n\nA) This is automatically an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) because it's longer than 2 months.\nB) This cannot be an AST because Sarah is the resident landlord, even though she's temporarily away.\nC) This is likely an AST if all statutory criteria are met, including John using it as his only or principal home.\nD) This is considered a holiday let and cannot be an AST, regardless of John's intentions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Whether an arrangement qualifies as an Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST) depends on meeting all the criteria set out in the Housing Act 1988, not just the length of stay. Key factors include:\n\n1. The tenant must be an individual.\n2. The dwelling must be occupied as the tenant's only or principal home.\n3. The tenancy must not fall under any exclusions listed in Schedule 1 of the Act.\n\nIn this scenario, if John is using the room as his principal home and no exclusions apply (e.g., it's not a holiday let), it could be an AST. The fact that Sarah is normally a resident landlord doesn't automatically disqualify it, as she's away for an extended period.\n\nA is incorrect because there's no automatic transition to AST based solely on length of stay.\nB is incorrect because temporary absence of the landlord doesn't necessarily prevent an AST.\nD is incorrect because it's not described as a holiday let, and John's intention to use it as a main residence contradicts this classification."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46218/what-remedies-would-be-possible-likely-in-a-successful-defamation-suit", "docs_id": 46218, "title": "What remedies would be possible/likely in a successful defamation suit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is related to another one I asked recently: [Is it true that a suit of defamation could require \"very little effort\"?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/45559/867), so please review that one first \\-\\- thank you.\n\nLet's say that someone brings a successful defamation suit.

If something appeared in that sci\\-fi universe prior to me re\\-iterating it; does that mean it's fair game for me to use? Its already used in that sci\\-fi universe but in a very obscure publication of it but once it's been used; can I use it again without any problem?\n2.

One might write, for example:\n\n> In *Spaceman Sam* the characters use \"blasters\" as weapons, while in *Jack of the Galaxy* \"contragravity\" is used to propel \"aircars\"\n\nThese are ***facts***, and copyright may never be used to protect facts. Moreover, such uses as reviews and criticism are particularly likely to constitute ***fair use*** under US law, or another ***exception to copyright*** under the law of some other country, even if some otherwise protected content is quoted.\n\n> If something appeared in that sci\\-fi universe prior to me re\\-iterating it; does that mean it's fair game for me to use?\n\nIf the \"something\" that appeared earlier is an \"idea\" or a name, it is indeed fair game. This is true whether it is obscure or well\\-known. In any case describing the facts of the fiction, even in detail, is generally not an infringement.\n\nIf \"re\\-iterating\" something from an existing work **in a new fiction** involves an extensive quotation, or a detailed, point\\-by\\-point reuse of a fictional element, that might constitute infringement, unless ***fair use*** or another ***exception to copyright*** applies.\n\n> Does intellectual law protect very specific plot concepts?\n\nNo, it doesn't. A plot concept is an ***idea***. In the US, [17 USV 103(b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) reads:\n\n> (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nLaws in other countries are similar on this point. This is sometimes known as the [idea/expression distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea%E2%80%93expression_distinction). This means that while the expression used to embody a concept is often protected by copyright, the concept itself never is.\n\n> Are you allowed to borrow names of different generic sci\\-fi inventions that aren't super\\-important to the story.\n\nYes. In fact even the names of fictional technological devices that **are** very important to a story may be, and often are, reused in different works by different authors. For example Ursula LeGuin used \"ansible\" as the name of a faster\\-then\\-light communicator, in fact an instantaneous communication device, in her \"Hanish\" series, particularly in *The Left Hand of Darkness*, *The Dispossessed*, and *The Word for World is Forest*. (She wrote that the term was derived from the word \"answerable\".) The term and concept were reused by Vernor Vinge in \"The Blabber\" and *A Fire Upon the Deep*, and by Elizabeth Moon in the \"Sassanek\" series and more centrally in the \"Vatta's war\" series starting with *Trading in Danger*.\n\nMoreover, the names of fictional characters are not protected. An author might introduce characters with names borrowed from Tolkien, Heinlein, or other well\\-known (or obscure) fictional works. US Copyright Office circular \\#33 \"Works not protected by Copyright\" says that \"names, titles, and short phrases\" may not be protected by copyright, and will not be separably registered.\n\nHowever, if a character has not only the name of a previous character, but a detailed, point\\-by\\-point similarity in distinctive elements to a character in a protected work, that may be enough to make the newer work a derivative work, and thus be infringing if permission is not obtained from the copyright holder on the source work. The same is true of the detailed reproduction of a distinctive setting from a source work. But a mere name and broad, general description is not enough tom make a later work derivative. The more details are reproduced, and the more distinctive and specific those details are, the more likely the newer work is to be found distinctive."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author is writing a detailed chronicle of technological and cultural developments in a popular sci-fi franchise.

If your sign stating \"Active Mine Field\" would, in the overall context, be understood as humor and not as a true statement of fact, it will be protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIf, however, someone is basically defrauded by a sign, because it appears to a reasonable person to be making a true statement of fact upon which a person reasonably relies to their detriment (or perhaps could reasonably rely to their detriment for criminal law purposes), then it is probably not protected.\n\nFor example, suppose that your \"Active Minefield\" sign causes the fire department, when responding to a wildfire next door to your property, to take the long way around your property or to call in the bomb squad at great expense.

Consider that word undiscovered. (aka, the landowner doesn't know someone is sneaking in and using the trampoline) \n\nHowever, if a landowner knows that trespassers have been on his/her land, then these persons are discovered trespassers to whom the landowner owes \"the duty of ordinary care to warn of danger.\"\n\nWhat all this means? Anyone can always be sued for anything. If the kid jumps badly, lands on your property, gets hurt, they might have a case or the judge might see it your way. Perhaps consider the laws of \"Attractive Nuisances\" and \"Discovered Trespassers\".\n\nTo note: A lot of people might say that you can't be held liable for something like this, but that is slightly false. As a property owner you CAN be held liable for anything that happens on your property. Including someone trespassing onto your property without your permission, even to commit crimes, and hurting themselves in the process. Many court cases have ruled in favor of the law\\-abiding landowner, but that's not to say there is a guarantee of this. The best thing to do is always minimize your risks."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Illinois, a homeowner discovers that their neighbor's trampoline partially extends onto their property.

The concept of \"attractive nuisance\" and \"discovered trespassers\" means that property owners can sometimes be held responsible for injuries to children, even if they didn't create the hazard. The fact that the trampoline partially extends onto their property complicates the situation.

In modern use there is no practical difference between not guilty and not proven: the defendant is acquitted in both cases.\n\nHas there ever been a case where a verdict of *not proven* ended up having a different practical effect on the defendant than if he had been found *not guilty*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There actually **is** a practical effect to a \"not proven\" v. \"not guilty\" verdict in Scotland, but it is mostly sociological or social in nature rather than legal. If your question is, are there future legal concerns, than no. Not proven *is*, to be sure, an acquittal. However, it is an acquittal that the tells the public something important: that the trier(s) of fact *thought the person likely guilty*. That's a fairly substantial distinction.\n\nIn Scotland, a criminal case may be decided either \"*in solemn procedure*\", which is simply the Scot term for a jury trial v. \"*in summary*\" or in \"summary procedure\" which is the U.S. equivalent of a bench trial. The difference between the two (and the divergence from the U.S. procedural vehicle) is that for lesser crimes the accused doesn't have an automatic right of a jury trial for any criminal matter. \n\nIn some ways this lesser included makes up for the fact that the Scottish accused is without absolute right to choose jury or bench trial, which in the U.S. can be very meaningful from a tactical perspective. Think of how important the make\\-up and emotional proclivities of juries are to both convictions and acquittals. A bench trial can be beneficial to the truly unlikable defendant, or in especially brutal crimes, where juries may convict out of fear or sympathy for the victim, even if the case is weak. At the same time, they may nullify the conviction for the sympathetic defendant. Juries are notoriously emotional and bias driven. Being able to choose a bench trial where the judge will follow the evidence and avoid the emotional response of a jury can be invaluable. Just as a sympathetic defendant can appeal to the emotions of the jury for acquittal or jury nullification, on the opposite spectrum. \n\nIn Scotland, lesser crimes are always (with limited exclusions) tried by a judge, while more serious allegations always (again w/ limited exclusions) get a jury trial, automatically. The d*efendant does not choose* the type of trial he is afforded. Hence, a defense or a prosecution cannot fiddle with the balance of proof based on emotion or lack there of. They get what they get. There are various rules procedurally that differ in comparison, but since this isn't the question that is the general rule and should suffice for background.\n\nAlso hugely important is the fact that in Scotland, jurors decide a case by *majority vote* (like a civil trial in the U.S.); hence, there are no hung juries and they don't need a consensus. So, one way or another the verdict *will be given* in a Scottish criminal action. Scots also get comparatively huge juries to any other country (15 jurors) and they *only need 8 in agreement* to reach a verdict.\n\nTactically, the \"not proven\" is a lesser included verdict (like U.S. uses lesser included charges in cases that are weaker for the prosecution). This lesser included finding can be used by choice when the Prosecution has a sympathetic defendant or when the defendant is probably guilty or unlikable. If the jury thinks the defendant (called \"accused\") probably did the crime, but the prosecution has failed to prove the elements, they can/will issue a \"not proven\" verdict. This sends a big message. This, again, is typically only reserved for those cases when there is strong but not conclusive proof that someone committed a crime. They don't want to profess their innocence with a not guilty verdict, so they are still acquitted, but with he stigma of the \"not proven\" verdict attached.\n\nSome estimates have from 1/5 to a full 1/3 of all acquittal verdicts by Scottish juries as \"not proven\" as opposed to \"not guilty\". Not proven can also be used by judges in the bench trial (summary procedure), however it's much less common. The proportion of 'not proven\" acquittals in general is higher in the more severe cases; but so then are the proportion of acquittals versus convictions. These would likely be hung juries in the U.S..\n\nBoth in the \"solemn\" and the \"summary\" acquittals, not proven is interpreted as indicating that the jury or judge, respectively, is not convinced of the innocence of the accused; in fact, they may be morally or even factually convinced that the accused is guilty, but do not find the proofs sufficient for a conviction under the elements of the crime on the jury instruction/verdict form. \n\nI look at this as similar to the adage oft used in the U.S., which is an acquittal, despite the fact that the verdict is termed \"not guilty\" does by no means indicate the person is in fact \"not guilty\", it just means the prosecution couldn't prove its case. Sociologists in the U.S., as well as legal scholars, have studied the phenomenon, and it appears that most not guilty verdicts in fact let go a guilty person. This can be intuited by the evidence the jury never saw, either by suppression from bad searches, by the exclusion of witness testimony due to procedural rules like hearsay, privilege, etc., and other forms of keeping relevant evidence from the jury to protect the rights of the accused. But in the U.S. the person can go forth and say, \"Hey, I was proven not guilty!\"\n\nScotland also has another interesting rule of criminal procedure, whereby a criminal can't be convicted without corroborated evidence. What this means is that if all the prosecution has is the victim witness, by way of proof, testifying, and no physical or corroboration testimony, Scottish law requires acquittal, but often will be so by the verdict \"not proven\". This is huge, if you think about it. Use, for example, a rape trial. A woman testifies, saying that Joe Schmoe climbed through her window and raped her. She knows Joe \\- he's her neighbor. Nobody saw him climb in. But she knows it's him. He leaves no physical evidence, having shaved his entire body and used appropriate protection (gloves, condemn, etc.). She has a rape kit done. Rape is obvious, but the only proof is her testimony. Joe goes free. But in Scotland, he goes free with a stigma attached. He's found \"not proven\" rather than \"not guilty\". I think this corroboration rule has a lot to do with why this verdict system still exists. In the U.S. the trier of fact would weigh the testimony and decide if one person was substantially more believable than the other, and a verdict would issue. That is a substantial difference, procedurally.\n\nSince Scotland doesn't have the hung jury because there is no consensus required they use the \"not proven\" in the same way a U.S. jury uses the hung jury when one or more jurors thinks the prosecution didn't prove their case but it's fairly clear the defendant is, in fact guilty. Then, you will often get a \"hold out\" juror, and since the U.S. requires a unanimous verdict, the hold out hangs the jury. It's sort of the opposite of jury nullification. The person knows that the evidence fell short, but their conscience can't reconcile letting the person go free, so they will vote guilty to hang the jury, almost ensuring the prosecution gets another shot.\n\nThere has been a lot of debate about this three verdict system in comparative law circles, with many legal scholars saying it's antiquated. But I think it serves an important purpose. It carries the stigma of likely guilt for those people who probably committed the crime but got off. Further, the hung jury cost tax payers millions of dollars in the U.S., and this is often the side effect of people not wanting there to be absolutely no recognition of the fact that the accused probably committed (especially serious) crime(s). The Scots, on the other hand, have found away to accomplish this without the cost and emotional toll multiple trials takes on all the players involved, from witnesses and victims, their families, the accused, and even the lawyers and the prosecutions, who have to put in all the work of a trial just to start anew. \n\nHere is a really good scholarly article that deals with this interesting phenomenon not seen in (I don't believe) any other country:\n\n<https://journals.iupui.edu/index.php/iiclr/article/viewFile/17848/18019>"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Scotland's criminal justice system, what is the primary practical difference between a verdict of \"not proven\" and \"not guilty\"?\n\nA) A \"not proven\" verdict allows for retrial of the accused, while \"not guilty\" does not.\nB) \"Not proven\" results in a lesser sentence than \"not guilty\" for the same crime.\nC) \"Not proven\" carries a social stigma suggesting probable guilt, despite legal acquittal.\nD) \"Not proven\" can only be issued by a jury, while \"not guilty\" can be issued by both judge and jury.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While both \"not proven\" and \"not guilty\" verdicts result in legal acquittal in Scotland, the primary practical difference lies in the social implications. A \"not proven\" verdict carries a social stigma, suggesting that the jury or judge believed the accused was likely guilty but that the evidence was insufficient for a conviction. This verdict tells the public that the trier(s) of fact thought the person was probably guilty, even though they couldn't legally convict. It's estimated that 1/5 to 1/3 of all acquittal verdicts by Scottish juries are \"not proven\" rather than \"not guilty,\" particularly in more severe cases.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-111_j4el.pdf)\\* Never decided the issue of compelled artistic speech on its merits. Inst ed it held that the baker, Phillips, did not receive a fair haring before the Commission, and that its decision could not stand. But they left for a future case the actual decision of then underlying issue.\n\nThe official 'SCOTUSBlog [wrote](https://www.scotusblog.com/2022/02/justices-will-hear-free-speech-claim-from-website-designer-who-opposes-same-sex-marriage/):\n\n> Nearly four years after the Supreme Court **declined to decide** whether compelling a Colorado baker to bake a cake for same\\-sex couples would violate his right to freedom of speech, the justices agreed to take up a similar question in another case from Colorado, this time involving a website designer. The justices\u2019 decision to grant review in *303 Creative LLC v. Elenis* sets up yet another major ruling on the intersection between LGBTQ rights and religious beliefs. \\[*Emphasis in the Original*]\n\nIn *Masterpiece Cakeshop* the court wrote in its Syllabus:\n\n> ... Phillips too was entitled to a neutral and respectful\n> consideration of his claims in all the circumstances of the case.\n> \n> \n> That consideration was compromised, however, by the Commision\u2019s treatment of Phillips\u2019 case, which showed elements of a clear and impermissible hostility toward the sincere religious beliefs motivating his objection. As the record shows, some of the commissioners at the Commission\u2019s formal, public hearings endorsed the view that religious beliefs cannot legitimately be carried into the public sphere or commercial domain, disparaged Phillips\u2019 faith as despicable and characterized it as merely rhetorical, and compared his invocation of his sincerely held religious beliefs to defenses of slavery and the Holocaust. No commissioners objected to the comments. Nor were they mentioned in the later state\\-court ruling or disavowed in the briefs filed here. The comments thus cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission\u2019s adjudication of Phillips\u2019 case.\n> \n> \n> Another indication of hostility is the different treatment of Phillips\u2019 case and the cases of other bakers with objections to anti\\-gay messages who prevailed before the Commission. The Commission ruled against Phillips in part on the theory that any message on the requested wedding cake would be attributed to the customer, not to the baker. Yet the Division did not address this point in any of the cases involving requests for cakes depicting anti\\-gay marriage symbolism. The Division also considered that each bakery was willing to sell other products to the prospective customers, but the Commission found\n> Phillips\u2019 willingness to do the same irrelevant.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> For these reasons, the Commission\u2019s treatment of Phillips\u2019 case violated the State\u2019s duty under the First Amendment not to base laws or regulations on hostility to a religion or religious viewpoint.

The prolonged presence of an abandoned vehicle \\-\\-just like any piece of junk\\-\\-\\- tends to contravene those purposes.\n\nRegardless of the vehicle's true state, the effect of its apparent abandonment is visibly detrimental to the neighborhood, and it frustrates the ultimate purposes of the HOA rule: to preserve safety conditions in the neighborhood as well as the value of the properties.\n\nAlso, the presumption that an abandoned vehicle is inoperable seems reasonable. The most straight\\-forward way to disprove the board's allegations of inoperability is to actually move the vehicle at least once in a while.

But my understanding is at least one side will always remove them before trial. Why would it always be the case that at least one side would not want someone with legal training on a jury?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically anyone can sit on a jury. Lawyers are not automatically excluded from juries anymore, as being called for jury duty is a right and a duty that the law abhors automatically excluding people from. That is the official line on this. However, in reality, lawyers will always be stricken from serving by one of the lawyers trying the case. Each lawyer has a certain number of preemptory strikes (the ability to get rid of a juror for any reason, aside from those protected by law, such as race, religion, etc). They also have unlimited \n\"for cause strikes,\" which are when a juror is biased in some way. \n\nLawyers trying the case almost always try to use a cause strike to get a lawyer off, saying that they are biased toward either Defense or Plaintiffs based on the type of law they practice. The judge will usually not let them use a cause strike, saying that an attorney is ethical enough to apply the facts to the law and not sway the jury based on their personal biases that everyone has; plus, we're officers of the court so we have a duty to be ethical. Hence, they are typically forced to use a preemptory strike to get a lawyer off, but they will, every time. (If the lawyer just tried a similar case, then they'd get to use *for cause*.)\n\nThe real reason that the lawyer from one side or the other definitely wants a lawyer off is that the jury instructions presented by each side to the judge are crafted in a way that each word carries specific meaning and, with that, is designed to lead to a certain way of thinking. Once the lawyers have fought over the instructions and the judge decides what will be presented, the jury only gets them in writing...in some states not even in writing, they only get them read to them without a copy to take back to the room.\n\nIf a lawyer is in the jury, that person will undoubtedly be able to explain exactly what the law requires for a finding, or exactly why a certain finding should be had. They will advocate one way or another; this is undeniable. The instructions are purposefully confusing. The reason is this: when we fight over jury instruction, inherently, one of us will want an instruction that is hard to understand, for a lay person. This is because we want them to apply the law as it is commonly (mis)understood, not as it truly is, because that's not good for our case. \n\nTo have a lawyer on the jury would defeat the finely crafted instruction and its potential to confuse. They would undoubtedly explain the instruction to the jury. One may think this would be helpful, however, juries are told that any special knowledge they have about anything pertaining to the case shall not be shared as it could sway the jury. This is most true when it comes to a lawyer sitting. When a jury doesn't understand a jury instruction, their *only* recourse is to send a question to the judge. In states where they have the instruction in writing, all he can say is \"read carefully;\" he cannot give his interpretation of what the instruction means. If a judge did give his own interpretation that is grounds for a mistrial or an appeal at least. A lawyer on the jury would be able to explain, \"Oh, what this really means is X,\" and this is bad from one side's perspective, almost always. We all have biases, and even finely determined rules of law can be subtly pushed toward one direction or another with the use of a certain word over another, or the placement of one element before another. \n\nGenerally, unless the side who would most want the attorney off had exhausted their preemptory strikes, and lost the argument to remove for cause, there is very little chance a lawyer will serve. The fact of the matter is that both sides are very likely to want a lawyer stricken from the jury pool, (even from the side who may believe the lawyer to have leanings in their favor). It is *essential* to control as many factors as possible in a jury trial, and an attorney on the panel is just a wild card. The potential always exists that if a lawyer ends up on the jury, they could explain the elements of the case to their fellow jurors, who may then not rely as fully upon the carefully crafted language in the instruction(s). This could backfire on either side when certain portions of the language used may be intentionally vague or difficult to parse though for someone who doesn't practice law.\n\nAnyone interested in the process of choosing and striking jurors (in the U.S.), through the process of *voir dire*, [this](http://www.rotlaw.com/legal-library/what-does-it-mean-to-strike-a-juror/) is a fairly comprehensive article on the topic."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A lawyer is called for jury duty in a complex civil case.

What is the MOST likely reason they would want to remove the lawyer-juror?\n\nA) The lawyer-juror might be biased based on their area of legal practice\nB) The lawyer-juror might not understand the jury instructions\nC) The lawyer-juror might explain the legal concepts to other jurors, potentially undermining carefully crafted jury instructions\nD) The lawyer-juror might be too critical of the attorneys' courtroom performance\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all options have some merit, C is the most accurate and comprehensive reason. The passage emphasizes that both sides in a trial carefully craft jury instructions, often intentionally making them complex or vague to suit their case strategy. A lawyer on the jury would likely be able to explain these instructions clearly to other jurors, potentially undermining the strategic ambiguity or complexity that the attorneys have built into the instructions.\n\nOption A is partially true, as the passage mentions this as a potential \"for cause\" strike reason, but it's not the primary concern and is often rejected by judges.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a lawyer would likely have a better understanding of jury instructions than a lay person.\n\nOption D, while possible, is not mentioned in the passage and is not as significant a concern as the explanation of legal concepts to other jurors.\n\nThe key issue is the potential for the lawyer-juror to become an unofficial authority in the jury room, explaining legal concepts and instructions in a way that could sway the jury's interpretation and decision-making process, which both sides typically want to control through their carefully worded instructions."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33127/is-sabrina-child-pornography", "docs_id": 33127, "title": "Is &quot;Sabrina&quot; child pornography?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many years ago I recall hearing (can't exactly remember where/when, but I believe it had to do with a then still very young Brooke Shields) that \"Child Pornography\" laws applied, even if the actor/actress was actually over 18, but the character was NOT.

Under [18 USC 2256](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256):\n\n> \u201cchild pornography\u201d means any visual depiction ...\u00a0indistinguishable\u00a0from that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\n\nBut the First Amendment limits its applicability in cases like *Sabrina*. In [Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/535/234), the Supreme Court held that the law violates free speech and was overbroad, with a lengthy discussion of the threats it posed to legitimate artistic works:\n\n> Under the CPPA, images are prohibited so long as the persons appear to be under 18 years of age. 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 2256(1\\). This is higher than the legal age for marriage in many States, as well as the age at which persons may consent to sexual relations. ... It is, of course, undeniable that some youths engage in sexual activity before the legal age, either on their own inclination or because they are victims of sexual abuse.\n> \n> \n> Both themes\\-teenage sexual activity and the sexual abuse of children\\-have inspired countless literary works. William Shakespeare created the most famous pair of teenage lovers, one of whom is just 13 years of age. See Romeo and Juliet, act I, sc. 2, 1\\. 9 (\"She hath not seen the change of fourteen years\"). In the drama, Shakespeare portrays the relationship as something splendid and innocent, but not juvenile. The work has inspired no less than 40 motion pictures, some of which suggest that the teenagers consummated their relationship.\u00a0E.\u00a0g., Romeo and Juliet (B. Luhrmann director, 1996\\). Shakespeare may not have written sexually explicit scenes for the Elizabethan audience, but were modern directors to adopt a less conventional approach, that fact alone would not compel the conclusion that the work was obscene.\n> \n> \n> Contemporary movies pursue similar themes. Last year's Academy Awards featured the movie, Traffic, which was nominated for Best Picture. See Predictable and Less So, the Academy Award Contenders, N. Y. Times, Feb. 14, 2001, p. Ell. The film portrays a teenager, identified as a 16year\\-old, who becomes addicted to drugs. The viewer sees the degradation of her addiction, which in the end leads her to a filthy room to trade sex for drugs. The year before, American Beauty won the Academy Award for Best Picture. See \"American Beauty\" Tops the Oscars, N. Y. Times, Mar. 27, 2000, p. El. In the course of the movie, a teenage girl engages in sexual relations with her teenage boyfriend, and another yields herself to the gratification of a middle\\-aged man. The film also contains a scene where, although the movie audience understands the act is not taking place, one character believes he is watching a teenage boy performing a sexual act on an older man.\n> \n> \n> Our society, like other cultures, has empathy and enduring fascination with the lives and destinies of the young. Art and literature express the vital interest we all have in the formative years we ourselves once knew, when wounds can be so grievous, disappointment so profound, and mistaken choices so tragic, but when moral acts and self\\-fulfillment are still in reach.\n> \n> \n> Whether or not the films we mention violate the CPPA, they explore themes within the wide sweep of the statute's prohibitions. If these films, or hundreds of others of lesser note that explore those subjects, contain a single graphic depiction of sexual activity within the statutory definition, the possessor of the film would be subject to severe punishment without inquiry into the work's redeeming value.\n> \n> \n> This is inconsistent with an essential First Amendment rule: The artistic merit of a work does not depend on the presence of a single explicit scene. See\u00a0Book\u00a0Named \"John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\" v.\u00a0Attorney General of Mass.,\u00a0383 U. S. 413, 419 (1966\\) (plurality opinion) (\"\\[T]he social value of the book can neither be weighed against nor canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness\"). Under\u00a0Miller,\u00a0the First Amendment requires that redeeming value be judged by considering the work as a whole. Where the scene is part of the narrative, the work itself does not for this reason become obscene, even though the scene in isolation might be offensive. See\u00a0Kois\u00a0v.\u00a0Wisconsin,\u00a0408 U. S. 229, 231 (1972\\)\u00a0(per curiam}.\u00a0\n> \n> \n> For this reason, and the others we have noted, the CPP A cannot be read to prohibit obscenity, because it lacks the required link between its prohibitions and the affront to community standards prohibited by the definition of obscenity.\n\nIf the law were applicable to *Sabrina*, the fact that it's streamed wouldn't save it. [18 USC 2252A](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252A) prohibits knowingly receiving, distributing, reproducing, advertising, promoting or presenting child pornography, \"by any means, including by\u00a0computer.\""}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Under current U.S. federal law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal definition and treatment of \"child pornography\" in artistic works?\n\nA) Any depiction of a character under 18 in a sexual situation is automatically considered child pornography, regardless of the actor's age or the work's artistic merit.\n\nB) Streaming services are exempt from child pornography laws due to their digital distribution method.\n\nC) The law prohibits visual depictions indistinguishable from minors in sexual situations, but First Amendment protections limit its application to legitimate artistic works.\n\nD) Only works featuring actual minors in sexual situations can be considered child pornography, regardless of the portrayed character's age.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the federal definition of child pornography includes visual depictions \"indistinguishable from that of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct,\" the Supreme Court ruling in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition established that this broad definition could violate First Amendment rights when applied to legitimate artistic works. The Court emphasized that the artistic merit of a work should be judged as a whole, not based on isolated scenes. This ruling provides protection for works like movies or TV shows that may depict underage characters in sexual situations, as long as they have artistic or literary value and do not involve actual minors in their production.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for First Amendment protections and artistic merit considerations. Option B is false; streaming services are not exempt from these laws.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The insurance company can legally deny the claim as long as any amount of alcohol was detected in the driver's system.\n\nB) The insurance company cannot deny the claim based on the driver's BAC if it was below the legal limit, as per Wisconsin Statute 632.32(6)(b).\n\nC) The insurance company can deny the claim only if the driver's BAC was exactly at the legal limit.\n\nD) The insurance company must pay the claim regardless of the driver's BAC, even if it was above the legal limit.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Wisconsin Statute 632.32(6)(b), insurance policies cannot exclude coverage for \"Any use of the motor vehicle for unlawful purposes, or for transportation of liquor in violation of law, or while the driver is under the influence of an intoxicant.\" Since the driver's BAC was below the legal limit, they were not considered to be \"under the influence\" as defined by law. Therefore, the insurance company cannot deny the claim based solely on the presence of alcohol in the driver's system if it was below the legal limit. Options A, C, and D are incorrect as they either misinterpret the law or make assumptions not supported by the given statute."}}
