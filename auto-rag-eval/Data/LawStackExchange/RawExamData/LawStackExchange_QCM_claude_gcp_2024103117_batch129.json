The reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case, which call for an overall assessment (Boddaert v. Belgium, 1992, \u00a7 36\\). Where certain stages of the proceedings are in themselves conducted at an acceptable speed, the total length of the proceedings may nevertheless exceed a \u201creasonable time\u201d (Dobbertin v. France, 1993, \u00a7 44\\).\n> 332. Article 6 requires judicial proceedings to be expeditious, but it also lays down the more general principle of the proper administration of justice. A fair balance has to be struck between the various aspects of this fundamental requirement (Boddaert v. Belgium,1922, \u00a7 39\\).\n\nThe court gives criteria which you can read for yourself but I will reproduce their examples from actual cases:\n\n> **a. Reasonable time exceeded**\n> \n> \n> * 9 years and 7 months, without any particular complexity other than the number of people involved (35\\), despite the measures taken by the authorities to deal with the court\u2019s exceptional workload following a period of rioting (Milasi v. Italy, 1987, \u00a7\u00a7 14\\-20\\).\n> * 13 years and 4 months, political troubles in the region and excessive workload for the courts, efforts by the State to improve the courts\u2019 working conditions not having begun until years later (Baggetta v. Italy, 1987, \u00a7\u00a7 20\\-25\\).\n> * 5 years, 5 months and 18 days, including 33 months between delivery of the judgment and production of the full written version by the judge responsible, without any adequate disciplinary measures being taken (B. v. Austria, 1990, \u00a7\u00a7 48\\-55\\).\n> * 5 years and 11 months, complexity of case on account of the number of people to be questioned and the technical nature of the documents for examination in a case of\n> aggravated misappropriation, although this could not justify an investigation that had taken five years and two months; also, a number of periods of inactivity attributable to the authorities. Thus, while the length of the trial phase appeared reasonable, the investigation could not be said to have been conducted diligently (Rouille v. France, 2004, \u00a7 29\\).\n> * 12 years, 7 months and 10 days, without any particular complexity or any tactics by the applicant to delay the proceedings, but including a period of two years and more than nine months between the lodging of the application with the administrative court and the receipt of the tax authorities\u2019 initial pleadings (Clinique Mozart SARL v. France, 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 34\\-36\\).\n> \n> \n> **b. Reasonable time not exceeded**\n> \n> \n> * 5 years and 2 months, complexity of connected cases of fraud and fraudulent bankruptcy, with innumerable requests and appeals by the applicant not merely for his release, but also challenging most of the judges concerned and seeking the transfer of the proceedings to different jurisdictions (Ringeisen v. Austria, 1971, \u00a7 110\\)\n> * 7 years and 4 months: the fact that more than seven years had already elapsed since the laying of charges without their having been determined in a judgment convicting or acquitting the accused certainly indicated an exceptionally long period which in most cases should be regarded as in excess of what was reasonable; moreover, for 15 months the judge had not questioned any of the numerous co\\-accused or any witnesses or carried out any other duties; however, the case had been especially complex (number of charges and persons involved, international dimension entailing particular difficulties in enforcing requests for judicial assistance abroad etc.) (Neumeister v. Austria, 1968, \u00a7 21\\).\n> * Little less than four years and ten months at two levels of jurisdiction concerning the constitutional redress proceedings involving complex and novel issues of law with an international element (Shorazova v. Malta, 2022, \u00a7\u00a7 136\\-139\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a complex international fraud case involving multiple defendants and extensive cross-border evidence gathering, the trial has been ongoing for 6 years and 8 months. Based on the European Court of Human Rights' interpretation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which of the following statements is most likely to be correct?\n\nA) The trial duration automatically violates Article 6 because it exceeds 5 years.\nB) The trial duration is likely to be considered reasonable given the complexity of the case and its international nature.\nC) The trial duration violates Article 6 unless the court can prove that every single day was actively used for proceedings.\nD) The trial duration is irrelevant to Article 6 as long as the verdict is fair.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The European Court of Human Rights does not set a specific time limit for trials to be considered \"speedy\" or \"within a reasonable time\" under Article 6. Instead, it assesses each case based on its particular circumstances, considering factors such as the complexity of the case, the conduct of the parties, and the nature of the proceedings.\n\nIn this scenario, the case is described as complex, involving international fraud with multiple defendants and cross-border evidence gathering. These factors align with cases where the Court has found longer durations to be reasonable, such as the Ringeisen v. Austria case (5 years and 2 months) and the Neumeister v. Austria case (7 years and 4 months). Both of these cases involved complex fraud charges and international elements, similar to the scenario presented.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no automatic violation based on a specific time threshold. Option C is too extreme and doesn't reflect the Court's nuanced approach. Option D is incorrect because the duration is indeed relevant to Article 6, even though it's not the only factor considered.\n\nTherefore, given the complexity and international nature of the case, a duration of 6 years and 8 months is likely to be considered reasonable under the Court's interpretations of Article 6."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43457/gdpr-information-and-consent", "docs_id": 43457, "title": "GDPR Information and consent", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am building a game that stores score/level on the local device and uses non\\-personalized AdMob.\n\nDo I need to inform the user about storing the score locally?\n\nDo I need consent for using non\\-personal AdMob?\n\nDo I need to ask for the age?

Thus, the law \"*if you rape a free woman, you have to pay 10 staters*\" only contains a hypothesis and a sanction. The disposition is implicit, i.e., implied by whether or not the accused person is sanctioned.\n\nBy contrast, some portions of ancient laws do contain a\\[n explicit] disposition. As an example, consider rules 11 and 12 of the [Code of Hammurabi](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp).

It's not explicitly stated but is implied by whether or not the sanction is applied.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law doesn't explicitly contain all three parts. Option B is incorrect because it misidentifies the sanction as a disposition. Option D is incorrect because it omits the hypothesis, which is clearly present in the first part of the law.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the classical legal scheme's components and their application to ancient laws, as well as the ability to identify implicit elements in legal structures."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8283/is-it-a-websites-discretion-to-cancel-and-refund-an-order-after-it-was-shipped", "docs_id": 8283, "title": "Is it a website&#39;s discretion to cancel and refund an order after it was shipped?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a customer places an order on a website, later decides to cancel the order, but the website ships the order, is it the website's discretion whether or not to refund the customer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Depends on the circumstance, however, if it is a typical sales website the common law position is that a contract is formed when they accept your offer \\- either by acknowledging acceptance in an email or dispatching the goods; at that point both parties are legally bound.\n\nThe actual terms of the contract May and probably will deal with returns and refunds but generally you do not have a common or statute law right to return goods unless they are faulty.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer places an order for a non-faulty item on an e-commerce website.

But while there, on a sudden whim, you decide to smash a flower pot that you see in the living room.\n\nThis time the trespass was not for the purpose of committing the additional crime, but still the additional crime happened and would not have been possible without the trespass.\n\nIs it burglary then?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We need a jurisdiction, because burglary is a statutory crime. Since this is a residence, in Washington, under [RCW 9A.52\\.025(1\\)](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.52&full=true#9A.52.025), the trespasser might have committed residential burglary:\n\n> A person is guilty of residential burglary if, with intent to commit a\n>  crime against a person or property therein, the person enters or\n>  remains unlawfully in a dwelling other than a vehicle.\n\nWhile other states may have a provision requiring intent to commit a felony, or intent to commit a crime other than trespassing, the Washington statute does not say \"felony\" or \"other than trespassing\". A person can enter unlawfully by accident, or with no intention to be there unlawfully, in which case the person committed the act without the requisite criminal intent. If a person intends to enter but not remain, and they enter, they have committed the misdemeanor of trespassing. The question of whether unlawful entering with the intent to unlawfully remain satisfies the \"intent to commit a crime\" called for in the Washington statute has not been directly addressed in case law, as far as I know.\n\nWhile the state generally shoulders the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the crime, in Washington, under [RCW 9A.52\\.040](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.52&full=true#9A.52.040), the accused may bear the burden of disproving intent (this is a permissive inference on the fact\\-finder's part):\n\n> In any prosecution for burglary, any person who enters or remains\n>  unlawfully in a building may be inferred to have acted with intent to\n>  commit a crime against a person or property therein, unless such\n>  entering or remaining shall be explained by evidence satisfactory to\n>  the trier of fact to have been made without such criminal intent.\n\nThis does not mean that the state shoulders no burden of proof regarding intent, according to [State v. Newton](https://www.courts.wa.gov/opinions/pdf/321541.unp.pdf):\n\n> A jury may, however, infer the defendant's specific criminal \n>  intent from his or her conduct if it is not \"'patently \n>  equivocal'\" and instead 'plainly indicates such intent as a matter of logical probability'\n\nIn this instance, the burglary conviction was overturned because \n\n> no evidence shows his intent was anything other than to show\n>  her she could walk\n\nThe relevant fact is that the accused was under the influence of PCP, and believed that God had told him that his disabled mother could walk, and he broke into the residence to tell her this.\n\nPursuant to [State v. Bergeron](http://law.justia.com/cases/washington/supreme-court/1985/50960-3-1.html) where the conviction for attempted burglary was upheld, the court held that\n\n> The intent to commit a specific named crime inside the burglarized\n>  premises is not an \"element\" of the crime of burglary in the State of\n>  Washington...\n>  The intent required by our burglary statutes is simply the intent to\n>  commit any crime against a person or property inside the burglarized\n>  premises\n\nThe court observed in this case that \"there is absolutely no evidence in the record to prove what specific crime it was the defendant intended to commit inside\". \n\nWhat distinguishes Bergeron from Newton (the latter, not precedential, citing the former) is that there was a good case that Bergeron had an intent to commit *some* crime, though not a specific identifiable crime; but for Newton, there was no evidence that defendant intended to commit any crime whatsoever, even remaining unlawfully. In the hypothetical instance, the fact that the criminal smashed a vase is evidence of an intent to commit a crime (destruction of property). It's unlikely that a mere assertion \"I just did that on the spur of the moment\" would carry any weight. If the circumstances make it more likely that he entered intending to do something wrong, such as vandalism, the elements of burglary are present/\n\nIf the defendant claims some innocent reason for trespassing, such as escaping a riot, he may avail himself of a defense (RCW 9a.52\\.090\\) that\n\n> The actor reasonably believed that the owner of the premises, or other\n>  person empowered to license access thereto, would have licensed him or\n>  her to enter or remain\n\nIf there is no evidence of a riot, such a defense is not credible.

Under Washington state law (RCW 9A.52.025(1)), residential burglary occurs when a person \"enters or remains unlawfully in a dwelling\" with \"intent to commit a crime against a person or property therein.\" The law doesn't require the intent to be present at the time of entry, nor does it need to be a specific crime.\n\nFurthermore, RCW 9A.52.040 allows for an inference of criminal intent when someone enters or remains unlawfully, unless explained otherwise. The act of smashing the vase provides evidence of criminal intent, making it difficult for the defendant to argue lack of intent.\n\nThe case of State v. Bergeron supports that the specific crime intended doesn't need to be proven, just that there was intent to commit some crime. The impulsive act of vandalism would likely be seen as sufficient evidence of this intent.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they underestimate the seriousness of the charge under Washington law. Option B is incorrect because while the defendant could try to argue lack of initial intent, the prosecution's case would still be strong given the circumstances and the law's allowance for inferring intent."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73912/construction-may-vs-shall", "docs_id": 73912, "title": "Construction: may vs shall", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Context:a Florida HOA bylaws indicate:\n\nThe passage below indicates `may`:\n\n> Special meetings of the Board `may` be called by the president on\n> five(5\\)days notice to each Director either personally or by mail ,\n> facsimile transmission or electronic mail.

That person is supposed to settle the decedent's debts, and divide the remainder equally among the siblings. It is virtually guaranteed that the mortgage\\-holder will get their share \u2013 you can't just sell a house with a mortgage and run. In the meantime, the estate has to keep paying the mortgage and property taxes.\n\nThe executor has wide latitude to dispose of the estate, and clearing out personal possessions is a necessary part of liquidating the estate. Those possessions being part of the estate, they \"count\", therefore that mink coat worth $10,000 can't just be \"taken\" by the executor in order to tidy things up. But that broken weed\\-eater worth $1 can just be thrown away and not stored for some months, waiting for the final reckoning. The executor is entitled to compensation for his work and reimbursement for his expenses, so nickle and diming the small possessions is probably economically counterproductive. The executor has the legal power to determine how the legally required distribution is carried out, that is, the law doesn't require a majority vote of the heirs in order to dispose of each and every item of property.\n\nIf there is an actual legal dispute, if you believe that the executor is improperly carrying out the job, you can hire a lawyer to have him removed, or otherwise put pressure on him to get a change in how things are. This will probably cost you more than you might get from the estate. It *is* possible that the real estate market will not support the current sale price and therefore a lower asking price is necessary (i.e. the executor needs a reality check).

However, it's noted that this legal action will likely cost more than what might be gained from the estate. This aligns with option C, which accurately reflects the potential for legal recourse while acknowledging its potential cost.

Obviously the best thing would be for the parents to work it out among themselves, but what would the law say if they cannot?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Either party can petition the appropriate court for an adjudication of paternity (if this has not already been established in connection with the issuance of the birth certificate), and for a parental responsibility and child support order, at any time, if no such order is in place (assuming that Pennsylvania is the \"home state\" of the child and venue is proper).\n\nChild custody and visitation rights are determined based upon the \"best interests of the child\" with very little other formal guidance from the statute or even case law which also affords a judge very broad, although not unlimited discretion in resolving the issue if the parents don't reach an agreement. Any parent who is not adjudicated to be \"unfit\" (whose parental rights would then be terminated), is entitled to some reasonable visitation under the circumstances at a minimum. In practice, courts tend to prefer to enter an order that preserves the pre\\-litigation status quo is one was established for any reasonable length of time.\n\nOnce a custody and visitation schedule are established (logically, this is actually done contemporaneously), a child support award is also entered based upon the number of nights per year that the child spends with each parent, the income of each parent, and the extraordinary expenses, if any of the child, pursuant to guidelines that exist under state law but are federally mandated. Generally speaking, child support payments are quite small relative to the incomes of the parties. If a parent is willfully refusing to work or underemployed so as to reduce child support, in some circumstances, income that could have been earned is imputed to that parent for purposes of determining the appropriate amount of child support.\n\nThere is a small body of civil procedure that goes to the nitty gritty of how this is handled after a petition is filed, but that really goes beyond the scope of the question.\n\nIn the simplest case, only the two parents are involved in the litigation. \n\nBut, there are circumstances in which there can be other parties. For example, if the child has been supported by welfare, a representative of the state is a party to make sure that child support is paid reducing the need for welfare payments or repaying welfare payments already made by the state. Guardians of an un\\-empancipated minor or disabled parent might participate. Grandparents can sometimes have standing to participate. A non\\-parent who has physical custody of the child would usually have standing to participate. This all gets a little technical, and since the question doesn't suggest any facts that would call for additional parties, I will leave it at that.\n\nIn the event of a substantial change of circumstances after a statutory period after the last order was entered, a court may start over, more or less from scratch, and establish a modified child custody, visitation and child support order that reflects the changed circumstances.

In May, it was reported that [\"The \\[State] Department has searched for Mr. Pagliano\u2019s email pst file and has not located one that covers the time period of Secretary Clinton\u2019s tenure,\u201d](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/emails-found-hillary-clintons-senior-staffer-state-department/story?id=38989504)\n\nIn June 2016, it was reported that [Pagliano had filed a motion in seeking to keep the immunity agreement secret](https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2016/06/bryan-pagliano-hillary-clinton-emails-immunity-224015) in a case involving a Judicial Watch FOIA request. Later that month the judge the document should remain sealed \u201cbecause the government\u2019s criminal investigation through which Mr. Pagliano received limited immunity is ongoing and confidential.\u201d (Presumably Pagliano's deal was related to the FBI investigation into the private e\\-mail server he administered for and which Hillary Clinton used instead of official state department servers.)\n\nLater, on September 13 of 2016, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee [voted to send to send a contempt resolution](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/bryan-pagliano-contempt-house-panel-228520) to the full House for Pagliano's refusing to testify in a hearing. (Note: Pagliano's attorney indicated he would take the 5th in open session, but be willing to testify in closed session.) [Wikipedia's summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress) indicates that the full House never considered the resolution.\n\nCan Congressional Committees still compel Mr. Paliano's testimony? \n\nHas this situation been clarified in the subsequent 24\\+ months?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If someone testifying before congress refuses to respond to appropriate questions (questions within the scope of the congressional inquiry), that person can be cited for contempt of Congress. One way to avoid this is if the witness can invoke the [Fifth Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fifth_amendment) privilege against self\\-incrimination. That says that a person may not be compelled to be a witness against himself (or herself) in a criminal case, and has been interpreted to mean that if testimony **might** in future be used against the witness in a criminal case, it cannot be required, even if the current occasion is not a criminal case.\n\nHowever, if a person has been granted immunity in a particular matter, no testimony can be used against the person in a criminal case on that matter, and so there is no Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify on that matter. This applies to testimony before a court as well as before Congress. The grant of immunity must be at least as comprehensive as the refusal to testify would have been, or the privilege remains.\n\nTherefore, if a person has been granted immunity on a subject, that person cannot refuse to testify before Congress by invoking the Fifth Amendment. If the person does refuse, s/he can be cited for contempt of Congress. However, the person can raise a claim that the inquiry was not a proper one, for example because the subject was not a proper one fo Congressional inquiry, or that the Committee was not properly authorized. If the court upholds such a claim, the person will not be convicted of contempt. Also, while Congress can issue a citation, the Justice Department is not required to prosecute the person, and may choose to let the issue drop. Or the court might not convict on some other ground. And of course Congress (or one house of it) has to vote to issue the citation, which it might decide not to do, for political reasons, or indeed for any reason at all.\n\nSo a grant of immunity alone is not enough to say that testimony will be compelled, but it is a significant step towards such compulsion.\n\nNote that under *Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n*, 378 U. S. 52 (1964\\), a state grant of immunity also bars Federal use of the compelled testimony or its fruits, and under [*Kastigar v. United States*, 406 U.S. 441 (1972\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/406/441/) a Federal grant of immunity bars state use of the compelled testimony or its fruits. See also [This *Justia* essay on \"the Power to Compel Testimony\"](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-05/08-power-to-compel-testimony-and-disclosure.html) which covers the whole subject with multiple case citations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A congressional committee is investigating a matter for which a witness, Mr. Smith, has been granted federal immunity.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Mr. Smith can still invoke his Fifth Amendment right because congressional committees are not bound by federal immunity grants.\n\nB) The congressional committee cannot compel Mr. Smith's testimony without a separate grant of immunity from Congress itself.\n\nC) Mr. Smith can be cited for contempt of Congress if he continues to refuse to testify, but the Justice Department has discretion on whether to prosecute.\n\nD) The grant of federal immunity automatically nullifies Mr. Smith's Fifth Amendment rights for all future proceedings, including state-level investigations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement. When a witness has been granted immunity on a subject, they cannot refuse to testify before Congress by invoking the Fifth Amendment. If they do refuse, they can be cited for contempt of Congress. However, the Justice Department has discretion on whether to prosecute the contempt citation. This aligns with the information provided that while immunity removes the Fifth Amendment protection, other factors (such as the Justice Department's decision to prosecute) can affect whether testimony is ultimately compelled.\n\nOption A is incorrect because federal immunity grants do affect congressional testimony. Option B is wrong because a separate congressional immunity grant isn't necessary if federal immunity has been granted. Option D overstates the scope of immunity, as it doesn't automatically nullify Fifth Amendment rights for all future proceedings, especially at the state level (though it does have implications for both federal and state use of the testimony)."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84526/can-you-safely-do-anything-without-infringing-patents", "docs_id": 84526, "title": "Can you safely do anything without infringing patents?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It seems like anything non\\-obvious can be patented, and even private use of patented processes is illegal.

How can the court refuse to admit evidence, especially if it's the only useful evidence existing? And if yes, then why is this so and where is this practice useful?\n\n---\n\n#### Some examples from the top of my head\n\nThe example question above deals with unlawful searches. Imagine that a police officer decided to search a car (or an apartment) and forcefully did so against the protests of the owner (or maybe the owner wasn't even present). They thought they might find drugs or something, but instead they are surprised to discover a dead body, clearly murdered. So... now what? According to the above question, since the search was illegal, this is inadmissible evidence in the court. Does that mean that the owner of the car/apartment gets to go away scott\\-free? Do they launch a new investigation and try to find other evidence *except* the fact that it was inside the property of this guy here (and failing to do that, release them)? If the owner of the car/apartment says \"I don't know what you're talking about, I last saw Jimmy here alive and well at the pub last night; I never seen his corpse before.\" \\- can they call him out on the obvious lie?\n\nOr, another example. I don't know about USA, but here in Europe it's illegal to record someone's phone calls without a warrant (or something like that; it's serious). Any recordings obtained unlawfully will be inadmissible as evidence.\n\nLet's now imagine that I've gone the full extra mile and have secretly bugged everything in my neighbour's house because I suspect (but have no evidence) that they murdered my child last month. I've got hidden cameras, microphones everywhere, etc. So one day I catch him talking to his spouse on the phone and mentioning the murder, admitting to doing it, and even telling where he buried the body.\n\nNow I have evidence... or do I? I give the recording to the police, they search the indicated place and they do find the body, but since they cannot accept my recording as evidence... does that mean that my neighbour now has no consequences? Let's also suppose that no other evidence is found that would indicate his guilt (the guy was thorough). Obviously I'd get some grief for bugging my neighbour's house, but do I now also become the prime suspect in the murder of my own child? After all \\- the recording of my neighbour's confession \"officially doesn't exist\", and I'm the one who told the police where to dig, so...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Different exclusionary rules have different reasons.\n\nHearsay is frequently inadmissible because it's less reliable for the court to hear Alice saying \"Bob told me that Carol hit him\" than to hear Bob saying \"Carol hit me.\" Another even more critical problem with hearsay testimony is that the defense cannot cross examine the person who made the statement in court. If Bob is there, the defense can ask questions such as \"where did Carol hit you\" and \"did Carol use her right or left hand\" to clarify the testimony or call its veracity into question. Alice, not having been a direct witness to the act, will not be able to respond to many of these questions.\n\n[united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nEvidence obtained in violation of a constitutional right is inadmissible because admitting it amounts to allowing police or prosecutors to violate people's constitutional rights in order to obtain convictions. Not only does an unconstitutional search itself violate the rights of the person being searched, but so does the use of evidence acquired in such a search.

However, this evidence was obtained through an illegal search conducted by law enforcement without a warrant. Which of the following best describes how a U.S. court would likely handle this situation?\n\nA) The court would admit the evidence because it proves guilt, overriding concerns about how it was obtained.\n\nB) The court would exclude the evidence under the exclusionary rule, potentially allowing a guilty person to go free.\n\nC) The court would admit the evidence but issue a formal reprimand to the law enforcement officers involved.\n\nD) The court would allow the jury to decide whether to consider the illegally obtained evidence.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In the United States, evidence obtained through violation of a person's constitutional rights, such as an illegal search, is generally inadmissible in court under the exclusionary rule. This is based on the \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" doctrine, which holds that evidence derived from illegal actions by law enforcement cannot be used in court. The purpose of this rule is to deter law enforcement from violating constitutional rights in their pursuit of evidence. Even if the evidence clearly proves guilt, the court would likely exclude it if it was obtained through an illegal search. This can indeed result in guilty individuals going free, which is seen as a necessary trade-off to protect constitutional rights and deter police misconduct.

I would appreciate pointers on this area of legal finance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is she allowed to short the stocks of some company trading in this other metal, before she publishes her result ?\n\nGenerally speaking, yes. The main exceptions consist of her being under certain form of *fiduciary duty* toward the company of which she is shorting stock, or (2\\) her transactions being motivated by *superior knowledge* resembling *insider trading* or *fraud*.\n\nAbsent an element of fiduciary duty or insider trading, what you describe is an entirely valid *arms\\-length* transaction. Indeed, this happens all the time in financial markets, except that a lawful asymmetry of information may come in forms other than the scientific discovery of new metallic alloys (example: statistical models developed by the entity).\n\nSearching for case law containing the terms in italics will show you how these concepts *supposedly* are applied. For instance, see [*Procter \\& Gamble Co. v. Bankers Trust*, 925 F.Supp. 1270 (1996\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19962195925fsupp127012043):\n\n> No fiduciary relationship exists ... \\[where] the two parties were\n>  acting and contracting at arm's length. Moreover, courts have rejected\n>  the proposition that a fiduciary relationship can arise between\n>  parties to a business relationship.\n\n(citations omitted)\n\nYou will notice that the court in *Procter \\& Gamble* points to case law in the sense that a party's superior knowledge imposes on him a contractual duty to disclose that information. But the notion of *superior knowlege* as applied in case law seems typically narrowed down to situations where the seller conceals defects for which he is responsible ([*Haberman v. Greenspan*, 82 Misc.2d 263 (1975\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/197534582misc2d2631269)) or when the concealment resembles fraud. *Haberman* points to a case of fraud \n\n> where (1\\) the seller of a boat before the sale took it from where it\n>  lay and placed it afloat in a dock to prevent the examination of the\n>  bottom which the seller knew to be unsound \\[...]; and (2\\) where the\n>  seller of a log of mahogany turned it in order to conceal a hole\n\n(citations omitted).\n\nThat is different from the *superior knowledge* that a party obtains through the design of superseding techniques.\n\nIt would be extremely inept for a court to rule against a party for trading without first bringing everyone up to speed as to her superseding developments.

If the store knew about potential issues with their supplier but still made promises they couldn't keep, it could be considered fraud. However, if the store was genuinely unaware of the impending problems and made good-faith efforts to fulfill the order, it's less likely to be deemed fraudulent. Options A and B are too absolute in their claims. Option D incorrectly assumes that fraud charges can never apply to custom or pre-ordered goods, which is not universally true.

Rule 53 applies to criminal cases, not civil suits.\n\nOver time, [Rule 53 has been expanded](http://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/cameras-courts/history-cameras-courts). It has changed from merely \"photographs\" to include television and related cameras.\n\n[Furthermore](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/RL33706.pdf),\n\n> The Judicial Conference of the United States prohibits the televising, recording, and broadcasting of district trial (civil and criminal) court\n> proceedings. Under conference policy, each court of appeals may permit television and other electronic media coverage of its proceedings. Only two of the 13 courts of appeals, the Second and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals, have chosen to do so.\n\nSo courts have the ability to *choose* whether or not they want to have their proceedings broadcaster/televised. It is technically allowed in the Supreme Court by all other legislation . . . but the decision ultimately rests in the hands of the justices.\n\nIn the 109th Congress, [five bills](http://fas.org/sgp/crs/secrecy/RL33706.pdf) appeared that would change existing rules, at some level:\n\n* H.R. 1751\n* H.R. 2422\n* H.R. 4380\n* S. 829\n* S. 1768\n\nH.R. 4380 and S. 1768 would apply to the Supreme Court; the others would apply to federal district and appellate courts. Both bills would make television coverage is mandatory, unless the justices collectively vote against it. So, once more, the power rests in the hands of the Court.\n\nH.R. 4380 is [brief](http://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/4380/text), and would be merely an addendum to Chapter 45 of title 28, United States Code. S. 1768 is also [brief](http://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/1768/text), and would amend the same statute.\n\nTitle 28, in all its glory, can be found [here](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28) ([Chapter 45](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-III/chapter-45)).

There is a trade\\-off between different aspects of security, and the data controller could reasonably arrive at an unusual conclusion.

While GDPR doesn't have specific rules on password storage, it requires \"appropriate\" technical and organizational measures for data protection. Storing passwords in plain text is generally not considered best practice.

The title \"Postmaster\" without elaboration or further detail refers to the U.S. Postal Service official who is the top manager in charge of a particular post office, which could have just one or two employees in an rural area, or might have hundreds of employees in a particular post office in someplace like New York City.\n\nIt would be helpful to know why the person asking the question wants to know, in order to determine which position is really relevant and to make a more focused inquiry into that person's relevant duties, responsibilities, and authority.\n\nIn U.S. law it is frequently the case that issues that come up frequently are well defined, but that other issues which come up only infrequently if ever, have answers that are ill\\-defined, vague, or indeterminate. A \"top down\" approach of trying to find governing documents that provide a general answer to all possible questions is rarely a fruitful one.\n\nBased upon a previous closed question, it looks like the main reason question is [who has the authority to decide which houses get mail delivery](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91211/nys-what-documents-give-authority-to-postmasters-to-decide-which-houses-get-mai) and how decisions regarding this matter can be disputed.\n\nI don't know the answer to that question without research, but I suspect that the answer is a mix of regulations suggested by the Postmaster General and approved by the Board of Governors, in the Code of Federal Regulations, that are implemented by a local post office level postmaster for the region including that house or their regional supervisor, but I don't know that for a fact.\n\nIn that question you stated:\n\n> I assume that on the funding path, contacting our local NYS State\n> Assembly member would be the first stop, but this is all new territory\n> for me and I would appreciate any and all pointers as to how to go\n> about finding available funding to support the new mail routes.

Since the U.S. Postal Service is part of the federal government, rather than part of the state government, your New York State Assemblyman has absolutely no input or clout on this issue at all. The people you would need to contact would be your local member of the House of Representatives, and secondarily the two U.S. Senators for New York State.\n\nEach elected official in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate has staff members who are devoted to what is called \"constituent service\" which basically means helping ordinary people navigate the federal bureaucracy to meet their needs. If you were to contact one of these offices, you would be put in the touch with a constituent services staff member of that elected official who would help you figure out a solution to your problem, or would tell you that either as a matter of practical reality, or as a matter of that elected official's position on that particular issue, that the office won't be able to help you.\n\nConstituent services staff members contact the right person in the federal bureaucracy (in this case the right person in the U.S. Postal Service) to inquire, in what is known by employees within those federal government agencies as \"a Congressional\" which receives very high priority in the agency relative to ordinary citizen complaints and communications.\n\nAgencies that disregard Congressional inquiries routinely find their funding interrupted, appointments to their agency frozen, riders to legislation related to their agency specifically addressing the issue, and related follow up communications from the President at the request of a member of Congress when the President needs support from that member of Congress, none of which is something that the top officials in the agency want to deal with if it can be avoided in any way.\n\nContacting your local U.S. House member's office should probably be your first step.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A resident of a small village in New York State is concerned about mail delivery to certain houses in their area.

Co. v. Stout*, 84 U.S. 657\\. As I understand it, In general, if a person is injured while trespassing on someone\u2019s property then, unless the injury is due to some specific fault of the landowner, the landowner isn\u2019t liable. After all, if someone trespasses on your property, you shouldn\u2019t be liable for poor judgment exercised by the trespasser, especially since he shouldn\u2019t have been trespassing in the first place. But *Stout* created an exception to this, initially termed the \u201cturntable doctrine\u201d (named after the piece of railroad machinery that that the child Stout was playing on when injured). The idea was that young children are a special case requiring a higher duty of care.\n\n*Stout* was cited soon after in a similar turntable case, *Keffe v. Milwaukee \\& St. Paul Railroad Co.*, 21 Minn. 207 (1875\\). The term \u201cattractive nuisance doctrine\u201d originated in *Keffe*, which explained the attractiveness concept thus:\n\n> To treat the plaintiff as a voluntary trespasser is to ignore the\n>  averments of the complaint, that the turn\\-table, which was situate\\[d]\n>  in a public (by which we understand an open, frequented) place, was,\n>  when left unfastened, very attractive, and, when put in motion by\n>  them, was dangerous to young children, by whom it could be easily put\n>  in motion, and many of whom were in the habit of going upon it to\n>  play. The turn\\-table, being thus attractive, presented to the natural\n>  instincts of young children a strong temptation; and such children,\n>  following, as they must be expected to follow, those natural\n>  instincts, were thus allured into a danger whose nature and extent\n>  they, being without judgment or discretion, could neither apprehend\n>  nor appreciate, and against which they could not protect themselves.\n>  The difference between the plaintiff's position and that of a\n>  voluntary trespasser, capable of using care, consists in this, that\n>  the plaintiff was induced to come upon the defendant's turn\\-table by\n>  the defendant's own conduct, and that, as to him, the turntable was a\n>  hidden danger, a trap.\n\nTwenty years later, the New York Court of Appeals discussed the turntable doctrine in *[Walsh v. F.R.R. Co.](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914cf45add7b049348205c4)*, 39 N.E. 1068 (NY 1895\\) and said *Stout* didn't apply in that case. Maybe I'm reading *Walsh* wrong, but it seems to me to be saying that *Stout* might apply in some cases, but it doesn't in that specific case.\n\nBut then *[Morse v. Buffalo Tank Corp](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3614924/morse-v-buffalo-tank-corp/)*., 19 N.E.2d 981, 280 N.Y. comes along in 1939 and says\n\n> The general rule which has prevailed since the well\\-known turntable\n>  case (*Walsh v. Fitchburg R.R. Co.*, 145 N.Y. 301\\) is that the so\\-called\n>  doctrine of attractive nuisance does not apply in New York, and that\n>  the only duty which an owner of land owes to a trespasser or bare\n>  licensee is to abstain from affirmative acts of negligence or not to\n>  injure intentionally such person.\n\nAnd from there to the present, supposedly New York doesn't follow the Attractive Nuisance Doctrine.\n\nHow can some states follow it and some others not? I've heard of circuit splits, but they can be resolved by a Supreme Court decision. In this situation, a Supreme Court decision already exists, so I don't see how there can be a circuit split on this.\n\n*(Reason for question: I am taking a paralegal class and one of the exercises asks the student to determine whether the attractive nuisance doctrine holds in the state where the student lives.)*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US Supreme Court only has jurisdiction in federal matters. So if someone is suing under federal law, or there is a constitutional question, the Supreme Court is the place to go for a definitive answer. \n\nHowever, states have their own laws. The Supreme Court cannot tell New York that it *must* apply the attractive nuisance doctrine, as it is neither a matter of federal law nor a constitutional matter. New York is free to make its own laws on the subject, and the New York courts are free to interpret those laws as they see fit. In fact, federal courts are required to defer to New York's interpretation if New York's laws apply to the case, even if the case is in federal court for some reason (like diversity of parties.)

Buffalo Tank Corp. in 1939. According to this ruling, New York only imposes a duty on property owners to abstain from affirmative acts of negligence or intentional injury towards trespassers or licensees. Therefore, unless the parents can prove the property owner intentionally injured the child or committed affirmative acts of negligence, the property owner is unlikely to be held liable. Option A is incorrect because New York doesn't follow the doctrine from R.R. Co. v. Stout.

Sweet*, [2018 BCSC 1696](https://canlii.ca/t/hvc04#par129), citing *R. v. J.A.*, [2011 SCC 28](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1). \"The definition of consent for sexual assault requires the complainant to provide actual active consent throughout every phase of the sexual activity. It is not possible for an unconscious person to satisfy this requirement, even if she expresses her consent in advance.\" *R. v. J.A.*, [para. 66](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1#par66).\n\nThe Supreme Court has explicitly declined to decide \"whether or in which circumstances individuals may consent to bodily harm during sexual activity\" (*R. v. J.A.*, [para. 21](https://canlii.ca/t/flkm1#par21)). However, in the context of a non\\-sport fist fight or brawl, one cannot consent to another intentionally applying force that causes serious hurt or non\\-trivial bodily harm: *R. v. Jobidon*, [\\[1991] 2 S.C.R. 714](https://canlii.ca/t/1fskj).1 And at the provincial appellate level, it has been held that \"consent is not a defence to a charge of sexual assault causing bodily harm in circumstances where the accused has deliberately inflicted pain or injury upon a person that gave rise to bodily harm\" (*R. v. Quashie* (2005\\), [198 C.C.C. (3d) 337](https://canlii.ca/t/1l3dd) (Ont. C.A.)).\n\nConsent would be irrelevant in a charge of criminal negligence or manslaughter, if the activities were to escalate this far (*R. c. Deschatelets*, [2013 QCCQ 1948, para. 175\\-77](https://canlii.ca/t/fwk0p#par175)).\n\nThe content of advance negotiations is not relevant to whether the complainant was consenting to the impugned conduct, however, it may be relevant as evidence of expectations about *how* consent would be communicated between the parties throughout the conduct. See *R. v. Barton*, [2019 SCC 33, para. 93](https://canlii.ca/t/j0fqj#par93) (citations omitted):\n\n> For example, in some cases, prior sexual activities may establish legitimate expectations about how consent is communicated between the parties, thereby shaping the accused\u2019s perception of communicated consent to the sexual activity in question at the time it occurred. American scholar Michelle Anderson puts it this way: \u201c\u2026 prior negotiations between the complainant and the defendant regarding the specific acts at issue or customs and practices about those acts should be admissible. These negotiations, customs, and practices between the parties reveal their legitimate expectations on the incident in question.\u201d These \u201cnegotiations\u201d would not, however, include an agreement involving broad advance consent to any and all manner of sexual activity. As I will explain, a belief that the complainant gave broad advance consent to sexual activity of an undefined scope will afford the accused no defence, as that belief is premised on a mistake of law, not fact.\n\nSee also *R. v.

If so, in my view, this passage suggests a corollary requirement to establish an alternative \u201csafe word\u201d or other mechanism to ensure that each party is also able to maintain their personal autonomy to put an end to unwanted sexual activity.\n\n### Application\n\nA contract cannot provide advance consent, therefore it is irrelevant as to proof of consent during the acts. However, advance agreements can (and several courts suggests *should*) set out the expectations about *how* consent will be communicated. Any evidence of such agreements would be relevant to establishing the defence of \"mistaken belief in communicated consent.\"\n\nNone of this would assist an accused in the circumstance where a court finds that any consent was vitiated because the accused deliberately inflicted pain or injury that gave rise to bodily harm (this position has not been confirmed by the Supreme Court).\n\nIf you are simply asking how to prove a fact in litigation, see [this Q\\&A](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/86826/46948).\n\n---\n\n1\\.

The law requires \"ongoing, conscious consent\" for sexual acts, which applies to BDSM activities. While advance consent alone is not sufficient, prior negotiations about how consent will be communicated are relevant in determining if consent was present during the acts.

Federal trademarks provide nationwide protection and are categorized by class numbers representing different industries or types of goods/services. Even if the app and manufacturing company are in different industries, there could still be a potential for trademark infringement if they fall under the same or similar trademark classes. Simply adding a letter to the name or relying on the fact that they're in different industries isn't sufficient to avoid potential legal issues.

Corresponding legislation has been enacted covering Scotland and Northern Ireland. Battery is the application of unlawful force, and as well as spitting, covers incidents of pushing and slapping. Spitting, if done deliberately, is seen as an assault. Common assault carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and/or a fine or community order. A prison sentence is generally reserved for cases where serious mental or physical injury was caused, and higher culpability is present.

In England and Wales, deliberately spitting on someone is classified as battery under the common assault category of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. It carries a maximum penalty of six months in prison and/or a fine or community order. The act of spitting is considered assault whether or not it makes contact with the victim, as established in the Misalati [2017] EWCA 2226 case. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, such acts are being treated more seriously due to the potential for disease transmission.

It did this by passing the [Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/17-18/4/contents).\n\nSection 1 of that Act also authorised the King to change his title by proclamation but it was understood (see [Hansard](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/lords/1927/mar/23/royal-and-parliamentary-titles-bill)) that he would not use the words *United Kingdom* in his title which became\n\n> George V. by the Grace of God of Great Britain, Ireland and the\n> British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith,\n> Emperor of India\n\nSubsequent British monarchs used a similar title and it was not until 1953 that the Queen changed her title to:\n\n> Elizabeth II. By the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great\n> Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and Territories\n> Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith\n\nso that her title contained *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*\n\nBefore 1953 sometimes treaties were entered into in the name of *Great Britain and Northern Ireland* ([example](http://foto.archivalware.co.uk/data/Library2/pdf/1937-TS0033.pdf)) sometimes in the name of the *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland* ([example](http://foto.archivalware.co.uk/data/Library2/pdf/1931-TS0012.pdf)) but as far as I can see *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland* is used consistently after 1953\\.\n\nSo my question is by what means and when did the title of the country itself change to *United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland*? Was it a precise event or did the country gradually come to be called that by frequently using that name in international relations?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The change in the *royal* title came about following the Imperial Conference of 1926, when the various governments of the Empire agreed that \"the group of self\\-governing communities composed of Great Britain and the Dominions\" were \"autonomous Communities ... equal in status\". The Conference declined to pursue developing any kind of Imperial Constitution, preferring instead to draw out a few specific consequences of that agreement. In [the Balfour Declaration](https://www.foundingdocs.gov.au/resources/transcripts/cth11_doc_1926.pdf), section IV(a) asks for legislation to change the King's title. There is also a longer discussion in V(a) about treaties, which affects the examples that you give in the question.\n\nBoth of your 1930 examples follow the recommendations in this Declaration.\n\n1. The convention on conflict of nationality laws is entered into by the King, with the governments of his realms separately represented and enumerated. It lists two plenipotentiaries \"For Great Britain and Northern Ireland\". The omission of \"the United Kingdom of\" is not material, much like talking about \"the Kingdom of Sweden\" versus just \"Sweden\".\n2. The agreement on Bulgarian financial obligations is between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and various other governments.\n\nThey both refer to Northern Ireland rather than Ireland but differ in form because they use the different structures of a treaty between sovereigns and an agreement between governments. As noted in the Declaration, prior usage was not always obvious to interpret, because of confusion about whether (say) Canada was meant to be bound by a treaty entered into in the name of the King of Great Britain. Likewise, [R v. Jameson \\[1896] 2 QB 425](http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs5/18962QB425.html) is an important case on extent of legislation to British possessions \\- in the past, it was not always explicit whether an Act was for the UK only, and this had to be deduced from context.\n\nIn debate on the 1927 Act in the Commons, the Home Secretary Sir William Joynson\\-Hicks (as he then was) [said](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1927/mar/09/royal-and-parliamentary-titles-bill):\n\n> It is clear that it is a misnomer to continue to talk of \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\" Quite obviously, since Southern Ireland has been granted Dominion Home Rule, there is no such thing as \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland,\" but there is still \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\" Consequently, after full consultation and interviews with the representatives of Northern Ireland, with the Government of Northern Ireland, it has been decided to ask the House to alter the title of Parliament\\- and to make it \"The Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\"\n\n[and](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1927/mar/15/clause-2-alteration-of-the-style-of):\n\n> Certain portions of Ireland have, as it were, slipped out of the United Kingdom, and we now call it the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but it is still the United Kingdom, and this is still the Thirty\\-fourth Parliament of the United Kingdom.\n\nIt is clear that he \\- on behalf of the government \\- saw the Act as sufficient to change anything *already defined in statute* which needed to be changed. (It was also debated whether the Great Seal needed to be renamed as well, etc.) The change to the name of the country did not need statutory authorization in contexts where the old name was not required by statute.\n\n* Diplomatic formulae are not statutory and so aren't mentioned here; the royal prerogative is already enough for the treaty language to be as envisaged going forward.\n* British passports also changed in 1927 to using \"United Kingdom of\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland\" in place of \"and Ireland\". At the time, passport issuing was entirely on the basis of the royal prerogative, without any legislative regime.\n* Various other official publications, like statistical reports, used the new name going forward.\n\nSome other provisions in the Declaration were given effect in the Statute of Westminster 1931\\. This should be seen as part of a continuing effort to let the legal situation follow the policy (Commonwealth nations are equal autonomous peers) which itself followed the facts on the ground (the UK government could no longer expect to rule them directly). So there was not precisely a \"flag day\" when the UK's name changed, but there was a process of recognizing that the name *ought* to change, some wrangling over *how*, and the fairly rapid *implementation* of the change in 1927, at least on the part of the UK government itself.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The process of changing the United Kingdom's name to include \"Northern Ireland\" involved multiple steps. Which of the following sequences most accurately represents the chronological order of events in this process?\n\nA) Imperial Conference agreement -> Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 -> Change in passport wording -> Statute of Westminster 1931 -> Queen Elizabeth II's title change in 1953\n\nB) Statute of Westminster 1931 -> Imperial Conference agreement -> Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 -> Queen Elizabeth II's title change in 1953 -> Change in passport wording\n\nC) Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 -> Imperial Conference agreement -> Change in passport wording -> Statute of Westminster 1931 -> Queen Elizabeth II's title change in 1953\n\nD) Imperial Conference agreement -> Statute of Westminster 1931 -> Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927 -> Change in passport wording -> Queen Elizabeth II's title change in 1953\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct chronological order is represented in option A. The Imperial Conference of 1926 first agreed on the need for change. This was followed by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, which officially changed the name of the Parliament. Passport wording was changed in the same year (1927) to reflect the new name. The Statute of Westminster 1931 further codified some provisions from the Imperial Conference. Finally, Queen Elizabeth II changed her title in 1953 to include \"United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\" This sequence accurately reflects the gradual process of implementing and formalizing the name change across different aspects of governance and representation."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86142/incorrectly-filing-a-civil-case", "docs_id": 86142, "title": "Incorrectly Filing a Civil Case", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What happens if a civil case is incorrectly filed? Is there recourse to request that the case be dropped and make the petitioner refile the case?\n\nFor example, in Indiana, a petition for a protective order must be accompanied with a statement by an affidavit, but it seems that judges often schedule a hearing for these petitions without such a statement. Can the respondent do anything if such a statement is not attached? If there is an affidavit, then isn't it the right that they should know their statement before the hearing?\n\nThe second example is about if there is obviously contradictory information in the filed case.
