Does Mexico have similar law?\n\nYes. Illegal entry into Mexico is illegal but, it is not a crime.\n\nThe form of the question suggest that the person asking it may not be familiar with the distinction between something being \"[illegal](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/illegal)\" and something being a \"[crime](https://www.lectlaw.com/def/c330.htm)\". The notion that they are the same is a common misconception.\n\n> If so, does anyone know of English translations?\n\nAn English translation of Mexico's immigration law can be found [here](https://www.albany.edu/%7Erk289758/documents/Ley_de_Migracion_en_Ingles.pdf).\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nIllegal entry into Mexico is illegal and has legally authorized consequences, although it is not a crime.\n\n### Civil Consequences For Immigration Law Violations In Mexico\n\nCivil detention of unlawful entrants into Mexico is authorized by Articles 99\\-105 of Mexico's [Migration Act of 2011](https://www.albany.edu/%7Erk289758/documents/Ley_de_Migracion_en_Ingles.pdf).\n\nDeportation is authorized by Articles 114\\-125\\.\n\nThere are civil fines for violating immigration laws in Mexico based on a multiple of the minimum wage, ranging from 20 days of minimum wage to 10,000 days of minimum wage, depending upon the offense and its severity (one day's minimum wage is [88\\.36 pesos](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/minimum-wages)). Articles 143\\-158\\. So fines range from 1767\\.2 pesos to 883,600 pesos for immigration violations. [Today's exchange rate](https://www.currency-calc.com/USD_MXN) is 19\\.4 pesos to $1\\. So, these fines range from $91 USD to $45,546 USD.\n\n### Immigration Related Crimes In Mexico\n\nImmigration crimes are found at Articles 159\\-162\\. According to the linked translation, these crimes are as follows:\n\n> Article 159\\. A term of eight to 16 years in prison and a fine ranging\n> from 5,000 to 15,000 days of the general minimum wage in effect in the\n> Federal District will be imposed upon an individual who:\n> \n> \n> I.

When the perpetrator or orchestrator is a public servant.\n> \n> \n> Article 161\\. A public servant who assists, conceals, or prompts any\n> person to violate the provisions of this Law in order to obtain a\n> direct or indirect profit in cash or in kind will be sentenced to a\n> term of four to eight years in prison and a fine ranging from 500 to\n> 1,000 days of the general minimum wage in effect in the Federal\n> District.\n> \n> \n> Article 162\\.

Illegal entry into Mexico, *per se*, even if it is intentional, while it is illegal and may justify civil immigration detention, deportation and/or a civil fine, is not a crime.\n\nOf course, one could conceivably commit other crimes in connection with the immigration process (e.g. assaulting a government official, forging official documents), but illegal entry into Mexico, *per se* is never a crime, unlike the situation in U.S. immigration law, where illegal entry is both illegal and also a crime in many (but not all) circumstances.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to Mexico's immigration laws, which of the following statements is correct regarding illegal entry into the country?\n\nA) Illegal entry into Mexico is both a civil violation and a criminal offense, punishable by imprisonment.\n\nB) Illegal entry into Mexico is neither illegal nor a crime, and carries no consequences.\n\nC) Illegal entry into Mexico is illegal but not a crime, and may result in civil detention, deportation, or fines.\n\nD) Illegal entry into Mexico is only a crime if the individual intends to stay permanently in the country.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, illegal entry into Mexico is indeed illegal, but it is not classified as a crime. The consequences for illegal entry may include civil detention (authorized by Articles 99-105 of Mexico's Migration Act of 2011), deportation (authorized by Articles 114-125), and civil fines ranging from 20 to 10,000 days of minimum wage (as per Articles 143-158). It's important to note that while these are legal consequences, they are civil in nature, not criminal. The document explicitly states that \"Illegal entry into Mexico is illegal but, it is not a crime.\" This distinguishes it from option A, which incorrectly states it's a criminal offense. Option B is incorrect as it claims there are no consequences, which is false.

Congress has the authority to modify these statutory specifications. The President, through Executive Orders, can specify additional details not covered by the statute, such as the precise arrangement of stars, as long as these details do not contradict the law set by Congress. This creates a system where both Congress and the President have roles in determining the flag's design, but with distinct areas of authority.

The author's copyright \\- as well as the design copyright, and any book company trademarks \\- does not change in any of those scenarios.\n\nCopyright around most of the world \\- read [Berne Convention (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) \\- says that copyright exists at the moment of creation of a work, i.e. a work that you say is \"100% yours\".

This makes sense to protect the president from interference and allows for flexibility.\n\nTo a European cursory observer, it seems that the immunity includes the Constitution. This is irritating.\n\nTechnically, the Constitution may be just another law, with just the same immunity. But I just can't get my head around it.\n\nIs the Constitution as a law special in any way?  \n\nIs the Constitution obligatory for the President of the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US President is indeed bound by the Constitution, and indeed by the ordinary laws. Current Justice Department policy is that a **sitting** president may not be indicted. No court has ever held this, the US Constitution does not give explicit presidential immunity the way it gives limited immunity to members of congress (in the \"speech and debate\" clause). No sitting US President has ever been charged with a crime, much less indicted, so the matter has never come before a court.\n\nAn old news story indicated that President Grant was stopped for a traffic offense (speeding, in a horse\\-drawn carriage), accompanied the officer to a police station, paid an appearance bond for the traffic court, and then failed to appear, forfeiting the bond. Even if this is accurate, no claim of presidential immunity was made, and no court decision was rendered. So no precedent was established by that event, one way or the other.\n\nAny President may be impeached and convicted, if Congress sees fit to do so. There is no enforceable standard on just what is and is not an impeachable offense. That is left to the sound judgement of Congress. Nor is Congress required to act if it chooses not to, no matter how strong the evidence may be.\n\nNixon's Vice President , [Spiro Agnew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiro_Agnew#Criminal_investigation_and_resignation), was investigated for alleged corrupt practices. It appeared that Maryland (where he had been Governor) was ready to indict him on several charges. He was persuaded to plead \"no contest\" in a plea bargain to a single count, and was sentenced to probation with no jail time. At the same time, he resigned as VP. No one knows what would have happened had he continued to insist on his innocence, and claimed before the court that a sitting VP could not lawfully be indicted (a claim he had made earlier in the process).\n\nEven assuming that a sitting President cannot be indicted or tried, nothing prevents such a person from being charged and perhaps convicted after his or her term has ended. The constitution explicitly says that if an official is impeached and removed from office, there may be a subsequent trial on any relevant charges.\n\n> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law. (Art I; section 3; clauses 6\\&7\\)\n\nWhether any statute of limitations would be tolled (paused) while the president was in office cannot be determined until and unless the matters comes before a court for a decision.\n\nNote that the US Constitution imposes few duties or obligations on individuals. it is mostly concerned with specifying he structure of the federal government, and the powers of and limitations on its various parts. It also specifies the relations between the Federal and State Governments. It also declares a number of rights held by individuals, most of which can be regarded as limitations on the power of the government. If the President were to be accused of a crime, it would almost surely be one established by statute, not by the constitution directly, because treason is the only crime defined directly by the constitution.\n\nHowever, the official acts of the president are clearly limited by the Constitution, and in a number of cases have been held void as being unconstitutional. One of the more famous cases is [*Youngstown Sheet and Tube vs Sawyer* 343 U.S. 579 (1952\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youngstown_Sheet_%26_Tube_Co._v._Sawyer), also known and the \"steel mills seizure case\". During the Korean War, President Truman attempted to take control of a number of steel mills to stop a labor dispute, on the ground that this was hindering the national defense.

Without evidence of illegal discrimination that court case will go nowhere. \n\nConsider that there are jobs where 100 people apply, and a dozen people are interviewed. Getting not hired three times, when 12 people got interviewed, is just normal. If the same 12 people were interviewed at each job, then you and eight others were rejected each time, because there were 12 good enough to be interviewed, but only one job. Not being hired three times is nothing. Maybe instead of thinking of lawsuits, you might think of some training to do better in interviews. \n\nSo not only do you not have any *evidence* of illegal discrimination, it's not even reasonably likely that there was illegal discrimination.

An intentional interaction occurs when the consumer intends to interact with the third party, via one or more deliberate interactions. Hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content does not constitute a consumer\u2019s intent to interact with a third party.\n\nRegulations\n-----------\n\nUnder the [CA AG's regulations implementing the CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/oal-sub-final-text-of-regs.pdf) A business must respond to a request to delete withing 45 days, which may be extend once for up to an additional 45 days. The business must indicate if it will comply, and if not, indicate the legal provision which permits or requires it to decline.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nCommunications sent from one user to another identifying the source user certainly fit the general definition of PI, as they are clearly associated with an identifiable person. However, under 1798\\.105 (4\\.1\\) a request may be declined to delete information which is needed to \"provide a good or service requested by the consumer\", or which is \"reasonably anticipated within the context of a business\u2019 ongoing business relationship with the consumer\" may be declined.\n\nIt seems to me that in sending a message to another user of the service, a user clearly \"requests\" the service to provide this info to the other user. Moreover, this seems to be an action that is \"reasonably anticipated. What is more, an argument could be made that the rights of the other user are impacted by any such deletion, although the CCPA, unlike the GDPR, does not require any balancing of the rights of others.\n\nThus I think a case can be made that a service provider such as Facebook need not delete messages sent by one user to another on a request by the sending user.\n\nBeyond this, the CCPA does not grant any private right of action for requests to delete. That is the user is nor permitted to directly sue the business for such violations. Only the California Attorney General has the authority to bring such suits under the CCPA as it now stands.\n\nI can find no reported litigation or enforcement action on the right to delete, much less on the right to delete in a fact pattern such as the question supposes.

Under the CCPA, a business must respond to a verifiable consumer request to delete personal information within 45 days, which can be extended once for an additional 45 days. However, the business may decline the request if it can justify retaining the information under specific exceptions provided in the CCPA, such as the need to \"provide a good or service requested by the consumer\" or to maintain information that is \"reasonably anticipated within the context of a business' ongoing business relationship with the consumer.\" In this case, the company could potentially argue that retaining the messages falls under these exceptions, as they were sent as part of the requested messaging service. The company must indicate whether it will comply with the deletion request or provide a legal justification for declining. Options A and B are incorrect because they don't accurately reflect the CCPA's nuanced approach to deletion requests.

That is the owner of the property can legally transfer ownership to someone else (by contract, deed, or gift).\n\nThis may require various degrees of formality: transfers of land must be in writing, transfers of motor vehicles usually require a change to a government register, transfers of a can of soft drink require no formality. Bills of landing serve to formalize the ownership of goods in transit and are so ubiquitous that the transfer of one is the transfer of the other. But that doesn\u2019t make them negotiable.\n\nFor normal goods, a person cannot pass on better title then they themselves possess. So, if I steal something or acquire it by fraud or otherwise dishonesty, I don\u2019t own it. If I sell it to you, you don\u2019t own it either even though you are a possessor in good faith (I, as the thief am a possessor in bad faith). The actual owner can recover the goods from whoever possesses them even if that person legitimately acquired them.\n\nNegotiable instruments are a special kind of transferable property where the mere possession of them (in good faith) makes you the owner of them. The most familiar type of negotiable property is cash. If I rob a bank and use that cash to legitimately buy something from you (and you don\u2019t know the cash is stolen) then you own the cash.

For example, a defendant may lodge an appeal against the judgment given by a trial judge. Where the court of appeal found in favour of the claimant, the defendant may ask another court to dismiss the case.\n\nIsn't one instance not enough? What is the rationale behind this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Overview**\n\nTrials and hearings before a judge aren't random, but they aren't terribly predictable either. The best empirical studies of high stakes felony jury trials suggest that the accuracy of a jury in a case that doesn't plea bargain is about 90%. They are right 90% of the time and wrong 10% of the time. The appeal process involving multiple instances exists primarily to correct these errors. If the first trial is 90% accurate and larger, more experienced panels are more likely to get it right, the likelihood of a correct result in 2\\-3 tries becomes more acceptable. (Easy cases settle.)\n\nBench trials (i.e. trials to a single trial court judge in common law systems) are just as final and probably not more or less accurate on average, but trade a more experienced fact finder who understands the process for the disadvantages of having only a single perspective on the facts from someone who doesn't have to persuade anyone else that he or she is right.\n\nThe appellate process in civil law systems is quite different and more likely to change the result than it is in common law systems, largely due to two factors: the need to preserve the jury trial right in common law systems and a much smaller number of judges in common law systems. Common law systems strive towards a get it right the first time or bust in one big event model, civil law systems creep towards a correct result bit by bit. Until the 1890s in the U.S., in federal criminal jury trials (and many state criminal trials), there were no direct appeals at all, only the equivalent of modern habeas corpus petitions.\n\n**Civil Law System Instances**\n\nIn civil law systems, a first instance judges will take testimony and documentary evidence and argument in a series of hearings (not necessarily in one continuous compact trial), recording the testimony with personal notes rather than a verbatim transcript, and applying law to fact on a piecemeal basis that narrows the scope of the proceeding as evidence and argument trickles in. This results in a court order which will become a final order unless appealed. In \"small\" case the first instance court may be one judge, in a more serious one it might be three judges. The first instance court looks primarily to statutes and legal treatises for legal guidance with case law precedents taking only a secondary role that is not strictly binding. Because testimony is delivered to a judge, there are few if any rules of evidence.\n\nThere is not a great analogy to this phase in most civil procedure systems today, but it is a lot like a preliminary hearing in a criminal case or a preliminary injunction hearing in a case where injunctive relief is the main remedy sought at trial, or a traverse of an attachment in a common law court system.\n\nIf either party thinks that there were serious errors of law or fact in the first instance judge's ruling that change the outcome, they can appeal the case to second instance court where hears any issues upon which there is an alleged error of law or fact de novo before a new, more senior and more numerous panel of judges (typically two more judges than in the first instance court). \n\nThe availability of de novo review in a second instance court makes trial preparation in the first instance court much less expensive than trial preparation in the U.S. or U.K. where any factual error in the first instance court is almost impossible to overturn on appeal and where there is no time to regroup if you are surprised in the first instance trial. So does the fact that in a civil law system you may be preparing for only a few witnesses at a time, rather than all of the witnesses and evidence back to back at once.\n\nSince most of the time the court correctly understands the evidence and there are no big surprises, and since the court narrows the issues over the course of the proceeding by applying law to each new set of facts, the amount of effort going into trial preparation and presenting evidence overall in a civil law system is often considerably less than in a common law system and these savings can often make up for more common and more time consuming appeals in civil law systems at the second instance.\n\nIn a civil law system, if the first instance court rules against you, but gets the case 90% right the first time around and no surprises come up in the trial, then you can proceed to a much narrower case in the second instance to get the 10% that the court got wrong the first time corrected without so many distractions and you have already seen your opponent's entire case, rather than having suffered an impossible to remedy fail.\n\nA second instance trial in a civil law system is somewhat analogous to a first trial following some motion practice that resolved many of the pending issues on dispositive motions in a common law system.\n\nLike the first instance court, the second instance court looks primarily to statutes and legal treatises for legal guidance with case law precedents taking only a secondary role that is not strictly binding except some rulings from the highest court.\n\nA third instance appeal in a civil law system is more or less comparable to a direct appeal in a common law system, where appellate issues are largely confined to disputes of law and the facts found by the second instance court (as well as the first instance court findings that were not disturbed on appeal to the second instance court) are taken as established (again, usually without a verbatim transcript based upon a written order of the second instance panel). This court often called a court of cassation (i.e. of ending a dispute) resolves disputed issues of law. Typically, a court of cassation or supreme court will have dozens or scores of judges who have subject matter specialties and hear cases only in smaller panels.\n\nNone of these courts has a power of judicial review, which is typically reserved for a constitutional court that is a separate small panel court not made up only of career judges.\n\nIn a civil law system, if the judge is found to have abused his or her discretion in the original trial in a manner that requires a retrial, another judge rehears the case.\n\n**Common Law System Appeals**\n\nIn the common law civil litigation process very few issues can be resolved prior to trial unless the relevant facts are undisputed and often not even then if substantial discretion is involved in a final decision.\n\nIn contrast, in a common law system, a single judge (often sitting with a jury of six to twelve jurors) decide facts in a trial from which a verbatim transcript is taken and reaches a verdict that can only be appealed if there is no evidence in the transcript and submitted exhibits that support a conclusion, or if there was a mistake of law or procedure (especially admission of evidence) in the proceedings that could have materially changed the outcome if decided correctly. There is no means by which factual errors or failure to respond to surprises can be remedied so preparation must consider every possibility no matter how remote. The trial is conducted all at once, typically in one to ten consecutive business days and all witnesses in the case must testify one after the other at this time. At trial, the judge carefully regulates what evidence is and is not permitted to be presented and instructs the jury regarding the law to apply to the facts and the issues for the jury to decide in its verdict. The trial verdict is final once the jury renders its verdict and appellate type issues raised with the original trial judge are rejected (or a retrial is granted on grounds similar to those upon which an appeal could be granted if a judge acknowledges making a serious mistake).\n\nIf either side thinks that there was an error, there is a right to a direct appeal to a panel of three judges that considers only the verbatim transcript of the trial, the exhibits admitted into evidence at trial, and legal arguments (typically no more than about three or four per party bringing an appeal). If the court of appeals panel on direct appeal finds an error of law or an abuse of discretion or a factual finding not supported by any evidence in the transcript and admitted exhibits, it will reverse the trial court, otherwise it will affirm. Jury verdicts are quite hard to overturn on appeal because they are upheld if any non\\-crazy jury could have reached that result even if they probably just screwed up.\n\nIn common law countries there are usually one or two more appeal available after a direct appeal (to a state supreme court and the U.S. Supreme Court in some cases), which strictly in the discretion of the state or U.S. Supreme Court with only a small percentage of cases even considered on this further appeal, and usually with just one or two novel or controversial issues of law raised at this point. Again, no new facts can be introduced or corrected on appeal.\n\nIn common law countries, if a trial court decision is overturned, the new trial will almost always be remanded to the same judge, even if the original trial verdict is overturned because the original judge abused his or her discretion in the original trial.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil law system, what is the primary difference between a first instance court and a second instance court?\n\nA) The first instance court uses a jury, while the second instance court does not.\nB) The second instance court allows for de novo review of both law and fact.\nC) The first instance court only considers statutory law, while the second instance court relies on case precedents.\nD) The second instance court uses a verbatim transcript of the first instance proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In a civil law system, the key difference between a first instance court and a second instance court is that the second instance court allows for de novo review of both law and fact.

The courts interpret the law in light of that purpose. If the police officer finds a solution that protects your rights while still carrying out the purpose of the statute, the court will be unlikely to fault him or her. In this case, if you tell the officer that there is a letter from your attorney in a particular folder, the obvious solution is for the officer not to open that folder.

They give a definition at the beginning of the document:\n\n> actual cash value means the cost of replacement with materials of similar kind and quality less depreciation. In determining depreciation we will consider the condition immediately before the damage, the resale value (if personal property), obsolescence and normal life expectancy.\n\nOk, that's vague. Depreciation is normally not applicable to fine art. Appreciation is usually more of a concept that would apply. Resale value can be extremely arbitrary and difficult to determine, much less agree upon. \"Obsolescence and normal life expectancy\" wouldn't apply. Worried that \"actual cash value\" means the material cost of the canvas and paint, I noted they have a specific Fine Art Endorsement further down the document, which I could purchase for a modest premium. It reads:\n\n> We insure fine art but only:\n> \n> \n> \u2022 items valued up to $5,000, for which you have provided us with a complete description, including the year and value of the items; and\n> \n> \n> \u2022 items valued over $5,000, for which you have provided us with an appraisal of market value within 30 days of the effective date of this Endorsement. The appraisal must have been completed within the past 3 years.\n\nWhich I originally figured meant that so long as I have paid for this endorsement, I could value the art however I wish (with or without an appraisal as outlined above) given the premium varies based on the value. But then the next paragraph adds this in:\n\n> ***If you have a claim:***\n> \n> \n> In the event of a claim insured by this endorsement we will pay the full cost of repair with materials of similar kind and quality, or replacement with a comparable article, whichever is less, without deduction for depreciation, up to the coverage limit for this endorsement on your Declaration. No deductible shall apply to this endorsement. However, we will not pay more than the actual cash value at the time of the loss:\n> \n> \n> \u2022 if repair or replacement is not complete as soon as reasonably possible and within one year following the date of loss; and\n> \n> \n> \u2022 for fine art which cannot be replaced with a comparable article.\n\nWait, what? That last bit brings us back to the situation we were at without the endorsement. The whole \"fine art, antiques, rare objects and other items which by their nature cannot be replaced with a comparable article\" bit.\n\nAm I correct that paying the premium for that endorsement would be useless?\n\n**Why all this concerns me**: I have several important (to me) pieces painted by relatively unknown artists. The cost of any given one was well under $5000, so appraisals don't apply but if I lost them I'd be out significantly. These artists are alive and, as far as I know, still actively painting... so if a piece were stolen, I'm sure I could commission a replacement. Is that cost the value with the endorsement? Without?\n\nPerhaps the answer is to insure them separately with a company that specializes in Fine Art Collections. But of course I'd rather not pay extra if my normal house insurance does cover it (at least with the endoresement).\n\nI called the company to ask. I thought the first person was just a trainee or something because all she did was regurgitate the policy wording verbatim. I asked to speak with someone \"higher up\" and that person didn't do much better. She was really vague and asked if I wanted the full policy sent to me. I assumed that would go into great detail, but it doesn't.\n\nI'm shocked, really, how loosy\\-goosy they are while they're collecting premiums. The whole point of having insurance is in case of an event that requires it... and that's when the details matters.\n\nThoughts and opinions on how things would go down if a piece gets stolen?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The practical answer is that the insurance is somewhat dependent on the reputation of the insurer. Legally, the verbiage of the contract applies: If you pay for the Fine Art endorsement, and you suffer a covered loss to a covered item under $5,000, they have three options to settle the claim within one year:\n\n1. Recover and repair the damaged item.\n2. Replace the item \"with a comparable article.\" If they are a reputable insurer, they *probably* won't offer you a replacement with which you aren't satisfied. But it's *possible* they would hand you a \"replacement\" that you don't think is comparable, and they think is comparable. At that point you get to start a negotiation, which can end up in court if neither side settles sooner.\n3. Pay you the \"actual cash value,\" **without deductible or depreciation**, which is determined by a claims adjuster based on whatever evidence you present and he can gather. Typically this would be the appraised value at time of loss (or the best approximation that can be made). Again, reputable companies don't stay in business by nickle\\-and\\-diming on claims. But it's *possible* you won't agree with their claim settlement, at which point you can appeal following whatever process is provided for in the insurance contract, and then to the courts if both sides want to fight.\n\nIs this endorsement worth it? If I read your excerpts correctly: Loss to irreplaceable objects under the base contract is \"actual cash value at the time of the loss....\" With the endorsement, if they can't recover, restore, or replace \"fine art, antiques, rare objects\" then they will pay you the actual cash value *without deductible*.\n\nI suspect you're missing some other relevant contract details: E.g., there are usually limits per loss event on all sorts of particular items. E.g., every standard HO policy I've looked at will, without an endorsement or individual scheduled coverage, limit to a defined amount (usually a few thousand dollars) payments for losses to categories like:\n\n* Bullion, cash, and negotiables\n* Firearms\n* Jewelry\n* Fine art\n\nThe endorsement probably also serves to lift that limit substantially.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An insurance policy holder has several pieces of fine art valued under $5000 each.

Additionally, it's likely that the endorsement increases the overall coverage limits for fine art, which are typically restricted in standard homeowner's policies.

Am I still expected to pay rent if he is living there?\n\nGenerally speaking, no. But you need to verify that your lease contains no language that overrides certain basic assumption about leases. My understanding is that (1\\) you delivered the property, and (2\\) the landlord was not entitled to live there during your tenancy.\n\nUsually one basic assumption in a lease is that *only the tenants and their beneficiaries/guests* (\"*tenants*\", for brevity) are entitled to use the property. It appears that the landlord is neither.\n\nYour delivery of the property enabled the landlord to reassign the tenant's exclusive right whenever the landlord deems it fit. The scenario of you finding someone to replace you in the lease is merely one alternative from which the landlord can make the *informed decision* to reassign that right.\n\nThe event of reassignment automatically releases you from subsequent payments related to your early move\\-out. Accordingly, the landlord's informed and willful reassignment (in this case, to himself) of the aforementioned exclusive right forfeits his entitlement to subsequent payments from you. This renders the \\[rest of the] lease voidable by you. In this regard, see [Restatement (Second) of Contracts](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/restatement-second-contracts.html) at \u00a7\u00a7 151 and 153(a).\n\nThere is also an issue of *fraud* and *quantum meruit* (see also *unjust enrichment*) insofar as the landlord benefited at your expense (in the form of your father's work on behalf of you) without informing you that reassignment had taken place already. The landlord knowingly and intentionally deprived you of the opportunity to decide whether to keep taking care of property about which you no longer had any obligation.\n\nI presume you already are mindful of this but I should still mention it: Make sure you can prove the landlord was actually *using* the property rather than inspecting/enhancing/managing it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant moves out of a rental property two months early but continues to pay rent as per the lease agreement.

When the landlord moves into the property without the tenant's knowledge or consent, it constitutes a reassignment of the tenant's exclusive right to use the property. This action by the landlord renders the remaining portion of the lease voidable by the tenant. The tenant is not responsible for rent payments from the time the landlord began occupying the property, as this action effectively releases the tenant from subsequent payments related to the early move-out. Additionally, the landlord's failure to inform the tenant about occupying the property while the tenant continued to maintain it (through lawn care) could be considered fraudulent behavior. It's important to note that the tenant should be able to prove the landlord was actually using the property rather than just inspecting or maintaining it."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28114/when-a-u-s-attorney-files-charges-does-this-mean-it-is-automatically-filed-on", "docs_id": 28114, "title": "When a U.S. Attorney files charges, does this mean it is automatically filed on behalf of the DoJ?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Background\n==========\n\nPiggy backing off the question about [two United State political bodies conducting an investigation](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/30719/how-would-a-trial-occur-if-two-political-bodies-investigate-the-same-crime?noredirect=1#comment112643_30719), someone made a comment that the a U.S. attorney is always part of the [DoJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice).

The flag means there has been some negative treatment.\n\nNegative treatment can mean lots of different things.

If the subsequent case cites the \"dirty\" part, it becomes \"dirty\" as well.\n\nAssuming the precedent used to decide the case was \"dirty,\" there's no automatic implication.

They are\n> offences under the common law, developed entirely by the law courts,\n> and therefore have no specific basis in statute.\n\nHowever, it seems that there is indeed a statute, [Offences against the Person Act 1861](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offences_Against_the_Person_Act_1861), currently in effect in England and partially in effect in Northern Ireland as well which makes homicide of the type covered in that series an offence.\n\nMy questions therefore are:\n\n1. Is my interepreation of the phrase *contrary to common law* correct in that it implies that the offence mentioned in the charges were common law offences and not statutory offences? If not then what does that phrase actually mean?\n2. Did the writers of that episode make an error or is it that homicide is indeed a common law offence and not a statutory offence?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It can be both\n--------------\n\nMany common law jurisdictions have codified common law crimes in statute. However, unless that (or another) statute abolished the common law crime then the statutory crime and the common law crime exist in parallel. You would need to look through all relevant statutes to see if the common law crime was abolished.\n\nFor an example, [s80AD](http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s80ad.html?context=1;query=Rape;mask_path=au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082) of the [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\") *Crimes Act 1900* says \u201cThe common law offences of rape\u00a0and attempted rape are abolished.\u201d", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In jurisdictions that have codified common law crimes into statute, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the relationship between common law and statutory offenses?\n\nA) Codification of a common law crime into statute automatically abolishes the common law offense.\n\nB) Common law and statutory offenses can coexist unless explicitly abolished by statute.\n\nC) Statutory offenses always take precedence over common law offenses when both exist.\n\nD) Common law offenses cease to exist once any criminal code is enacted in a jurisdiction.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. As explained in the passage, when common law crimes are codified into statute, both the statutory and common law versions of the offense can continue to exist in parallel, unless the statute (or another statute) explicitly abolishes the common law crime. This is illustrated by the example from New South Wales, where the Crimes Act 1900 specifically states that the common law offenses of rape and attempted rape are abolished. This implies that without such explicit abolition, both forms of the offense could coexist.\n\nOption A is incorrect because codification alone does not automatically abolish the common law offense. \n\nOption C is not supported by the information given and oversimplifies the relationship between statutory and common law offenses.\n\nOption D is too broad and incorrect, as the mere enactment of a criminal code does not necessarily eliminate all common law offenses."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86148/what-should-a-contract-contain-to-protect-an-employees-rights-to-work-on-unrelat", "docs_id": 86148, "title": "What should a contract contain to protect an employees rights to work on unrelated side projects in their free time", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A typical IP clause in an employment contract says that\nworks created *\"during the course of your employment\"* belong to your employer.\n\nThis is essentially [echoing the *\"work for hire\"*](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86128/why-do-employment-contracts-need-a-clause-to-cover-work-for-hire)  principle in UK employment law.\n\nThe notion of *during the course of your employment* looks to be [open to interpretation](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49396/in-the-uk-what-does-during-your-employment-mean).\n\nIt seems to mean:\n\n* while you are on company time\n\nbut it can also mean:\n\n* while you are employed to do something of a particular nature for us\nyou can only do it for us.\n\nI am explicitly concerned about software development, which falls under copyright law in the UK.\n\nMany software developers have several side projects which they want to keep independent from work for their employers.\n\nAn oft quoted example is that its okay for you to do something completely different like write a novel but not okay for you do something similar to your employer, like say software development.\n\nThere are many kinds of software development. Some which might overlap with work for an employer and some that might not. Before everything was software this was less recognised but it could still be an issue.\n\nFurther as many are now in remote / flexible working environments, It is less clear which hours are \"employee hours\" and which are \"company hours\" unless someone keeps a very strict logbook (which is desirable and challenging by not impossible).\n\nIt is also assumed that you would keep your work on an entirely separate computer system from your employers.\n\nI have heard of many contracts which unfairly favour the employer, for example:\n\n> Any rights in Intellectual Property belong to the Company. This will\n> apply whether you make, discover or create Intellectual Property in\n> the course of the duties of your employment, on the Company premises,\n> at home or elsewhere, and whether you carry out the work in the\n> Company\u2019s time or in your own time.\n\nThis is clearly a red flag which needs to be negotiated if you care about your side projects.\n\nIf you successfully negotiated away the \"or in your own time\" clause would evidence of that negotiation be sufficient to demonstrate the intent of the contract as in the employees favour?\n\nThis [example](https://techblog.bozho.net/amend-contract-allow-side-projects/) suggests:\n\n> Products resulting from the Employee\u2019s duties according to the terms\n> of employment \u2013 individual or joint, including ideas, software\n> development, inventions, improvements, formulas, designs,\n> modifications, trademarks and any other type of intellectual property\n> are the exclusive property of Employer, no matter if patentable.\n\nThis does not explicitly mention an employees right to their own side projects.\nIs it sufficient?\n\nIs an extra clause explicitly stating your rights to side projects necessary?\n\nDoes anyone have an example of contracts that provide some kind of explicit protection for employees own work (perhaps like the CA law) or where this has been negotiated successfully?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is an extra clause explicitly stating your rights to side projects necessary?\n\nNo. The samples you provide already contain semantics to limit the scope of the clause to the \"duties or terms of the employment\".\n\nIn the first sample clause, the element of \"*carry\\[ing] out the work \\[...] in your own time*\" is premised on \"*the course of the duties of your employment*\". The clause reflects awareness that the employee might do work in his free time, but only the IP pursuant to the duties of employment becomes employer's IP.\n\nThe interpretation that \"*whether you carry out the work in the Company\u2019s time or in your own time*\" encompasses any and all work regardless of being within the scope of *duties of employment* is wrong because it purports to treat the conjunctions \"*and*\" and \"*or*\" as synonyms. This position contravenes the principle formulated in [Restatement (Second) of Contracts](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/restatement-second-contracts.html) at \u00a7203(a), and which most likely has its equivalent under UK law: \"*\\[A]n interpretation which gives a\\[n] \\[...] effective meaning to **all** the terms is preferred to an interpretation which leaves a part \\[...] of no effect*\" (emphasis added). Treating \"and\" and \"or\" as synonyms inevitably renders one of these conjunctions without effect.\n\nThe second clause is more straight\\-forward because it hardly delves in the alternative circumstances under which an employee might perform work. The clause unequivocally provides that it refers to \"*\\[e]mployee's duties according to the terms of employment*\".\n\nIt is important to ensure that other language in the contract does not supersede the rationale developed here, though.

For example, there are specific [adapters available for connecting a given smartphone with a display](https://www.apple.com/de/shop/product/MD826ZM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter?afid=p238%7CsatJg2GVH-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_91282506382_&cid=aos-de-kwgo-pla-btb--slid-----product-MD826ZM/A-DE) or cars can be equipped with matching [roof racks](https://accessories.ford.com/exterior/racks-carriers/cross-bars-2-piece-set.html).\n\nThe availability of given accessories can very well influence the decision to buy something so traders advertise their products accordingly, such as \"For this product, the accessory \\[...] is available to enable functionality \\[...]\". \n\nNow let's imagine you buy the product, but you notice very soon that it is not possible to buy the accessory anywhere (for the sake of argument there is also no third party manufacturer that provides a matching accessory). It might be the case that this accessory was never manufactured at all or it is out\\-of\\-stock and will never be manufactured again. The true reason is of course not known to the consumer.\n\nHow does this relate to the status of the main product? I can imagine three different reasonings.\n\n* If the car was advertised with an A/C, but it is broken, you can not use the A/C functionality and thus it is a defect of the car and you can expect repairs or (monetary) compensation. Correspondingly, if the advertised roof rack is not available, you can not use the \"putting stuff on the roof\" functionality that was promised in the advertisement, thus it is a defect of the main product, too.\n* If an [ad shows a smartphone used in a swimming pool](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/5972867/htc-tom-daley-ad-smartphone-waterproof/), but it is not waterproof, this is misleading advertisement. While the individual consumer can not do anything about it, authorities can perform certain actions against it. Correspondingly, if there is an ad where a smartphone is connected to a display, but it is not possible for anyone else to reproduce this setup, this is misleading advertisement.\n* Promising the availability of accessories is a purely informative statement and has no legal consequences. This, however, would enable manufacturers to just promise and advertise certain functionality without putting any engineering effort into the actual implementation. *Edit:* Of course, this would be noticed fast for very popular products, but in some areas such as household appliances, the variety of models is large enough that a public outcry is unlikely.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Now let's imagine you buy the product, but you notice very soon that it is not possible to buy the accessory anywhere (for the sake of argument there is also no third party manufacturer that provides a matching accessory). It might be the case that this accessory was never manufactured at all or it is out\\-of\\-stock and will never be manufactured again. The true reason is of course not known to the consumer.\n\nIf the issue is the lack of availability of the accessory, then that's not a \"defect of the main product\" per se. As long as the main product *would* function as advertised with the accessory, were it available, the main product is technically not defective.\n\nYou could probably still have a case for something like \"false advertising\", were you induced to buy the main product under the promise or pretense that the accessory would be easily available.\n\n> If the car was advertised with an A/C, but it is broken, you can not use the A/C functionality and thus it is a defect of the car and you can expect repairs or (monetary) compensation.\n\nSure, if the accessory is *installed as a component of the main product,* then of course a defect in the accessory is now a defect of the main product. But not if they are sold separately.\n\n> Correspondingly, if the advertised roof rack is not available, you can not use the \"putting stuff on the roof\" functionality that was promised in the advertisement, thus it is a defect of the main product, too.\n\nIf I go to the car dealership because I see a roof rack in the ad, and at the dealership they tell me up front they're out of roof racks and won't get any more, since I have not made the purchase yet, I cannot complain of a \"defect in a product\" that I don't own.\n\nEven if I choose to buy the car with the (mistaken or deceptive) impression that a roof rack can be purchased and installed later, and the car works fine on its own, then it's not a \"defective car\".

This situation would likely be considered false or misleading advertising, as the consumer was induced to purchase the smartphone based on the promise of a non-existent accessory. However, the smartphone itself is not inherently defective if it functions as intended without the adapter. The lack of availability of an external accessory does not constitute a defect in the main product itself. Option A is incorrect because the phone isn't defective in its core functions. Option C is incorrect because advertising claims can have legal consequences if they're false or misleading. Option D is incorrect because the phone's inability to connect to a display due to lack of an advertised accessory doesn't make the phone itself defective, but rather points to a false advertising issue."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36317/question-on-intent-in-texas-forgery-case", "docs_id": 36317, "title": "Question on intent in Texas forgery case", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: (f) A person is presumed to intend to defraud or harm another if the person acts with respect to two or more writings of the same type and if each writing is a government record listed in Section 37\\.01(2\\)(C).\n\nDoes this mean if a person had only one counterfeit bill then they would not be presumed to have intent to defraud?

You have minimized this processing to what you consider the minimum, taking into account your obligation to ensure the security of processing. Your security measures are likely to be covered by an overriding legitimate interest (taking into account Recital 49\\). Offering an opt\\-out is likely not appropriate since it would defeat the purpose of these security measures. That is, the data subjects still have a right to contact you and object to the legitimate interest per Art 21, but the objection can most likely be denied.\n\nAll your website visitors are protected by the UK GDPR because you, the data controller, are in the UK (GDPR applies to all your processing activities per Art 3(1\\)).\n\nFrom the scenario you describe, two GDPR compliance obligations have to be pointed out.\n\n* You are still required to provide a privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR. However, since your processing activities are fairly limited, that notice will be comparatively short. Read the [ICO's guide on the right to be informed](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/) for further details and a checklist. I strongly recommend using that checklist and/or just reading Art 13 and Art 15 GDPR instead of relying on some privacy policy generator.\n* You are serving the website as a CDN. Presumably, this CDN acts as a data processor on your behalf. You would then need to make sure that an appropriate contract is in place that binds them as your data processor, in line with Art 28 GDPR. Again, the [ICO has guidance on such contracts](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/contracts/).\n\nTo the degree that the use of the CDN involves data exports into other countries, you would also need to assess whether this is a \u201crestricted transfer\u201d, possibly requiring further protections. The [ICO has a page about international transfers](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/), though you can skip the Brexit\\-specific parts. Note in particular that the United States are not covered by an \u201cadequacy decision\u201d and that the old Privacy Shield is invalid. If you are making a restricted transfer that is not covered by an existing adequacy decision, you will have to make a transfer risk assessment. The ICO does not publish guidelines for such an assessment, but an [EU GDPR transfer impact assessment template](https://iapp.org/resources/article/transfer-impact-assessment-templates/) is available from the IAPP. If the assessment shows that the risks of the transfer are sufficiently small, the transfer can be made on the basis of standard contractual clauses (SCCs).

The culpable intention of the accused is the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not always decisive. Modesty in this Section is an attribute associated with female human beings as a class. It is a virtue which attaches to a female owing to her sex. The act of pulling a woman, removing her saree, coupled with a request for sexual intercourse, is such as would be an outrage to the modesty of a woman; and knowledge, that modesty is likely to be outraged, is sufficient to constitute the offence without any deliberate intention having such outrage alone for its object. As indicated above, the word 'modesty' is not defined in\u00a0IPC. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary (Third Edn.) defines the word 'modesty' in relation to woman as follows:\n> \n> \n> \n> > \"Decorous in manner and conduct;\n> > \n> > \n> > not forward or lower; Shame\\-fast;\n> > \n> > \n> > Scrupulously chast.\"\n> \n> \n> Modesty is defined as the quality of being modest; and in relation to woman, \"womanly propriety of behaviour; scrupulous chastity of thought, speech and conduct.\" It is the reserve or sense of shame proceeding from instinctive aversion to impure or coarse suggestions.\n\nAs an aid to show what activities may be covered by the IPC offence, the Singapore Penal Code 1871, at [section 354](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PC1871?ProvIds=pr354-), mirrors the IPC word\\-for\\-word (apart from the prison sentence), and the Singaporean courts have held the following acts to be an outrage of modesty in the past:\n\n> * A male offender repeatedly touched the thigh of a sleeping woman on an MRT train.\n> * A man rubbed his thigh against a young tutor several times on a bus.\n> * Groping a domestic maid in a lift.\n> * Touching the buttocks of a 60\\-year\\-old woman on a bus.\n> * A male exposed himself to a domestic helper.\n> * A tutor touching the breasts of a student.\n> * Slapping a secretary lightly on the buttocks.\n> * Massaging a man\u2019s groin area without his consent.\n> \n> \n> [Source](https://pkwalaw.com/outrage-of-modesty/#:%7E:text=Examples%20of%20outrage%20of%20modesty&text=The%20courts%20have%20held%20the,domestic%20maid%20in%20a%20lift.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the interpretation and application of Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code regarding the outrage of a woman's modesty?\n\nA) The offense requires physical contact and can only be committed against women in public spaces.\n\nB) The definition of \"modesty\" is explicitly stated in the Indian Penal Code and is limited to acts involving sexual intercourse.\n\nC) The offense can be committed without physical contact, and the reaction of the woman is the sole determining factor in establishing guilt.\n\nD) The culpable intention of the accused is crucial, and the offense can occur even without deliberate intention if there is knowledge that modesty is likely to be outraged.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the Supreme Court of India's interpretation of Section 354.

For example, in Colorado cases brought in its trial courts of general jurisdiction, simplified civil procedure rules apply if the amount in controversy is less than $100,000\\.\n* The federal rules of civil procedure and most state rules of civil procedure require \"special damages\" to be pleaded with specificity in the complaint to be recovered. There are several definitions of this term that are used. [One of them](https://www.google.com/search?q=special%20damages&oq=special%20damages&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512l9.2020j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) is that: \"In contract law, special damages (also called consequential damages) refer to irregular damages such as physical injuries during a breach of contract, but general damages would refer to the damages expected from the contract being breached.\"\n* In most cases, a default judgment which is entered because a defendant fails to respond to a complaint filed in court and duly served upon a defendant over which it has jurisdiction may not exceed the amount claimed in the complaint. The complaint can't be amended to claim more damages after it is filed and served. This requirement arguably has constitutional due process dimensions.\n* In arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules, certain cases to which other arbitration rules do not apply are presumptively subject to the AAA Commercial Rules if the amount in controversy is in excess of $500,000\\.\n* In cases where a defendant has both primary liability insurance and also \"excess\" or \"umbrella\" insurance, a claim in excess of the limits of insurance under the primary liability insurance policy immediately trigger the involvement of the excess or umbrella insurer.\n* The amount of damages claimed in a lawsuit is one important factor in determining whether a lawsuit has to be disclosed in the public disclosures of a publicly held company, or in the prospectus to an initial public offering of securities in a company, or in a private sale of the securities of a closely held company in a private placement memorandum.\n* The amount of damages claimed in a lawsuit is generally the initial value of the claim of the person bringing the lawsuit in a bankruptcy filed by the defendant unless and until the value of the claim is challenged in the bankruptcy court process.\n* The amount of damages claimed in a lawsuit is one factor to be considered in whether a transfer of property from a defendant to a third\\-party for less than substantially equivalent value is a fraudulent transfer.\n* A claim of damages in a lawsuit made without reasonable factual support can be a basis upon which an attorney filing the lawsuit may be sanctioned for misconduct by the court in which the case in pending.\n\nAlso, some states, including Colorado, prohibit filing a claim for a specified dollar amount in many circumstances.\n\nSome states, including Colorado, allow certain kinds of damages (e.g., punitive damages) to be requested only in an amended complaint filed after some information has been exchanged by the parties after the lawsuit is filed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A plaintiff is filing a lawsuit in federal court against a defendant from another state.

To establish diversity jurisdiction in federal court, the amount in controversy must exceed $75,000. By claiming $76,000 in damages, the plaintiff ensures that their case meets this threshold and can be heard in federal court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because $70,000 does not meet the minimum threshold for federal diversity jurisdiction.\n\nOption C is incorrect because failing to specify an amount could lead to the case being dismissed or remanded to state court if the amount in controversy is not clear.\n\nOption D, while technically meeting the federal court threshold, could be seen as an unreasonable inflation of the damages.

For anyone who might be familiar, this company is a large social network (based in the United States) with millions of users who post their workouts and athletic activities online for others to see. It is essentially a social network for runners/cyclists/athletes, and the posted content consists of activities uploaded and shared by these users.\n\nI am an academic researcher with an interest in sports statistics. While reviewing the content on this social media platform, I discovered some interesting results that I'd like to turn into an academic/journal publication. Essentially, I performed some statistical analysis on some of the platform's data (which is visible and accessible by anyone with an account on the platform) and came to some meaningful conclusions, which I'd now like to publish as a paper.\n\nObviously, there are legal considerations to be made before trying to publish these results.\n\nAbove all, the company has a Terms of Service that I agreed to in order to use the platform. The Terms of Service explicitly state that I may not \"create derivative works from the content of the service\". This is a significant obstacle that would prevent me from achieving my goal of publishing my results.\n\nI reached out to the legal team at this company asking for an exemption to this clause for the purpose of my academic research. In return, I received a fairly generic response that all users of the platform are bound to the Terms of Service and must abide by them (which is fair, but already known). I have since followed up with the company to explain my objectives in more detail; I am currently awaiting a response to my e\\-mail.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I was considering other approaches to publishing this work and did some research into how fair use doctrine might support my case here. I think there are a few points that I have in my favor here:\n\n1. The purpose and nature of the use is for noncommercial, nonprofit educational purposes. Specifically, the nature of the use is for research and scholarship.\n2. The nature of the use is fairly *transformative*, as I would be publishing the analyzed/summarized statistical data and not any of the raw content from the platform.\n3. To some extent, I guess that you could say the raw data represents facts, which are not protected by copyright laws.\n4. The appropriate attribution and acknowledgment would be provided to the company regarding the use of their data in the publication.\n5. Finally, I would not be harming the copyright owner's market or limiting their ability to exploit the original data for their own purposes.\n\nThese are all points that I could pitch to support my argument. I'm not sure if the fair use doctrine would, in this case, supersede the relevance of the company's Terms of Service. For the purpose of this question, let's assume that the argument I've posed above is reasonable (although please feel free to leave a comment if there are notable flaws in my reasoning).\n\n**Question:**\n-------------\n\n*Should I inform the copyright holder (i.e. the company and its legal team) that I would intend to invoke the fair use doctrine if they were to pursue legal action against me?*\n\nIf so, to what extent should I detail my argument\u2014should I simply let them know that I would invoke fair use in my defense, or should I go even further and explain my arguments for each of the four factors for fair use consideration?\n\nIf not, what is the reason for withholding my intentions from the company?\n\nOn one hand, I believe that expressing my intent to invoke fair use might make them concede to my request (both because it may be perceived as grounded in legal doctrine *and* because they'll realize that I am not willing to back down without a fight). On the other hand, I worry that giving them too much information upfront might end up working against me if I end up in a legal battle against the company (which is not something I want to do unless there's a very strong chance that I'd win).\n\nHow should I play my cards here? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each option?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We cannot dispense personalized legal advice: that is what your attorney is for. However, I agree with your analysis that this is most likely covered by fair use, and indeed it is not obvious that you have taken anything that is protected. There is no creativity behind a number such as entries in the \"I did N pushups\" column. The arrangement of data into a web page passes the smidgen of creativity test, but \"210\" is not a creative number.\n\nThe terms of service of a website cannot negate your right to use the website however you want in a non\\-infringing way. If your use is \"fair use\", then they can't tell you that you can't use it. In case it turns out that \"fair use\" fails, the matter would hinge on what exactly the TOS says. They may have granted you permission to make use of their \"information\". So there are three positive avenues for you to consider: not protected, fair use, and permitted.\n\nA practical difficulty is that a university lawyer is only interested in the interests of the university, and they are as likely to say \"don't do that\" or \"get permission\" as they are to say \"that is fair use\". You can hire a lawyer who is paid to care about *your* interest, though there is never a guarantee that the lawyer's advice is correct. I think it is likely that the lawyer will tell you to not say anything until legally forced to, given the apparent rebuff of your request for special permission.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: As an academic researcher using data from a sports-focused social media platform for a potential publication, which of the following approaches is most advisable given the platform's Terms of Service and fair use considerations?\n\nA) Inform the company's legal team of your intention to invoke fair use, providing a detailed argument for each of the four factors of fair use.\n\nB) Proceed with publishing the research without informing the company, relying solely on the fair use doctrine for protection.\n\nC) Consult with an independent lawyer who prioritizes your interests before taking any action or communicating further with the company.\n\nD) Abandon the research project entirely to avoid any potential legal complications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most advisable approach in this situation. The information provided suggests that while fair use may apply, there are complexities involving the platform's Terms of Service and potential legal implications. Consulting with an independent lawyer who prioritizes the researcher's interests is the best course of action for several reasons:\n\n1. University lawyers may not prioritize the researcher's interests, potentially advising against the project to avoid risk.\n2. An independent lawyer can provide a more comprehensive analysis of the fair use argument, Terms of Service implications, and potential legal risks.\n3. The lawyer can advise on the best strategy for communication with the company, including whether to disclose fair use intentions or how to proceed with publication.\n4. This approach allows for a thorough evaluation of all legal aspects before taking any action that might have consequences.\n\nOption A is not advisable as it may provide too much information to the company prematurely. Option B carries significant risk without proper legal guidance. Option D is overly cautious and unnecessary without first exploring legal options.
