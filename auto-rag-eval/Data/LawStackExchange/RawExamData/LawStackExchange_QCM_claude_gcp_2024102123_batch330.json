He isn't an obvious one, so having an actor resemble him will be so\\-so. However, if I could deep fake his real face into the short scene where he's alive, people would instantly recognize him, and have an \"oh shit\" moment when he bites the dust.\n\nObviously, this is ethically questionable. What sort of laws could be brought down on me by a bruised ego with more money than I'll ever see? If his death isn't shown on screen, but he's alive\\- cut to news report of death, is that better? Is it better if he just \"disappears\"?\n\nAlso, deep faking is a new tech, and I'm not sure how many laws have even been put into place about it yet. If a law were to be put into place down the road that outlaws this type of portrayal, would I be grandfathered into the system and not prosecuted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you make clear that this is fiction, it isn't really a true \"deepfake\" which in the primary sense of the word is a depiction that intends to mislead the viewer about whether something actually happened. It is merely special effects.\n\nIf you do so without someone's consent there are several potential theories of liability.\n\n* Individuals have a right of publicity. Generally, their likeness cannot be used to make a profit without their consent, and if it is not, they are entitled to fair compensation relative to what they would have been paid if they had agreed in a typical arms length negotiation. The exact scope of this right varies from state to state.\n* It is conceivable, although unlikely, that this could be construed as intentional infliction of emotional distress/outrageous conduct, if it was calculated to cause distress and emotional harm to the person faked or someone who knows the person faked. The fact that this is fiction greatly reduces this risk and it would take some quite exceptional facts (e.g. secret knowledge that the person had a deep phobia of dying in a particular way) for this claim to be legally supported.\n* Depending upon the nature of the film, this could be deemed an implied threat, similar to burning someone's image in effigy, which could provide a basis for the issuance of a protection order and to criminal prosecution for threatening someone's life. The context of the film and its making would have to support the theory that this was intended to be a threat to the person depicted (or someone close to them). A [recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court case](https://www.mcall.com/news/police/mc-nws-anthony-elonis-cyberstalking-20210802-egcejopnu5d2bhx7azpndt5wxe-story.html) (of a man who was subject to a previous U.S. Supreme Court case on a similar topic) addressed the issues associated with this kind of charge.\n* There could be a defamation claim, related to, for example, the reason that the person is killed in the movie, if politician can credibly claim that the film, while itself fictional, is impliedly making a statement about a presently existing real world material fact about the politician that damages the politician's reputation, which is not true and is made with actual malice to destroy the politician's reputation. This might happen, for example, if the overall plot is so close to reality (or a very close allegory to reality) that calling it fiction is really inaccurate, and it is really just a smear job disguised as a fictional story.\n\nNotable, all of these claims depend upon the intent of the party making the film, and the purpose of the scene, and the larger context. You can't determine if a \"deepfake\" will give rise to legal consequences in a vacuum.\n\nUsually, fictional films contain prominent disclaimers that \"any similarity to real events is purely coincidental\" in an effort to rebut these theories of liability.\n\n> If a law were to be put into place down the road that outlaws this\n> type of portrayal, would I be grandfathered into the system and not\n> prosecuted?\n\nThe particular method is new, but the legal considerations are the same. People have been making snuff films falsely depicting someone's death for more than a century, and some of them have been convincing.\n\nA new statute cannot have *ex post facto* effect to acts taken prior to its enactment, but there are existing statutes and common law rules that may well provide legal consequences in appropriate circumstances as noted above."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A filmmaker creates a fictional movie depicting the assassination of a well-known politician using deepfake technology to portray the politician's likeness without their consent.

However, option D is incorrect because laws cannot have ex post facto effect, meaning new laws enacted in the future cannot be applied retroactively to prosecute actions taken before the law was in place.

No event has occurred.**\n\n**Any reply I receive is not legal advice and I will consult a lawyer if I were to ever need appropriate legal advice.**\n\n---\n\nLet's say I own some baby items that my baby has outgrown, but have remaining useful life.\n\nEg: An expensive bassinet.\n\nI own the bassinet, and it has been used properly. I then sell the bassinet noting that the prospective buyer is buying \"as\\-is\" but the item has been reasonably inspected (to the best of my lay ability) and appears to be in proper working condition and is \"like\\-new\".\n\nSomeone else buys that bassinet and, while the baby is in the bassinet, the baby dies. The. cause of death is [SIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By definition, when a death is diagnosed as an instance of SIDS, the actual cause of death is not known. (If the cause is known or is determined by autopsy, the diagnosis is not SIDS.) Thus there can be no proof that the bassinet was the cause, or even a contributing factor, in the death, and therefore the seller of the bassinet should have no liability.\n\nIf there was some other cause of death that was due to the condition of the bassinet, there could possibly be liability. For example, say the bassinet broke suddenly, causing the baby to fall and death resulted. But here I think ther could be liability only if the seller knew (or suspected) that the bassinet was in an unsafe condition, or if a reasonable person in the seller's position would have known or suspected this, or possibly if the seller made knowingly false statements about the condition which made the bassinet seem safer than it in fact was. None of these matches the situation described in the question.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions there are laws specifically forbidding the sale of used mattresses, adult or infant, regardless of their detailed condition or how they are described. In such a jurisdiction the seller could not lawfully include the mattress as part of the sale. With a new mattress it would be even harder to link the seller to any SIDS case, as any risk factor from an overly\\-soft mattress would not be the seller's responsibility."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A parent sells a used bassinet \"as-is\" to another family, stating it appears to be in proper working condition and is \"like-new\".

The apprehension must reasonably continue throughout the commission of the act. Option C correctly reflects these conditions. Options A and B are incorrect because they misstate the law. Option D is incorrect because while the defense doesn't apply if there was a reasonable opportunity to avoid the act without harm, it doesn't automatically fail if any opportunity existed, regardless of risk."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48808/does-impeachment-conviction-necessarily-imply-removal-from-office", "docs_id": 48808, "title": "Does impeachment conviction necessarily imply removal from office?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The relevant bits of [Article 1 Section 3](https://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec3.html) state that:\n\n> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States\n\nThis seems to imply that, if convicted, the Senate *may* then choose to remove the president, or to bar them from holding future offices.

There were municipalities (actually most) where the final decision was made using a public vote. This practice was declared illegal by the federal court some years ago, because becoming a citizen is a formal governmental act, and as such a reason needs to be given for turning an application down. This is inherently impossible with a vote. \n\nSince that law decision, most municipalities have shifted the responsibility to a committee for citizenship applications.

It copies the desktop background, Windows logo Start menu icon, and the overall look and feel of the UI. The purpose is to allow ethical hackers/penetration testers to use Kali Linux in public places (e.g. a client's office) without drawing attention from bystanders who might not know that the testing is authorized.

Assuming Offensive Security (the company that develops Kali Linux) didn't get permission from Microsoft, is this legal? I doubt Microsoft would give a license for an intentionally deceptive clone of Windows's UI.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright would generally protect all aspects of the Windows operating system. Therefore, to the extend that Kali is visually similar to Windows, it might be illegal infringement. It would not be infringement if those elements were used with permission from MS (note that the product is available on the Microsoft store). Since you semi\\-stipulate that they do not have permission, we can move to the possibility of a fair use defense. That defense might be successful since at least apparently there would be no effect on market and the copying is somewhat transformative.\n\nFinally, the finder of fact would have to decide if those elements of Kali are \"substantially similar\" to the Windows originals. It could be found that the similarity which you perceive is due to \"copying the idea\", not copying the expression.

Whether the copied elements are considered \"substantially similar\" to Windows, which is a decision for the finder of fact.\n2.

It needs to be evaluated incident and sub\\-incident act by sub\\-incident act.\n\n1. The use of force is legally permitted to prevent harm to others and to the property of others under some circumstances.\n2. Citizens arrests are permitted under some circumstances, but generally, the person making the arrest must have personal knowledge of the crime while it is in the process of being committed.\n3. Some laws prohibit wearing masks under some circumstances, but usually not in all circumstances.\n4. Your client's \"business model\" is not consistent with being able to testify in court, so the criminal justice system will only be able to convict someone whom your client delivers to police if they can do so without your testimony.\n5. As a general rule, the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence collected by private parties or to statements obtained by private parties that are not made under duress that are not Mirandized. But, if your client is effectively \"deputized\" or becomes a \"de facto\" agent of the state who is called up to be a member of a posse for the police, for example, by using an agreed symbol such as shining a light with a symbol on it on some clouds, at that point, with respect to that matter, the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule and Miranda probably do apply to evidence that your client obtains, and exclusion of that kind of evidence could make prosecution much more difficult, unless the prosecution can successfully make an argument that the other evidence that the illegally obtained evidence leads them to is not \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" because it would have inevitably been discovered in due course using only the legally obtained evidence.\n6. Even if your client does violate the law, law enforcement is not obligated to investigate his alleged crimes even if the victims complain, and prosecutors are not obligated to prosecute those crimes, even if they have overwhelming evidence of guilt which they could use to secure a conviction. Prosecutorial discretion is basically absolute.\n7. Your client might be sued civilly for operating a corrupt enterprise under RICO, for various intentional torts, and for negligence, by people who think that they have been harmed by his conduct, but someone can only sue your client if they can figure out who he is and serve him with civil process.\n8. If you are helping your client conduct on ongoing criminal enterprise, whether or not the crimes are prosecuted by the criminal justice system, the attorney\\-client privilege you have with your client is probably forfeit should you be placed under a subpoena and your may be violating other ethical rules.

Stallman, I came to know that copyright, patent and treadmark are totally different things and people are usually using the misleading term \"Intellectual Property\" to address them.\n\nSo, in order to understand software licensing, I want to know what are these leagle terms related or different with eachother. And what \"Intellectual Property\" stands for?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Stallman is simply wrong: that's like saying that stealing a car and stealing a motorcycle are \"totally different things\" because there is some difference. They are all examples of the concept \"intellectual property\", though they differ under the law in particular ways. Copyright of books and copyright of computer programs is likewise covered by somewhat different law, but they have something in common. The essential thing that all forms of intellectual property law have in common is that they protect a person's intangible intellectual creations: they are treated like property, just as the fruits of an individual's labor is property.\n\nAs far as \"how much of the actual code\" is the same, you would have to look at the legal code of a particular country. In the US, trademark law is gathered together in [Title 15 under Chapter 22](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-22); patent law is in [Title 35](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35); copyright law is [Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17). Patents and copyrights are similar in being a constitutionally enumerated power of Congress (Art. I, Sect. 8, Cl. 8\\), the power \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries\". Patents and trademarks are similar in that they are both controlled by the [Patent and Trademark Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office). All three have in common that they are the based in the common law, and were until the [Trademark Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-Mark_Cases) held to be covered by the Copyright Clause.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, understanding the intellectual and historical underpinnings of copyright, trademark and patent is probably not useful in understanding software licensing. Instead, it is most useful to understand copyright law and contract law, and perhaps patent law just in case some piece of software is patented (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patents_under_United_States_patent_law) for an overview in the US, and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patents_under_United_Kingdom_patent_law) for the UK).

While copyright, patent, and trademark laws have distinct characteristics and applications, they all fall under the broader umbrella of intellectual property law. They share the common purpose of protecting intangible intellectual creations, treating them as a form of property. Although they differ in specific legal details and applications, they are not completely unrelated (ruling out option A). They are not identical or interchangeable (ruling out option B), as each has its own specific role in protecting different aspects of intellectual creation. Finally, they are very much applicable to software and digital realms (ruling out option D), with copyright law being particularly relevant to software licensing.

We can no longer access the bank account where the funds were withdrawn anymore, so we cannot know if you got refunded or not.\n\nThen I emailed Insurer 2, but they replied\n\n> Insurer 1's answer is wrong.

The fluctuation of the number of exposures (and impliedly the opt\\-outs) in a group policy can be of interest to a prospective insurer for purposes of rate making of the plan being assessed.

Juries at that time fear that they will go to hell if they convict an innocent man. So the rule is made that the jury must conclude that the defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nOf course, the purpose and the meaning is no longer there. The purpose of beyond reasonable doubt cases is now a way to protect defendants.\n\nThat's because, of course, values have changed.\n\nUS have become secular countries. Yada yada.\n\nStatutory rapes laws also evolved.\n\n[https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer\\=https://law.stackexchange.com/\\&httpsredir\\=1\\&article\\=1080\\&context\\=fac\\_pub](https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://law.stackexchange.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1080&context=fac_pub)\n\nIt says that statutory rapes laws are there to protect **virginity of young girls.**\n\nThat would make a lot of sense.\n\nVirginity was very important at that time.\n\nVirginity of boys are \"worthless\" and hence not worth protecting. So a hot beautiful young teacher having sex with young boy would be \"nice\".\n\nHowever, as times go buy, we have men and women treated equally.\n\nAlso marital age have gone up and virginity is not important anymore.\n\nSo now, statutory rapes would actually protect a 15 years old boy that **rape** an 21 years old girl. That 21 years old girl will have strong incentive not to report the rape due to statutory rapes law.\n\n> When an adult is raped by a juvenile, the offense of statutory rape\n>  imposes criminal liability on the adult for the same intercourse by\n>  which the adult is a victim of rape.

Before paternity tests, adultery means paternity frauds. Men with power and wealth will end up inheriting his wealth to someone else' child if his wife commit adultery.\n\nTimes changed.\n\nWe can just use paternity tests to know who the father of the child is. So adultery laws become meaningless. In most states it's legal. Being legal, getting married no longer protect men from paternity fraud.

So the laws were there for a reasonable purpose. And now the law is there for totally different purpose.\n\nWhat are these called?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes \\- any general law book will deal with this\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn common law systems, judges apply the law to the particular facts of the case. The law means the statutes passed by the legislature, regulations properly made by the executive and precedent set by other judges in higher courts in the particular appellate chain.\n\nWithin the constraint of those laws the judge may need to create or alter a law to fit the specific case, including the changed society that the case exists in. Now, lower courts are bound by precedent, even if that precedent was set in the 1700s \\- indeed there are plenty of judgments where the judge says \"I don't agree with agree with it but Lord Farquart said in Some Guy v Some Other Guy \\[1856] ...\". These judgments often get appealed up to a court that is not bound by the precedent who can then set a new precedent. Alternatively, these sorts of cases can serve as notice to the legislature who may enact a law that overturns the old law.\n\nFor example, in Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. (2015\\) the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the fundamental right to marry is guaranteed to same\\-sex couples by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It is unlikely that this interpretation would have been contemplated by *any* of the people who drafted it and passed it in the 1860s \\- even the ones who were in same\\-sex relationships. Legislative *intention* is *one* thing the courts consider, however, it is not the only thing \\- they also consider what the law actually says and what that means within current society.\n\nThis is basic jurisprudence and is covered in the opening chapter of any first\\-year law text."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes how common law systems adapt to societal changes over time?\n\nA) Judges are always bound by precedents, even if they were set centuries ago, and can never alter laws to fit current societal norms.\n\nB) Legislatures are solely responsible for updating laws, and courts have no role in interpreting or adapting laws to fit modern contexts.\n\nC) Lower courts can freely overturn any precedent they disagree with, regardless of when it was set or by which court.\n\nD) Through a combination of judicial interpretation, appeals to higher courts, and legislative action, laws can evolve to address changing societal needs while still respecting legal precedent.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D correctly captures the nuanced way common law systems adapt over time. Judges can interpret laws in light of current societal contexts, but are constrained by precedent, especially in lower courts. However, appeals to higher courts can lead to new precedents being set that better reflect current values. Additionally, legislatures can pass new laws to address outdated precedents.

What is meant by \"generally accessible\" is public places like plazas, stretches of green by the road, parks, parking lots, etc. The definition is kind of a negative and could be more easily phrased as: \"You may camp at A) designated camping areas or B) private places where you are entitled to camp\". This means you either have to find a camping area where you pay a fee for a period of time, or you may camp on private grounds that either belong to you, or you have been given explicit permission to camp, say in a private garden or field.

So before it's been executed, you can pretty much forget about accessing it. After the warrant is executed, though, there are differing answers to this question.\n\nThe Supreme Court gave us a test for this kind of question in *[Press\\-Enterprise II](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13753927311495241910)*, which held that the First Amendment gives us a qualified right to access court proceedings and records. The right applies when public access makes sense using the \"experience and logic\" test: Has the Anglo\\-Saxon experience typically been to provide access, and does logic tell us that access has beneficial effects for the judicial process?\n\nBut lower courts have disagreed about how to apply the test. The Eighth Circuit allowed access to warrants in a defense\\-industry corruption investigation in *[In re Search Warrant for Secretarial Area\\-Gunn](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10448147063985598731)*, but the Ninth Circuit denied access in to warrants in the same investigation in *[Times Mirror Co. v. U.S.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3799723892039676377)* I think, though, that the Ninth Circuit decision would have come out differently if the investigation had already ended.\n\nJust to mix things up further, the Fourth Circuit has also allowed access, but based on common law principles of access, rather than the First Amendment. That was *[Baltimore Sun Co. v. Goetz](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11321522830792891234)*. Same in the Second Circuit: *[In re Application of Newsday, Inc.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11861486303090610370)*\n\nIndividual states also have their own rules, but those are of course subject to limits under the First Amendment.\n\nWhen I wanted a copy of a warrant, I would go first to the clerk of the court whose judge signed the warrant. I would tell them what I was looking for, and I pretty much always got it.\n\nI would rarely submit a FOIA request, especially if the warrant was issued by a federal agency. Those requests sit in a queue for months or years without being reviewed, and the agency virtually always denies the request anyway. When law enforcement agencies and courts have copies of the same record, you're almost always going to have better luck getting access from the courts, which are set to open by default.

The accessibility of search warrants as public records varies significantly across jurisdictions in the United States. Several factors influence this:\n\n1. Different circuit courts have ruled differently on this matter. For example, the Eighth Circuit has allowed access in some cases, while the Ninth Circuit has denied it in others.\n\n2. The stage of the investigation plays a role. Warrants are typically sealed before execution to prevent evidence tampering.\n\n3. Some courts base their decisions on First Amendment principles (using the \"experience and logic\" test from Press-Enterprise II), while others rely on common law principles.\n\n4. State laws also vary and may have their own rules regarding search warrant accessibility.\n\n5. The status of the case (whether charges have been filed, if it has gone to trial, etc.) can affect accessibility.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the issue and doesn't account for jurisdictional differences.

According to Terry v. Ohio, a pat-down search during a stop is permitted only for the purpose of officer safety, specifically to check for weapons. The scope of such a search is limited to what is necessary to discover weapons that could be used against the officer. In this scenario, the officer exceeded the permissible scope of a Terry stop by removing Bob's ID from his pocket.

Generally it is the person who is paying money who wants to void the contract and the one providing services would be the plaintiff. For example, recently [a small business owner got hit with a $4000\\+ contractual demand when she tried to end her internet service contract because the internet service was bad](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/frontier-demands-4300-cancellation-fee-despite-horribly-slow-internet/).\n\nSo, for example, in Massachusetts I know that district courts are supposed to handle certain \"equitable injunctions\", but superior court handles \"equitable relief\". I am not sure of the exact distinction there. So which court would it be?\n\nAssuming we have figured out the right court, is it then just a matter of making a normal suit for equitable relief stating cause and asking for an order voiding the contract as the remedy?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are at least three options available to litigate this dispute. \n\nThe first doesn't actually require going to court unless the other side tries to sue you. The second would probably be cheaper if the suit could be brought in a limited jurisdiction district court rather than a general jurisdiction superior court. The third would have to be brought in a superior court which would usually be slower and more expensive than bringing suit in district court.\n\nAlso, @I\u00f1akiViggers is correct that the contract might require mediation prior to commencing litigation, or might require an arbitration forum. That would need to be confirmed before someone files suit. Both kinds of terms would be common in contracts like the one described.\n\n**Self Help**\n\nThe usual one is to stop paying and advise the non\\-performing party why you are doing so (which takes little or no legal fees). Then, the non\\-performing party has to sue you to get paid, and you have a credible defense against that suit. But, you can't be sure in advance that the court will rule in your favor.\n\n**A Suit For A Refund**\n\nA second option would be to sue the service provider for a refund of the amounts already paid which were not earned as a result of non\\-performance. This breach of contract suit would be proper in any court with jurisdiction over breach of contract suits with the appropriate amount in controversy in the lawsuit. The service provider would then probably counterclaim against you for the amount owed for which you have not yet paid (if any).\n\nA declaration of the rights of the parties would have to be made by the court incident to resolving the claim for money judgment relief in the case.\n\n**A Declaratory Judgment Action**\n\nA third option is to bring a suit for \"declaratory judgment\". This is a lawsuit brought when there is a bona fide dispute between the parties concerning the interpretation of a legal issues such as contract interpretation or statutory interpretation as applied to a particular situation. The court would then rule on the question of whether you had a right to withhold payment before you risked being sued, without providing any other relief.\n\nIf the court determined that the breach of contract eliminated your obligation to pay, you could then cease to pay and request a refund of what you have already paid without risking being sued for non\\-payment which could hurt your credit rating, or put you at risk of violating some loan covenant that considers being sued for non\\-payment of a debt to be an event of default unless a bond is posted for the payment of that debt (which is not uncommon in business loan agreements).\n\nIt is not entirely settled whether a declaratory judgment action is equitable or not. In some circumstances in some jurisdictions, these kinds of lawsuits are aways treated as equitable because they don't seek either a money judgment or possession of specific real property or personal property, which are the primary kinds of remedies allowed in non\\-equitable cases called \"actions arising at law\". Other jurisdictions, for example, for the purpose of determining a right to a jury trial, look to whether the underlying dispute in which relief is sought arises at law or in equity to determine the character of the action.\n\nUsually, case law interpreting or the express language of, the statute setting out the jurisdiction of particular courts, or the statute or constitutional provision authorizing declaratory judgment actions in a jurisdiction, will address the question of whether a particular kind of court has jurisdiction to entertain declaratory judgment actions. As explained below, in MA, a statute expressly states which courts do and do not have jurisdiction to enter declaratory judgments.\n\nA suit for an injunction is always one seeking equitable relief, but an injunction is a court order directing someone to refrain from taking a particular action, or ordering someone to take a particular action, rather than simply declaring what the law says about the rights of the parties in a particular situation without actually requiring either party to do, or refrain from doing anything, as a declaratory judgment does. In the situation that you describe in the question, the proper court in which to bring a declaratory judgment action regarding this dispute would be the superior court.\n\nIn MA, the statute describing jurisdiction to enter a declaratory judgment is M.G.L.A. 231A, \u00a7 1\\. It states (emphasis added and paragraph break added for ease of reading in this digital format):\n\n> \u00a7 1\\. Power to make declaratory determination; jury questions\n> \n> \n> **The supreme judicial court, the superior court, the land court and the probate courts,** within their respective jurisdictions, may on\n>  appropriate proceedings make binding declarations of right, duty,\n>  status and other legal relations sought thereby, either before or\n>  after a breach or violation thereof has occurred in any case in which\n>  an actual controversy has arisen and is specifically set forth in the\n>  pleadings and whether any consequential judgment or relief is or could\n>  be claimed at law or in equity or not; and such proceeding shall not\n>  be open to objection on the ground that a merely declaratory judgment\n>  or decree is sought thereby and such declaration, when made, shall\n>  have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and be\n>  reviewable as such; provided, that nothing contained herein shall be\n>  construed to authorize the change, extension or alteration of the law\n>  regulating the method of obtaining service on, or jurisdiction over,\n>  parties or affect their right to trial by jury. \n> \n> \n> When a declaration of right, or the granting of further relief based\n>  thereon, shall involve the determination of issues of fact triable by\n>  a jury as of right and as to which a jury trial is duly claimed by the\n>  party entitled thereto, or issues which the court, in accordance with\n>  the practice of courts of equity, considers should be tried by a jury,\n>  such issues may be submitted to a jury in the form of questions, with\n>  proper instructions by the court, whether a general verdict be\n>  required or not.\n\nAs the language above indicates, for purposes of a right to a jury trial, MA is a state in which a declaratory judgment action is not automatically either at law or in equity, but instead the court looks through to the nature of the underlying dispute to determine if there is a right to a jury trial (which hinges on the distinction between law and equity).\n\n**FOOTNOTE RE STATUTORY DRAFTING STYLE**\n\nThe MA declaratory judgment statute demonstrates a common feature of (bad) American statutory drafting, which is the use of very long compound, multi\\-clause sentences. This is disfavored in modern legal writing because it often gives rise to ambiguities in meaning and is hard to read.\n\nThis style became common because American statutory drafters were worried that if the entire concept of a statute was not contained in one sentence that a sentence from the statute could be truthfully quoted out of context in a way that would mislead a reader regarding the meaning of the statute as a whole. This was particularly a problem in the days when few people had easy access to the full statutory language of a law. Thus, many readers of a misleading out of context quote from a statute would not be able to review the full context of the quoted language to determine its true meaning."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, a small business owner wants to void her internet service contract due to poor service quality.

Some documents, mostly relating to mediation, can never be made public. Other documents are covered by the blanket rule \"A non\\-party may, if the court gives permission, obtain from the records of the court a copy of any other document filed by a party, or communication between the court and a party or another person\", which allows the court itself to draw the line between open justice and breach of privacy which will discourage frankness in future cases. So Bob's \"publishing the court documents\" without permission is a breach of the rules and possibly a contempt of court.\n\nAssuming \"opening his cards\" means setting out his own case and accepting that he may no longer change his arguments according to what happens in Court, I see nothing wrong with it. But \"speculating about what is going on\" may well breach the *sub judice* rule. If and when a jury is empanelled to try this case, they will be expected (indeed sworn) to make a decision based solely on what they hear in court, where the judge can disallow improper arguments, exclude 'evidence' that is unsupported, and so on. If Bob (who does not even have a lawyer's advice) publishes his guesses in a way that may affect a future juror, he has deliberately introduced bias and may be sanctioned or fined.

This scenario falls under the case where both parties were aware of the potential interference, but the client chose to accept the risk.\n\nOption A is incorrect because if Sam knew about the issue and didn't disclose it, this could be seen as misrepresentation, potentially relieving CompanyX of their obligations.\n\nOption B, while a common scenario, doesn't necessarily favor CompanyX's position as strongly as option C.

Which of the following statements best describes her eligibility for continued unemployment benefits under the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program?\n\nA) She is not eligible for PUA because her employer has requested her to return to work.\n\nB) She is eligible for PUA only if she can prove she has been diagnosed with COVID-19 or is showing symptoms.\n\nC) She is eligible for PUA as the primary caregiver for children whose school has closed due to COVID-19, even if her employer requests her return.\n\nD) She is only eligible for PUA if she can demonstrate that her workplace has permanently closed due to COVID-19.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Michigan Department of Labor & Economic Opportunity, individuals are eligible for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) if they \"Are the primary caregiver for a child whose school or care facility closed, due to COVID-19.\" This applies even if the individual's employer requests their return to work. The mother in this scenario falls under this category as she is caring for young children (ages 4, 5, and 10) whose schools are closed and participating in remote learning.

So they wait until the owner has left and ask the owner's child to enter the property to search it. In my home state a child as young as 8 can be left alone, but it's unlikely a child that young would have any idea he could refuse a search from police if they showed up and demanded to do so.\n\nCould such a search authorized by a child be upheld by the courts? Is there some cutoff for age before a child is old enough to be able to authorize a search of a home he resides in?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The central legal question would be whether the minor has the capacity and authority to consent to a search: in the context of search law, the police would have to have a reasonable belief that both are the case. It is not reasonable to believe that an 8 year old can consent to a police search, that is, a child will most likely acquiesce to a request from the authorities to conduct a search. It is as reasonable to believe that a 16 year old can give actual consent as it is to believe that an 18 year old can consent. The law leaves the matter open for those under 18, to be determined by circumstances. The other consideration, applicable to younger children, is whether the child is authorized to open the house to outsiders.\n\nSo in [People v. Hoxter](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/4th/75/406.html), 75 Cal. App. 4th 406, a 16 year old child invited police in, whereupon polices obtained plain sight evidence of drug offenses by the child's father. The court found that \"sufficient discretion certainly exists\" by that age. There are similar results in [Saavedra v. State](https://casetext.com/case/saavedra-v-state-9), 622 So. 2d 952 involving a 15 year old. In contrast, in [Davis v. State](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1325798/davis-v-state/), 422 S.E.2d 546, a 10 year old child who was home alone called the police to report drugs in the house. The search was invalidated because\n\n> although the child's mother had given him permission to call for\n> emergency assistance if he needed help, the child had no right, absent\n> an emergency, to invite anyone into the house while he was alone\n> there, much less into his parents' bedroom\n\nSee also [People v. Jacobs](https://scocal.stanford.edu/opinion/people-v-jacobs-23503), 729 P.2d 757 involving an 11 year old, for extensive discussion of the question of \"joint control\" and authority to permit a search, citing US v. Matlock, 415 U.S. 164\n\n> there must be some objective evidence of joint control or access to\n> the places or items to be searched which would indicate that the\n> person authorizing the search has the authority to do so.

But also see [Lenz v. Winburn](https://casetext.com/case/lenz-v-winburn), 51 F.3d 1540 for a permitted case of consent given by a 9 year old to a guardian *ad litem*: the court found a 4th Amendment issue and and concluded that the search was reasonable, holding that minors can give third party consent.\n\n> Fourth Amendment rights, unlike rights attendant to due process, do\n> not guarantee a fair and impartial determination of truth; rather,\n> they protect the interest of the citizen \"to be let alone\".

The homeowner is not present, but their 14-year-old child is home alone. The officer asks the child for permission to enter and search the house. Under what circumstances might this search be considered legal?\n\nA) The search would always be legal because a 14-year-old is old enough to give consent.\nB) The search would never be legal because only the homeowner can give consent.\nC) The search might be legal if the child has been given authority by the parents to allow visitors into the home and shows understanding of the situation.\nD) The search would only be legal if the child calls the police first to report a crime.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of a search authorized by a minor depends on several factors, including the child's age, maturity, and authority within the household. Courts have generally found that teenagers around 14-16 years old may have the capacity to consent to a search, but it also depends on their understanding of the situation and whether they have been given authority by their parents to allow people into the home. The search might be considered legal if:\n\n1. The 14-year-old demonstrates sufficient maturity and understanding of the situation.\n2. There is evidence that the parents have given the child authority to allow visitors into the home.\n3. The child's consent is voluntary and not coerced.\n4. The police officer reasonably believes the child has the authority to consent.\n\nOption A is incorrect because age alone doesn't guarantee legal consent. Option B is too absolute; minors can sometimes give valid consent. Option D is unnecessarily restrictive; the child doesn't need to report a crime for the search to potentially be legal. Option C best captures the nuanced approach courts take in evaluating these situations."}}
