It usually declares the source from which the law claims to derive its authority. In many countries, an enacting formula is not considered necessary and is simply omitted.\n> \n> \n> The simplest enacting clauses merely cite the legislature by which the law has been adopted; for example the enacting clause used in Australia since 1990 is \"The Parliament of Australia enacts\". Alternatively an enacting clause may invoke the ultimate sovereign. For example, California, based on the principle of popular sovereignty, has the following enacting clause: \"The People of the State of California do enact as follows.\"\n\nFor example, Acts of the US Congress begin with words not unlike those of Acts of Parliament:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\n> United States of America in Congress assembled\n\nUK statutory instruments go further, stating not only who made the order, but also which legislation provided the power to make this order. To take a [recent example](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/654/made) at random:\n\n> The Secretary of State for Education makes the following Order in exercise of the powers conferred by section 129(1\\) of the Education Reform Act 1988\n\nFrom these, one might surmise that the purpose of these sentences is to convince the reader that the person or body issuing the legislation has the power to do so.\n\nFor most statutory instruments, the power to make them comes from Acts of Parliament, and so the specific section(s) of the those Acts are stated. For Acts of Parliament themselves, it is taken as read that the Queen, Lords and Commons acting together (or more formally, the [Queen\\-in\\-Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen-in-Parliament)) have the power to legislate, so it is sufficient to merely state that is they who have done so \\- and similarly for the US Congress and other legislatures.\n\n---\n\nIn response to edits in the question:\n\n> Can't the hackneyed sentence ... be shortened?\n\nYes it could, as evidenced by the fact that not all countries use an enacting clause at all, and some of those that do have shorter, simpler ones.\n\n> Why not something less pompous?\n\nWhy should they?\n\nOne shouldn't underestimate the role of tradition in the UK constitution \\- indeed it's held together in part by unwritten conventions whose long use has solidified them into something like law.\n\nAs mentioned in the question, bills don't become acts until they've been assented to by a hereditary monarch, which is indicated by a clerk uttering a statement in Norman French. Compared to that, what's wrong with acts starting with a grandiose statement?\n\n---\n\nIncidentally, if you thank that's pompous, then you'll enjoy the enacting clause which appears at the top of UK [Finance Acts](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/3/introduction/enacted):\n\n> Most Gracious Sovereign\n> \n> \n> WE, Your Majesty\u2019s most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled, towards raising the necessary supplies to defray Your Majesty\u2019s public expenses, and making an addition to the public revenue, have freely and voluntarily resolved to give and to grant unto Your Majesty the several duties hereinafter mentioned; and do therefore most humbly beseech Your Majesty that it may be enacted, and be it enacted by the Queen\u2019s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:\u2014\n\nFinally, context is everything. I would strongly recommend watching a recording of the [State Opening of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Opening_of_Parliament). In addition to all the pomp and circumstance, the main event where is the Queen \\- wearing a priceless bejewelled crown, sitting on a golden throne under a golden canopy, watched by Peers of the Realm dressed in ermine robes \\- reads a speech prepared by the government, in the chamber of the House of Lords, with its golden ceiling, intricate carvings, statues and stained\\-glass windows.

All charges have been dropped.\n\nTo prevail on a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim and defeat the qualified immunity defense in this context, a plaintiff must show that the law enforcement officer intentionally violated a well\\-established constitutional right.\n\nTo use force lawfully to prevent an escape of a suspected criminal, under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution (as incorporated against U.S. states under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution), a police officer may use deadly force to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect (whose status as a suspect is supported by probable cause) only if the officer has a good\\-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. *Tennessee v. Garner*, [471 U.S. 1](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/471/1/) (1985\\).\n\nIn this case, the officer may have had a reasonable suspicion (the car looked similar to one he had been on the lookout for in connection with a car theft case although it was not actually the same one), although not probable cause (since there are many cars of the same color, make, and model of almost any type on the road at any one time), to believe that the car in question was stolen by a person who was not armed other than having the car. This probably doesn't meat the *Garner* test for constitutionality.\n\nAlternatively, the use of force could be justified for self\\-defense or in the defense of others, if the car's hypothetical use as a weapon gave the officer probable cause to believe a suspect posed an imminent threat of serious bodily harm to the officer or others which the use of deadly force could prevent (as discussed in dicta in *Garner*).\n\nIn this case, the question of whether the officer was actually in imminent risk of serious harm, when the officer, in fact, never even came into contact with the car and was off to the side of it, would also be weak.\n\nShooting someone without either justification ought to overcome the qualified immunity defense.\n\nA full qualified immunity legal analysis would cited also to binding precedents from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit restating these U.S. Supreme Court enunciated constitutional right in circumstances as factually similar to this case as possible, to underline the fact that these constitutional rights are \"well\\-established\".

According to the Tennessee v. Garner case, police can only use deadly force if they have a good-faith belief that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. In this case, the teenager was eating in a parked car and did not appear to pose an imminent threat.\n\nOption A is incorrect because reasonable suspicion alone is not sufficient to justify the use of deadly force. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the charges were later dropped, and even if they weren't, evading detention does not necessarily justify the use of deadly force.\n\nOption D is incorrect because qualified immunity does not protect all actions taken by police officers, particularly those that violate clearly established constitutional rights."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/34368/is-it-legal-to-trade-receipts", "docs_id": 34368, "title": "Is it legal to trade receipts", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Companies can claim an expense as long as they have the mean to justify it, usually in the form of invoice or receipt.

The lawyer in question has been doing some questionable things and I am not sure which ones would be considered 'over the line.'\n\nExample:\nThe lawyer set up a call with me to negotiate a pay settlement on some pending deals I had with old employer. I was told (by employer), verbally and in text/email messages that I \"would be paid when the deals closed.\" The lawyer and I had a phone discussion where he said the same thing and he also tried to negotiate my % of the payment down from 30% to 15%. A month later, in writing, he claims I am \"owed nothing\" on the deals in progress.\n\nSo, I have been told I would get paid, by the employer and then the lawyer as well. The lawyer then tried to negotiate with me on the payment amount...and now has changed his tune to \"you are owed nothing.\" Is this kosher? If there is evidence of him doing this, is there some kind of ethical violation here? Would that evidence, in support of my case, be a serious issue for the lawyer should we go to court?\n\nThere was a separate occasion where I asked the lawyer if he had discussed these matters with anyone else. I know that he has, as I am still friendly with an employee that the lawyer spoke to about these matters. He flat out told me that he \"had not discussed it with anyone else\" nor would he.\n\nWhat would be the sensible way to use this information to my advantage while trying to resolve these matters with having to bring suit and go to court? Is there anything that this lawyer should fear, if his unethical behavior was brought to light, either in court or to a bar association? Thanks for any help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are basically two kinds of conduct that you identify.\n\nOne is backing away from what you believe were oral promises made by the employer and lawyer regarding payment. Whatever the status of the promises made by the employer, the oral statements made by the lawyer would probably be viewed by a court or ethics board as settlement offers or proposals rather than actual binding agreements, and this is unlikely to be considered an ethical lapse.\n\nFor purposes of ethics questions and fraud lawsuits, lies about what kind of deal you are willing to make with an adversary don't count as lies. This isn't a terribly logical rule, but is is a well established one.\n\nGiven that:\n\n> I was told (by employer), verbally and in text/email messages that I\n>  \"would be paid when the deals closed.\"\n\nIt is going to be very hard for the employer to take back those written statements and text and email messages are usually given the effect of signed writings in a court of law. This is going to be taken as a confession of the employer regarding the probably unwritten agreement of the parties regarding your right to be paid on these deals, so you would be well advised to stick to your guns on this issue. The percentages will be another point that is hard for the employer to fight if there is a course of dealings between the parties in which you receive a consistent percentage or there was a written agreement concerning your commission percentage.\n\nAlso, even if the lawyer did make a promise and breached it, this would still only be a breach by the employer of a contract made on the employer's behalf by his lawyer. It is not an ethical lapse to breach a contract about future conduct, and a lawyer is not personally responsible for contracts he makes as a disclosed agent of your former employer.\n\nThe second is making a false statement of fact about whom the lawyer has discussed the matter with. Lawyers do have an ethical duty to be truthful and failing to do so is an ethical lapse. But, this duty is generally interpreted to apply only to statements of fact which are material. If a lawyer lies to you about how old he is, or whether he's ever had an affair, in the context of a pre\\-litigation negotiation like this one, the ethical officials won't care. If a lawyer lies to you about something material to the transaction (e.g. claiming that the employer has money in the bank to pay a settlement when in fact it is overdrawn on all of its accounts and has no money coming in and the lawyer knows those facts), this is a serious ethical breach. \n\nIt is hard to see how this information would be material, even though it casts doubt on his credibility.

But no such exception seems to be given allowing you to \"modify\" or \"translate\" the software where technically necessary. I'm not aware of any common computing platform where loading an application does *not* usually involve \"modifying\" it (to link it together in memory with required system dynamic libraries).

In these cases, it returns to its usual red\\-yellow\\-green mode when the system is back up and running.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CJ0GK.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CJ0GK.png)\n\n**Visibility Enhancing Red Only Flashing Red Lights**\n\nBut, sometimes a permanently flashing red light with no other colors is deployed in addition to, or instead of, a stop sign, at intersections where stop sign visibility has been a problem. In these cases there is never a solid red light, or a light of any other color.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is probably a different legal entity from the United Nations (UN) itself and merely affiliated with the UN from a legal perspective, rather than being legally considered to be an agency of the UN. So, the WHO rather than the UN would be the proper defendant.\n\n**Subject Matter Jurisdiction**\n\nFederal courts have limited \"subject matter\" jurisdiction and this must always be analyzed before other jurisdictional considerations are considered. \n\nBut, U.S. District Courts are allowed to adjudicate civil lawsuits where the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and the defendants are not citizens of the same U.S. state. This is a civil lawsuit, the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000, the plaintiffs are citizens of New York State, and the Defendant is not a New York State entity. So, the federal court has subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\n\n**Venue**\n\nVenue is proper in a federal district court if the district court can assert personal jurisdiction over the defendant. \n\nA district court, in turn, has personal jurisdiction over any defendant over whom a state court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located would have personal jurisdiction.\n\nNote, as an aside, that where none of the events giving rise to the suit took place in the state, and the defendant does not reside in the state, any of the U.S. District Courts in the state is a proper venue, whether or not the Plaintiffs reside there, if the general jurisdiction state courts of the state would have personal jurisdiction over the Defendant.\n\n**Personal Jurisdiction**\n\n*General Jurisdiction*\n\nIt appears that the WHO does not have a permanent office for the conduct of business in the United States (it's headquarters is in Switzerland and none of its regional offices are in the U.S.), although it might have a full time representative at the UN offices in New York City. \n\nTherefore, a federal district court in New York State (or a state court in New York State) would probably not have the authority to assert \"general personal jurisdiction\" (i.e. jurisdiction over any case against the defendant without regard to how it arose) over the WHO because this is not a \"headquarters\" or equivalent permanent office in New York State.\n\n*Specific Jurisdiction*\n\nTo have \"specific personal jurisdiction\" over over the WHO (i.e. arising from the facts of the particular case and limited to that case), the WHO would have to have taken actions directed as someone within the state in which the District Court in question is located which would suffice to personally avail itself of the laws of that state and the United States. \n\nFailure to adequately take actions in China for the general benefit of the world, would not suffice to meet that standard. While the injury may have occurred in New York State, the actions alleged did not occur in New York State and were not directed in any particular way to New York State as opposed to anywhere else, and no one is alleging that the WHO intentionally or negligently itself sent coronavirus germs to New York State, even if it may have failed to take certain steps that it had a duty to take, and that failure made the arrival of those germs in New York State possible.\n\n*Tag Jurisdiction*\n\nA third way to acquire personal jurisdiction in some cases is called \"tag jurisdiction.\" \"Tag jurisdiction\" provides a court with personal jurisdiction over an individual in a particular case in the state where personal service of process upon that individual took place, without regard to other considerations. But, \"tag jurisdiction\" does not apply to entities such as the WHO.\n\n**Governmental Immunity**\n\nMoreover, even if a U.S. District Court did have personal jurisdiction over the WHO, this action would be a \"tort\" action and the WHO would also almost certainly have some form of sovereign immunity under U.S. law from a tort action of this type.\n\nThe relevant U.S. statute is the [International Organizations Immunities Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organizations_Immunities_Act) (full text [here](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title22/chapter7/subchapter18&edition=prelim)). The key provision for purposes of this question is 22 U.S.C. \u00a7288a(b) which states:\n\n> International organizations, their property and their assets, wherever\n>  located, and by whomsoever held, shall enjoy the same immunity from\n>  suit and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign\n>  governments, except to the extent that such organizations may\n>  expressly waive their immunity for the purpose of any proceedings or\n>  by the terms of any contract.\n\nThe definition of an International Organization for the purposes of the act is [22 U.S.C. \u00a7 288](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/288) which provides a general rule protecting international organizations in the absence of an executive order to the contrary. The President may revoke an international organization's immunity prospectively by executive order (except in the case of 13 organizations who are covered by a specific statutory provision; the WHO is not one of them), but neither a private organization nor a U.S. state or local government, may do so. And, an executive order purporting to revoke an organization's immunity retroactively would be void as an *ex post facto* determination.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, then, this lawsuit will very likely be dismissed either for lack of personal jurisdiction, or on account of an immunity from tort liability doctrine, in response to a motion to dismiss, without ever getting any further. It might also be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted on other grounds (e.g. the lack of a legal duty or the lack of plausible allegations sufficient to support the claim that the WHO's actions or inactions were a legal cause of the harm suffered).\n\n**Footnote Re Legal Basis For The Claim On The Merits**\n\n> It is unclear which statute is violated.\n\nIt would be unusual for a claim for personal injury to arise under a statute. Most claims for personal injury are brought on the basis of a common law claim of negligence which would arise from the case law of New York State's state courts in this case (pursuant to the *Erie* doctrine).\n\nA negligence claim has four canonical elements: \n\n1. The existence of a legal duty (normally the legal duty to use reasonable care to refrain from causing injury to others) of the defendant that runs to the plaintiffs.\n2. Breach of the legal duty by the defendant.\n3. The causation of the damages alleged by the breach of the legal duty by the defendant in a foreseeable manner.\n4. Actual damage to the plaintiffs."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the lawsuit filed against the World Health Organization (WHO) in White Plains federal court over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak?\n\nA) The lawsuit is likely to succeed because the WHO clearly violated U.S. federal statutes in its handling of the pandemic.\n\nB) The case will probably be dismissed due to lack of personal jurisdiction or immunity from tort liability, without consideration of the merits.\n\nC) The federal court has subject matter jurisdiction, so the case will definitely proceed to trial on its merits.\n\nD) The plaintiffs can easily overcome any jurisdictional issues by proving the WHO's negligence caused their injuries.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The lawsuit against the WHO is likely to face significant legal hurdles that will probably result in its dismissal before the merits of the case are even considered. The key issues are:\n\n1. Personal Jurisdiction: It's unlikely that a New York federal court would have personal jurisdiction over the WHO, as the organization doesn't have a permanent office in the U.S. and its alleged actions weren't specifically directed at New York.\n\n2. Immunity: The International Organizations Immunities Act likely provides the WHO with immunity from this type of lawsuit, similar to the immunity enjoyed by foreign governments.\n\n3. Subject Matter Jurisdiction: While the federal court does have subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity and the amount in controversy, this alone is not sufficient for the case to proceed.\n\n4. Merits of the Claim: Even if jurisdictional issues were overcome, the plaintiffs would face challenges in establishing a legal duty, breach, and causation required for a negligence claim.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the case doesn't primarily involve violation of U.S. statutes.

The Texas state government enjoys sovereign immunity, except as specified under the [Tort Claims Act](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/docs/cp/htm/cp.101.htm). Under that law, immunity is waived only in the case of damage caused by negligence of a state employee, and is limited primarily to vehicle accidents and physical injuries.

An individual would not enjoy such immunity, but given the law, there is no identifiable defendant to seek relief from (*everybody* is a potential defendant). An former abortion provider who now declines to perform an abortion can't be sued, because doctors in general have no obligation to perform particular medical procedures (most doctors in Texas *won't* perform an abortion, even before SB8\\), and the course will not render a judgment against a doctor on the grounds that they obeyed an existing law but should have known that it would be found unconstitutional."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: If the Supreme Court finds Texas Senate Bill 8 (SB8) unconstitutional, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal recourse for affected parties?\n\nA) Women denied abortions can sue the state of Texas for damages under the Tort Claims Act.\nB) Abortion providers can seek compensation from individual citizens who reported them under SB8.\nC) Impacted parties have no viable path for financial relief due to sovereign immunity and the law's structure.\nD) Doctors who refused to perform abortions while SB8 was in effect can be held liable for damages.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because the passage explains that there is \"no prospect for equitable relief\" if SB8 is found unconstitutional.

About two years ago, my bathroom sink overflowed, and flooded her bathroom below it and part of her kitchen. I helped to clean up the mess, and agreed to pay for damages, which consisted of damage to the drywall, because it had gotten wet. I got estimates from contractors, but did not schedule the work, because, at the time, I didn't have the money to pay them. In an association meeting last year, I brought up the fact that water enters the basement when it rains, and that we should get estimates to have the foundation repaired. She fronted me off, and said to take care of her condo drywall first. Actually, she did not want to deal with the foundation issues because of the expense. So, I got another estimate, and scheduled the work, with plans to pay them after the project was completed. She agreed to have the work done. A couple of weeks before the work was to be done, I emailed her a release form and explained that I would need her to sign it if the work was done satisfactorily, and that it would release me from all liability regarding the flooding. She said she couldn't sign it, and that she would go through her homeowner's insurance. So, I cancelled the appointment with the contractor.\n\nShe said that her homeowner's insurance reviewed the bylaws and that any damages caused by a unit owner that is not covered by insurance needs to be paid by the unit owner who caused the damages. Her deductible is $500, so she said I owe her $500\\. Much of the conversation was via email, and I requested the repair bill, to which she never responded. \n\nShe's also the Treasurer, so every month I submit my association dues to her. Every month, she would scream at me about paying the $500, and would not let me say anything, but would slam her door in my face, after she gave me the receipt for the association dues. One time, she did let me respond, and I said, \"As soon as I receive a repair bill,\" to which she screamed, \"You don't get a repair bill!!! You're not paying for the whole project, you're only paying $500\\...\" \n\nFast forward to this week's association meeting, which was over a year from the last one, even though we're supposed to have at least four meetings a year. She distributed minutes that she typed up from the last association meeting, in which she wrote lies about me regarding the flooding, and that were not discussed in the association meeting last year. She also said that I caused damage to her bathroom in another flooding incident, but never mentioned anything to me about it until several years after she had tile replaced, and said it costed her $1800\\. There are only six condo units, so to have a quorum to vote on anything, at least four voting members would have to agree. Only three showed up to the meeting, the President, another condo owner, and I. So, we just talked about what was going on, and she suggested raising the association dues, because expenses were going up. Both the other condo owner and I were in agreement, but since we couldn't vote, she planned to type up something and have at least four sign off on it later. \n\nHer spreading lies about me is fine.

That being said, the relation between \"*sign\\[ing] for \\[your] vote*\" and signing off on the president's minutes is unclear. Thus, these are separate issues requiring separate analyses.\n\nFrom your description, I gather that your vote only has to do with the question of raising the association dues, and that it bears no relation to her false statements about you. Although deciding your *vote* on the basis of her unrelated falsehoods seems pointless \\-\\-and perhaps retaliatory or vexatious\\-\\-, from a legal standpoint there is nothing wrong with you adopting that criterion.\n\nBy contrast, it would be detrimental for you to sign off on *minutes* that contain falsehoods about you. That is because your endorsement of the minutes might be used by her as \"evidence\" of your *admission* of liability in the event that she brings court proceedings against you regarding the pre\\-existing dispute (the one which prompts her to publish the falsehoods).\n\nThe minutes might strictly purport that *she said* those things about you, rather than you *having done* those things. Even in that case, signing off on the minutes without your rebuttal/clarification being reflected therein memorializes \\& can carry a defamatory import (in addition to the aforementioned evidence of admission).\n\nAccordingly, you might want to ensure that the dispute \\-\\-which she should not mix in her capacity of president\\-\\- and the vote are not so intertwined in her minutes."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given scenario:\n\nQuestion: In the condominium association scenario described, what is the most appropriate course of action for the condo owner regarding the association meeting minutes and the vote to raise dues?\n\nA) Sign off on the minutes as presented and vote to raise the dues to maintain good relations with the association president.\n\nB) Refuse to sign the minutes or vote on raising dues until the president removes all false statements about the owner.\n\nC) Sign off on the minutes but add a written objection to any false statements, then vote separately on raising dues based on the association's financial needs.\n\nD) Ignore the minutes entirely and focus solely on voting for or against raising dues based on personal financial considerations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate course of action because it allows the condo owner to address the false statements in the minutes without conflating this issue with the separate matter of raising dues. By adding a written objection to any false statements in the minutes, the owner creates a record of their disagreement, which can protect them from potential legal implications of appearing to admit liability. At the same time, voting separately on raising dues based on the association's financial needs demonstrates a commitment to the association's well-being, regardless of personal conflicts with the president. This approach maintains a clear distinction between personal disputes and association business, which is important for the proper functioning of the condo association.\n\nOption A is incorrect because signing off on minutes containing false statements could be used as evidence of admission of liability in future disputes. Option B is too extreme and could be seen as obstructing association business.

United States to not touch upon findings of guilt but instead punishment, sentencing, and incarceration (as if whether or not a defendant had free will influences those aspects of a criminal case rather than influences a finding of criminal guilt).\n\nWhere in U.S. law is it officially argued that the U.S. criminal justice system presumes defendants commit crimes with free will?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is an unquestioned pre\\-American axiom, expressed in Latin as *actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea* (\"the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty\") which has been part of the Anglo\\-American legal system since at least the 17th century. It is thus presupposed in all criminal proceedings. It's not that a person only commits a crime with free will, it's that it is not deemed to be a crime if there is no free will. A person can be held at gunpoint and required to commit a criminal act: the person does indeed have free will to choose to be killed rather than commit the act, but the act is legally excused since dying is never held to be the only acceptable alternative to committing an otherwise\\-criminal act."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the relationship between free will and criminal culpability in the U.S. legal system?\n\nA) Free will is only considered during sentencing and has no bearing on the determination of guilt.\n\nB) The absence of free will is a defense that must be proven by the defendant to avoid conviction.\n\nC) The presence of free will is presumed in criminal proceedings, and its absence may provide grounds for excusing otherwise criminal acts.\n\nD) Free will is irrelevant to the U.S. criminal justice system and is not considered in any legal proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The U.S. legal system operates on the presumption that individuals possess free will when committing criminal acts. This concept is rooted in the Latin maxim \"actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea,\" which suggests that an act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty. The presence of free will is assumed in criminal proceedings, and its absence or significant impairment (such as acting under duress) may provide grounds for excusing otherwise criminal acts. \n\nOption A is incorrect because free will is considered in determining guilt, not just in sentencing. Option B is incorrect because the presence of free will is presumed, not its absence. Option D is incorrect because free will is highly relevant to the U.S. criminal justice system and forms a foundational principle in criminal law."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36701/am-i-required-to-re-attach-neighbours-gate-to-my-fence-post", "docs_id": 36701, "title": "Am I required to re-attach neighbours gate to my fence post?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I\u2019ve had my my fence replaced including new posts, which I\u2019m 100% sure is my my fence, post, and boundary.\n\nPreviously the neighbour\u2019s gate was directly attached to my fence post, I\u2019ve allowed it to be re\\-attached to the new post but was I legally required to do so?\n\nCould I have simply removed the gate and left it on their side of the boundary?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on who is [responsible](https://www.inbrief.co.uk/neighbour-disputes/ownership-of-fences/) for the boundary.\n\nIf they are responsible then you have done them a kindness by building a fence for them.

The fifth consideration is \"transformativeness\". W.r.t. purpose of the use, your use would likely be found to be \"fair\", except for the Youtube monetization problem.

Do these rights differ if the DVD is (a) publicily sold for profit, (b) privately sold for profit (e.g. just to those associated with the production), (c) privately distributed for free?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It would literally take nearly a treatise to answer this question and it would still be more theoretical rather than practical, as the answer to this question will inevitably be one largely born of a variety of licenses and contractual agreements and will differ with each production. What follows is only an overview of the typical course of how these converging rights get addressed and parsed out.\n\nIn a stage play or a film, the producer(s) are the ones who fund or raise all the money without which the production would never come to fruition. They are the ones responsible for the underpinnings of all the manner of IP that goes into a production. As you (likely) know, the production will begin with a writing (the script), to which copyright originates with the author (unless the work is commissioned from the beginning). However, it is not always that a producer's vision begins with a pre\\-ordained screen or stageplay. It may begin with a book, or an article, or a short story, etcetera, that may then be transitioned into a piece that can be performed. This transition may or may not be created by the originating author; in the case of not, the built upon work would result in its own, new copyright.\n\nSo, while the producer may not be the author, or even responsible for the vision behind of the original idea for the screenplay, without their imagination, planning, and money \\- a film or stage project is unlikely to ever be....well....produced. Throughout the entire process, it is typical that the producer (actually, the producers' lawyers) will negotiate multiple agreements that define how the IP rights will be dispersed from inception to a project's completion. A production includes creative material that would, if created independent of the whole, give rise to numerous copyrights vested in a variety of individuals. This would be very messy to say the least, and would be untenable when the goal is one cohesive work when the final version is complete. Practically speaking, if everyone retained an individual copyright in their creative contribution, it would be analogous to each thread claiming responsibility if not ownership for the shape of the garment. \n\nWhen a production agreement is drafted, it will typically result in the final rights vesting in one entity (although not always); this, usually being the producer/production company, and from that agreement varying rights of remuneration will flow to the various contributing entities.\n\nWhile the producer/production company will *typically* own all the combined copyrights to a given production as a whole when the production is finalized, there will likely be licenses or limited copyrights retained for the explicit use of the parts in separate endeavors (eg. soundtracks or the right to perform a score one composed). Since the input of the various creative contributors will be used in the production of the whole, each contributor is remunerated in a variety of ways. This can be anything from the commissioning of a work whereby a lump payment creates the ownership of the copyright, to payments for the work as it occurs, to royalties for each time a work is viewed or sold in reproduced form, to partial ownership rights in the completed work (much more rare) or any combination of these things. \n\nThese agreements are foundational to any production, as without them, courts throughout the world have recognized, and alike failed to recognize, various copyrights in all manner of contribution. They (the agreements) arise out of the combined tenets of copyright and contract law, and are typically known as or referred to as chain of title documentation. This conglomeration of titles, licenses, contracts, copyrights, trademarks and so\\-on, are how this equation is resolved. It is different with each production, although there are formulaic ways of compiling these chains of titles\n\n(See: *From Script to Screen; What Role for Intellectual Property* at [http://www.wipo.int/ip\\-outreach/en/ipday/2014/ip\\_and\\_film.html](http://www.wipo.int/ip-outreach/en/ipday/2014/ip_and_film.html) as well as \n[http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/copyright/950/wipo\\_pub\\_950\\.pdf](http://www.wipo.int/edocs/pubdocs/en/copyright/950/wipo_pub_950.pdf) *Securing Rights* for a comprehensive discussion of the varying types of agreements producers need to negotiate.)\n\nJust think, each production, at minimum, has: a script, a variety of actors (who may have copyrights in their performances, separate from the scripted words), directors whose vision lends to the flow of the work, cinematography, costume designer and creators, make\\-up artists (if unique enough, their designs can hold copyright\\-for example a certain henna tattoo design), stage/set designers and creators, musical scores that were composed and performed (rights flow to each), and myriad other creations that go into a production. \n\nThese chain of title compilations are some of the most lengthy and complex commercial transactions arising under IP law, with so many moving parts to draft, negotiate, revise, renegotiate and finalize. This legal process alone can often take up the bulk of preproduction planning and expense."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a theatrical production that is filmed for DVD release, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ownership and distribution of intellectual property rights?\n\nA) The venue where the play was performed automatically owns the rights to the filmed performance.\n\nB) The actors retain individual copyrights for their performances, which cannot be transferred to the producer.\n\nC) The person who filmed and edited the performance typically owns all rights to the final DVD product.\n\nD) The producer usually negotiates agreements that result in the final rights vesting in one entity, often the production company, with various remuneration arrangements for contributors.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, producers typically negotiate a complex set of agreements known as \"chain of title\" documentation. These agreements usually result in the final rights vesting in one entity, often the producer or production company. This arrangement allows for a cohesive management of the various intellectual property rights involved in a production.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the venue does not automatically own rights to the filmed performance. The rights are typically negotiated and assigned through contracts.\n\nAnswer B is inaccurate because while actors may have initial rights to their performances, these rights are usually transferred or licensed to the producer through contractual agreements.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the person who filmed and edited the performance is just one of many contributors to the final product. Their rights, like those of other contributors, are typically negotiated as part of the overall production agreements.\n\nOption D correctly reflects the complex nature of intellectual property rights in theatrical and film productions, where multiple creative contributions are consolidated under one entity's control through careful legal negotiation and agreement."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53107/illegal-to-sell-textbook-notes", "docs_id": 53107, "title": "Illegal to sell textbook notes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Would it be illegal to sell notes that I have made using my own reading and understanding of a textbook and nothing else (like nothing from lectures of classes (they were all online so there were no lectures)).

But we can indicate some aspects of the relevant law.\n\nThe particular license that a developer grants is not as important as who holds the copyright, and the terms of the contract between developer and client, which may include specifying the license.\n\nLet us call the developer D, and the client C. D will hold the initial copyright for the software unless it is a work\\-made\\-for\\-hire (WFH). In the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), under 17 USC 101, a work can be a WFH in two ways. Either a) the creator (D) is a regular employee of C, acting within the scope of D's employment, or b)\nthere is an explicit written contract saying that the work is a WFH, **and** the work falls into one of a limited set of categories. Neither a) nor b) seems to apply to the situation described in the question.\n\nThat the developer (D) grants a license to the client (C) shows that D holds the copyright. A transfer of copyright would be a different agreement (and must be in writing in the US).\n\nC and D will want to have a written contract that specifies who holds the copyright, and what rights each has. This will affect the price for the work.\n\nSince C wants to create a company based on the software to be created, and sell interests in it or acquire funding, D will need to be able to clearly show that the rights to the IP involved are secure. D will want either the transfer of the copyright, or at least a permanent, non\\-revocable license. D may well want such a license to be exclusive, as well. D will not want any opensource or copyleft license to be used.\n\nNote that even if the agreement transfers the copyright from D to C, under 17 USC 106A D retrains the right to assert authorship, which cannot be transferred waived. Many other countries, particularly European countries, grant a similar \"moral right\" to the author. This right could be mentioned and acknowledged in any contract between C and D.\n\nIf D's primary interest is to be able to show others the significance of D's work, that might be sufficient. If D wants to be able to resell the developed code, or part of it, then a transfer of copyright will not serve D. In that case C and D should agree on just what rights D will have.

According to the documentation, using brand names like \"Colt\" to accurately represent historical weapons in a game is considered nominative use and is generally acceptable. This allows developers to maintain historical accuracy. However, using such brand names in the game's title (e.g., \"Colt Single Action Simulator 1848\") could be problematic as it might be seen as using the trademark to market the game itself, rather than just representing the historical weapon.

New York, was characterized by the Supreme Court striking down economic regulations adopted by states based on the Court's own notions of the most appropriate means for states to implement their policies. This period, roughly from 1897 to 1937, saw the Court routinely overturning legislation that restricted \"freedom of contract\" on the grounds that such laws violated due process.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Court often struck down, rather than upheld, state laws regulating working conditions during this period.\n\nOption B is correct as it accurately describes the Court's approach during the Lochner era.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the Court did protect freedom of contract, it did so through interpretation of the Due Process Clause, not by claiming it was an explicitly stated constitutional right.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Court during this era was notably not deferential to legislative bodies, including Congress, on economic regulations.\n\nThis question tests understanding of a significant period in U.S. constitutional law history and its implications for economic regulations and judicial interpretation."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93679/how-do-war-survivors-claim-damages", "docs_id": 93679, "title": "How do war survivors claim damages?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A Modern Example:\n\nNumerous Ukrainians survivors have had their homes destroyed by Russian missiles.

This means the Russian government has to tell the Russian courts that they allow people to sue Russia for specific, enumerated things.

The documentation indicates that currently, there is no direct recourse for Ukrainian civilians to claim damages against Russia due to sovereign immunity. Any potential claims would likely depend on the terms negotiated in a peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia, which could establish a framework for reparations or compensation. Additionally, changes to Russian laws regarding sovereign immunity could potentially allow for such claims.

Do any countries' copyright laws explicitly discuss this situation, or is there any relevant case law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That is the case in the state of Washington, for example. All property acquired during a marriage is considered community property. This can make things complicated since there are state\\-specific rules that can arise in case of a divorce ([Enovsys LLC v. Nextel Communications, Inc](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1533724.html): the couple declared *no* community property at the time of the divorce, meaning the wife who was not a party in in infringement case, had no standing \u2013 and therefore the infringement suit could procede).

There are 9 US states with community property regimes: it is also the law for Sweden, Germany, France and Italy.\n\nIn the US, permission from one author is sufficient to constitute \"having permission\" w.r.t. copyright: an owner of the copyright can license the work, and you do not have to get permission from all owners. This does not invalidate an open source license: spouse 1 can grant such a license even if spouse 2 refuses to grant such a license.\n\n[Rodrigue v. Rodrigue](https://casetext.com/case/rodrigue-v-rodrigue), 218 F.3d 432 partially answers the question in Louisiana specifically w.r.t. copyright. A lower court held that the state\\-specific quirk of giving a non\\-author an equal interest in copyrighted IP must be swept away in the interest of uniformity of federal law. The lower court indeed rejected an argument based on [17 USC 301](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/301) which declares federal law to be superior to legal or equitable rights that are equivalent to that set out in Title 17: but community property law is *not* equivalent to Title 17, it's much broader. The higher courts reasoning is a tall wall of words which boils down the their conclusion that \"we disagree with the district court only to the extent that it held the conflict between Louisiana community property law and federal copyright law irreconcilable absent congressional intercession\", and having found a way that didn't involve Congress, they declared the work\\-creator to be the sole owner of the IP created during the marriage.

Rodrigue case, federal copyright law does not always automatically supersede state community property laws. Courts have found ways to reconcile the two in some cases.\n\nOption C is incorrect. The given information states that permission from one author (or spouse) is sufficient for granting an open source license, even if the other spouse refuses.\n\nOption D is correct. The information provided, particularly the Rodrigue v. Rodrigue case, demonstrates that the impact of community property laws on copyright ownership can indeed vary by state.

Or will this need to be determined in a court to determine if it is fair use?\n\nAlso, would this be a case of civil law (so the owner would need to file a lawsuit) or criminal law if it is done on a small scale without making any profit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Given the specific questions you're asking, any court action in the US would be a civil suit brought by the copyright owner, not a criminal prosecution brought by the Dept. of Justice. [This letter from the DoJ](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1841-copyright-law-prosecution-policy) explains the policy on prosecutions and while they are non\\-committal on many issues, it is clear that\n\n> the statutory scheme also requires that the government prove, as an\n> element to any criminal violation\\-\\-felony or misdemeanor\\-\\-that the\n> infringement has occurred \"willfully and for purposes of commercial\n> advantage or private financial gain.\"\n\nEven if making thumb\\-drive backups is a violation of the EULA, it is not criminal infringement.\n\nThen one must inspect whatever license terms exist for use of the content. Musical content is often vended with minimal licensing of unclear authority, but commercial software is generally vended with a license agreement that is directly presented to you and you have to at least say \"I agree\". A license might explicitly allow, forbid, or be silent on a particular kind of copying. Copyright protection only protects the creations of the creator A, and does not lay claim to the creations of user B who uses A's software. Therefore you can sell documents that you create with Word for large sums of money, as well as backing them up.\n\nWhether or not you can use \"peripheral stuff\" created by the copyright holder, such as clip\\-art, depends on what the license says. Some such files are licenses for any usage, not everything is. Explicit statements of permission are very useful in that situation (also explicit denials). If you cannot find an explicit statement covering your case, there is a risk that you are violating copyright law by copying material without permission.\n\nIn general, one has or had non\\-statutory permission to make backups of your installed \"stuff\" (software, ancilliary files, music and so on). It is *not* safe to assume that you have permission to make duplicate copies of an installation CD (if you have one), rather, the installation CD *is* the backup and you execute the installed copy. It is also not guaranteed that you have permission to make backup copies on other devices, indeed there may be technical means implemented to limit you to just one installation (which can cause problems if you don't uninstall before the drive crashes). It's all in the agreement, and there is a reasonable chance that with current software, you do not have permission to make a backup copy. [17 USC 117](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/117) has a provision for \"archival copies\":\n\n> that such new copy or adaptation is for archival purposes only and\n> that all archival copies are destroyed in the event that continued\n> possession of the computer program should cease to be rightful\n\nbut this exception is only extended to\n\n> the owner of a copy of a computer program to make or authorize the\n> making of another copy or adaptation of that computer program\n\nHowever, even if you paid money, you are not necessarily the owner of a copy of the program, you may be only a licensee or renter. The [Regster of Coprights](https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2010/08/05/register-of-copyrights-says-who-knows-on-ownership-of-computer-program-copies/) does not know (cannot legally determine) if you are the owner of a copy of Word 2003\\.

Many software licenses, including Microsoft's, allow for a single backup copy for archival purposes. The law (17 USC 117) provides some provisions for archival copies, but these are limited and depend on whether the user is considered an owner or just a licensee of the software. The action described is unlikely to result in criminal charges, as criminal copyright infringement typically requires willful infringement for commercial advantage or financial gain. However, it could potentially be a civil issue if it violates the terms of the license agreement.

Email addressees are owned by the person who controls the access to the email account at the email provider, i.e. the login and password. (For simplicity, I'm ignoring the fact that the individual's listed name on the email account can come into play in ownership disputes).\n\nA Facebook page is owned by the owner of the administrative email for the account at that service. A domain is owned by the domain registrant, who opens an account at a domain registrar with an email and registers the domain. The domain registrant administers the ownership of the domain via an administrative email, and that email owned by the person who has the access to that email account. \n\nVery basically, in your situation, if you want to *\"establish legal ownership\"* of a web property owned and/or administered by someone else, you determine if there is a contract in place (written or verbal) that established your partial ownership to the property, or an agreement to transfer full ownership of the property to you at some point. See [Elements of a Contract \u2014 Judicial Education Center](http://jec.unm.edu/education/online-training/contract-law-tutorial/contract-fundamentals-part-2).\n\nIf there is an agreement or contract to transfer full ownership to you, execute the contract. Have everyone sign off on it and do the technical transfer of the property, i.e. change ownership and access of the email account associated with the property.\n\nIf there is an agreement or contract that you have partial ownership and you want full ownership, you attempt to renegotiate the contract, if both parties agree to renegotiate. Or you go to court and let a court decide the status of the contract.\n\nIf there isn't an contract and/or agreement in place regarding your current partial or future ownership of the property, you're out of luck. Whoever owns the property owns it.\n\nYou can go to court alleging something, like breach of contract, or you deserve the property (such as a domain or email address or Facebook page) because it's the same as your business name, but that's your choice.\n\nFurther, in particular to domain names, there is also a dispute resolution process [Uniform Domain\\-Name Dispute\\-Resolution Policy \\- ICANN](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/help/dndr/udrp-en) that seeks to resolve *trademark\\-based domain\\-name* disputes, which may or not be relevant in your question, which is primarily about ownership.

In this scenario, Tom used his personal email to set up these accounts, which gives him technical control and, in many cases, legal ownership. The key point is that without a clear contract specifying ownership or transfer of these properties to Jane's business, Tom likely retains legal ownership.

But you could get trouble if your presentation of a trademark is seen as indicating that the object was *made by* the company.

The First Sale doctrine allows for the transformation of legally purchased items into new objects without copyright infringement. However, trademark issues can arise if the presentation suggests the new product was made by the original company. To avoid legal troubles, the business owner must clearly indicate that the products are recycled and not manufactured by the original designers. This approach balances the ability to reuse materials while respecting trademark rights and avoiding consumer confusion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the business model isn't completely illegal.

I\u2019ll address the second part first (where Rob argues for the decision in Bob\u2019s favour to be overturned in his response to Bob's appeal), because it\u2019s easier. For both parties to partially succeed at trial, and both parties to contend on appeal that they should have been wholly successful, is not that unusual. It is usually called a cross\\-appeal in Commonwealth jurisdictions, or in the Supreme Court of the United States, a cross\\-petition.\n\nAn example from the United Kingdom: in [*R (on the application of Carmichael and Rourke) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions*](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2014-0125-press-summary.pdf) \\[2016] UKSC 58, the court dealt with four appeals arising out of challenges to the so\\-called [bedroom tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedroom_tax).

Both A\u2019 and the Rutherfords\u2019 Equality Act claims were rejected. The Secretary of State appeals the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to allow the Rutherfords\u2019 and A\u2019s discrimination claims. A cross\\-appeals the rejection of her Equality Act claim \u2026 The Secretary of State\u2019s appeal in respect of A is allowed, and A\u2019s cross appeal is dismissed, by a majority of 5 to 2\\.\n\nThe first part of your question is more difficult, which is why you have received two conflicting answers. Usually appellate courts have the formal power to go beyond the issues raised by the parties, as pointed out by @Dale M. In any event, if an apex court exceeds its powers, there is no further court of appeal to say so. However, as @ohwilleke points out, to decide the case on a ground not argued violates due process. When an appellate court does this, it is said to act \u201con its own motion\u201d or [*sua sponte*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sua_sponte).\n\nAs @ohwilleke says, in the United States, appellate courts may be able to *affirm* the trial court\u2019s decision for any reason supported by the record, even if not raised by any party. This is the \u201cright for any reason\u201d or [tipsy coachman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsy_Coachman) doctrine. However, your question asks whether a court can *overturn* part of decision not appealed against. That is, by appealing his partial win, does Bob run the risk of the court ruling *sua sponte* that he ought to have suffered a complete loss?\n\nThis is discussed in Miller, \u2018[Sua Sponte Appellate Rulings: When Courts Deprive Litigants of an Opportunity to Be Heard](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sanlr39&div=41&id=&page=),\u2019 39 *San Diego Law Review* 1253 (2002\\). In the introduction, Miller observes:\n\n> In fact, some of the Supreme Court's most famous opinions decided issues not presented by the briefs or addressed below. In [*Erie Railroad v. Tompkins*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Railroad_Co._v._Tompkins), the Court overturned sua sponte an ancient precedent on applying the common law in diversity cases. [*Mapp v. Ohio*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapp_v._Ohio) overrules a prior case and applied the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule to the states, without briefing or argument on the issue. In [*Washington v. Davis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_v._Davis), the Court decided that Title VII standards did not apply to constitutional discrimination, even though the parties had agreed that they did. [*Younger v. Harris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_v._Harris) prohibits injunctions against pending state court criminal cases, even though the issue was not argued on appeal. Indeed, in [*Stanley v. Illinois*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_v._Illinois), the Court held that due process requires hearings and an opportunity to make submissions before a state can terminate the parental rights of unwed fathers. But the Court decided this without briefing or argument \u2013 without a hearing on the issue or an opportunity for the parties to make submissions.\n\nMost of those cases involve a petition for certiorari in which the petitioner got more than they asked for. However, *Younger v. Harris* is closer to the Bob/Rob scenario. Younger, the [District Attorney of Los Angeles County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_District_Attorney), prosecuted Harris under the [California Criminal Syndicalism Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Criminal_Syndicalism_Act). Before the criminal trial, Harris sued Younger in the Federal District Court, which held the Act void for vagueness and overbreadth, and enjoined the prosecution. Younger appealed to the Supreme Court, but rather than determining whether the Act was constitutional, the Supreme Court reversed the district court\u2019s decision on the ground that federal courts should only enjoin state criminal prosecutions in extraordinary circumstances. So, Younger \u201cwon,\u201d but Harris\u2019s constitutional argument remained open and supported by the district court\u2019s opinion, which Younger could not challenge again without first securing a conviction at trial.\n\nTo summarise, appellate courts sometimes do overturn decisions based on arguments not raised by the parties. However, this is exceptional and is generally considered procedurally unfair. If an appellate court thinks the parties have missed an important legal argument, it is more common and appropriate for the court to raise it at the hearing, and invite the parties to consider and make submissions about it."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In an appellate court case, Bob appeals a lower court decision on question Y, having won on question X. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the appellate court's power and typical practice?\n\nA) The appellate court has no authority to review question X unless Rob files a cross-appeal.\n\nB) The appellate court can overturn the decision on question X sua sponte, but this is common practice.\n\nC) The appellate court has the formal power to review question X sua sponte, but rarely does so due to procedural fairness concerns.\n\nD) The appellate court must always review all aspects of the lower court's decision, regardless of what was specifically appealed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Appellate courts generally have the formal power to go beyond the issues raised by the parties and can theoretically review and overturn decisions sua sponte (on their own motion). However, this is exceptional and generally considered procedurally unfair. Courts rarely exercise this power, especially to overturn a decision not appealed, due to due process concerns. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because appellate courts do have the authority to review issues not specifically appealed, even without a cross-appeal, though they rarely exercise this power.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while courts can theoretically overturn decisions sua sponte, this is not common practice due to fairness concerns.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because appellate courts are not obligated to review all aspects of a lower court's decision. They typically focus on the issues raised in the appeal.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the nuanced reality that courts have broad formal powers but are constrained by procedural fairness considerations in practice."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73991/are-gun-manuals-protected-under-the-second-amendment", "docs_id": 73991, "title": "Are gun manuals protected under the second amendment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My understanding of the second amendment is that it covers a wide class of weapons such as knives in addition to firearms.\n\nMy question is given that gun manuals inform individuals on how to operate firearms, and thus elevates an individual's ability to protect themselves, does this elevate it to the status of a second amendment protected property?\n\nAs a side note, I am aware that gun manuals would likely already be covered by the first amendment, making them legal regardless. I am asking specifically about their protection status under the second amendment.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One can only be certain when a case is decided by SCOTUS, and so far, no law has attempted to ban the publication of manuals for firearms.\n[Jackson v. City of S.F.](https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf), 746 F.3d 953 gives good reason to think that the court would find such a ban unconstitutional. There is an analogous line of thinking regarding ammunition regulations, where some municipalities took the position that ammunition is not \"arms\" and therefore is not protected, since the amendment does not explicitly say \"and ammunition\". The Jackson court comments that\n\n> A regulation eliminating a person's ability to obtain or use\n> ammunition could thereby make it impossible to use firearms for their\n> core purpose\n\nreferring to [Heller](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf), and SCOTUS's finding that\n\n> the Second Amendment protects an individual\u2019s right to\n> possess firearms and that the city\u2019s total ban on handguns, as\n> well as its requirement that firearms in the home be kept\n> nonfunctional even when necessary for self\\-defense, violated that right.\n\nThe Jackson court\n\n> conclude\\[s] that prohibitions on the sale of ammunition do not fall\n> outside \u201cthe historical understanding of the scope of the \\[Second\n> Amendment] right.\u201d\n\nThe reasoning that brings ammunition within the scope of Second Amendment protection applies equally well to e.g. ammo cases, gun oil, cleaning brushes, and instruction manuals, all of which are necessary to the lawful exercise of one's Second Amendment rights. See also [Ezell v. Chicago](https://casetext.com/case/ezell-v-city-of-chicago#p708), 651 F.3d 684 which holds that\n\n> the right to possess firearms \"implies a corresponding right to\n> acquire and maintain proficiency in their use\"\n\nand thus a ban on firing ranges violates the Second Amendment."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the legal precedents discussed in Jackson v. City of S.F. and Ezell v. Chicago, which of the following items would most likely be considered protected under the Second Amendment?\n\nA) A book on firearm safety and maintenance\nB) A subscription to a gun enthusiast magazine\nC) A video game featuring realistic gun combat\nD) A decorative gun-shaped keychain\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A) A book on firearm safety and maintenance. \n\nThe reasoning in Jackson v. City of S.F. extends Second Amendment protections to items necessary for the lawful exercise of one's right to bear arms. The court's logic regarding ammunition can be applied to other essential items like gun manuals, cleaning supplies, and training materials. \n\nAdditionally, Ezell v. Chicago established that the right to possess firearms implies a right to \"acquire and maintain proficiency in their use.\" A book on firearm safety and maintenance directly supports this right by providing essential knowledge for proper and safe firearm use.\n\nOption B, while related to firearms, is not as directly tied to the functionality and safe use of firearms as a manual would be. Options C and D are even further removed from the core purpose of the Second Amendment as interpreted by these court decisions, as they don't directly contribute to the ability to own, maintain, or use firearms for self-defense."}}
