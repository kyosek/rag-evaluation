Real estate agents have an inherit benefit of a buyer paying a higher price for a home as they get more commission since its based on a percent of the home's final sell price. If you can prove they give you advice in offering a higher price than required to buy the home. Can they be held liable for something?\n\nAnother example, What if you want to make a lowball offer on a home. The buyers agent says \"Hey to guarantee you get the home, you can offer over asking price by 40K and still get the home\". You say to them, \"I can offer at asking or below and still get the home. Why should I over pay?\". They then proceed to say they will put in the offer but never do. Then the home sells for the same amount you proposed to them. Are they liable for not putting in the offer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since you ask specifically about [fiduciary duties](https://www.thebalancemoney.com/fiduciary-definition-2866602) ...\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese exist in common law and are in addition to and complement any statutory or contractual duties.\n\nFirst, real estate agents do owe a fiduciary duty to their clients. The linked article breaks them into six categories, even though the duty is a wholistic one it gives a reasonable framework to think about it:\n\n> Obedience: You must obey your client\u2019s lawful instructions.\n> \n> \n> Loyalty: You must always act in your client\u2019s best interests, even if it means forgoing your own interests.\n> \n> \n> Disclosure: You must disclose any material facts about the transaction, including your relationship to the other party.\n> \n> \n> Confidentiality: You must keep your client\u2019s information confidential unless you have their permission to do otherwise.\n> \n> \n> Accounting: You must keep accurate records of all money and property involved in the transaction.\n> \n> \n> Reasonable Care: You must use reasonable care and skill when handling your client\u2019s business.\n\nUrging a buyer to offer a higher price, even though it is good for the agent, doesn't mean it's a breach of the fiduciary duty. If the objectively assessed reason (i.e. by the judge after the event) is that the advice was commercially sound and in the best interest of the buyer, then there is no breach of duty.\n\nFailing to follow the client's instructions to make an offer is more likely to be a breach of this duty but it still depends on the circumstances. It's always best for the client to give clear instructions, preferably in writing, or the agent may genuinely confuse an *instruction* as a *discussion*. Even where there is clear instruction the agent still has to act in the best interests of the client. For example, if while taking the offer to the seller's agent they are informed \"My client (the seller) has told me to reject all offers below the asking price and to no longer deal with that prospective buyer\" then it would not be in the client's interest to make the offer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A real estate agent, Alice, is representing a buyer, Bob, who is interested in purchasing a house listed at $300,000.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Alice's fiduciary responsibilities?\n\nA) Alice has not breached her fiduciary duty because she was acting in Bob's best interest by trying to secure the house.\nB) Alice has breached her fiduciary duty of obedience by not following Bob's instructions to submit the $280,000 offer.\nC) Alice has not breached her fiduciary duty because real estate agents are allowed to use their professional judgment to override client decisions.\nD) Alice has breached her fiduciary duty of loyalty by prioritizing her potential commission over Bob's interests.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Alice has breached her fiduciary duty of obedience by not following Bob's clear instructions to submit the $280,000 offer. Real estate agents have a duty to obey their client's lawful instructions, and failing to submit an offer as instructed is a clear violation of this duty. While Alice may have believed she was acting in Bob's best interest, she does not have the right to override her client's explicit instructions without their consent. Options A and C are incorrect because they wrongly assume that Alice's professional judgment supersedes her duty to follow client instructions.

Three people, two men and a woman, enter. The woman appears to be drunk and unconscious, and is being supported by one of the men. The other man smells of alcohol, but is otherwise sober. They try to get a room. The receptionist, aware that the hotel is situated in the vicinity of a red\\-light district, is suspicious and lies that there's no room available.

If this does not meet the threshold for \"reasonable suspicion\", is it worth calling the police in this situation?\n\nIf it matters, the country is Singapore.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Singapore, being a former British Colony, would likely use Common Law Terms like \"Reasonable Suspicion\" and \"Probable Cause\" (Probable Cause is a the general principle that covers terms such as Reasonable Suspicion, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt, ect. used in law.). At the very least, it would be reasonable to assume it is Common\\-Law Hybrid at best (Singapore is way stricter to criminals than most Common Law nations by punishment system only.)\n\nThe fundamental misunderstanding of theses terms expressed here is that it applies to ordinary citizens alerting the police. It does not. It only serves as rules of operation that constrain police officers to the limits of what they can do with respect to the case. There should be no reason why your friend should not call the police to (in good faith, mind you) report a possible suspicious action that may or may not be a crime in progress. It could be a crime... it could be perfectly logical explanation.\n\nFor comparison, I had to call police out to my neighbors house after I returned home after dark and observed a man with a flash light looking at a window before running behind their house as I drove into my parking spot.

This of course seemed to me to be the behavior of a possible thief or peeping Tom (On top of that, it was one of the coldest nights of the year, so no body was out in the neighborhood). Cops rolled up and after I explained the situation, one officer knocked on my neighbors door and then returned back. Turns out the guy slinking around the house was an appraiser (explaining the need to look at windows and go to the rear of the house) that the family was aware of (his \"suspicious\" behavior of ducking behind the house as I drove up was just happenstance and as far as I was aware, he never knew I was there).\n\nNow, I didn't get in trouble for this because that is part of the cops' job duties.

The receptionist can call the police in good faith to report suspicious activity without needing to meet any specific legal threshold. It's better for citizens to report concerns and let the police investigate, even if it turns out to be a misunderstanding.

I am not currently able to create these fonts myself, and would much rather have a professional do them. However, I am worried about copyright. \n\nMy limited understanding of copyright suggests that the copyright belongs to whoever made the product (in this case the font). If I hire someone to create a custom font for me, I want to be sure that I have total ownership of that font, and can both use it however I wish, and restrict its use by other parties. **How do I ensure that?** \n\nI am also curious if anything changes if no money changes hands. If someone makes these fonts for me for free, does that change anything? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The simplest way to do this is via the contract you have with the programmer, where you state that all copyright arising from this project is assigned to you. There does exist a \"work for hire\" doctrine, but that doesn't mean \"anything you pay to get created\". The problem (in part) is that a program is not included in the list of things that are works for hire: \"literary works\" are not included, and software is considered legally a \"literary work\".\n\nIf there is no money involved, that could be a problem for the customer. Ordinarily, there would be a [contract](http://jec.unm.edu/education/online-training/contract-law-tutorial/contract-fundamentals-part-2) between Customer and Programmer where Programmer creates the font and assigns copyright to Customer (one way of doing it), and in exchange, Customer pays Programmer \u2013 this is known as \"consideration\" (each party does something for the other, which they didn't have to do already). There does not actually have to be monetary payment, but a gift of a font is not a contract, and isn't enforceable in court in the same way. Whereas is the contract states that each party gets something of value, then you would have a contract (assuming you didn't foul up somewhere else).\n\nOne matter that you would want to discuss with the programmer / artist is exactly how much of the work product you want to prohibit him from using in the future. For example, the computer file doesn't contain ink drawings, but such drawings are likely to be necessary in creating the computer file. It may be, then, that your interest is in purchasing a TTF file but not precursor drawings, scans, etc. Or maybe you want everything. Carefully defining the objecting being purchased is a good idea: do not just say \"font\" and think that that is unambiguous.\n\nSince copyright transfer does not happen (in the desired way) automatically by law, under [17 USC 204(A)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/204),\n\n> A transfer of copyright ownership, other than by operation of law, is\n>  not valid unless an instrument of conveyance, or a note or memorandum\n>  of the transfer, is in writing and signed by the owner of the rights\n>  conveyed or such owner\u2019s duly authorized agent.\n\nHence something in writing, with a signature, is required to effect complete transfer of the programmer's copyright.

The jurisdiction is South Carolina.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can appoint a guardian, or write in anything regarding the guardianship of minor children into your will. That being said, if you fail to name a guardian, and you die with no other relatives to place the children with, then the court will look to blood relatives before anyone else. It would seem obvious that you'd name a guardian, if you're going to write in who you *don't* want your children with, but I felt I should mention this since you brought up the event of not naming anyone. \n\nMost people who set up a guardianship arrangement have second, and even third choices in place if the first choice is unable to fulfill that great obligation (along with trusts in place for their care and comfort). If you didn't have anyone named, or everyone you had named could or would not do it (one should always get the assent of the named guardian prior to naming them and work out financial arrangements) the court would take your wishes into consideration as a *factor* to consider, but it is not bound by them. If there is a family member who wants or is willing to take the orphaned child(ren), than It is always seen as better, in the absence of a pre\\-arranged guardian or clear proof to the contrary, to place children with family as opposed to strangers. \n\nWhen there is no plan in place, the placement is considered temporary while DHS/DCF investigates the situation and makes a plan for permanent placement. I am assuming you are **not** talking about disavowing the **other parent** \u2013 unless they've had their parental rights terminated for abuse or neglect. If there is a living parent, even if you have full parental rights and responsibilities, that is who the child will be placed with unless that person cannot or will not take custody. \n\nAssuming you're not referring to a parent, as with any court action involving children, a \"best interest of the child\" analysis is undertaken, and in a case like you're describing, many factors would be analyzed like fitness from a non\\-biased perspective (a guardian ad litem is appointed as well as a child services case worker) with frequent visits and interviews, background checks, well\\-being checks, and the like before any permanent placement order occurs. Also, if the child(ren) are older, they will also be heard as to their preference for placement if there are competing interests.

This interpretation is based on the principle that courts assume every part of a contract has a purpose. The clause extends beyond working hours, prohibiting engagement in any other trade or business at all times without the company's written permission. Such clauses are generally enforceable in the UK if they are reasonable to protect the employer's business interests. The \"prior consent in writing\" provision makes the clause more likely to be considered reasonable, as it allows for exceptions with the company's approval.

You see the chocolate and, of all things, you have a big appetite for chocolate. Because the chocolate is lying on the table so unobserved, the temptation to eat the chocolate immediately is great. But my daughter said she wouldn't do that. After a moment's thought, she said she would put 20 euros on the table and then eat the chocolate and leave a note saying that the chocolate tasted very good. Now I was irritated. Is that actually theft?\n\nI suppose if the owner of the chocolate sees the note and accepts the 20 euros, it would be a legal transaction, wouldn't it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is theft. While theft is defined in different ways in different places, the heartland of theft is \"larceny\" which involves knowingly taking property without permission of the owner, with an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property taken.\n\nIn general, one of the defining qualities of something that is \"property\" is that it can't be transferred without the permission of the owner, except in narrowly defined circumstances where the government authorizes a taking.\n\nIn a very different but analogous context, if a lawyer takes money held in trust for a client out of the client's trust account with the lawyer, without a valid legal basis for doing so, even if the lawyer intends to and does replace the funds in the trust account later, the lawyer is guilty of a crime.\n\n**Unintentional Conversion Compared**\n\nIf you accidentally and unknowingly take someone else's property, for example, taking the wrong coat from a coat rack, or taking the wrong umbrella, and that item is later destroyed, you have committed the civil wrong (a.k.a. the tort) of conversion, but you haven't committed a crime. Crime usually (but not always) involves acts committed with a bad intent.\n\nBut taking someone else's property on purpose, without their permission, is the crime of theft and not just a tort.\n\n**Implied Consent To A Purchase Compared**\n\nThe situation would be different, however, if there is implied permission to purchase the item taken from the person who owns it.\n\nFor example, suppose you walk into a convenience store which sells 20 euro candy bars, but there is no one available to sell it to you because the sole employee of the store is hung over and vomiting in the store's toilet. If you take the candy bar and leave a 20 euro bill at the cash register, you have not committed theft, because in that context, the owner of the property has implicitly consented to sell the candy bar to any member of the general public who wants to buy it for the stated price.\n\nSimilarly, this is why buying candy from a vending machine isn't theft.\n\n**Abandonment Compared**\n\nAlso, it is important to distinguish property that has been abandoned by the owner, to which a \"finder's keepers\" rule generally applies, to property which there is no indication that the owner intended to abandon.\n\nSo, if someone throws something in the trash, or simply leaves what would generally be thought to be trash in public, like a bag of dog poop, that would not generally be theft, since a reasonable person would assume that the property had been abandoned and no longer had an owner.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John finds a rare, unopened bottle of wine worth $500 in a public park.

John has indeed committed theft by taking the wine bottle without the owner's permission, even though he left money and a note. The key elements of theft (larceny) are present: knowingly taking property without the owner's permission and intending to deprive the owner of the property. Leaving compensation does not negate the fact that the taking was unauthorized. Answer A is incorrect because fair compensation doesn't legitimize unauthorized taking. B is wrong because good faith doesn't excuse theft in this scenario.

If so, approximately how much\n> should I expect it to cost? How would it work with the requirement for\n> him to pay the legal fees?\n\nYou would ordinarily either hire a lawyer or bring suit yourself in a limited jurisdiction court (the kind that handles misdemeanor criminal offenses and smaller dollar amounts owed, the exact name of the court differs from state to state). You can always bring suit in the county where the debtor resides. If the loan was not for consumer purposes, you could sue in the place where the loan \"was made\" or in a forum provided by the loan documents (which does not appear to be present), that might be different from the place where the debtor resides.\n\nUsually, you would want to hire a lawyer with offices not too far from the place where you are bringing suit, as limited jurisdiction courts often require in person appearances.\n\nNormally, a lawyer would ask to be paid up front, with you posting a retainer equal to a significant share of the estimated legal fees, called a retainer against which the lawyer would bill until it was exhausted, and would normally bill on an hourly basis. Fees on the order of $1,500\\-$5,000 wouldn't be unusual.\n\nOne factor that would increase the cost would be the fact that your loan is almost certainly at an illegally high rate of interest, and you and your lawyer would have to examine the relevant law to determine the effect of that on the enforceability of your loan, and the correct amount to claim. In some jurisdictions and circumstances, this might make your entitle loan or at least all interest on it and all fees incurred to collect the debt, uncollectible. In other jurisdictions it might just reduce the amount of interest you could recover.\n\nWithout this complication, it might have been a matter you could handle on your own. With this complication, you really need a lawyer.\n\nYou could probably not legitimately claim the full $18,000 plus attorney fees and costs.\n\nSome lawyers would take a case like this on a contingent fee basis with you only advancing court costs and out of pocket expenses like process serving charged, but they'd typically do so only if they were confident that they would prevail at trial and if they were also confident that the debtor had the ability to pay. On a one\\-off basis, a contingent fee percentage of 40%\\-50% would be more common in this situation that the \"usual\" one\\-third contingency rate.\n\n\"Reasonable\" legal fees would be added to the amount you are owed on the loan if the high rate of interest doesn't invalidate this provision. Amounts recovered for legal fees would be paid to you from which you could repay your lawyer whatever you owed your lawyer. In a contingent fee case, usually hourly based fees are awarded and included in the total amount recovered (once the debtor actually pays) and the lawyer would get a percentage of the total collected regardless of what the amount recovered is supposed to be for.\n\nAnother option would be to sell your debt to a debt collection firm which would charge you a small sign up fee and then collect a percentage of the debt recovered. The usurious interest rate involved, however, might discourage them from accepting you as a customer or buying the debt.\n\nIf the debtor is not collectible with a job and/or real estate with substantial equity, you probably won't be able to find someone to take the case on a contingent fee basis at all, and will probably have to pay an hourly rate.\n\n> Do I have the option to take this up via civil complaints? Or is that\n> only for people who are in the same state?\n\nIt isn't clear what you mean in these questions. A lawsuit is commenced by filing a civil complaint, filed by you or your lawyer in a court, and this can be done even if you don't live in the same state as the debtor, although it may be necessary to file it in the state where the debtor lives.\n\nBut, the government won't supply a lawyer to help you collect your debt in the way that it would appoint a prosecutor to bring criminal charges against someone who committed a crime in which you were a victim.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A lender loaned $15,000 to a business friend with a contract stating it should be repaid as $18,000 in a week, including a clause for attorney fees in case of default.

The lender should hire a lawyer, but there are complications to consider. The extremely high interest rate (20% in just one week) is likely usurious and illegal in most jurisdictions. This could affect the enforceability of the loan and the amount that can be collected. A lawyer would need to examine the relevant laws to determine the correct amount to claim and how to proceed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because filing without a lawyer would be risky given the complexity of the usury issue, and collecting the full amount plus fees is unlikely due to the potentially illegal interest rate.\n\nOption B is not the best choice because debt collection agencies might be hesitant to take on a loan with potentially usurious interest rates.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the government does not appoint prosecutors for civil debt collection cases.

Under what circumstances can the US Supreme Court review this case?\n\nA) The Supreme Court can review the case if it believes the state court misinterpreted the state constitution.\nB) The Supreme Court can review the case if it involves a fundamental constitutional right, regardless of the state court's reasoning.\nC) The Supreme Court cannot review the case due to both federalism principles and the lack of a \"case or controversy\" under Article III.\nD) The Supreme Court can review the case, but its decision would be merely advisory and not binding on the state court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The US Supreme Court cannot review this case for two primary reasons:\n\n1. Federalism: State courts have the final word on the interpretation of state laws and state constitutions. The Supreme Court cannot override a state court's interpretation of its own state law.\n\n2. Lack of \"case or controversy\": Article III of the US Constitution requires an actual \"case or controversy\" for federal courts to have jurisdiction. In this scenario, even if the Supreme Court were to hear the case and disagree with the state court's interpretation of federal law, it could not change the outcome of the case. This is because the state court's decision rests on \"adequate and independent state grounds\" - namely, the state constitution that provides broader protections than the federal Constitution.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Supreme Court does not have the authority to review or overturn a state court's interpretation of state law.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because even fundamental constitutional rights do not override the jurisdictional limitations imposed by federalism and the \"case or controversy\" requirement.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the Supreme Court does not issue advisory opinions. If it cannot change the outcome of a case, it lacks jurisdiction to hear it at all.\n\nThis question tests understanding of complex concepts related to federalism, judicial jurisdiction, and the relationship between state and federal courts in the US legal system."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16148/difference-between-private-property-and-no-tresspassing-signage", "docs_id": 16148, "title": "Difference between &quot;Private Property&quot; and &quot;No Tresspassing&quot; signage", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my door\\-to\\-door ministry work I've observed various forms of \"No Tresspassing\" signs on properties. Do \"Private Property\" signs imply the same laws as a \"No Tresspassing\" sign?\n\nAt one house in particular, the owner had posted a sign which said \"Private Property,\" but had covered the \"No Tresspassing\" part of the sign with duct tape. We skipped that house to stay on the safe side, but would like to know if there are actually any differences in meaning.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question for trespassing is whether the trespasser has been adequately notified of the possession interest that another person has in the property. Although it is legal to evangelize door\\-to\\-door without a permit, most jurisdictions will require you to leave promptly if the owner asks you to leave. In the absence of such verbal requests, you have a legally protected interest in engaging in conversation with your neighbors. \n\nBased on the law as I understand it, it is likely that your jurisdiction will recognize a right to proselytize to your neighbors door\\-to\\-door regardless of a no trespassing or private property sign. However, for the sake of certainty, here\u2019s a little bit about trespass law. Typically, states have statutes that define what it takes to make a sign \u201cconspicuous\u201d enough to create grounds for prosecution. Such laws include specifications for the thickness of markings and the sign\u2019s distance from the ground. Arkansas statutes have established that a person who enters or remains unlawfully on property has committed trespass, which means that the person must enter or remain in or upon the premises when not licensed or privileged to enter or remain in or upon the premises.\n\nCommunication is key. Arkansas law provides that if the property is unimproved and apparently unused, and is not fenced or otherwise \u201cenclosed in a manner designed to exclude an intruder,\u201d the person entering the property does so with license and privilege. Generally, however, if a person unlawfully enters property that has been improved, he has trespassed regardless of a sign on the premises devoid of some religious purpose for his visit.\n\nThus, there really is not a significant difference between the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign and the \u201cPrivate Property\u201d sign. Both would communicate to any potential intruder that the property he is about to enter is presently being possessed by another person and thus would likely be sufficient to provide grounds for claiming notice in court if a property owner should choose to bring a suit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A door-to-door evangelist encounters a property with a sign that says \"Private Property\" but has the \"No Trespassing\" part covered with duct tape.

Based on the information provided, which of the following is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The evangelist is clearly guilty of trespassing because any sign indicating private property is legally equivalent to a \"No Trespassing\" sign.\n\nB) The evangelist is not guilty of trespassing because the \"No Trespassing\" part was covered, implying permission to enter.\n\nC) The evangelist is likely not guilty of trespassing, as door-to-door evangelism is generally protected, but the final determination would depend on specific state laws and whether the property was clearly enclosed or improved.\n\nD) The evangelist is guilty of trespassing only if they refused to leave when asked by the property owner, regardless of the sign.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the documentation suggests that door-to-door evangelism is generally protected and that the mere presence of a \"Private Property\" or \"No Trespassing\" sign may not be sufficient to establish trespassing, especially for religious purposes. The final determination would depend on specific state laws, whether the property was clearly enclosed or improved, and if the sign met the state's requirements for being \"conspicuous\" enough. While the evangelist should exercise caution, they are likely not automatically guilty of trespassing simply by entering the property. However, they would be required to leave if asked by the property owner. The covered \"No Trespassing\" part adds ambiguity to the situation, further supporting that a definitive determination of guilt would require more context and depend on specific state laws."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83322/what-do-lawyers-mean-when-they-say-somebody-said-something-in-terms", "docs_id": 83322, "title": "What do lawyers mean when they say somebody said something &#39;in terms&#39;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I occasionally see lawyers refer to something somebody else said or wrote, and they often insert, parenthetically, the words 'in terms'. Here is an example to motivate the question. Imagine there is a written report that makes a series of recommendations. A lawyer might say something like:\n\n> \"The report says, in terms, that procedures must be improved at once.\"\n\nWhat I am trying to understand is: what does the addition of 'in terms', as a parenthetical, accomplish? Put another way, if the phrase were removed, what confusion or ambiguity would be introduced?\n\nOne would hope this would be easy to answer with a quick search on Google. But the words \"in terms\" are so common that it's frustratingly hard. The interesting thing as a layperson is that I could imagine two quite different, and contradictory, meanings.\n\nFor example, does the insertion of 'in terms' mean \"what follows is a paraphrasing\"? As in:\n\n> \"The report said *words to the effect that* procedures should be tightened\"?\n\nOr might it mean the opposite: \"what follows is a verbatim quote\"? As in:\n\n> \"The report said, *precisely and specifically*, that procedures should be tightened\"?\n\nFinally: note that I'm asking here about the specific case of 'in terms' being used as a parenthetical. I'm not talking about sentences where it appears as 'in terms of' or 'in terms that'.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The report said clearly and directly that procedures must be improved at once, but may not have used the exact words \"procedures must be improved at once\". In a legal context, the precise words used by someone can be important, and legal writers may be in the habit of being careful about that detail even in contexts where it is not vital. Often, the writer is trying to summarize a text that is on point, but inconvenient or unnecessary to quote exactly.\n\nIn [R v Brown \\[1993] UKHL 19](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1993/19.html), Lord Slynn said, on the topic of consent and BDSM:\n\n> I agree that in the end it is a matter of policy. It is a matter of policy in an area where social and moral factors are extremely important and where attitudes can change. In my opinion it is a matter of policy for the legislature to decide.\n\nThen, the [Law Commission report of 1994](https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2016/08/No.134-Criminal-Law-Consent-and-Offences-Against-the-Person-A-Consultation-Paper.pdf) on that concept was able to say:\n\n> Lord Slynn of Hadley said in terms that the ultimate issue was one of policy.\n\nWhile he did not use the precise words \"the ultimate issue is one of policy\", he said emphatically that this was a policy issue.\n\nSimilarly, from [In re E (a Child) \\[2008] UKHL 66](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd081112/inrea.pdf), Lord Carswell at paragraph 47 said:\n\n> The submission advanced by Mr Macdonald QC for the first intervener NIHRC went equally far. He argued in terms that the positive obligation under article 3 was absolute in its nature and that no element of proportionality entered into consideration.\n\nHe goes on to quote a paragraph from Barry Macdonald's written submission, which does not use the words \"obligation\", \"absolute\", or \"proportionality\", but still makes the stated argument in explicit and forceful language:\n\n> Likewise, the concept of balance is not in play in that the needs of the community cannot be weighed against the right of an individual not to be subjected to torture or other ill\\-treatment reaching the threshold. To express the standard of the state\u2019s responsibility in terms of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 therefore fails to reflect the categorical\n> imperative created by Article 3\\. Considerations of reasonableness may operate in deciding whether a proposed measure is available or likely to be effective to stop the ill\\-treatment in question but not otherwise. In circumstances where the state has it within its power to\n> prevent or stop inhuman or degrading treatment, it must take the measures necessary to do so. The only room for discretion is in determining the most effective means of achieving the object of preventing the ill\\-treatment. There is no room for opting not to prevent it.\n\nWe also often have negative phrases like \"the statute does not say in terms that...\" or \"the witness did not concede in terms that...\". These mean that whatever was said, was not said in an express and obvious way (but perhaps there is still something that can be concluded by implication).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In legal writing, when a lawyer uses the parenthetical phrase \"in terms\" to describe something someone else said or wrote, what does it most accurately indicate?\n\nA) The following statement is a verbatim quote from the original source.\nB) The following statement is a loose paraphrase that captures the general idea, but not the exact wording.\nC) The following statement conveys the clear and direct meaning of the original, though not necessarily using the exact words.\nD) The following statement is deliberately vague to avoid committing to a specific interpretation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"in terms\" in legal writing typically indicates that the following statement conveys the clear and direct meaning of the original source, even if it doesn't use the exact same words. This allows lawyers to succinctly summarize key points while acknowledging that they aren't providing a word-for-word quote. It's a way of being precise about the substance of what was said or written, without claiming to reproduce the exact phrasing. Options A and B are incorrect because \"in terms\" doesn't guarantee either verbatim quotation or loose paraphrasing.

This occurred not because of a definitive ruling on copyright or trademark infringement, but because the defendant failed to produce documents ordered by the court. A default judgment is a procedural outcome that doesn't establish legal precedent on the core issues of the case. Therefore, this case doesn't provide clear guidance on the legality of parody games, game rule copyrights, or the extent of trademark protection in board games.

Of course, it's possible that Dan arrives just when there's a Christian service in the chapel, but then he can just wait for half an hour or so.\n\nIn the general case, no private entity is forced to offer a particular service. So even the airport would not be forced to offer a prayer room, let alone a *Muslim* prayer room. It could however be illegal discrimination if Dan wasn't allowed to enter a Christian chapel *because* he is Muslim.

We know that its judiciary isn't independent and the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) guidelines are that its judiciary, like anyone else in China, must ultimately serve CCP's interests. So, we have seen multiple examples when Chinese courts used tools like anti\\-suit injunctions and others to discriminate against US firms. We have seen Chinese firm Tencent block live\\-streaming of NBA broadcasts which cost NBA $600M, apparently in breach of its contract with NBA, which NBA even can't seek legal remedy to refund.

That cost DuPont a valued chemical tech patent. Further, USTR releases each year foreign trade barrier report in which other cases of US companies' unfair treatment by Chinese courts can be found. So one obviously would then ask why Chinese companies are protected under fair legal process in the US.\n\nHuawei and other Chinese companies regularly sue the US government and exercise their unreciprocated constitutionally rights here in the US. And if any US government agency, presumably State Department, provided solid evidence of unfair discrimination against US companies in China in a US court, can US Congress/government pass a law that bars Chinese companies from fair legal protection in the US?

The proprietor of LearnHub.org are *unlikely* to be an individual and are therefore not a Subscriber under the terms of use. \n\nUnder Clause 2, everything on Stack Exchange is copyright and some things are trade marked as well. The copyright for posts vests in the Subscriber and is licenced to SE (CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0\\) or vests in SE directly as the creator.\n\nClause 8\\.1a. of CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0 **requires** SE to grant a licence to any recipient of a distribution (e.g. on a web site) on the same terms. For this reason the limitations on the copyright in Clause 2 can only apply to those items where copyright vests in SE directly; not to the content of the Subscriber posts.\n\nAssuming that it is only Subscriber posts that they are reproducing then they either need to:\n\n1. Comply with CC BY\\-SA 3\\.0 and attribute the work as required by that licence; what they have put up does not on the face of it do that because:\n\t1. They are referring to an earlier version of the licence\n\t2. Attribution under 3\\.0 is detailed in Clause 4\\.c. and this doesn't meet the criteria.\n2. Have been licenced by the original copyright holder; which seems unlikely.\n3. Meet the fair use criteria; attribution would not be required but would certainly be polite. Fair use turns on the specific facts of the case \\- on the face of it they could put forward a credible argument that their use is fair use.\n\nComplications\n-------------\n\nJurisdiction matters here; copyright laws are not uniform across the world. For example, Australian copyright has a much more limited \"fair use\" concept than the US and also creates a \"moral copyright\" of the *author* that exists independently of the copyright of the *owner*.\n\nFor signatories to the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention); the country of origin for simultaneously published works (which online posting is) and therefore the law applying is the country that gives the shortest term of protection.

Sued for what? Surely the worst\\-case scenario is that somebody writes to me and asks me to take their comment down, and I'll just do it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It first depends on whether the author has granted permission to others to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute such Content in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). Hosting sites often include such licensing as a condition of using their service. Such a license eliminates any risk of a suit for copyright infringement.\n\nSupposing that there is some reddit\\-like site that failed to include a such a license for others (for instance, Reddit requires you to license to Redit, but not to other users), an author might decide to sue someone else for copying and distributing their posts without permission. In the worst case scenario, you might end up in court, being sued for copyright infringement. One way to defend yourself against that suit would be to established that is was \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info)\", for example if you just copied one sentence, and/or you were making a comment on the text. If the author posted a short novel and you decided to copy it and put it on your web page, that would not be fair use and you would almost certainly be found liable for copyright infringement. Then the question would be, what was the damage? That is hard to judge, but it could be expensive, since you deprived the author of a possibly considerable amount of revenue. The bottom line could be in the millions of dollars, but more probably it would be in the thousands. [This article](https://www.dmcaagentservice.com/copyright-infringement-damages/) addresses the ways in which it could cost you. It talks about really huge awards up to $221M, or at least a half a million in the case of George Harrison, but literary works are unlikely to be so lucrative (assuming the author is not J.K. Rowling). The cost of litigating the suit is non\\-trivial: [this guy](https://www.traverselegal.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-pursue-a-copyright-infringement-claim/) says it can go up to 6 figures. It is improbably that an angry author would bother to litigate a case where you redistribute his Reddit post, since he is unlikely to be able to show much actual damage or loss of revenue and probably did not register his copyright.

The website owner could indeed face copyright infringement claims, but the level of risk and potential damages can vary significantly based on several factors:\n\n1. Licensing agreements: Some social media platforms include licensing terms that allow content to be shared by other users, which could mitigate risk.\n2. Fair use considerations: Depending on how the content is used (e.g., for commentary or criticism), it might fall under fair use doctrine.\n3. Nature of the copied content: Copying a short comment vs. a longer, more substantial work would likely result in different levels of damages.\n4. Actual damages: The court would consider the revenue lost by the original author, which could range from negligible to substantial amounts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because blurring personal information doesn't address the copyright issue. Option B overstates the risk, as not all cases would result in million-dollar damages.

The documentation emphasizes that British courts, when ruling on constitutional matters, generally regard themselves as interpreting existing law rather than creating new law. The Supreme Court's ruling on prorogation was framed as recognizing and interpreting longstanding legal principles, particularly those stemming from the 17th century Bill of Rights. While the ruling did establish important precedents, such as the justiciability of prerogative powers and their limits, the court presented these as interpretations of existing constitutional principles rather than the creation of entirely new law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the court did not explicitly state it was creating new law.

There had previously been successful lawsuits for trespass and/or nuisance for, among other things, bullets that passed over land without touching it.\n\nAviation in the early 20th century was largely unregulated in the United States, partially due to the issue of Federalism but primarily due to the question of if private citizens would be able to claim compensation for the government seizing their airspace. Neither state nor Federal governments wanted anything to do with it. The question *was* resolved in Europe before the First World War because national governments there were (largely) not federal, did not have the same sanctity of private property rights as the US and could see enormous national security issues in foreigners flying over your military installations, gathering intelligence about them and \\- as events ultimately showed \\- dropping bombs on them.\n\nWhen the US finally decided that aviation needed regulation it passed the [Air Commerce Act of 1926](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_role_in_civil_aviation#Air_Commerce_Act).

I'd like to be informed before I go so I know what to do with my family.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legally, they cannot just nab you. The usual (?) option is that authorities in the US request extradition pursuant to the [US\\-Mexico extradition treaty](http://www.oas.org/juridico/MLA/en/traites/en_traites-ext-usa-mex.pdf) via the Department of Justice, and if the paperwork is in order, this can result in a Provisional Arrest Warrant (and arrest) in Mexico, which will be carried out by the Mexican federal police. This is true whether or not you go to the US consulate. After a hearing in the Mexican courts you might be extradited (or not, but DoJ presumably doesn't proceed with cases that they will lose). Extradition is not possible for every offense, so you would have to look at the offenses listed in the treaty, and whatever the Arizona warrant is about. You can't be extradited for parking tickets, you can be extradited for murder: whatever it is, it has to be a crime in both places, and has to be subject to a minimum one year imprisonment. Also, if you are a Mexican citizen as well, you cannot be extradited unless the Mexican authorities agree to (whereas there is no choice if you are only a US citizen). An alternative is deportation, which would overcome limitations related to extradition, but it's not clear what the requirements for deportation from Mexico are (typically illegal presence, unclear whether Mexican authorities can or would try an end\\-run around official extradition procedure).\n\nAlthough consulates enjoy a degree of immunity from local law, a consulate in Mexico is still Mexican territory, subject to Mexican law. If you are *in* the consulate, Mexican authorities cannot enter without permission to arrest you. They also cannot arrest you without a warrant (see Art. 16 of the [Mexican constitution](https://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/mex/en_mex-int-text-const.pdf)). Consular staff also cannot arrest you (if you are not caught *flagrante delicto*). Nor are they authorized to execute a US warrant in Mexico (thus they have to go through the process of judicial review to send you back to the US, and why a *Mexican* warrant is required).

(A sovereign state can set their own laws by virtue of being a sovereign state.) In the early days of copyright, such efforts were not uncommon. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, for instance, was notorious in 19th century Italy for disregarding the copyright of other states. This was a deliberate policy choice that led to a burgeoning reprint business. Giuseppe Verdi was repeatedly warned by his publisher not to bring any of his scores to Naples for that was tantamount to having them spread across the world. Needless to say, when the first international copyright treaty was adopted between Austria and Sardinia (in 1840\\) and they invited the rest of Italy to join, the Two Sicilies were the only state to refuse.\n\nLater on, the industrial heavyweights of the world have of course made sure this doesn't happen. The Berne Convention today has roughly 180 member states and there are several other copyright\\-related treaties in place as well (WCT, WPPT, TRIPS ...). Simply put, the strategy consists of two elements: First, no one gets a trade agreement without ensuring and properly enforcing the IP rights of foreigners. Second, if you don't protect our authors in your country, we don't protect your authors in our country. This has led to a fairly high standard of protection across the world.\n\n> In other words, if a country did this and a citizen of this country built a server filled with recent Hollywood movies, would users in that country legally be allowed to download those movies, and would the US have any right to seize and shut down that server (as they have done with torrent sites in the past)?\n\nIn purely legal terms, you cannot simply seize property in foreign countries. You always need a country that cooperates (is required to cooperate) with you, be it based on international law or as a \"courtesy\". If, hypothetically, there were some super\\-rogue country that for some reason is completely autarch and doesn't want to do business with the rest of the world, you couldn't force them to let you seize anything. (The military surely could ...)\n\nHowever, even then, the operator of the server in your example would have some trouble of his own. Because if you operate a server in country X and offer Hollywood movies, without permission, you would expect that the rest of the world can download these movies as well, either directly or through a VPN service. In many countries, that would be enough to bring the action (the communication to the public of the content, see eg WCT, art 8\\) within the purview of their own jurisdiction.

The website operator could face legal issues in other countries that consider the website's actions a violation of their copyright laws, especially if the content is accessible globally. Many nations have agreements to protect intellectual property rights, and the operator could be subject to prosecution if they travel to countries with stricter copyright enforcement.

When a majority of justices agree in the outcome of a case, but not on the law that gets them there, the *Marks* rule comes into play to determine what *reasoning* should be followed by lower courts.\n\n### An example\n\nI'll explain with an example that was at the center of the appeal in *[Hughes v. United States](https://casetext.com/case/hughes-v-united-states-105)* (2018\\).\n\nThe issue arose in *Hughes* because lower courts did not know how to deal with the 4\\-1\\-4 split in [*Freeman* (2013\\)](https://casetext.com/case/freeman-v-united-states-13). The *Marks* rule says to look at the positions of the members that concurred in the outcome. In *Freeman*, there were two positions that together accounted for the outcome: that of four justices (written by Justice Kennedy) and that of Justice Sotomayor, in a solo concurrence. Her position was arguably decided on a \"narrower\" ground. However, neither the Kennedy plurality nor the Sotomayor concurrence was a logical subset of the other. Justice Sotomayor was not merely agreeing with some but not all of the plurality's reasoning. She came to the same conclusion, but based on a different understanding of the law. Yet some circuits were treating Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in *Freeman* (with which no other justice had agreed) as the controlling opinion. This is apparently what *Marks* required.\n\n### *Marks* has always been confusing\n\nThe *Marks* rule has been a source of confusion in the jurisprudence and academia ever since it was announced. It was not reasoned nor explained by the Court when it was announced. It hasn't been reasoned or explained by the Court since. To the extent that the *Marks* rule has arguably clear application, it is in cases where the various reasons for judgment of the Court form a \"logical subset\" or \"common denominator\" structure. But many times, the reasons don't relate to each other that way (e.g. *Freeman*). There is sometimes no identifiable \"narrowest ground\" in that sense, and even where there is, it reflects a minority position of the court: one that none of the other justices agreed with.\n\n### The *Re* brief in *Hughes*\n\nProfessor [Richard M. Re](https://www.law.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/rmr6w/2914854) filed an [*amicus* brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) in *[Hughes v. United States](https://casetext.com/case/hughes-v-united-states-105)* (2018\\) on the topic of the *Marks* rule arguing that the *Marks* rule should be abandoned and replaced with the following:\n\n> A precedent of this Court should form only when most Justices expressly agree on a rule of decision.\n\nRe notes that the *Marks* rule \"applies precisely when this Court issues a decision that lacks any majority agreement on a rationale.\" He argues that \"there is no persuasive reason to treat views that lack majority support as binding, nationwide precedents.\"\n\nThe Court itself has said the *Marks* rule is \"easier stated than applied.\" And the Court has never attempted to explain the rule since. Re cites his own paper, \"[Beyond the Marks Rule](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090620)\" which he says further shows the rule has \"defined consistent application by lower courts.\" At [page 16 of the brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf), he describes [circuit splits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_split) that have developed over an attempt to apply the *Marks* rule to the reasons of the Court.\n\n### *Hughes* gave us no answer\n\nBoth parties in *Hughes* presented alternatives to the *Marks* rule. It was discussed extensively at [oral argument](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/17-155_2co3.pdf). Counsel for the petitioner acknowledged that, \"Whatever guidance Marks may have provided, it's probably caused more confusion than \\-\\- than guidance.\" The arguments contained analogies to Venn diagrams and Russian nesting dolls. Ultimately, the Court in *Hughes* found it unnecessary to resolve the \"proper application of *Marks*.\" Despite granting certiori to address those questions, they were able to resolve the case by skipping directly to the the merits of the substantive question about sentencing.\n\n### *Ramos* did not clarify things\n\nIn [*Ramos v. Louisiana*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-5924_n6io.pdf), 590 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2020\\) some members of the Court commented on what *Marks* might mean. Ironically, the Court in *Ramos* itself was split without a majority on the meaning of *Marks*. Justice Gorsuch, writing for three on this issue, said that *Marks* in fact does *not* ever result in a single justice's opinion becoming the controlling position. He presented this example:\n\n> Suppose we face a question of first impression under the Fourth Amendment: whether a State must obtain a warrant before reading a citizen's email in the hands of an Internet provider and using that email as evidence in a criminal trial. Imagine this question splits the Court, with four Justices finding the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant and four Justices finding no such requirement. The ninth Justice agrees that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, but takes an idiosyncratic view of the consequences of violating that right. In her view, the exclusionary rule has gone too far, and should only apply when the defendant is prosecuted for a felony. Because the case before her happens to involve only a misdemeanor, she provides the ninth vote to affirm a conviction based on evidence secured by a warrantless search.\n\nThis is a 4\\-1\\-4 split, in which the solo Justice holds the arguably narrowest grounds of decision, one which would be overruling precedent in this hypothetical. Justice Gorsuch says though that *Marks* \"never sought to offer or defend\" a rule that \"a single Justice's opinion can overrule prior precedents.\"\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, writing in concurrence, but not agreeing with Justice Gorsuch on his *Marks* point, said that the *Marks* rule is \"ordinarily commonsensical to apply and usually means that courts in essence heed the opinion that occupies the middle\\-ground position between (i) the broadest opinion among the Justices in the majority and (ii) the dissenting opinion.\" He noted that the members of the Court in *Ramos* had notably differing opinions about how to apply *Marks* to *Apodaca*: \"six Justices treat the result in *Apodaca* as precedent for purposes of *stare decisis* analysis. A different group of six Justices concludes that *Apodaca* should be and is overruled.\"\n\nThe dissent in *Ramos*, written by Justice Alito, was of the view the *Marks* applied to the ruling in *Apodaca* and that it produced precedential value that the Justice Gorsuch majority was ignoring. The dissent said that *Marks* clearly stands for the proposition that \"the position taken by a single Justice in the majority can constitute the binding rule for which the decision stands.\"\n\n### Further reading\n\nIf you're really interested in this, I suggest reading Richard Re's [brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) and his [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090620), read the parties' briefs in *Hughes* ([petitioner's](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/28738/20180122155818808_Hughes%20Merits%20Brief.pdf), [respondent's](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/36187/20180221203622477_17-155bs%20UnitedStates.pdf), [petitioner's reply](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/38841/20180313194715620_Hughes%20Merits%20Reply.pdf)), and listen to the [oral argument](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/17-155).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In applying the Marks rule to a Supreme Court decision with a fragmented opinion, lower courts should:\n\nA) Always follow the opinion that provides the narrowest grounds for the decision, even if it's a single Justice's concurrence\nB) Only apply precedent when a majority of Justices explicitly agree on a rule of decision\nC) Identify the \"middle-ground\" position between the broadest majority opinion and the dissent\nD) Determine if there's a \"logical subset\" relationship among the opinions, and if not, treat the decision as non-binding\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the complexities and ambiguities in applying the Marks rule. Option A reflects a common but oversimplified interpretation of Marks that has caused confusion, as seen in the Freeman case. Option B aligns with Richard Re's proposed alternative but is not the current state of the law. Option C reflects Justice Kavanaugh's interpretation in Ramos, but it's not universally accepted and doesn't account for all scenarios.\n\nThe correct answer, D, best captures the nuanced approach courts should take when applying Marks. It acknowledges that the \"narrowest grounds\" are most clearly identifiable when opinions form a logical subset, as mentioned in the explanation of when Marks has arguably clear application. However, it also recognizes that in many cases, such a relationship doesn't exist, and in those instances, lower courts may have to treat the decision as non-binding precedent.

If I buy a VW car and find it is not what I was promised, I can sue VW (the company) because I have a **contractual** relationship with it and the contract has not been honored.

While it may seem counterintuitive for shareholders to sue their own company, the explanation clarifies that many plaintiffs in such cases are often former shareholders who have already sold their shares at a loss due to the scandal. Additionally, current shareholders who purchased shares based on false or misleading information (such as the cars being compliant with emissions standards when they were not) may seek quicker and more certain compensation through a lawsuit rather than waiting for potential long-term stock recovery.

I'd like to exclude that, unless it's pivotal to the answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Water law is complicated and detail intense, but the basic principle is \"prior appropriation\".\n\nIn other words, you gain a water right by taking water from a river or other body of water and appropriating it for your use on a particular date, and then continuing to do so going forward. The older the date at which you first started using water in a river basin, the higher priority your water right will be.\n\nState officials (including a corps of civil engineers) and the courts with judges trained in water law, engage in the complicated matter of determining who has water rights from particular dates in particular river basins, in determining which prior appropriation date will provide the cutoff date for a particular snowmelt season, and in punishing people who use water from a river basin that their priority is insufficient to allow them to use.\n\nOnce established, water rights may be purchased and sold like property. So, for example, if a farming has water rights to X units of water dating with a 1891 appropriation date, and a developer wants to build a new subdivision whose residents need water in the same river basins, the developer can purchase the X units of water with an 1891 appropriate date from the farmer (who goes out of business without these water rights) and can give it to an HOA or water district for the developer's new subdivision.\n\nThere are special rules that tweak this general principle. The Western states have interstate compacts, which are basically treaties between U.S. states, that govern how much water upstream states must allow to pass to downstream states. These are not infrequently litigated in the original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThere are also special rules governing when and how much precipitation one can store in a cistern or rain barrel, treaties with Indian tribes regarding water rights, rules on storage of water you are allowed to use with your water rights, rules about wasting water, and rules about how groundwater aquifers are handled.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided water rights information:\n\nQuestion: A developer is planning to build a new residential subdivision in Arizona.

According to the principle of \"prior appropriation\" in water law, older water rights have higher priority. By purchasing the farm's water rights from 1891, the developer can secure a high-priority water allocation for the new subdivision. This is a common practice where developers buy existing water rights from agricultural properties to support new developments.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because CAPLTER is a research organization and does not grant water rights. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because water rights are not based on tax revenue or economic impact, but on the principle of prior appropriation.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because economic impact does not override the established system of water rights based on historical use and prior appropriation."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59434/are-midi-files-copyrighted", "docs_id": 59434, "title": "Are Midi files copyrighted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I have a midi file of a public domain work, it the midi file copyrighted?

The **requirement that a defendant raise the defense** going to something beyond the elements of the crime or civil claim **is what makes it an \"affirmative\" defense**. **Affirmative defenses are conclusively presumed to be unavailable to the defendant if not raised**.\n\nUsually, it is possible to prevail in a civil or criminal case by establishing a complete affirmative defense, even if the defendant admits all of the elements of the crime or civil claim against the defendant have been proven.\n\nAlso, many affirmative defenses (e.g. failure to mitigate damages, or heat of passion) are incomplete affirmative defenses that reduce the consequences that a defendant will face if the prosecution/plaintiff establishes a prima facie case (i.e. proves all the elements of the crime or civil claim), but will not completely eliminate all consequences of the prosecution/plaintiffs' proof of all elements of the crime or civil claim for the defendant.\n\nBut the prosecution/plaintiff must always prove each and every element of a crime or civil claim (beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases, and by preponderance of the evidence or by clear and convincing evidence in most non\\-criminal claims) even if the defendant fails to present any evidence or make any arguments related to the element of the crime or civil claim to prevail on the merits.\n\nSomething that undermines an element of the crime or civil claim is a mere regular defense, because it doesn't have to be raised affirmatively, although in civil cases, facts that are alleged in a plaintiff's complaint are deemed admitted if they are not affirmatively denied, making the distinction between affirmative defenses and ordinary defenses in civil cases rather subtle.\n\nOf course, the term \"defense\" can be used to encompass both affirmative defenses, and other defenses which are not affirmative defenses (such as defenses that disprove an element of the crime or civil claim).\n\nJust to complicate matters further, there are a small number of ordinary defenses that still have to be raised affirmatively in advance in a criminal case despite the fact that it disproves an element of the crime, rather than advancing some other matter. The main example of this is an alibi defense (i.e. I wasn't at the scene of the crime when it happened).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about affirmative defenses is NOT correct?\n\nA) Affirmative defenses must be raised by the defendant, or they are presumed to be unavailable.\n\nB) The burden of proof for an affirmative defense in a civil case typically falls on the defendant.\n\nC) An affirmative defense always completely eliminates all consequences for the defendant if proven.\n\nD) Affirmative defenses can be raised even if the defendant admits to all elements of the crime or civil claim.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: The passage states that \"Affirmative defenses are conclusively presumed to be unavailable to the defendant if not raised.\"\n\nB is correct: The text mentions that \"in a civil case, at least, the burden of proof for an affirmative defense is on the defendant.\"\n\nC is incorrect: The passage explains that \"many affirmative defenses (e.g. failure to mitigate damages, or heat of passion) are incomplete affirmative defenses that reduce the consequences that a defendant will face... but will not completely eliminate all consequences.\" This contradicts the statement in option C.\n\nD is correct: The passage states, \"Usually, it is possible to prevail in a civil or criminal case by establishing a complete affirmative defense, even if the defendant admits all of the elements of the crime or civil claim against the defendant have been proven.\"\n\nTherefore, C is the only statement that is not correct according to the given information."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78596/can-tucker-carlson-be-penalized-or-punished-by-the-us-government", "docs_id": 78596, "title": "Can Tucker Carlson be penalized or punished by the US government?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Tucker Carlson has often shown much bias in his reporting and opinions.

Giving people the freedom to say \"our government is wrong\" without being afraid of repercussions is the reason why this amendment exists. And yes, freedom of speech includes the freedom to be wrong. When someone makes false claims in public to sway public opinion, then it's the responsibility of their peers to [point out those falsehoods](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/tucker-carlson/) and let people decide by themselves who to believe. The government can of course also engage in counter\\-speech, for example by holding a press conference where they address claims made about them and present their side of the debate. But it is not the job of the government to use force to suppress falsehoods, because the government can not be expected to be impartial in this matter.\n\nThe government not suppressing public discourse is one thing which separates libertarian states like the United States from [authoritarian states where uncomfortable speech is suppressed](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/71414/which-statements-about-the-war-in-ukraine-are-now-criminal-in-russia).\n\nThere are [a couple exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions).

While recording and sharing a sports event may not necessarily violate copyright law (as the recorder is making their own creative choices and sports events are not scripted), there are other legal considerations to keep in mind.\n\nOption A is incorrect because sports events themselves are generally not protected by copyright in the same way that musical performances or scripted events are.\n\nOption B is overly permissive. While the recorder may be considered the author of their own video, there could be other legal issues, especially if they try to monetize the content.\n\nOption C is the most accurate.

Although certain matters pertain to the states, federal laws trump those laws.

IE state laws regulating birth (either forcing them or preventing them) would not be constitutional as they are regulating immigration separate from the Federal govt.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While in many areas of law the federal government and states have concurrent jurisdiction, immigration is not one of them.\n\nThe federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration, and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution makes birth in the United States an event relevant for citizenship, although Congressionally enacted immigration law also makes birth to a U.S. citizen or U.S. national parent relevant for immigration law.\n\nSo far as I know, state laws sometimes state that life begins at conception, but never say that birth occurs at some other time such as conception, and birth is the relevant event for immigration law. But that doesn't mean that a state couldn't enact a law that stated that birth occurs at conception (indeed, something close to that concept is the law in South Korea where historically you have been counted as one year old at birth and you get one year older for legal purposes each New Year's Day, regardless of when you were actually born, a law it is thinking of reforming in the near future to the global norm).\n\nBut, even if a state did this, it wouldn't matter. In the United States, words routinely mean different things in different laws. Words don't even always have the same meaning in different laws enacted by the same government. The fact that a state enacts a law defining something, for the purposes of some or all state laws, has no legal effect on the meaning of the same thing for purposes of a particular federal law. States legally define terms in a manner inconsistent with particular federal laws for their own purposes all the time.\n\nOn the other hand, this state law would not be unconstitutional, except to the limited extent that it purports to make its definition effective for purposes of federal law.\n\nFor example, a definition enacted for purposes of a homicide statute, would not conflict with an immigration law that uses a different definition, and would not be unconstitutional on the grounds that it regulated immigration which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government.\n\nIf the state statute were ambiguous regarding whether it applied to terms in federal laws, it would be interpreted to only apply to the use of that term under state law to avoid the constitutional question that would otherwise arise.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A state passes a law defining \"birth\" as occurring at conception for all legal purposes within the state.

The state law defining \"birth\" as occurring at conception would be constitutional for state purposes, such as in applying state criminal or civil laws. However, it would have no effect on federal immigration law or citizenship determination under the 14th Amendment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law itself is not unconstitutional merely for defining a term differently from federal law, as long as it doesn't attempt to regulate immigration directly.\n\nOption B is wrong because state laws cannot change how federal laws are applied. The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration, and federal definitions would still apply for federal purposes regardless of state law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the law would be constitutional even without explicitly excluding impact on federal laws.
