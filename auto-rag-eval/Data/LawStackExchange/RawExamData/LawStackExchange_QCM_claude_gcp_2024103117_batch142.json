Prohibiting an assembly because of viewpoint is illegal. Banning a group is illegal (regardless of the reason for such a ban). A group cannot be banned because they don't have a permit (this too is a First Amendment issue): however, an *assembly* can be prohibited if there is no permit. An event can be disbanded if it causes violence or unreasonable disruption, but if others engage in violence in response to a demonstration, that does not invalidate your First Amendment rights (\"The police must permit the speech and control the crowd; there is no heckler\u2019s veto\", [Cox v. Louisiana](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/379/536/) 379 U.S. 536\\). Even if a past event by the organization has resulted in violence, a subsequent event cannot be prohibited ([U.S. v. Baugh](https://openjurist.org/187/f3d/1037/united-states-of-america-v-pamela-baugh), 187 F.3d 1037\\). The constitutional right to assembly is an individual right, not a collective right: an individual cannot lose his First Amendment rights, so a city cannot ban particular individuals.\n\nThere is a huge difference between what the city may do with respect to public property and private property. Compelled speech is also unconstitutional. When an individual unlawfully take possession of the property of another in order to express himself, that is trespassing. The government cannot compel an individual to involuntarily support a viewpoint, thus a protester does not have a constitutional right to protest on my private property. They *do* have that right with respect to public places. (Not absolutely *all* places, e.g. not on a military base).\n\nAny limits on time and place have to be narrowly constructed and clearly stated in the law, and arbitrarily limiting an assembly to some location miles from the intended audience is illegal ([Bay Area Peace Navy v. U.S](https://openjurist.org/914/f2d/1224/bay-area-peace-navy-v-united-states), 914 F.2d 1224\\). Limitations have to be reasonably and narrowly related to safety and disruption concerns, or to regulate competing uses ([Forsyth County, Ga. v. Nat\u2019list Movement](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/505/123/), 505 U.S. 123\\).

The government cannot ban a group based on their political beliefs or viewpoints.\n\nOption B is also illegal. Even if a past event by the organization resulted in violence, a subsequent event cannot be prohibited, as established in U.S. v. Baugh.\n\nOption C is the correct answer. Cities can implement content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions on assemblies, as long as these restrictions are narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest (such as public safety) and leave open ample alternative channels of communication. Requiring permits and setting reasonable limits on time and place, if applied equally to all groups, is generally considered constitutional.\n\nOption D is unconstitutional.

Assume that the police officer punches/kicks/grabs first, and you are not guilty of any crime before the attack. To what extend can you do so?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The General Rule**\n\nIn practice, the only time when self\\-defense against a police officer is legal is when you do not know and have no reasonable way that you could have known that the person attacking you is a police officer. (And arguably, a police officer acting in an official capacity in furtherance of his or her duties, rather than in a personal capacity as an individual.)\n\nFor example, if the police do a no knock raid in the dark of night, and don't announce themselves, and you shoot police officers reasonably believing them to be home invasion burglars, you would not have criminal or civil liability for doing so.\n\nA similar valid self\\-defense claim might arise when someone has an objectively reasonable reason to think that someone claiming to be a police officer is really just a criminal impersonating a police officer, even if that belief is, in fact, mistaken.\n\nIn almost all other circumstances, you need to submit to the officers, and you are pretty much required by law to bear the risk that excessive force by the officer will harm you. If you don't, you will probably be guilty of the crime of resisting arrest and will not be entitled to a self\\-defense defense.\n\nThe fact that you are not actually guilty of a crime is irrelevant. This is often the case and police officers are not omniscient. If the officer lacked probable cause for an arrest (which there is often no way that the person being arrested or attacked can know at the time), the remedy is a civil rights suit after the fact, not self\\-defense.\n\nIn theory, there might be other isolated circumstances where self\\-defense against a police officer is legal, but they involve fact patterns so quirky that they would almost never happen in real life, or would almost never be possible to prove in a manner that the courts would believe.\n\n**Officer Liability For Harming Someone Legitimately Acting In Self Defense**\n\nWhether the officers had civil liability to you if you were harmed by the officers while exercising your right to self\\-defense would depend upon their state of mind, even if you were rightfully using self\\-defense. \n\nFor example, a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in January of 2017 ([*White v. Pauly*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-67_2c8f.pdf)) involved this fact pattern. In *White v. Pauly* an officer arrived late on the scene and had no reason to believe that the officers who arrived there before him and were being shot at by citizens in a house that they were approaching, lacked probable cause, or had not announced themselves. The court held that as a result, he had no civil liability to a citizen he shot, even if the person who the late arriving officer shot while that citizen was shooting back at the police officers on the scene was actually engaging in good faith self\\-defense.\n\nThe citizen's self\\-defense in the case had a valid defense to criminal or civil liability for firing on the officers, because the citizen shooting back didn't actually know that the people approaching his house were police officers. But, because the late arriving officer reasonably believed under the circumstances that the citizen had no right to engage in self\\-defense, because he thought that the early arriving officers had probable cause and had announced themselves, the late arriving officer had no civil liability to the citizens he shot.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Officer Smith responds to a distress call at night in a high-crime area. Upon arrival, he sees his partner struggling with an individual. Without announcing himself, Smith immediately tackles the person.

The individual sustains injuries from Smith's tackle. Under these circumstances, which of the following is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The individual can successfully claim self-defense for any injuries caused to Officer Smith during the struggle.\nB) Officer Smith is definitely liable for civil damages due to his use of force against the individual.\nC) The individual has no legal recourse and must bear the injuries sustained from Officer Smith's actions.\nD) Officer Smith likely has qualified immunity from civil liability, even though the individual was justifiably defending himself.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario closely mirrors the complexities discussed in the White v. Pauly case. Officer Smith, arriving late to the scene, had no knowledge of the true circumstances and reasonably believed he was assisting his partner in subduing a suspect. Even though the individual (the undercover officer) was justifiably defending himself, Smith's actions would likely be viewed as reasonable given his limited knowledge of the situation. As per the Supreme Court's ruling, an officer who acts reasonably based on the information available to them at the time can be shielded from civil liability through qualified immunity, even if the citizen was actually engaging in lawful self-defense.

The recent Supreme Court case Texas Department of Housing & Community Affairs v.

The last owner had lived in that house from the time it was built in 1964 until four years ago. When the owner passed on, the bank took ownership of the house (under a reverse mortgage) and hired an agent to sell it. The house was bought with an FHA loan.\n\nAfter three years of living in the house, A discovered that, even though city sewer runs on the street, the house has a septic tank instead of being connected to the city sewer. The cost of connecting the house to the city sewer system is $25K. Emptying the septic tank will run about $3k to $4k since they have to dig up to reach the hatch.\n\nAll public websites such as Zillow and Redfin say that the house is connected to city sewer. A received no disclosure from the real estate agent that the house has a septic system. Perhaps the agent didn't know either. A paid for inspection when A bought the house. Inspection didn't mention anything about a septic tank.\n\nIn terms of real estate law, does A have a valid claim against the bank, the agent, the inspector, or anyone else for failure to disclose the use of a septic system instead of the listed sewer connection?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on what state this is. In Washington state, [there is a form](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=64.06.020) that sellers must fill out, and section 3 addresses sewer connections. This matter could have been disclosed \u2013 the allowed answers are \"yes; no; don't know\" (or NA). These are *sellers* disclosures, and Zillow / Redfin are free to be unreliable (I personally know that they are wrong about square footage). A real estate agent also doesn't become liable for being misinformed. Assuming your state has this or analogous question, \"No\" means that you were told (doesn't matter if you didn't notice it), and \"Don't know\" means you're gambling.\n\nLet's say that the answer was \"Yes\". Still, you can't necessarily sue (and win): you would have to prove misrepresentation (fraud or negligence) and not innocent error. You could do this by, for instance, proving that seller had the septic tank cleaned out some years earlier.\n\nPerhaps an action against buyer's inspector is possible, since that's nominally what they might have been hired to find out.

This scenario does not result in an automatic collapse of the trust or immediate vesting of property in the beneficiary. English law allows for situations where the trustee and beneficiary can be the same person, so having Emily as both sole beneficiary and one of the trustees (if Sarah were to resign) would not invalidate the trust. The death of one trustee does not automatically terminate the trust or require immediate replacement, as long as at least one trustee remains. Option A is incorrect because the trust doesn't automatically collapse. Option B is incorrect because while appointing a new trustee might be advisable, it's not immediately required for the trust to continue. Option D is incorrect because there's no automatic vesting of trust property in the beneficiary upon a trustee's death."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1503/multiple-deals-in-a-row-and-reasonable-expectation", "docs_id": 1503, "title": "Multiple deals in a row and reasonable expectation", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I once heard that there is a certain level of reasonable expectation that is guaranteed by law when it comes to making multiple deals with others.\n\nFor instance, is the following legal or illegal to do.\n\n* Bill offered to Mow Janes lawn for $1, which is agreeable.\n* Bill mows the lawn, and gives Jane a bill for $1\\.\n* Jane happily pays.\n* A week pasts, and Jane asks Bill to mow her lawn again.\n* Bill mows the lawn again, and give Jane a bill for $2\n* Jane asks why $2 and not $1, like last week\n* Bill says that he changed the price within the last week due to high demand of his services, and that is what he charges everyone now.\n\nI do not mind which country the law exists, or if it exists at all; I was told that this was illegal to do (anecdotally), and I just want to get a quick opinion (not used in any legal way, just to cure my curiosity) and see if they were telling the truth or not.\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Bill and Jane are free to enter into a contract where, among other things, each provides valuable consideration; in this case Bill provides valuable lawn mowing services and Jane provides valuable money.\n\nIn week No 1 they have negotiated the terms and the contract is complete when Bill mows the lawn and Jane pays the money.\n\nIf Bill turns up next week without Jane's instruction then there is no contract and Jane does not have to pay anything; I don't think this is what you are asking but I include it for completeness.\n\nIf it is understood that this arrangement continue week after week then either there is an ongoing contract or, more likely, a series of independent contracts.\n\nIf there is an ongoing contract, then it can be renegotiated but it cannot be changed unilaterally by Bill.

The attorney who drafted the trust did so in such a way as to alter the intent of the deceased. I believe he did this intentionally. The same attorney lied on the witness stand. His testimony was directly countered by a witness whose veracity was beyond question. The judge for the trial had already decided the outcome of the trial before it started. This is known because of statements he made to attorneys before trial. The judge also actively advocated on behalf of the plaintiff, was very biased as well. The net result was, I was removed as trustee. An accounting was ordered. The Judge retired. Jump ahead 18 months. A trial was set because of objections to my accounting. After 3 days of trial, the new judge over ruled all objections. It was determined that the attorney for the trust I had hired had given me poor advice, bordering on malpractise. My current trial attorney had, unfortunately, neglected to enter the exhibit that supported this conclusion as evidence. Even though the judge had the information, he said he was unable to use it as it was not entered as evidence. So I was surcharged these fees, which is a high 5 figure. This judge also stated that he was satisfied in all respects with my performance as trustee and expressed surprise that I was removed. Now, my current trial attorney , the one who neglected to admit the exhibit, wants to go after the original attorney for those fees on a contingency basis, his fee to be 50% of the recovered money. That would leave me with nothing except still owing the trust the other half of those fees. I don't know where to go with this.\nThere is a lot more to the story, but I have tried to be concise.

If anyone could, it would be the probate estate of the deceased.\n\n> The same attorney lied on the witness stand.\n\nStatements made in a court proceeding are not actionable.\n\n> After 3 days of trial, the new judge over ruled all objections. It was\n>  determined that the attorney for the trust I had hired had given me\n>  poor advice, bordering on malpractise.\n\nFor this advice to be actionable, it would be necessary to show that you wouldn't have been removed and surcharged, but for the malpractice of your attorney. But, the attorney might plausibly argue that given the fact that the case was clearly prejudged, that the advice he gave you wouldn't have made a difference in any case.\n\n> My current trial attorney had, unfortunately, neglected to enter the\n>  exhibit that supported this conclusion as evidence.

He probably could have made a motion to reconsider that could have remedied this failure to introduce evidence, or an appeal that might have been successful. On the other hand, he can argue that but for the first attorneys' malpractice, this wouldn't have been an issue, so liability should at least be shared if not entirely transferred to the first attorney, and that subsequent uncertain litigation options not exercised shouldn't count against you (or him).\n\n> my current trial attorney , the one who neglected to admit the\n>  exhibit, wants to go after the original attorney for those fees on a\n>  contingency basis, his fee to be 50% of the recovered money. That\n>  would leave me with nothing except still owing the trust the other\n>  half of those fees.\n\nIt is often the case in life that you can't be made whole from someone else's wrongs. Attorney malpractice cases are almost always of this variety, since you generally can't recover your attorneys' fees in an attorney malpractice case, only your damages. Someone, whether the current attorney or a third attorney, is going to charge a fee to sue someone for malpractice.\n\nThe benefit of going with the current attorney is that he is up to speed and is willing to take the case on a contingency basis, albeit a steep one. The downside is that the current attorney will not sue himself and may have liability as well, that the current attorney has made a key mistake once and could do so again, and that the current attorney may be conflicted out of the case as a potentially responsible party and as a potential witness at some point. \n\nSo, if you could find someone other than your current attorney to bring a malpractice case on a contingent basis, that would probably be better for you. Suing two attorneys instead of one also increases the likelihood that you can collect whatever judgments you secure. But, it may be hard to find someone to represent you in a case like that since the amount of time involved in a case like this for a plaintiff's attorney is very substantial and also requires considerable outlays for expert witness fees.\n\nAll of this said, however, attorney malpractice cases are very difficult to prevail in since you must prove not only malpractice but also a \"case within a case\" to show that you would have gotten a different and better result but for the malpractice. \n\nMost of the time, you will end up settling for only a portion of your damages prior to trial to avoid the cost of litigation and the risk of a defense verdict. So with a 33% to 50% contingent fee, your net recovery might realistically often be in the 1/4 to 1/3 of your losses in a decent settlement equal to half of your actual losses.\n\nA settlement like this is better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, but no attorney malpractice case is going to make you whole. And, you may decide that the time and distraction involved in litigating an attorney malpractice case may not be worth the trouble to you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A trustee of a moderate-sized trust is removed from their position and surcharged a high 5-figure amount due to a series of legal complications. The trustee is considering legal action against the attorneys involved. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the trustee's potential for legal recourse and recovery?\n\nA) The trustee can sue the judge who showed bias for damages, as judicial immunity does not apply in cases of clear prejudice.\n\nB) The trustee has a strong case against the attorney who drafted the trust, as altering the intent of the deceased is grounds for a lawsuit by the trustee.\n\nC) The trustee's best course of action is to accept the current attorney's offer to sue the original attorney on a 50% contingency basis, as this guarantees full recovery of losses.\n\nD) The trustee may pursue a malpractice case against one or both attorneys, but full recovery of losses is unlikely, and the case may be difficult to win.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement. The trustee may indeed have grounds for a malpractice case against one or both attorneys involved. However, attorney malpractice cases are notoriously difficult to win, as they require proving not only malpractice but also that a different outcome would have occurred without the malpractice. Additionally, even if successful, the trustee is unlikely to recover all losses due to legal fees and the difficulty of proving damages. The other options are incorrect: A) Judges have absolute immunity from lawsuits for their judicial actions; B) Trustees typically don't have standing to sue for altered intent in trust drafting; C) The 50% contingency offer would not guarantee full recovery and might even result in the trustee still owing money to the trust."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7322/is-it-legal-to-sell-a-software-which-will-scan-user-files-with-multiple-antivira", "docs_id": 7322, "title": "Is it legal to sell a software which will scan user files with multiple antiviral engines located on remote server?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have an idea for a software, which will allow users to upload their files for antivirus scan, receive scan results and perform corresponding action on user end.

The slower season was advertised as a benefit of the job. Assuming the auditor performed well and was not fired for discriminatory reasons, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of the termination?\n\nA) The termination is illegal because the employer misrepresented the job benefits.\nB) The termination is legal only if the employer can prove the auditor's performance was unsatisfactory.\nC) The termination is legal due to Washington's \"At Will\" employment laws, unless there was a contractual agreement specifying employment duration.\nD) The termination is illegal because it violates overtime pay regulations for exempt employees.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Washington State follows \"At Will\" employment laws, which allow employers to terminate employees for any reason or no reason at all, as long as it's not discriminatory against a protected class. The advertisement of a slower season as a benefit doesn't constitute a binding contract unless explicitly agreed upon in writing. Even if the auditor performed well, the employer has the right to terminate employment. The exception would be if there was a specific contractual agreement guaranteeing employment for a certain duration.

However in the United Kingdom there is another interesting system with its own traditions, procedures, terminology \u2013 Scots Law (Scottish Law).\n\nI wonder if there is any significant influence of Scots Law anywhere outside Scotland itself, particularly in the US? Are there any elements in any US legal system, or parts of it, that can be traced to Scots Law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nI really can't think of any influences of Scots Law on U.S. law. In all of the areas where I know Scots law to be distinctive vis\\-a\\-vis English common law, the U.S. has not followed the Scots law model, and I have never seen a Scottish precedent cited in a court opinion in the U.S. while I have seen many English ones cited (with one narrow exception noted below).\n\nFor example, while the Scots Law concept of a criminal trial verdict of \"not proven\" rather than \"not guilty\" has been discussed by academics and policymakers, to the best of my knowledge, no U.S. jurisdiction has adopted a \"not proven\" verdict option.\n\nTwo U.S. states experimented with non\\-unanimous verdicts, something that U.S. law has since disavowed, but so far as I know, this decision was not borrowed from Scottish practice. In Louisiana, it was a calculated strategy to make it easier to convict black defendants after slavery was abolished.\n\nNo U.S. jurisdiction has ever had petite juries of 15 in any kind of case.\n\nScotland and the U.S. are now aligned in being jurisdictions that have [jury trials of ordinary personal injury cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_jury_in_Scotland), something that very few countries do, but in the U.S. case, the right to a jury trial in personal injury cases flows from English law practice that England later modified while the U.S. did not, rather than from copying Scots law.\n\nScotland still has many [common law crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_criminal_law), which U.S. jurisdictions are in the final stages of completely abolishing (most have done so, but there are a few partial stragglers). Similarly, U.S. criminal law, unlike Scots Law, has never required corroboration for a criminal conviction, although, of course, it is desirable to have it if possible.\n\nThe [Scottish Court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courts_of_Scotland) has much more specialization of court jurisdiction than almost all U.S. jurisdictions do, although U.S. jurisdictions vary in the extent to which they have specialized courts, and of course, no U.S. jurisdiction has had religious courts since the early 1800s before the church was disestablished in New England.\n\nWhile the U.S. merged law and equity for the most part, as did most common law jurisdictions, the distinction still has a significant residual effect that differs from [Scots law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_law) which never fully separated the two. Equity is still taught as a distinct elective class in many U.S. law schools to this day.\n\nPerhaps the only area I can think of where there has arguably been some borrowing from Scots Law has been in the jurisdiction and choice of law analysis applied to marriage and divorce questions. It used to be easier to get married in Scotland than in England, and in cases of parental or religious opposition, couples sometimes went to Scotland to get married and left courts to sort out whether that was legitimate after the fact. This is an area where U.S. case law sometimes referred to how those issues were resolved in the cases of disputes over whether English or Scottish laws related to marriage formation and marriage dissolution should apply.\n\nI don't know the law of mineral rights well enough to describe the provenance of some of its doctrines accurately, but there are some similarities between the Scottish concepts applicable to the structure of mineral rights, when they are reserved in a patent from the sovereign of the surface rights to property (as many key mineral rights in Scotland were starting in the early modern period), that may have some Scots Law influence.\n\nThe lack of Scots Law impact on U.S. law despite significant Scottish immigration to the U.S. is to some extent a function of U.S. immigration history.\n\nScottish immigration that was early enough to have an impact on the legal system's larger outlines was mostly \"Scotch\\-Irish\" (i.e. Protestants from the Scottish borderlands, often traditionally herders or subsistence farmers, who were ancestral to the current Irish Protestants of Northern Ireland), who were lower to middle class, who engaged mostly in rural subsistence farming in Appalachia and the rural American South, and were not prominent in commerce and were subordinate to an English elite (the Episcopal Church of English origins has always a higher socioeconomic status church in the U.S. than the Presbyterian Church which has Scottish roots).\n\nBy the time middle class Scottish people engaged in commerce and inclined to participate in formal law and politics arrived in the U.S., a wave of migration reflected in the American West mostly from the mid\\-1800s as part of the gold rush and homesteading movements, the die was largely already cast with respect to major framework level issues in the U.S. legal system. The map below partially obscures this history to some extent, however, because [many people with Scotch\\-Irish ancestry now identify for census purposes as \"American.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch-Irish_Americans)\n\nMany anthropologists attribute the \"[culture of honor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_honor_(Southern_United_States))\" of the American South and Appalachia to a Scotch\\-Irish ancestral source, and this culture of honor surely did influence the character of various U.S. legal doctrines and legislative developments in the U.S., but it did not involve direct borrowings from Scots Law, and indeed, it can be seen as deriving from a subculture of people for whom formal legal institutions in Scotland were sufficiently weak in practical application that they had little impact on their lives.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKhrL.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cKhrL.jpg)\n\nHonestly, if I had to hazard a guess, I would say that there have been more borrowings from Australian legal innovations (especially in probate and real property), and from civil law systems (for example, the law of good faith and fair dealing, and the law of unjust enrichment), than there have been from Scots law.\n\nI would be happy to be corrected if someone is aware of a counterexample, however.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the influence of Scots Law on the United States legal system?\n\nA) The concept of a \"not proven\" verdict in criminal trials has been widely adopted in U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nB) U.S. mineral rights law shows some potential influence from Scottish concepts, particularly regarding rights reserved by the sovereign.\n\nC) The structure of specialized courts in the U.S. is largely based on the Scottish Court system.\n\nD) The \"culture of honor\" in the American South, derived from Scotch-Irish settlers, led to direct borrowings from formal Scots Law.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while the \"not proven\" verdict has been discussed, no U.S. jurisdiction has adopted it. \nB is correct as the passage mentions that there may be some similarities in mineral rights concepts, particularly when reserved by the sovereign, that could have Scots Law influence. \nC is incorrect because U.S. jurisdictions generally have less specialization in court jurisdiction compared to the Scottish system. \nD is incorrect because while the \"culture of honor\" may have influenced some U.S. legal doctrines, it did not involve direct borrowings from formal Scots Law.\n\nThis question tests the student's ability to carefully discern nuanced information from the passage and identify the most accurate statement among options that all contain elements of truth but vary in their precision and accuracy."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44149/what-are-the-reasons-for-the-european-court-of-justice-to-declare-a-legal-act-of", "docs_id": 44149, "title": "What are the reasons for the European Court of Justice to declare a legal act of the EU invalid?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides:\n\n> The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:  \n> \n>  (a) the interpretation of the Treaties;  \n> \n>  (b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;  \n> \n>  \\[...]\n\nWhat are the reasons to declare a legal act of the EU (such as regulation or directive) invalid?\n\nThe Article 263 of the TFEU provides:\n\n> The Court of Justice of the European Union shall review the legality of legislative acts, of acts of the Council, of the Commission and of the European Central Bank, other than recommendations and opinions, and of acts of the European Parliament and of the European Council intended to produce legal effects vis\\-\u00e0\\-vis third parties.

In particular, in Articles 173 \\[modern TFEU 263] and 184 \\[TFEU 277], on the one hand, and in Article 177 \\[TFEU 267], on the other, the Treaty established a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to permit the Court of Justice to review the legality of measures adopted by the institutions. \\[...]\n\nFor modern restatements see for example [C\u2011583/11](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=142607&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=884022) paragraph 92 or [C\u201172/15](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=189262&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=req&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=885613) paragraph 66\\.\n\nUltimately, all EU acts must be consistent with the \"basic constitutional charter,\" these days that's the [Treaty on European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maastricht_Treaty) (TEU), the [Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Functioning_of_the_European_Union) (TFEU) and by reference, the [Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_Fundamental_Rights_of_the_European_Union).\n\nWhile Regulations and Directives could only be declared invalid on the basis that they violate the treaties, secondary legislation or actions could additionally be declared invalid under whatever Regulation or Directive they were adopted.\n\nFor a Directive invalidity example, see *Digital Rights Ireland and Seitlinger and Others* ([Joined Cases C\u2011293/12 and C\u2011594/12](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=150642&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=888650)) where the Data Retention Directive was declared invalid1, being contrary to Charter Articles 7, 8 and 52(1\\).\n\nAs to \"validity\" versus \"legality\", there appears to be no real difference, as the court is very much stating the equivalence of the two Articles in this respect.\n\n---\n\n1.

You cannot arrest or convict based on a hint. A hint plus other facts can result in a warrant, which can result in a conviction. This is the case of the Golden State Killer. The details of the case are not generally known, but [see this paper](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1136717) for a bit more information. Basically, they used public genetic databases to arrive at a tree of about 1,000 persons related to the suspect, and used other investigative techniques to narrow it down further.

There have been attempts to limit police access to genetic databases at the state level, and no laws have been passed. The Dept. of Justice has limited restrictions on the use of forensic genetic data in cases that it is involved with in certain ways, [see here](https://www.justice.gov/olp/page/file/1204386/download).

Would I for example have to include the storage service as a sub\\-processor in my published list of sub\\-processors?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since you are able to encrypt the data, the data is clearly personal data for you. That means you will have to comply with the GDPR regarding how you process and store this data. This involves disclosing recipients of this data per Art 13(1\\)(e), and only engaging data processors in line with Art 28\\.\n\nYour storage provider such as Azure and AWS cannot decrypt this data, so it would not be personal data if processed by them for their own purposes. There is an argument that they did not receive personal data, especially considering the definition of a recipient in Art 4: a person/entity \u201cto which the personal data are disclosed\u201d.\n\nHowever, this is not necessarily relevant when talking about sub\\-processors. A processor is anyone who \u201cprocesses personal data on behalf of the controller\u201d. As processors, they're not using the data for their own purposes but are just acting on your behalf. Storage is a kind processing, and they are storing data on your behalf. This data is personal data for you. Thus, I'd consider the storage providers to be your processors.\n\nDue to your use of strong client\\-side encryption, your remaining compliance obligations are mostly boilerplate (signing a data processing agreement per Art 28, sorting out international transfers if necessary, and getting agreement for adding a sub\\-processor from your controllers). Note that encryption is mandatory whenever appropriate (Art 32(1\\)(a)).\n\nSuch client\\-side encryption could even serve as a legal basis for storing the data in jurisdictions that don't offer an adequate level of data protection, such as a data center in the US.

The encryption is performed on the company's own servers before transmission, and the encryption keys are never shared with the cloud provider. Under GDPR, how should the company treat the cloud service provider in terms of data processing?\n\nA) The cloud provider is not a data processor since they cannot access the unencrypted data.\nB) The cloud provider is a data processor and must be listed as a sub-processor, but no data processing agreement is necessary due to encryption.\nC) The cloud provider is a data processor and must be listed as a sub-processor, with a data processing agreement in place.\nD) The cloud provider is a data controller since they are storing the data on their servers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Even though the data is encrypted and the cloud provider cannot access the unencrypted information, they are still considered a data processor under GDPR. The cloud provider is processing personal data on behalf of the controller (the company) by storing it, which is a form of processing. Therefore, the cloud provider should be listed as a sub-processor, and a data processing agreement should be in place as required by Article 28 of GDPR. The encryption provides strong protection but does not change the cloud provider's status as a processor.

In the US, [copyright in unpublished works](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain) lasts for the life of the creator \\+ 70 years. After that, they pass into the public domain. This means that if the composer/arranger died before 1919, then the works passed into the public domain before the formal publication in 1989, and they are still in the public domain now. However, if the creator died after 1919, then their 1989 publication effectively \"resets the clock\" on the copyright, and they will not come into the public domain until (according to the above link) 70 years after the death of the creator or 2048, whichever comes later.\n\nWhat doesn't matter is that the original symphonic works were in the public domain. Even if the *1812 Overture* is in the public domain, I could write an arrangement of it for accordion quintet and I would have the exclusive right to publish it and profit from that arrangement for the standard term. In your case, if the work really is a straight transcription, it *might* not have a copyright; but if the work required some amount of creativity and artistic decision\\-making (which a piano transcription of a symphony certainly would) then the arrangement gets its own copyright when it's published.\n\n### Can I make transcriptions of them if I don't publish them?\n\nProbably, but you should really consult your librarians. It's entirely possible that your proposed copying would fall under \"fair use\"; it would be for scholarship \\& research and you're not planning to include the transcriptions in your final published work. On the other hand, you're talking about effectively copying a substantial portion of a creative work that is still in print, which argues against fair use.

But this is a security leak as I don't want to disclose my inventions even if they are simple, it's a matter of privacy.

So the question is what I can do or what the reality is of the situation\n\nThe reality is that you are asked to sign a contract that is abusive and ridiculous. \n\nOne vulnerability from describing your inventions (presumably in Appendix A) is that the employer gets \"irrevocable, worldwide, etc\" rights on them as soon as you \"*use or disclose any \\[items listed in Appendix A] when acting within the scope of \\[your] employment*\". This means that if instead of reinventing the wheel you share or apply any portion of your prior creations so as to enhance your productivity, you *knowingly* and *irreversibly* grant to the employer perpetual rights to those items.\n\nLegal disputes regarding APIs can become extremely intricate.

The only somewhat relevant case is [Busby v.

The court does stress out that:\n\n> **The Convention does forbid a signatory country (or subsidiary state) from imposing or enforcing license revocations in a manner that discriminates against residents of other signatory countries.** But Busby does not claim that he was the victim of such discrimination. Busby's license was revoked for conduct that would have led to license revocation if committed by an Alaska resident. (Indeed, Busby's license was revoked while he was an Alaska resident.) And Busby does not claim that he was singled out for prosecution because he was a resident of a foreign country\u2014i.e., that the State would not have charged him with the offense of driving with a revoked license if he had still been an Alaska resident.\n\nThis could possibly mean that the court believes that the Convention only applies to foreign residents, but its not spelled out specifically.\n* Searching for Canadian court cases [likewise doesn't turn up anything useful](https://www.canlii.org/en/#search/type=decision&text=%22convention%20on%20road%20traffic%22).

First, to settle the definition of \"international traffic\":\n\n> Nonetheless, the United States ultimately accepted that \u201cthe purpose\n>  of chapter II was to establish, in effect, an international code of minimum\n>  safety requirements.

Nonetheless, a court might conclude\n>  that, with respect to section II\u2019s rules of the road, the governmental obligation is merely to \u201ctake appropriate measures\u201d\n>  and that such an obligation is too vague to be enforced judicially.\n\n---\n\nSo it seems absolutely clear that the Convention intended for participating countries to allow foreign drivers to drive abroad for up to one year. However international treaties [are not self\\-executing by default in Canada](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-making-power/), unlike the US:\n\n> Canada is bound by the terms of treaties that it enters into and breach thereof may give rise to international claims. However, in Canada treaties are not self\\-executing; they do not constitute part of the law of the land merely by virtue of their conclusion.\n\nSo even though British Columbia is violating the 1949 Geneva Convention one cannot directly rely on said international agreement to enforce their rights.

Your question needs to address these specifics in order to analyze it and respond in a meaningful way.\n\nLook at it like this... just as it is impossible to prove a negative, so is it impossible for anyone to conclude with absolute certainty that any law is ***not unconstitutional*** because no one can predict with certainty every possible future challenge a law might face. There are just too many possibilities to (pre\\-emptively) exhaust them all with certainty. Also, no one can predict with certainty how any future court might rule on the future challenges (*which themselves* are unpredictable as previously argued).

You would need a legal basis, and a lawyer. When you say that you don't have a contract, I assume you mean that you don't have a piece of signed paper, but you do have an agreement \u2013 which *is* a contract.

In most U.S. states there is a two part test. One part is determined based upon the face of the document, the other is based upon extrinsic evidence.\n\n**Formal Requirements**\n\nTo be formally valid without a hearing unless an interested party requests one in most U.S. states on its face (i.e. to be a \"self\\-proving will\") a will must:\n\n* Be in writing.\n* Be signed by the person making the will who is at least eighteen years of age.\n* Be signed by at least two witnesses who do not have conflicts of interest, who are attesting that the person making the will was competent and that they saw him or her sign it.\n* The signatures of the witnesses must be notarized. If their statements are not notarized, usually at least one witness must testify in a hearing or with a later affidavit.\n* The language of the will must indicate an intent to make a binding disposition of property in the estate of the person making it when they die, and other rights related to their estate and their death.\n\nVarious exceptions to these requirements exist in most state (e.g. a \"holographic will\" is valid if it is in writing, indicates the necessary intent, is signed, and has its material provision substantially in the hand writing of the person writing it).\n\nSome states allow oral wills called \"nuncupative wills\" in very specific circumstances usually limited to soldiers or sailors in circumstances of actual battle or imminent mayhem likely to result in death, with the proper witnesses.\n\nA will is like a dollar bill, a copy is not as good as the original document. If the original document cannot be found it is presumed that the will was revoked by physical destruction of the will, in the absence of evidence to the contrary submitted at a hearing to a judge.\n\n**Extrinsic Requirements**\n\nAny interested party can contest a will that appears valid on its face under the standards describe above on several grounds.\n\nTwo of these relate to the condition of the person signing the will at the time it was signed. The notarized witness statements create a presumption that these two conditions were met. But, that presumption can be overcome with other evidence from witnesses and/or documents or other kinds of evidence. These conditions are:\n\n* The document was procured from the person making it with duress or undue influence, even if the person making it did have \"testamentary capacity.\"\n* The person making it lacked testamentary capacity which is also a two part test. The first part is that the person making it knows who their family and the \"natural objects of their bounty are\", knows in general terms what they own, and knows what a will is intended to do and is capable of understanding the general outlines of what it does. This basically rules out people with severe dementia. The second part is that if the person is not suffering from dementia but is suffering from hallucinations, that the hallucinations have not influenced the nature of the provisions contained in the will.\n\nIn practice, \"[undue influence](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/law_aging/publications/bifocal/vol_35/issue_3_feb2014/defining_undue_influence/)\" is the predominant ground for contesting wills that are formally valid on their face because testamentary capacity is a very low standard.\n\nA will can also be contested on the grounds involving extrinsic evidence that:\n\n* A later validly executed document revoked the will, or\n* The document is a forgery.\n\nIf any of the issues related to extrinsic evidence are disputed, both the party contesting the will, and the party defending it, has a right to have that issue resolved in a jury trial, although often the right to a jury trial in a case like this is waived by the parties.\n\nThis is determined by making a reasonable inquiry before submitting the will and examining the physical document and the place where it was when it was discovered, closely. The inquiry should be very searching if the terms of the will are surprising, and can be fairly lax if the terms of the will are what was widely expected.\n\nThere is generally a notice given to all interested parties when a will is submitted to a court with probate jurisdiction to be given effect that contains a deadline to raise a contest along these lines. A will that is not submitted to a court with probate jurisdiction usually has no force or effect until that happen in most U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nPublic Policy\n=============\n\nEven if the will is valid in general, some terms of the will may be invalid as a matter of public policy, or modified by statue, in certain circumstances. These exceptions can usually be determined on the face of the document or with minimal additional information (although \"your mileage may vary\" and cases where, for example, the cause of death or date of death is uncertain can be difficult).\n\nFor example, the following limitations are common:\n\n* A term in a will conditioning a gift at death on marrying or not marrying a particular person is void in most, if not all, U.S. states.\n* Under certain circumstances a will is required to leave certain minimum amounts to a surviving spouse and/or minor dependent children.\n* If a will appears to omit a child of the person making it by accident, it is modified in particular ways mandated by statute.\n* Will provisions making gifts at death or giving responsibilities to someone who murdered the person who wrote the will are void.\n* Some states invalidate provisions in favor of an ex\\-spouse upon divorce, unless a post\\-divorce document reaffirms those inheritances.\n* Certain kinds of words are given defined statutory meanings unless the express language of a will says otherwise, such as \"by representation\", or \"if he survives me\", that are not necessarily intuitive or in line with every day use of language.\n\nIt is usually necessary to review the probate court and case law in the state where the decedent was domiciled at death to determine if these limitations apply, ideally with a probate or estate administration lawyer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John, a 75-year-old widower with dementia, signed a will leaving his entire estate to his caretaker, Sarah.

The question states the will was properly signed and witnessed, which often suffices for formal validity.\n\nB) Testamentary capacity is a low standard.

The evidence is thrown out of court.\n\nHowever, I've heard cops can seize cash on even less suspicion.\n\nBasically many cops see cash, think it's from drug dealing, and seize it.\n\nThe mere act of bringing cash is punishable by civil forfeiture without trial.\n\nBy that **logic**, the cop that **suspect** the stereo is from a crime, should also be able to seize the stereo.\n\nOnce the stereo is seized, it's easy to just look at the back and see the serial number.\n\nAnother way to look at this:\n\nWhy didn't the cop just use civil forfeiture laws to seize the stereo and then, after the stereo is on cops' hand, the cop can just see the serial number?\n\nDid the cop have a right to seize the stereo under civil forfeiture law?\n\nCan the cop see the stereo serial number after seizing the stereo?\n\nIf the answer two both question is yes, then why bother getting a warrant to look behind?\n\nAlso, what should have the cop done on that circumstances to capture the burglar?

There were expensive stereo components in plain sight, which raised a reasonable suspicion. But that reasonable suspicion did not justify a further search, which police nevertheless conducted: they turned the stereo to get the serial numbers. Having phoned in the numbers and learning that the items were stolen, they then had probable cause for a seizure. That cause was, however, obtained via an illegal search.\n\nSuppose that the serial numbers had been visible from the front: then because they would have been in plain view and since the police were there for a reasonable search related to the shooting, then could have legally seized the stereo, since no additional search was required.\n\nThere is no distinction between search and seizure w.r.t. 4th Amendment protection (\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated\"). Police could not confiscate the stereo without probable cause, nor could they confiscate cash, or any other thing, again, unless they had probable cause. And they could not search for evidence that would give them probable cause to take stuff.\n\nAs SCOTUS said, regarding searches versus seizures, \n\n> We have not elsewhere drawn a categorical distinction between the two\n>  insofar as concerns the degree of justification needed to establish\n>  the reasonableness of police action, and we see no reason for a\n>  distinction in the particular circumstances before us here.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the Arizona v.

In this scenario, the police could have legally seized the stereo without conducting an additional search, as they would have probable cause based on the visible serial numbers matching those of stolen property.

I've leased this office for many years and currently don't have a lease. The owner of the building has decided to sell, and the new buyer has contacted me and asked me to sign a lease.\n\nThere is absolutely no benefit to me to signing a lease. Office space is plentiful locally, so the new owner needs me more than I need them. However, the buyer informed me today that if I don't sign a lease, the mortgage won't be approved. I don't want to be the guy who killed a real estate deal and end up with both the current owner and future owner mad at me. So the buyer proposed writing a contract \"on the side\" between us that releases me from the lease if I provide 90 days notice. The mortgage lender would be unaware of this contract. I'm amenable to that, but it raises some questions:\n\n1. Concealing the contract from the mortgage company is probably credit fraud of sorts, but my view is that's the buyer's problem, not mine. Am I correct on that?\n2. Would it be a legal, enforceable contract? If I give 90 days' notice and the landlord refuses to release me from the lease, would a court find in my favor?\n3. Am I missing other legal pitfalls?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can a contract alter a lease?\n\nYes. A lease is a contract and, as such, is amenable to mutually agreed modifications.\n\n> my view is that's the buyer's problem, not mine. Am I correct on that?\n\nYes. The problematic scenario might be if you were planning to leave the building in the foreseeable future and the new buyer intentionally concealed that knowledge from the lender. That could be actionable as conspiracy with \\-\\-or abetting of\\-\\- the new buyer. Your description does not reflect any plans of yours to vacate the premises, though.\n\n> Would it be a legal, enforceable contract?\n\nYes. However, it is utmost important that the \"separate\" contract make it clear the superseding effect it has on the full contract that is presented to the lender.\n\nThe primary reason for this is that, when interpreting a contract, a court is supposed to restrict its review to the language of the contract only. Any external records are ignored unless they explicitly relate to the contract, or in situations where the language of the contract lacks guidance as to the controversy at issue.\n\nAlso, without proper reference to the official lease, the separate provision would look as a one\\-sided promise rather than an *exchange* of considerations (by definition, a contract is an exchange of considerations). Thus, you would be more vulnerable to the new buyer's eventual decision not to honor the provision. \n\nStrictly speaking, the separate contract with no references to the official lease could make it clear that your consideration was in the form of helping the new buyer in his mortgage process. However, for obvious reasons the new buyer will refuse to reflect that in the separate contract. Hence, your protection consists of ensuring that the relation between the official contract and the separate contract is explicit in the latter.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, a tenant is asked to sign a lease to help a new building owner secure a mortgage, but with a separate agreement allowing early termination.

The documentation emphasizes the importance of the separate agreement explicitly referencing the main lease to ensure its enforceability. This is crucial because courts typically restrict their review to the language within the contract itself. Without proper reference to the official lease, the separate agreement could be seen as a one-sided promise rather than a valid contract with an exchange of considerations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the tenant is not likely to be held liable for mortgage fraud in this scenario, as that would be the buyer's responsibility.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the separate agreement can be legally enforceable if properly constructed.\n\nOption C is partially true but incomplete.

The situation described meets the elements of contract formation: Cash App made a general offer (unilateral contract) through their promotion, and the user performed by referring a new client who met all the stated conditions. The fact that Cash App partially fulfilled the promotion (giving $5 to the new user) further strengthens the case that a valid contract exists. \n\nThe user has a reasonable case for breach of contract, as they fulfilled their part of the agreement but did not receive the promised compensation.

(Since, ostensibly, Josephine would be getting all that she is due.)\n* Does Josephine's desire to represent the class make a difference?\n* Does it make a difference whether the class has been certified or not?\n* Does it matter whether Josephine accepts the offer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you are referring to is a Rule 68 (FED. R. Civ. P. 68\\) offer of judgment (OOJ). Thus far, nearly every jurisdiction's court of appeals has refused to construe these as being binding on the Plaintiff if the offer is denied, even if it offers complete remuneration, especially in a putative class action. The underlying reasons when applied to a certified class differ fairly substantially from an individual plaintiff or a non\\-certified class. However, there are some kinds of cases where a Rule 68 offer could *never* fully compensate (as with cases where subjective or non\\-substantive forms of damage have been requested).\n\nA Rule 68 offer is a cost\\-flipping mechanism, often used by defense attorneys when they are making what they believe is a fair offer (very rarely is the offer one that is equal to the Plaintiff's demand, which is why this issue rarely arises). If a defense attorney makes an offer of judgment, and then the Plaintiff doesn't accept the offer, they need to get a jury verdict in an amount greater than the offer, or the costs are flipped. So, typically, if there is no OOJ and the Plaintiff wins even a nominal judgment (it can be a dollar) the Defendant always has to pay their costs, which can be substantial. When a Rule 68 offer is made, it's a carefully calculated amount that the defendant thinks the plaintiff can't get in a jury verdict, even if they win, but it's typically less than the demand. \n\nThe reason a Rule 68 offer is **almost never** \"full compensation\" is that a Plaintiff's demand for settlement will typically be somewhere in the area of 3x the amount the Plaintiff's attorney estimates the case to be worth. The Plaintiff is informed of this by their lawyer, so they don't have unreasonable expectations. If you think about it, this makes sense from an *ability to negotiate* perspective, with the logic being that the Plaintiff wants to get as close to full value as they can, and the defense needs their client to think they've saved them from some huge judgement. If a plaintiff demanded only what the case was worth, it would have no chance of settling for true value, or if the case were to settle, the Defense lawyer wouldn't be able to move the Plaintiff down off their number in any substantial way. This way, the lawyers can play their game negotiating the case down to a fair value. Plaintiff gets what their case is worth and Defendant feels like their lawyer saved them from catastrophe. It's all illusion.\n\nThe First Circuit recently joined the Second, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits in holding that a Rule 68 offer made prior to class certification and rejected by Plaintiff does not moot the Plaintiff\u2019s claim. The Plaintiff, a private high school, brought the action against the corporate developer of a college\\-entrance exam, alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and an analogous state statute related to unsolicited faxes it received. Prior to Plaintiff\u2019s deadline to move for class certification, the Defendant made an Offer Of Judgment, offering Plaintiff the amount it could receive under the two statutes for each fax. Plaintiff did not respond within 14 days, rendering the offer withdrawn under Rule 68, and instead moved for class certification. Defendant then moved to dismiss, arguing that the withdrawn offer rendered Plaintiff\u2019s claims moot and divested the court of subject matter jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion, holding that Plaintiff\u2019s claim was not moot, but certified the question of whether an unaccepted Rule 68 offer, made before certification, moots the entire action and deprives the court of jurisdiction.\n\nGenerally speaking, aside from very specific types of cases involving contracts, or specific types of statutory relief, a Plaintiff typically includes counts for things like NIED (negligent infliction of emotional distress), pain and suffering, loss of consortium, loss of future earning capacity \u2013 these are a few of the types of counts whereby there is no specific value a defendant could ever point to being \"fully satisfied\" \u2013 the reason being, a jury needs to determine the legitimate value of these claims unless the Plaintiff accepts a settlement award whereby he/she/it feels as if it's fully satisfied.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a class action lawsuit, plaintiff Jane Doe sues XYZ Corp for violations of a consumer protection statute.

Based on recent rulings in multiple Circuit Courts, including the First, Second, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits, an unaccepted Rule 68 offer of judgment made before class certification does not moot the plaintiff's claim. Jane can reject the offer and continue pursuing class certification. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the offer does not automatically moot the claim, especially in a putative class action context. \n\nOption B is incorrect because if Jane accepts the offer for her individual claim, she likely would not be able to continue as the class representative, as her individual claim would be resolved.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the offer cannot moot the entire class action, particularly when the class has not yet been certified.

Would this clause prohibit me for offering this service to anyone outside the current company I'm working with?\n* The CEO, with his lawyer have tried to convince me that this only apply to current client and any past clients that I have work on. Is this true?\n* If I start my own company, this would also apply to me right? Even if I start a company that provide online courses and don't offer services, this will still apply?\n* Would this make it impossible for me to take any job from any company in the country that provide this service?\n* From your view, how fair is this? Should I expect the CEO to offer a fair contract or is this something you read and negotiate? (This service has nothing todo with legal matters and I'm not expected to be good in legal matters)\n\n---\n\n**Country size:** around 15 million people\n\n**market:** Only the capital, with less than 50 clients.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> The CEO, with his lawyer have tried to convince me that this only apply to current client and any past clients that I have work on. Is this true?\n\nNo. It will be true only if they make that clarification in the clause or a properly added amendment. The clause currently has no indication that it is limited to \"*current client and any past clients that \\[you] have work\\[ed] on*\".\n\nThe CEO's \\& lawyer's refusal to amend the clause so as to make it consistent with their attempts \\[to persuade you] would be a red flag. Their inconsistent representations to you suggest that they are not planning to honor the *covenant of good faith* on which all contracts are premised.\n\n> Should I expect the CEO to offer a fair contract or is this something you read and negotiate?\n\nYou should *require* a contract that seems fair *to you*. And by \"*to you*\" I mean that it has to be in line with *your* expectations regardless of the *average* conditions in the labor market.\n\nNegotiations are not binding. They are merely a preamble to a contract, and that contract *is* binding. This is why you should reject a contract that falls short of your requirements.\n\nSome clauses are unlawful and/or void and unenforceable as unconscionable or for contravening legislation (unlawful clauses can and do arise even if drafted by attorneys). Thus, although you might not have to worry about those clauses in particular, the company's mere attempt to include them in a contract should alert you of the high risk of ending up with other *abusive* terms \\& conditions which are *binding and enforceable* nonetheless.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the non-compete clause in the Consulting Agreement?\n\nA) The clause only applies to current clients and past clients the consultant has worked with.\nB) The clause prohibits the consultant from working for any company in the country that provides similar services for 5 years.\nC) The clause is limited to the term of the agreement and does not extend beyond that.\nD) The clause, as written, is broader than what the CEO and lawyer verbally claimed it to be.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The information provided states that the CEO and lawyer tried to convince the consultant that the non-compete clause only applies to current clients and past clients they have worked with. However, the actual wording of the clause is much broader, prohibiting competition with the Client or any of its subsidiaries, including any company engaged in business competing with the Company's business, for 5 years after the agreement ends. This discrepancy between the written clause and the verbal explanation indicates that the clause is indeed broader than what the CEO and lawyer claimed it to be.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it reflects what the CEO and lawyer claimed, not what the actual clause states. Option B, while closer to the truth, is not entirely accurate as the clause doesn't specifically mention \"any company in the country.\" Option C is incorrect because the clause explicitly extends 5 years beyond the term of the agreement."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16879/are-officials-shielded-from-implementing-an-executive-order-later-considered-unc", "docs_id": 16879, "title": "Are officials shielded from implementing an executive order later considered unconstitutional?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that the President of the United States issues an executive order that violates the constitution.

The violated right was not clearly established in existing precedent at the time of the violation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the official's potential liability?\n\nA) The official is automatically liable for damages because they violated the Constitution.\nB) The official is protected by absolute immunity and cannot be sued for damages.\nC) The official is likely protected by qualified immunity and may avoid liability for damages.\nD) The official has no immunity and must prove the constitutionality of their actions to avoid liability.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question tests understanding of qualified immunity for government officials. Based on the information provided, particularly from Harlow v. Fitzgerald, executive officials generally have qualified immunity, not absolute immunity. Qualified immunity shields officials from liability for civil damages if their conduct does not violate \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n\nThe key here is that the violated right was not clearly established in existing precedent. As stated in Plumhoff v. Rickard, for a right to be clearly established, \"existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question confronted by the official beyond debate.\" Since the right wasn't clearly established, the official is likely protected by qualified immunity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because violating the Constitution doesn't automatically result in liability if qualified immunity applies. Option B is wrong because absolute immunity is reserved for specific roles, not general executive officials. Option D is incorrect because the burden of proof typically falls on the plaintiff to show that the right was clearly established, not on the official to prove constitutionality."}}
