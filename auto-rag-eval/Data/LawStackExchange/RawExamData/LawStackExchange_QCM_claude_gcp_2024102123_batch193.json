So far I have used about 40GB high speed data this month and the system shows my data balance is negative.

Based on the information provided, the customer cannot be held responsible for receiving a service that was neither promised by the company nor requested by the customer. The provider failed to implement the promised speed reduction after 30GB, and it's their responsibility to manage their network speeds. The customer did not actively seek or request additional high-speed data, so they cannot be charged for it. Options A and C are incorrect because the provider has no right to charge for or penalize the customer for their own failure to limit speeds.

I cannot pinpoint the line for you or tell you whether any particular action would lie on one side or the other, but I can describe the test.\n\nIn Maryland, there are \"five elements necessary to consider before applying the defense of necessity\" (*[Marquardt v. State](https://casetext.com/case/marquardt-v-state-5)*, 164 Md. App. 95, 135\\-36 (2005\\), citing *Sigma Reproductive Health Center v. State*, 297 Md. 660, 677\\-79 (1983\\)):\n\n1. The harm avoided \u2014 this need not be physical harm but also may be harm to property as, for instance, where a firefighter destroys some property to prevent the spread of fire which threatens to consume other property of greater value.\n2. The harm done \u2014 this is not limited to any particular type of harm but includes intentional homicide as well as intentional battery or property damage. An illustration is supplied:\n\n\\`\\[A]s where A, driving a car, suddenly finds himself in a predicament where he must either run down B or hit C's house and he reasonably chooses the latter, unfortunately killing two people in the house who by bad luck happened to be just at that place inside the house where A's car struck \u2014 it is the harm\\-reasonably\\-expected, rather than the harm\\-actually\\-caused, which governs.'\n3. Intention to avoid harm \u2014 to have the defense of necessity, the defendant must have acted with the intention of avoiding the greater harm. Actual necessity, without the intention, is not enough. However, an honest and reasonable belief in the necessity of his action is all that is required.\n4. The relative value of the harm avoided and the harm done. The defendant's belief as to the relative harmfulness of the harm avoided and the harm done does not control. It is for the court, not the defendant, to weigh the relative harmfulness of the two alternatives. To allow the defense the court must conclude that the harm done by the defendant in choosing the one alternative was less than the harm which would have been done if he had chosen the other.\n5. Optional courses of action; imminence of disaster. The defense of necessity applies when the defendant is faced with this choice of two evils: he may either do something which violates the literal terms of the criminal law and thus produce some harm, or not do it and so produce a greater harm. If, however, there is open to him a third alternative, which will cause less harm than will be caused by violating the law, he is not justified in violating the law. For example, \"\\[a] prisoner subjected to inhuman treatment by his jailors is not justified in breaking prison if he can bring about an improvement in conditions by other means.\"\n\n*Marquardt* at 137:\n\n> in order for the defense of necessity to have been warranted in this case, appellant must have presented \"some evidence\" that there was a choice between two evils, that no legal alternatives existed, that the harm appellant caused was not disproportionate to the harm avoided, and that the emergency was imminent."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John is walking down a suburban street when he hears screams coming from a nearby house.

I saw a lot of news about it, and my general understanding is that the companies are simply not providing their service to that individual, something they have complete right to do.\n\nBut also, there was that [Colorado baker](https://www.pressherald.com/2018/08/15/baker-who-refused-cake-for-gay-wedding-in-2012-sues-colorado-again/) case, and there was a whole lot of discussion if he could or not deny service to the couple.\n\nMy question is how these two cases are **different** and how US law states if a company can or can't deny a service to someone.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The key difference is the motivation for denying service.\n\nGenerally, a business can deny service for almost any reason, or for no reason, and doesn't have to explain its reasons for doing so.\n\nHowever, laws may make it illegal to deny service for certain specific reasons. The federal [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964#Title_I) forbids discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. So a business may not deny service for those *specific* reasons. In the Colorado case, there was a similar state law that also forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. \n\nIf they deny you service because of your political views, or the way you dress, or because they just plain don't like you as a person, that's legal. If they deny you service because of your sex, or race, or on the other bases in the Civil Rights Act, that's illegal.\n\nObviously, since a business doesn't have to say why they're denying service, or could lie about the reason, this could make it hard for a plaintiff to prove that denial was in fact based on (e.g.) race. They might be able to do so by finding out about internal discussions within the business, or by showing a pattern of denial to customers of a particular race.\n\nIn *Masterpiece Cakeshop*, the baker made it easy by explicitly stating that he was denying service because of the customers' sexual orientation, or at least because of the same\\-sex nature of the marriage in question. This would appear to violate the Colorado state law. Had he just said no without giving a reason, it would have been harder for the plaintiffs to make their case. (A state commission held that the baker did violate the law, but the US Supreme Court reversed because, they said, the commission had improperly taken the baker's religion into account.)\n\nBut there is no such law that forbids discrimination on the basis of political views, so Alex Jones can't make a similar case."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A local restaurant owner refuses service to a customer wearing a political campaign t-shirt.

While businesses generally have the right to deny service, they cannot do so based on these protected characteristics. However, denying service based on political views is not explicitly prohibited by federal law. The First Amendment protects against government censorship, not private businesses' decisions. Therefore, the restaurant owner's actions, while potentially controversial, are legal under federal anti-discrimination laws."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21984/copyright-for-re-scored-tune-that-was-out-of-copyright", "docs_id": 21984, "title": "Copyright for re-scored tune that was out of copyright", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a song is out of copyright, but has been re\\-scored for a movie, can it be used in an amateur video?

The question presents an interesting issue of contract law.\n\n> Can a Rental Contract Supersede State Law?\n\nNo, not in your situation. The doctrine of [*contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) is decisive, and it favors your position unless you are the party who drafted the lease contract (which is unlikely in a landlord\\-tenant context).\n\nThe clause establishing a six\\-month statute of limitations is in conflict with the tenant's right (per the same contract) \"*to pursue legal action within 30 days of terminating the lease*\". That is, the contract creates an ambiguity.\n\nBecause the 30\\-day deadline has not expired \\-\\-by virtue of your lease not having been terminated yet\\-\\-, the doctrine of *contra proferentem* dictates the ambiguity is decided or solved by adopting the option that favors the party who is not the draftsman of the ambiguous contract.\n\nThere is one note of caution, though. You mention that the statute of limitations in CA is four years, and also that the habitability issues lasted four years. At first glance, the latter suggests that the CA statute of limitations might have expired anyway (depending on the exact dates when your claims \\-\\-specifically, your losses\\-\\- accrued). If that's the case, you need to be careful about what legal theory (or theories) to pursue. Some of these theories could be to proceed on the basis of:\n\n* *Breach of contract* by establishing that your losses accrued at the instant(s) the landlord failed to fix the issues;\n* *Unjust enrichment* accruing at the instant when the landlord refused to reimburse you for rent overpaid (assuming that reimbursement is consistent with the language of the lease); and/or\n* *Fraud*, if you are able to prove that the landlord intentionally misled you, and that your reasonable reliance on his representation(s) caused you losses.\n\nNote that although in California \"*there is not a standalone cause of action for 'unjust enrichment,' which is synonymous with 'restitution', \\[...] \\[unjust enrichment and restitution] describe the theory underlying a claim that a defendant has been unjustly conferred a benefit through mistake, fraud, coercion, or request. \\[...] The return of that benefit is the remedy typically sought in a quasi\\-contract cause of action.*\", [*Astiana v.

The doctrine of contra proferentem favors the tenant in this case, as it resolves ambiguities in a contract against the drafter (likely the landlord). This means the restrictive clauses in the lease may not be enforceable. However, the tenant needs to carefully consider when their damages accrued in relation to the state's 4-year statute of limitations. The tenant may need to pursue different legal theories (such as breach of contract, unjust enrichment, or fraud) depending on the specific timeline of events and the nature of their losses.

This is the case because the Bill of Rights applies by its terms only to the federal government.

Obscenity laws are also, per Miller, to be in the power of the most local levels of governance among a body of people (so while the U.S. cannot ban content on a web forum, the forum's own rules may).\n\nThe other case is law is *New York v. Furber* which held that there is a compeling government interest in protecting the physical and mental health and well being of a child and that the manufacture and sale of child porn leads to the abuse of children and tramautic memories of the experience that last for much of their lifetime that overrides any protection offered by the First Amendment, thus the material need not be legally obscene to make illegal.\n\nIt's that compelling government interest that forms the basis of the answer. Because that is the justification for the illegalization of child porn and as such it would not always fall to obscenity laws without the interest, there is a bit of a loop hole. To be illegal, the pictures in question must have a real child featured in the porn in question. Thus pictures depicting fictional characters in their entirety (such as cartoon depictions of children) and erotica (literature featuring sexual content) are not illegal under *Ferber* and must fall to *Miller* to determine if it is illegal.\n\nBecause *Miller* leaves the rules to the lowest level of community law possible, these pictures can be against the rules of many websites, 4chan is (in)famous for having next to no standards, this kind of material is perfectly legal on this site as far as higher levels of government are concerned and it falls to the moderation team of 4chan (such as they are) to limit the offensive content.\n\nIt is because these materials do not depict actual real children that they are legal. This is due to the fact that these works can just barely qualify as having an artistic or literary value (the bar is very very low as to what qualifies as \"merit\" under *Miller*). It's also acceptable to make pictures of a real child portraying a fictional character who in the story is a victim of child pornography, regardless of the work's depiction **so long as you aren't actually having the child actor strip on camera.** This can be done by giving the child flesh colored clothing that covers the areas deemed obscene and using shoot angles that depict the child's skin that is legally allowed to be exposed (to hid the fact that for legal reasons the child is legally dressed on the set. Other production tricks are to hire actors who are older than 18 years old, but look younger than they are and can play a kid.). So long as you are not actually making child porn (showing the \"no\\-no areas\" on a real child), you can make fiction works that depict fictional characters involved in such activities in artistic ways to make any statement you want on the subject matter.\n\nIn your two examples, Operation Avalance targeted sites that had materials such as pictures and videos that depicted actual children in pornographic situations. In the case of the Megaupload, the U.S. was requesting extradition for money laundering and racketeering in connection with the legal seizure of Megaupload following investigations into the site concerning digital piracy. I'm unaware of actual instances of child porn involved, but not saying it's not impossible. Extradition only works if the country requested (Here New Zealand) chooses to honor the request (the U.S. and New Zealand have an extradition treaty and very similar laws so extradition is both required per treaty when requested AND the accused person would face similar charges if the crime was committed in the requested country.)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on U.S. Supreme Court rulings, which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the legality of cartoon depictions of child pornography in the United States?\n\nA) All cartoon depictions of child pornography are illegal under federal law.\n\nB) Cartoon depictions of child pornography are always protected under the First Amendment.\n\nC) Cartoon depictions of child pornography may be legal unless deemed obscene under the Miller test.\n\nD) Cartoon depictions of child pornography are treated the same as photographs of real children under the law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of cartoon depictions of child pornography in the U.S. is primarily governed by the Miller v. California decision, which established the test for obscenity. Unlike depictions of real children, which are illegal under New York v. Ferber regardless of artistic merit, cartoon depictions must be deemed \"obscene\" to be illegal. The Miller test allows for consideration of artistic, literary, or other merit, and obscenity is determined at local community standards. Therefore, cartoon depictions may be legal unless they fail the Miller test for obscenity. Options A and D are incorrect because they overstate the law's reach regarding fictional depictions. Option B is incorrect because while some cartoon depictions may be protected speech, those deemed obscene are not protected by the First Amendment."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/65497/legal-latin-term-for-argument-that-treats-someone-elses-injuries-as-ones-own", "docs_id": 65497, "title": "Legal / latin term for argument that treats someone else&#39;s injuries as one&#39;s own?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Interning in a court, and I note that the defendant's brief once had a case dismissed because of potential overreach by the court, but that overreach would not injure the defendant's interests, it would injure others.\n\nI feel like there's a legal or latin term for this kind of argumentation \\-\\- where you're acting as if injuries to someone else are actually injuries to you, and requesting relief for those injuries.\n\nDoes such a term exist, and if so what is it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sounds like you're thinking of [third\\-party standing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-3/section-2/clause-1/standing-to-assert-the-rights-of-others)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a complex legal case, the defendant argues that a potential court ruling would negatively impact a group of individuals not directly involved in the case.

Most cases where these things become federal crimes involve conduct affecting multiple states, and the person committing the crime would likely also commit at least one state crime.

Since the Toronto University name is trademarked, you have to respect their rights pertaining to the usage of the trademark. Since you don't list too many details, I'll try to give more of a general overview.\n\nThe registration and use of trademarks in Canada is governed by the [Trade\\-marks Act, RSC 1985, c T\\-13](http://canlii.ca/t/52dg3). Similar to copyright, the owner of a trademark is entitled to exclusive rights regarding its usage. However, there are exceptions to where usage of a trademark does not infringe on the owner's rights. \u00a720 outlines when a trademark is infringed, as well as two exceptions.\n\nRelevant to your case, is \u00a720(d):\n\n> **Infringement**\n> \n> \n> 20 (1\\) The right of the owner of a registered trade\\-mark to its exclusive use is deemed to be infringed by any person who is not entitled to its use under this Act and who\n> \n> \n> (d) manufactures, causes to be manufactured, possesses, imports, exports or attempts to export any label or packaging, in any form, bearing a trade\\-mark or trade\\-name, for the purpose of its sale or distribution or for the purpose of the sale, distribution or advertisement of goods or services in association with it, if\n> \n> \n> * (i) the person knows or ought to know that the label or packaging is intended to be associated with goods or services that are not those of the owner of the registered trade\\-mark,\n\nSince your app is intending to be associated with the trademark owner's institution, you would not be infringing a trademark.\n\nHowever, trademarks are fairly complicated.

The app is genuinely intended for students of Toronto University, and the use of the trademark in the store listing is to accurately identify the target audience, not to mislead consumers or infringe on the university's rights. However, trademark law can be complex, and while this use is probably acceptable, it's always safest to err on the side of caution. The developer might want to consider seeking permission from the university or consulting with a lawyer specializing in intellectual property to ensure compliance.

One \"day\" refers to a \"notional day\" consisting of one\\-tenth of the equivalent of an employee's ordinary hours of work in a two\\-week period. Because patterns of work do not always follow two\\-week cycles, the entitlement to \"10 days\" of paid personal/carer's leave can be calculated as 1/26 of an employee's ordinary hours of work in a year.\n\nSo we deal with \u201cnotional days\u201d that are measured in hours equivalent to 1/26 (or 1/13 for annual leave for non\\-shift workers).

But, it isn't necessary to reach the constitutional issue to make it a close case.\n\nThe common law rule is that someone making a statement can be liable for false material statements about presently existing material facts, but cannot be liable for statements of opinion, because statements of opinion are inherently neither true nor false.\n\nThe question presented with respect to common law liability is whether a too high credit rating is a statement about a presently existing material fact, which is actionable, or an opinion, which i not actionable.\n\nThe argument that a credit rating is more than a \"mere opinion\" that is incapable of being true or false, is that credit ratings are prepared based upon a careful methodology that is based upon presently existing material facts. Thus, the argument goes, rather than being a mere opinion, a credit rating is better described as a summary or compilation of presently existing material facts, from which presently existing material facts underlying the rating can be inferred, or if it is so discretionary that a credit rating doesn't really imply any underlying basis in presently existing material facts.\n\nThe methodology used by credit reporting agencies, the way business people use the credit reports of companies (especially in bond trading), the way that federal securities law regulation uses credit ratings of companies from this agencies, and securities fraud caselaw holding that statements that historically would have been considered opinion in common law fraud cases that imply facts are actionable for statutory securities fraud claims, all argue that credit reporting agencies should be exposed to liability because a credit rating from such an agency can be a misrepresentation (at least if it is far off the mark in light of objective methodological concerns).\n\nThe argument in favor of not holding credit reporting agencies liable for inaccurate credit ratings is basically that they have acted in reliance on long standing common law case law holding that there is no liability for statements of opinion, and that the credit reporting agencies didn't bargain for this potential liability when they issued their reports (for fees that were a tiny percentage of their potential liability).\n\nEven if civil liability is rare, a ruling that there is liability for an inaccurate credit rating essentially turns what was a zero liability risk line of business into a business where basically 100% of their work product could expose them to liability if a company with a good credit rating defaults, particularly because the credit reporting agency itself claims argue from historical records, that a credit rating disclosed a percentage likelihood of default, but recognizes that any company with any credit rating could default on its debts.\n\nIf credit reporting agencies knew that they were exposed to so much liability for their credit ratings when they charged fees to prepare them, they argue, they would have charged ten times a much or more for this work, in much the way that an attorney preparing an opinion letter on the law that exposes the attorney to liability if the opinion letter is wrong charges much more than their hourly rate for essentially guaranteeing that courts will treat a transaction as the lawyer claims that they should.\n\nCritics of this argument, however, say that it is possible in many clear cases to say that the rating itself clearly made a bad estimate of the probability of default and not just whether there would be a default or not, based upon the standards that credit reporting agencies use to assign the ratings in the first place.\n\nThe answer from @DavidSiegel notes that the First Amendment defense failed in many of these cases in preliminary motion practice in these cases. But those decisions didn't resolve those cases on the merits of the claims made, and I'm not aware of how these cases were resolved on the merits. I suspect that many settled, thereby not creating binding case law, but I don't know how they were resolved in the end."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the legal argument for why credit rating agencies (CRAs) might be held liable for inaccurate ratings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the 2008 financial crisis?\n\nA) CRAs' ratings are protected as free speech under the First Amendment, and therefore cannot be subject to liability.\n\nB) CRAs' ratings are purely opinions and thus not actionable under common law rules regarding false statements.\n\nC) CRAs' ratings can be considered summaries of presently existing material facts, potentially making them subject to liability for misrepresentation.\n\nD) CRAs actively participated in designing MBS products, making them equivalent to engineers designing faulty bridges.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

Shipping company ([DHL](https://www.logistics.dhl/br-en/home/contact-us.html), [TNT](https://www.tnt.com/express/pt_br/site/suporte/contato.html), [UPS](https://compass.ups.com/)) insurance policy;\n3. [Express or implied contract](https://www.bc-llp.com/express-and-implied-warranty/) with the seller;\n4. Manufacturer warranty\n\nIf you see the damage when the product is being delivered, you can either refuse the shipment as *damaged \u2013 return to sender*, or you can have the delivery company mark the tracking as *received damaged, subject to further inspection*. Please note, you have only a few days to report damage so if the delivery company drops off your package without your signature, call or contact them right away. Here are some links to contact major shipping companies in Brazil: [DHL](https://www.logistics.dhl/br-en/home/contact-us.html), [TNT](https://www.tnt.com/express/pt_br/site/suporte/contato.html), [UPS](https://compass.ups.com/). Find the contact information for the company who delivered your product to you. You also must keep all boxes and packing material. When you call you will need the tracking number off your box, a description of the damage and its value). All of the companies will log the call. Wait about 30 minutes and then run your tracking number online. It will show that you reported the damage. Once it shows, you then contact the seller. \n\nCarefully review the text of the following documents to determine who is responsible for the replacement or refund and under what conditions:\n\n1. The manufacturer warranty,\n2. The terms of service for the website on which you ordered your product\n3. The agency that controls the payment method you employed (if it's not cash).\n\nKeep your communications with the seller in writing so there is never any doubt as to when you contacted them or what was said by either party. A reasonable response time is a full business day for them to get back to you with an offer of resolution.\u00a0\n\nIf a seller claims the item was sold *[as is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_is)*, then that does not apply to freight damage. If the seller claims the item was sold *as is*, then they need to have stated it was damaged in the advertisement or the auction. If they failed to specify that it was damaged, then they cannot retroactively claim it was sold *as is*.\nIn the final case, you will need to rely on [small claims court to recover your costs.](https://www.dubbio.com.br/artigo/212-juizados-de-pequenas-causas-tudo-que-voce-precisa-saber) This requires, however, that you precisely determine [which party is at fault or otherwise liable](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/small-claims-book/chapter2-4.html) for the damaged product, since you will want to bring the claim on the party whom you think the court will find responsible."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer in Brazil purchases an electronic product online that arrives broken.

What the consequences of this are would depend on the laws and caselaw in your jurisdiction, but you will have to make these disclosures on at least one of the two websites.\n\nAbout Germany going after bloggers who show ads:\nincome from ads is taxable income,\nand operating a business requires registration.\nHowever, the German Impressumspflicht is rarely enforced by the state.\nInstead, other market participants (competitors) trawl the internet for potential violations and then send a cease\\-and\\-desist letter.\nThey can do this because skirting legal obligations distorts the level playing field, which harms those competitors.\nThere is a thriving cease\\-and\\-desist industry built around this, but it only affects businesses that operate within Germany."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A musician from an EU country (not Germany) has a website in English and their native language offering paid bookings. The website doesn't process payments but has a contact form.

This is based on the principle of the EU single market. The German TMG law, which includes the Impressumspflicht, recognizes this principle. However, the musician will still need to comply with their own country's laws, which likely include GDPR requirements and eCommerce Directive-based legislation.

However, personal effects such as clothing and electronics (like the laptop) are not considered household effects for customs purposes. While duty is often waived on personal effects more than one year old, the clothes may still be subject to duties. The laptop, being 2 years old, might have duties waived, but this isn't guaranteed.

That would be the case with an airline reservation, and one clear sign is that you have to pay for the ticket when you make the reservation; or, it you don't, then there is no contract, and they can cancel or change the price. You would look for clear signs of an agreement, such as a \"agree to terms\" button that you have to click. Paying a deposit is another clear sign. Then you would simply look at the terms of the contract to see what their obligation is, and what yours is. They may have strongly committed to providing service in which case you might have a cause for legal action if they break that commitment, or they might have made no specific promises about service in case of intervening events (such as if the chef has a heart attack, or the power goes out). If we do think of this as a contractual matter, you breached your duty as a customer, to be there by 7:30, so even if there is a contract, they didn't break it. The note that you added renegotiating the arrival time was insufficient \u2013 it is outside of the contract, and possibly something that they didn't see (they only look at the names and official time blocks reported by the web page).\n\nIn lieu of a contract, there could be some statutory obligation, i.e. a specific regulation in Sweden saying \"if a restaurant accepts a reservation, they absolutely must hold the space available for the entire reserved time\", which is an unreasonably onerous business practice that no nation requires."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of restaurant reservations, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal obligations between the customer and the restaurant?\n\nA) Making a reservation always creates a binding contract between the customer and the restaurant.\n\nB) A restaurant is legally obligated to hold a table for the entire duration of a reservation, even if the customer arrives late.\n\nC) Adding a note to arrive later in the reservation form is sufficient to modify the original reservation time.\n\nD) Restaurant reservations typically do not create a binding contract unless there are clear indications of agreement, such as paying a deposit or explicitly agreeing to terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, making a restaurant reservation does not automatically create a binding contract. For a contract to exist, there need to be clear indications of agreement, such as paying a deposit, clicking an \"agree to terms\" button, or explicitly stating the terms of service. Without these elements, a reservation is generally considered a courtesy rather than a legal obligation. Options A and B are incorrect because they overstate the legal obligations of restaurants in typical reservation scenarios.

We are located in Florida, US, if that is pertinent to the answer.\n\nI don't have an image of the actual plantings in question, but below is a good approximation of the size of the plantings, and degree that the tree crosses the boundary line (yellow line).

Our landscaper disputes the neighbor's claims, but allows that they may have inadvertently stepped over the property line. This is possible, but not likely, as the neighbor's plantings are low, and it would be difficult to trim their plantings that cross the line from slightly over the line. Not to mention, pointless, as it is easier to trim the encroaching plants entirely from our property, than it is to stand on or near the property line.\n\nNotwithstanding our neighbor's claim, he has crossed entirely to our property while trimming his plantings. When he attempted to confront us about our landscaper allegedly crossing over, he defended his own crossing over as allowed because he was maintaining his plantings.\n\nThe neighbor has sent a letter from his attorney stating that we are not allowed on his property without express written consent. Fine, we have no interest, nor need, to cross onto his property. However, we are incensed that he misrepresented the facts, and we feel he is essentially attempting to bully us into letting his plantings grow by vaguely claiming some of our trimmings have damaged the \"heart\" of the tree; and asserting our landscaper engaged in \"conversion\" (*sigh*).\n\nPrior to my neighbor's belligerence, we were content to simply trim the low trees that crossed over the line; it wasn't much of a big deal. But now battle lines have been drawn.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The only way to compel a neighbor to do something is to sue him and get the court to use force. In order to succeed in your lawsuit, you need to show that you have been harmed (annoyance/nuisance does not count). The courts are generally not sympathetic to battle lines being drawn, but might in principle listen if you show that the tree is harming you (not just annoying you). Even then, the court will order compensation for that damage and will not order the removal of the tree.\nThe tree\\-owner has a duty to take reasonable care to maintain the tree, so they cannot just let it fall on your gazebo and say \"oops\". The problem is that the basic rule is that \"a possessor of land is not liable to persons outside the land for a nuisance resulting from trees and natural vegetation growing on the land\", but if a tree destroys your property, the courts also will not suppose that the neighbor has a right to negligently destroy your house. See [Scott v McCarty](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2533344/scott-v-mccarty/), 41 So. 3d 989, [Gallo v. Heller](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1111782/gallo-v-heller/), 512 So. 2d 215\\. Therefore, a lawsuit would have to focus on the extent of actual damage \u2013 it has to be more than a nuisance. Also, the principle that \"it is wiser to leave the individual to protect himself, if harm results to him from this exercise of another's right to use his property in a reasonable way\" does not mean that you cannot trim the tree at all: you may be able to mitigate the problem without damaging the tree. You almost certainly will have to accept some level of \"trespass\" from the vegetation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Florida, a property owner is dealing with a neighbor's tree that grows diagonally over the property line.

To have a successful legal case, the property owner must demonstrate significant harm or damage caused by the tree, beyond mere nuisance.

There are a few questions here.\n\nFirst, is the message protected by copyright? In general, it probably is, but there are many exceptions that might allow you to use it without permission. Unfortunately, these exceptions vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The exceptions tend to allow the use of small excerpts of a work for various sorts of purposes that don't undermine the copyright holder's ability to profit.\n\nThat leads to the second question, which is why you are using that message. If you're including it in your source code so you can test whether a message generated at run time is in fact that message, that's one thing, and it's probably okay. On the other hand, if the owner of the copyright sells a database of all its message strings, and you're compiling a similar database that you also intend to sell, that's probably not okay.\n\nA third question concerns the Firefox license terms. It's entirely possible that they allow you explicitly to do what you're considering, in which case it doesn't matter what copyright law says about it. On the other hand, Firefox is open source software, and under some open source licenses, if you incorporate any of the source code in your own product, you are required to release your product's source code under the same license. If you're not already planning to do that, you should consider carefully whether including that error message would trigger that provision (if there is one) of Firefox's open source license."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is creating a website for their company and encounters an error message generated by Firefox.

Copyright laws: Small excerpts might be allowed under fair use or similar doctrines, depending on the jurisdiction.\n2. Purpose of use: Using the message for testing purposes is more likely to be acceptable than using it for commercial purposes.\n3. Firefox's license terms: These may explicitly allow certain uses or impose additional requirements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because error messages can be protected by copyright.

The town has a few houses and businesses, but is mostly comprised of undeveloped lots. Even so, suppose this town levies property taxes to suppose the local services (fire, waste disposal, etc.) which are in excess of the market value of the property (a few hundred dollars per year). If there are no conventional buyers of such a plot, are there any legal ramifications to selling said property to, say, an indigent buyer who has questionable means and perhaps low propensity to pay the taxes, but who could be incentivized to purchase the property for only a small loss to the seller?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question seems to assume that the purpose of the sale is to avoid property tax liability.\n\nFirst, property tax liability on a parcel of property with marginal value is generally only a tiny percentage of the fair market value of the property, and the usual remedy if the property is overvalued is to contest the valuation of the property when it is made. Property taxes on property with a fair market value of a few hundred dollars would almost never be more than $1 per year.\n\nSecond, the usual remedy for non\\-payment of property tax, if it continues long enough, is for the property to be sold for tax liens in foreclosure sale. It would be extraordinarily exceptional for a lawsuit against the owner to be pursued to collect (lawsuits against owners are used in California to collect property taxes on tangible personal property that is subject to a property tax).\n\nSo, the implicit motives behind the question are misguided.\n\nBut, a property owner is free to sell real estate to an unrelated third\\-party at any price the seller wants, even if the buyer can't afford to pay the property taxes on the property.

See [here](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome/ \"here\") for how works can enter the public domain (in your case, you're hoping that it was \"dedicated\" by the photographer, and not otherwise assigned to some third party who is not the photographer, e.g., his employer).\n\nAssuming it's in the public domain, what this means is that nobody has any of the exclusive rights to the work anymore (see [17 U.S.C. 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106)). \n\nNow, a bit of property law. You can imagine the list of exclusive rights listed above as a handful of post it notes. One says, \"to reproduce the copyrighted work...\" Another says \"the right . . . to display the copyrighted work publicly.\" Someone who owns all of these exclusive rights can do anything he wants with them. He can give one of the post\\-it notes away permanently (assignment) to another person, or he can give it away temporarily (usually, a license). He can give away just one, or all at the same time.\n\nThe terms of this website are effectively requiring you to let SE borrow, forever, the post\\-it note that says \"publicly display\" **so that they are not violating your exclusive right of public display**.\n\nHowever, this assumes you even own that exclusive right (post\\-it note). Something in the public domain no longer has any rights (post\\-its). No exclusive rights exist at all with respect to such a public domain work *in copyright*.\\*\n\nTherefore, since you do not possess any copyright rights with respect to a public domain work, you have nothing to give to SE, and so you have not given anything to SE.\n\nThe answers to your questions therefore are \"no you have not licensed anything\" and \"yes it stays in the public domain\".\n\n* Other rights can apply to images, such as trademark.

Are you a US citizen?\n\n\t* For a person who is a citizen of the United States and at least one other country, is it okay simply to answer *yes*?\n\t* For a person who is a citizen of multiple countries, not including the United States, is it okay simply to answer *no*?\n2. What country are you a citizen of?\n\n\t* Is it necessary to disclose all countries of citizenship when responding to the second question? Does it matter if one of those countries is the US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Yes. A multi\\-nation citizen who has US citizenship has equal US citizenship with every other citizen; therefore the answer to this binary question is \"Yes\". The citizenship(s) of anyone who does not have US citizenship is irrelevant to this question; thus, the answer to this binary question is \"No\".\n2. Yes. The main point here is to determine if you have the relevant documents and permissions to be legally present in the US. If you are a US citizen, a) this makes the process easier for you and b) avoids any possible issues if evidence is found of citizenship from another country, which will make immigration think that A) you are not a US citizen and b) you lied to them. Most people have only a single citizenship. That is the default mindset of immigration. There's no downside for you to inform them; there may be additional difficulties, delays, and scrutiny if you do not.\n\nIf you are not a US citizen, most of the same applies. Additionally, lying (even by omission) can be grounds to have your legal status revoked.\n\nIn summary, if you have the legal *right* to be in the US (e.g. US citizen, legal resident) being fully honest cannot hurt you, and can make the process smoother. If you have legal *permission* to be in the US, being fully honest will help prevent that permission from being revoked."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A dual citizen of the United States and Canada is stopped at a U.S. Border Patrol interior checkpoint.

A tip is an amount of money paid by a third party to the employee without a legal obligation in addition to a service owed to the employer.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThe base *Salary* can never be paid in anything but Euros.\n\nMakes sense, how would you determine whether 2 apples, an egg and a parttime timeshare of a camel each month are above or below the minimum wage? How would the employee pay their own costs from that, even it it were worth more? Taxes would be a nightmare. Good luck to the Ex\\-Wife and kid, getting half an apple and a stinky camel timeshare for a day as alimony. No, money is there for a reason.\n\n*Benefits* like bonuses or additional agreements on top of your basic salary *can* be goods of other kinds. Loot boxes for example. Please note that the employee has to explicitely agree on that. I will assume getting an *additional* lootbox on top for free is something an employee can agree on without a second thought. Getting parts of your salary normally paid in Euros or bonus normally paid in Euros as Lootboxes would be something the employee would have to explicitely agree to, otherwise it must be Euros. You cannot \"force\" an employee to accept anything but Euros.\n\nNote the sentence that the employer can give the employee goods instead of Euros not for their made up \"sale\" price, but for the cost of making them. So for no profit. You could pay someone partially in loot boxes, but since a loot box costs about 0,01\u20ac to make (electricity, database maintenance, the developer who has to press the button once a month), that would be a *lot* of loot boxes to pay a part of the salary.\n\nAnd yes, even \"goods\" will be taxed. They are part of your income. So if you get a \"lootbox\", be preprared to pay taxes on that. If you don't play the game, paying taxes on something you don't use might not be worth it after all.\n\nIt is well known that companies have employee\\-only pricing schemes. For example you will find that employees of automobile manufacturers will drive their brands cars, because getting a good price on a car is a big deal. Some companies allow private use of company cars for the employees that work \"in the field\". But it is very rare that employees get actual goods monthly as part of their salary in Germany.\n\nBut there is no mention of \"luck\" anywhere in the law.

The documentation explains that the First Amendment of the US Constitution specifically restricts the government from limiting free speech, not private entities. Apple, as a private company, has the right to set its own guidelines for content on its platform. This does not constitute a violation of free speech rights, as developers are free to publish their content through other means. The other options are incorrect because they misinterpret the scope of constitutional protections or mischaracterize Apple's guidelines as government action."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52932/remedy-for-breach-of-contract-with-a-no-assignment-clause", "docs_id": 52932, "title": "Remedy for breach of contract with a &quot;No Assignment&quot; clause", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is common for written contracts between entities to contain a \"No Assignment\" clause, which essentially states that, for a contract between entities *A* and *B*, the benefits or rights under the contract *A* cannot be assigned to another entity *C* without the consent of *B*.\n\nIt is possible for a breach of contract by *B* to precipitate the dissolution of *A*. (Examples: If *B* poaches a key member of *A*, or if the existence of *A* as a going concern depends entirely on its contract with *B*.) In such an event, it appears that a \"No Assignment\" clause would in effect make *B* immune to any liability claims, because *A* no longer exists and the contract could not be assigned to any beneficiary of *A*.\n\nNot a perfect analogy, but in playground terms this is sort of like Bob and Al agreeing, \"Let's build a sandcastle.

While it could be applicable in some contract disputes, it doesn't specifically address the issue of preventing immunity through a \"No Assignment\" clause.\n\nD) The Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing is the most appropriate principle here. This doctrine requires that neither party will do anything to injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the agreement.

Let's imagine a situation in which I am messaging with my friends. I need to send to my first friend a picture of someone of celebrity. I need to send to my second friend some funny pictures because he feels blue. I go to Google and find some pictures with copyright, save them on my phone and send them to my friends without any commercial purpose.\n\nDo I commit a crime in this case? Do I break the EU's or US's laws in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically, downloading such pictures and sending them to others is copyright infringement, unless they have been released under a license which permits sharing them with others.\n\nCopyright infringement is not a crime. It is a ***tort***. That means the copyright owner can sue, if and when the owner learns this has happened, and chooses to bring a court action. As that would involve paying a lawyer, and court fees, and other expenses, most owners will not bring such a suit unless they think the damages are likely to be large enough to make it worth their time and trouble, over and above getting their expenses back. Most copyright owners would not bother to sue over personal sharing of pictures posted on the net. However, that is the choice of the owner to make, if they learn of the sharing.\n\nNote that, if instead of attaching a picture to an email, one sends a link, there is no copyright infringement involved, even technically.\n\nWhile the details of copyright laws differ in different countries, the information above is true for both the US and the EU, and most if not all other countries.\n\nOne of the ways in which copyright laws differ between countries is in the exceptions to copyright that are available. In the US there is the somewhat complex concept of \"fair use\". Being personal and non\\-commercial use does not automatically make something fair use, although it helps support a finding of fair use. Some EU countries have a specific exception for personal use. I believe that India has such an exception also. Many countries have exceptions for news reporting, use in classroom teaching, parody, and various other cases.\n\nI said above tyht copyright infringement is not a crime. That is not always true. Under [17 USC 506](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506) infringement can be criminal, but **only** if the infringement is:\n\n1. willful;\n2. for private financial gain or commercial advantage; and  \n\n3A) of works valued at over $1,000, or  \n\n3B) of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, knowingly preempting such distribution by electronic posting.\n\nI believe that there are similar limits on criminal copyright infringement in the laws of other countries.\n\nBeyond that, the current policy of the US Department of Justice is to prosecute criminal copyright infringement **only** when it is done on a bulk basis, as a business. In particular, mass reproduction and sale of CDs and DVDs without permission may be prosecuted.\n\nComments point out that a plaintiff may, in the US, elect to receive statutory damages, instead of actual damages, and in that case need not prove any financial loss. This is true, but the damages may be as low as $750 per work infringed (not per copy) or as low as $200 for \"innocent infringers\". The amount is set by the court, as it thinks just.\n\nIt is also true that a US court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs, under 17 USC 505\\. But this is wholly in the court's discretion, it is in no way automatic, and I understand is typically not awarded in \"minor\" cases. In any case a plaintiff cannot **count** on getting fees and costs, nor on a large statutory damage award."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided copyright information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of copyright law, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered criminal copyright infringement in the United States?\n\nA) A student downloads a copyrighted image from the internet and uses it in a school presentation without permission.\n\nB) An individual shares a copyrighted movie file with friends via email for personal entertainment.\n\nC) A small business owner uses a copyrighted song in their store's background music without obtaining proper licensing.\n\nD) A person operates an online service that sells unauthorized digital copies of newly released movies, generating significant profit.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) While this is copyright infringement, it's likely not criminal as it doesn't meet the criteria for willful infringement for financial gain or commercial advantage.\n\nB) This is copyright infringement, but it's not criminal as it's for personal use without financial gain.\n\nC) This is copyright infringement and could potentially lead to civil action, but it's unlikely to be considered criminal as it doesn't involve bulk reproduction or distribution.\n\nD) This scenario meets all the criteria for criminal copyright infringement:\n1.
