It is my understanding that the Supreme Court has upheld the unconstitutionality of enforcing the Flag Code on private citizens or organizations as it conflicts with their First Amendment rights (*United States v. Eichman*), but are public facilities such as a public schools or police stations required to adhere to the flag code? Are those acting in an official capacity in those facilities legally required to adhere to the Flag Code as they are operating a public facility?\n\nFor example, Section 6, Clause g states, \"The flag should be displayed during school days in or near every schoolhouse.\" If a school were to fail to display the flag, would that be considered a crime? Who would be responsible if it were a crime?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Federal facilities are required to adhere to the flag code.\n\nNon\\-federal governmental entities are not, and the explanation is more complicated. In theory, the federal government should have very little power over the decision\\-making of state governments \\-\\- this is a principle of federalism and is expressly stated in the 10th Amendment. In practice, however, the federal government has a lot of power over state governments. Congress can condition the allotment of federal monies to states, i.e. block grants, as long as such a condition meets the five point test spelled out in [*South Dakota v. Dole*](https://openjurist.org/483/us/203). The most stringent of these points is that the condition \"must not be coercive\" so as to apply \"irresistible pressure\", creating a false choice where accepting money is the only realistic option (thus complying with the conditions). I couldn't find a clause within USC Title 4, Chapter 1 for withholding funds from states in the event of noncompliance, [similar to one that exists for the national drinking age](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/23/158). Therefore states (state, county, municipal all treated as an extension of state power under the US Constitution) are not required to to adhere to the flag code. \n\nTheoretically, Congress could pass a new law that would condition the receipt of some federal funds on the states' compliance with the flag code. But the new low could face additional hurdles, since the condition must be \"directly related to one of the main purposes for which... \\[the funds] are expended\" (quoting from *Dole*). This restriction is the reason why states were given the right to opt out of the Obamacare medicare expansion without losing their pre\\-existing Medicaid funding ([567 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2012\\) at 51](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf)), and is also the reason why the recent \"Sanctuary Cities Ban\" is having legal trouble. It would be unlikely that any law like this would hold up. It's also worth noting that most states have their own flag law, which makes this whole discussion of the federal law's effect on state facilities.\n\nAs you noted, since *US v. Eichman*, all criminal penalties for violating any flag code have been unenforceable against individuals.

Sometimes you have to pay a fee for an additional inspection or have other hurdles to jump through that can slow down a project.\n\nThe remedy for violations of zoning ordinances is much stricter and can involve criminal or civil penalties. These civil penalties can involve a person being forced to demolish a building or enjoined from using their house a business. Zoning is a complicated area of law because the rules and regulations vary from one town to another.\n\nTo directly answer your question:\n=================================\n\n> Can I file a lawsuit compelling them to demolish this building?\n\n**Answer**: Get a lawyer familiar with local land use regulations. \n\n**Other thoughts/Considerations:** Most jurisdiction have a process for filing a complaint with the agency that regulates zoning laws. That's probably your first bet. Generally, people don't have the right to sue their neighbor for zoning issues unless they have exhausted their administrative remedies.\n\nIf the local officials don't take action because they're friends or connected with your neighbor, could could file *writ of mandamus* in court. In New York they call it an [Article 78 review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandamus#State_courts). Basically, a writ of mandamus/article 78 review is a lawsuit that is seeking to force a government official or government body to do something it is required to do.

However, the article asserts that\n\n> the Supreme Court asserted, in Lessee of Pollard v. Hagan (1845\\), that the Constitution mandated admission of new states on the basis of equality\".\n\n. . . and then the article mentions two later Supreme Court rulings saying this is a Constitutional principle.\n\nHowever, this has been asserted to apply only to states that have been admitted to the Union, not to state within the territory of the U.S.A. that have not been admitted to the Union but are nonetheless states. Here it may be asserted that no such states can exist, or at least that none have existed.\n\nHowever, look at the Northwest ordinance of 1787 and its amendment in 1789\\. The 1787 ordinance was enacted by Congress while the Articles of Confederation were still in effect, and it said\n\n> There shall be formed in the said territory, not less than three, nor more than five States; \\[\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0] And whenever any of the said States shall have sixty thousand free inhabitants therein, such State shall be admitted, by its delegates, into the Congress of the United States, on an equal footing with the original States, in all respects whatever;\n\n(Ultimately that territory became five states and part of a sixth.)\n\nThis seems to say that before the population of one of the proposed states reached 60,000, they would not yet be admitted on an equal footing, but would nonetheless be states. The equal\\-footing doctrine applies only to states admitted to the Union, and not to any of these proposed not\\-yet\\-admitted states, but that they would still be in some substantial sense states. As states, presumably they would have constitutions enacted by the voters of the state and otherwise not be under federal jurisdiction in the way in which organized incorporated territories are.\n\nIn 1789, after the present Constitution was in effect, Congress altered the ordinance for the purpose of adapting it the the new Constitution, but the only adaptation was that reports that the territorial governor had been required to submit to Congress were to be submitted instead to the President.\n\nSo here we have an act of Congress under the present Constitution saying states could exist within the boundaries of the U.S. that would not yet be *admitted* states, thus although they were states, the equal\\-footing doctrine would not apply to them.\n\nNo such states were ever created under the authority of Congress. However, there was one occasion when Congress allowed that a certain entity within the boundaries of the U.S. was already a state but not yet an admitted state, and decided that it would get admitted. That was Vermont. When Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791, the 1786 \"Constitution of the State of Vermont\" continued in effect and the man who had begun a one\\-year term of office as \"governor of the state of Vermont\" in October 1790, succeeding the previous \"governor of the state of Vermont\", continued his one\\-year term of office uninterrupted, as did all other officers of the state. When he assumed office, Vermont had not yet assembled its convention that met in January 1791 to decide whether to apply for admission to the Union. Under Vermont law, no new State of Vermont was created at that time, but rather the same state continued to exist, and Congress said that the entity that had petitioned them for admission was \"the State of Vermont\", and they were granting the petition.\n\nOne can argue that Vermont cannot serve as a precedent because it was organized before even the Articles of Confederation were in effect and before the boundaries of the U.S. were defined (that first happened in the Preliminary Articles of Peace of 1782 and wasn't really in effect until the peace treaty of 1783 was effective) \\-\\- it was entirely unique. No other state can ever be in that situation. And throughout the 1780s, the state of Vermont took the position that Vermont was *not* within the U.S., even though the peace treaty, to which Vermont was not a party, said it was.\n\nBut there is the Northwest Ordinance, authorizing the creation of states that would be states but would be not\\-yet\\-admitted states, to which equal footing would not apply.\n\nIf one takes the equal\\-footing doctrine to be a part of the Constitution although nowhere explicitly stated in the document, could one say that (1\\) it applies to admitted states but (2\\) not to non\\-admitted states, but (3\\) those could exist within the boundaries of the U.S. and still be *states*?

Bob retains the right to pursue the claim and even if he later wins a similar judgment against Acme, Acme gains the full benefit of the delay, at Bob\u2019s cost. \n\nAllen\u2019s deception strategy seems most likely to have a big payoff if it is successful in fooling Bob, and a small payoff if it is not.\n\n**Is there any way this strategy could, in practice, significantly backfire?**  \n\nIf Bob were \"playing\" optimally, what, if anything, could he *practically* he do to make it backfire?  \n\nIf nothing, why is it not commonly taught in law schools as an effective way to win over an adversary and best protect a client\u2019s interests? \n\nContinuation: If Bob signed, and gets annoyed at Acme's failure to follow through on $X, Y, and/or Z, Acme's strategy is to present the signed release (perhaps calling special attention to the acknowledgement of payment received) to the Court, blocking Bob from pursuing that line of inquiry any further. \n\nIn the unlikely event that Bob manages to overcome that block and figure out \\+ execute all the legal steps needed to reach an evidentiary hearing about whether or not payment was made, Acme's strategy is to cause the finder of fact to believe that Bob had stated a preference for cash payment and Acme conceded to Bob's wishes, underscored by the clear evidence that Bob signed acknowledging receipt of the funds. \n\nAssume that Allen presents himself to the Court as a reasonable person, that Acme is at least a locally powerful institution that many assume to be credible, and that Allen's role as an attorney further strengthens of the assumption of credibility that others in the courtroom apply to Allen in representing Acme, [particularly in contrast to non\\-attorney Bob](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/4931/4800). As a result, any claim Bob makes about Acme contrary to a statement Bob himself signed is likely to reduce his own credibility more than Acme's; Bob and Allen both know this. Acme's strategy also includes privately pointing this out to Bob beforehand to try to convince Bob not to raise his challenge. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I could spectacularly backfire because if carried out with the intention you describe it is the crime of fraud which, in most jurisdictions, is punishable by imprisonment for some number of years.\n\nEven if the \"error\" was innocent, the release would be unenforceable because Bob can demonstrate that he has not, in fact, been paid.\n\nThe signed release is only one piece of evidence a court will consider.

The strategy described could significantly backfire for Acme and Allen. If it can be proven that they intentionally misled Bob, this could constitute fraud, which is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. Even if the deception was unintentional, the release form would likely be unenforceable if Bob can demonstrate that he never received the promised payment. \n\nThe court would consider multiple pieces of evidence, not just the signed release. If Acme cannot provide proof of payment and Bob testifies that he never received it, the court may conclude that the release contains an error or was obtained through deception.

In this scenario, John becomes aware of the child's presence after 30 minutes of driving.

This meets the criteria for second-degree kidnapping, but only for the period after he became aware of the child. \n\nOption A is incorrect because first-degree kidnapping requires specific intent, which John did not have. Option B is incorrect because while John didn't initially intend to take the child, he became liable once he knew about the child and continued the act.

Customers may get paid by publishing the advertising. The customers presumably want to do this in order to make profits. Some customers may be organized as nonprofit and they're not allowed to make profits, but individuals are not nonprofit and nonprofit organizations presumably want to do this in order to make surpluses. The company does not appear to serve primarily nonprofits.\n\nThe company requires a contract, which is a contract of adhesion. Ignore that the contract may have been sloppily drafted. Assume the company will defend it as written now. The contract forbids customers from doing anything \"commercial\". The contract does not explicitly define \"commercial\" but implicitly relies on one or more legal definitions inferrable from outside of the contract. While it is possible for a customer to enter into the contract and then do nothing so as not to do anything \"commercial\", the customer would then earn no revenue and therefore no profit or surplus, and such a possibility is therefore a trivial case not considered here. Therefore, while the company is not in violation of the contract, all customers, except nonprofits, are always in violation. The only cure is to cease doing anything with the company.\n\nIf I, an individual, enter into the contract and I then do something \"commercial\" in relation to the company, is the company barred from treating me as violating the contract because what I do under the contract is \"commercial\" when what everyone is doing under the contract is \"commercial\"? For example, might the bar be due to estoppel?\n\nCompanies are usually presumed to legally exist in perpetuity, so assume perpetuity for this company. Does it add fuel to the legal fire if enforcing the bar to commercialism against all customers would put the company out of business? In this case, customers would not publish the advertising supplied by the company, no one in the world would act on the advertisements, advertisers would stop advertising through this company, the company would stop receiving any revenue, and the company therefore would have no more profit.

Does that mean the company cannot enforce contractual violations grounded solely on commercialism?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If such a case came to court, the court would presumably rule that merely publishing the advertising could not be considered to be doing something \"commercial\". (Otherwise the contract would be absurd, as the question points out.) The court would therefore define \"commercial\" as some act beyond merely displaying the advertising \\-\\- perhaps charging for the website on which it is displayed, or using it to sell goods. \n\nMoreover, since the company apparently wrote the contract, any ambiguity in it would be construed against the company, if there is another reasonable interpretation. \n\nThus the contract would not be void, and could be sued on, but the company would win only if it established some conduct that the court was prepared to consider as \"commercial\" in light of the circumstances and the purpose of the contract.\n\nBy the way it is not really on point, but it is a common misunderstanding that:\n\n> some customers may be organized as nonprofit and they're not allowed to make profits\n\nNonprofit entities may do business and make income that would be considered \"profit\" for an ordinary corporation.

Not infrequently I will see cases in which the defense makes almost completely absurd arguments which are obviously futile. What is the point of this?\n\nAre judges deliberately encouraging this behavior to increase business for legal professionals?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are misinformed. \n\nIn fact, approximately the reverse is true: in a typical jurisdiction in the United States today in excess of 95 percent of criminal cases that begin never reach a verdict. (The exact number varies a little, depending on which exact court system we're talking about.) Or never reach a trial at all, in fact. Or never even come close to making it to the trial date. \n\nNow, in some of those instances the charges wind up being dismissed. In some others defendants are diverted outside of the traditional criminal justice system when the circumstances seem better suited to other resolutions (examples: a petty criminal who steals to feed a drug addiction is diverted into a process where he or she will get drug treatment, a non\\-violent mentally ill person is put into a process where he or she will get mental health treatment); if they complete the diversion program the criminal charges are dropped. But in the vast majority of cases a defendant winds up pleading guilty, in court, to something. Sometimes in exchange for the prosecutor dropping certain other charges. Sometimes in return for the prosecutor downgrading a charge he or she would otherwise pursue in court to a charge for a lesser offense. Sometimes just in return for perhaps getting some credit in the eyes of the judge for \"acceptance of responsibility\" when sentencing rolls around. But make no mistake: there are few elements more central to the way modern American criminal justice works than plea bargaining. \n\nBut don't feel too bad: for what it's worth you are certainly not alone in thinking otherwise. In fact, in my personal experience almost everyone outside the legal profession and the court system/s holds at least a few large misconceptions about the way criminal justice in the U.S. actually works. General news media outlets contribute quite a bit to helping those misconceptions form by typically focusing solely on the rare, high\\-profile, controversial (and thus ratings\\-grabbing) cases rather than the vast, vast number that end in a whimper instead of a bang. Law drama shows and movies almost invariably bear little relation to reality. (And that's is totally fine, BTW, as long as you *realize* they bear almost no relation to reality.) Which makes sense: *Law \\& Order: SVU* probably wouldn't have stayed on the air year after year if most episodes just consisted of an endless stream of one rote, dull plea hearing after another, each featuring some otherwise\\-unremarkable sleezeball who's been caught dead\\-to\\-rights downloading and re\\-distributing child pornography.\n\n(And, BTW, the misconceptions aren't limited to criminal law \\& justice, by any means. In fact, in my view other high\\-profile legal arenas like civil litigation, intellectual property disputes, constitutional law battles, and many others are even *more* misunderstood. But I digress...) \n\nAnyway, to sum up: very frequent plea bargaining \\= one of the foundations of how modern American criminal justice operates at a practical level.

These I take to have been administrative divisions of the country. Congress passed an \"organic act\" for each such territory that said the government in this territory shall be organized in thus\\-and\\-such manner. During the existence of such a territory, if it was decided to change the term served by the governor from two years to fours year, or make some other change, the change was enacted by Congress, not by the voters in the territory. The constitution of a state, by contrast, is drafted by politicians in that state and submitted for the approval of the voters, and any changes are made by popular vote; there is no involvement of Congress or anything at the federal level. Thus states are not administrative divisions of the federal government. Counties, in those states where they exist (or parishes in Louisiana or boroughs in Alaska), are administrative divisions of the state.\n\nThus it seems appropriate that in the U.S., states get \"admitted\" by Congress whereas territories get \"organized\" by Congress.

That is, the APP shares with other applications and uses the user's personal information without user consent, such as device identification information, product browsing records, search usage habits, and commonly used software application lists.\n4. \"Force users to use directional push function\". That is, the APP does not inform the user, or does not mark it in a prominent way, and uses the collected user search, browsing history, usage habits and other personal information for targeted push or precision marketing, and does not provide the option to turn off the function.\n\n(3\\) Unreasonable request for user rights\n\n5. \"Do not give permission without permission\". That is, when the APP is installed and running, the user is asked for rights that are not related to the current service scenario. After the user refuses to authorize, the application exits or closes.\n6. \"Frequently apply for permission\". That is, after the user explicitly rejects the permission application, the APP frequently applies to open the address book, positioning, SMS, recording, camera and other permissions that are not related to the current service scenario, harassing the user.\n7. \"Excessive permission\". That is, when the user does not use related functions or services, the APP applies in advance to open the address book, positioning, SMS, recording, camera and other permissions, or exceeds its business functions or services, apply for address book, positioning, SMS, recording, camera and other permissions .\n\n(4\\) Setting up obstacles for user account cancellation\n\n8. \"It is difficult to cancel the account.\" That is, the APP does not provide users with an account cancellation service, or sets an unreasonable obstacle to the cancellation service.\n\nThat is the problem statement, the announcement says they want the companies collecting information to fix the problem themselves or it will be legislated on them.\n\n---\n\nIt's now 2020 and the Ministry has engaged a third\\-party testing agency to verify applications, and has given a small number of them notice to fix problems or be removed by specific dates).

While the entire book, including the text, photographs, and diagrams, can be protected by copyright, the underlying folding technique or method itself may not be copyrightable. This is because copyright law does not protect functionality, methods, or processes. The resulting dragon sculpture could potentially be copyrighted if it's original, but the folding pattern itself might not be separately protectable under US law if it's considered a functional method. The book's copyright would likely extend to the specific expression of the folding instructions (like the organization of diagrams and accompanying text) but not to the underlying technique itself.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while elements of the pattern's expression might be protected, the folding sequence itself, as a method or process, is likely not fully protectable under copyright law.\n\nOption B is partially correct about the sculpture but oversimplifies the protection of the instructions, which may have copyrightable elements in their specific expression.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while some traditional origami models are in the public domain, new and original designs can be protected by copyright, especially when published in books or other media."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33068/its-not-against-the-constitution-to-arrest-a-pregnant-woman-in-bolivia", "docs_id": 33068, "title": "it&#39;s not against the constitution to arrest a pregnant woman in Bolivia", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Bolivia my liberal party is about to make it illegal to arrest an pregnant woman and I am wondering if this goes against the portion of our Constitution that talks about equity before the law.

The TSJ has demonstrated flexibility in interpreting the Constitution, as evidenced by their ruling on presidential term limits. The passage suggests that the court might consider various factors, such as health rights (Article 18) or the potential constitutional implications of arresting an \"innocent person\" (the fetus). The uncertainty of the outcome and the court's role in determining constitutionality make C the most accurate statement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage doesn't definitively state that the law would violate equity principles.

He ordered that I go to the other side of a sign that was farther away. \n\nWere they right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the scenario you described, you were both right:\n\nPolice have no authority to demand that you leave a public space because you are photographing, [nor does the government have the right to prevent you from photographing anything that is visible from a public space, including government facilities or employees](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/photographers-what-do-if-you-are-stopped-or-detained-taking-photographs).\n\nHowever, the police would likely have followed through on their threat to arrest you. In that event, any vindication for wrongful arrest and violation of your civil rights would only come (if ever) at the end of protracted and expensive litigation in the courts.

It *might* be interpreted as saying \"it doesn't belong to us\", but you can't count on that (it's virtually guaranteed that at least *some* of the content there is owned by the website owner). A more informative statement would be \"You will have to get permission from the content owner to copy their stuff\", and \"We're not going to spend time figuring out who owns what\".\n\nYou could read the terms of service (try this with Stack Exchange) to see what the site tells people. The [TOS here](http://stackexchange.com/legal) says that if you contribute anything, it \"is perpetually and irrevocably licensed to Stack Exchange under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license\". You can then look up what that license says and learn what that allows. Websites are kind of tricky, though, because it's not hard to change the wording of a TOS, and you need to know what specific TOS was promulgated at the time a particular contribution was unleashed. Usual practice is to think it through carefully and not frequently tweak the TOS, but it's not illegal to change the TOS. Note that copyright law does not prohibit you from using other people's stuff, it prohibits you from *copying*. The distinction is clearer when you see a post that explains an algorithm with actual code, you read and learn and make use of that, but write your own code. As a user out there, if there isn't a clear indication that stuff posted is there for the taking, under some public license (as is the case with SE), then getting specific permission to copy, from the owner of the content (possibly untraceable), would be necessary.\n\nNow assume that you're a moderator or site\\-owner of some forum: presumably (hopefully) you have a TOS that addresses that situation, which says that moderators have the right to edit or delete content at their sole discretion, and also you say what kinds of posts are prohibited. Such an statement is not absolutely mandatory for all things, but it may be necessary to avoid litigation over some acts. One one end of the spectrum, it would be illegal for a forum to host child porn, stolen credit card numbers, or protected digital content. If a user were to post such stuff, the site would need to eliminate that stuff, and the poster could not legally rely on an argument of the type \"That's my stuff, you have no right to mess with it\".\n\nOn the other hand, if a forum actually requires paid membership, then there may be a strong contractual expectation that the user is getting something of value, so you would have to watch for statements that could be interpreted as broad permission to put stuff out there without any interference. (For instance, a file\\-hosting service would have only minimal restrictions on content, aimed at protecting their own legal interests; whereas a political\\-advocacy site would have maximal interest in prohibiting the expression of views counter to the cause). Thus the SE TOS has you \"grant Stack Exchange the perpetual and irrevocable right and license to use, copy, cache, publish, display, distribute, modify, create derivative works\", which allows moderators to correct typos, delete offensive wording, and obliterate entire posts. If a site fails to have any such clauses in their TOS, then it might be a matter that has to be settled in court, whether they have the right to eliminate \"spam\" (i.e. advertising for a service, especially if the reason for getting an account was to provide an advertising platform).\n\nIn light of the limited use sanctioned by the TOS, per the below comment, legal copying will be quite limited. However, \"fair use\" a situation where copying is allowed, regardless of what the TOS may say. (You could be banned from the site, but you could not be sued for infringement). Fair use was invented precisely so that people could make comments like \"Jones advocates an absurd law, saying '...\\[quote from Jones]...'\". Thus you can comment on a post and quote the relevant part (\"The lines '\\[... quoting the code ...]' results in an infinite loop\").

There are various limits on in kind payments around the world, including the US. Very generally, in kind payments are only allowed for particular industries and occupations, only allowed up to a certain dollar value, and only allowed as a certain fraction of the employee's wages.

This violates minimum wage laws as the cash component is below the federal minimum wage, and the in-kind portion exceeds both the allowable percentage and uses retail value instead of cost.\n\nB) Incorrect. Paying entirely in in-kind benefits is not allowed. There must be a cash component, and in-kind payments are limited to a fraction of total wages.\n\nC) Incorrect. While this maintains a majority cash payment, stock options are not typically considered an allowable form of in-kind payment for minimum wage purposes.\n\nD) Correct. This scenario is legal because the full minimum wage is paid in cash, and the meal is an additional benefit.

However, I have never really seen a juror ask someone at the bench a question.\n\nIn a recent Australian case in which the convicted murder's appeal was granted for a lighter sentence the judge commented that\n\n> the jury could not properly have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the element of intent to kill or do grievous bodily harm had been proved.\n\nGiven this case was about a man who killed his wife (and I have also forgotten some of the facts about the case), when I heard about this I thought \"did the jury not think that when you pick up any weapon you have to be fully aware you can take a person's life or do grievous bodily harm with it?\"\n\nBut then I remembered that in the crime dramas I have seen (probably not a good idea to assume this is how trials work in the real world), the defense and prosecution may not have revealed to the jury when the murder weapon was picked up and the state of mind of the accused moments before said weapon was picked up, tiny facts which on the surface may not mean a lot.\n\nSo I am wondering: are juries able to ask questions of those on the bench during a trial? If not, why aren't they, considering that it's the jury who ends up deciding if the accused is innocent or guilty?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, while Law and Order should not be taken as an accurate depiction of a New York trial, it *especially* should not be taken as an accurate depiction of an Australian trial. Australian law, while it has some major similarities with US law (both ultimately derive from the law of England), is not US law. With procedural matters (such as \"may jurors ask questions of witnesses\"), it can potentially differ from court to court.\n\nIn general, jurors may not simply ask a witness a question. The jury's job is not to investigate and figure out if the defendant was guilty or not; it's to evaluate the cases presented by each side. US (and Australian, as far as I know) courts use what's known as the adversarial model, where the prosecution and the defense both present the best cases they can and a neutral third party decides which case was stronger. In a US criminal trial, the state is expected to justify why someone should be in jail; the jury shouldn't be helping them justify it. This isn't how all jurisdictions around the world work, but it's how the US does.\n\nOne concern with juror questions is that it has the risk that the juror will not be impartial. Jurors are not supposed to get into arguments with witnesses, or to go after them to try to prove a point. In your case, the juror might be introducing an entirely different line of reasoning from the one either side is presenting, and that's simply not their job. People have raised the concern that a juror thinking up questions might be deciding the case before they hear all the evidence, and might give too much weight to the answers to their own questions (or read a lot into it if a question is denied).\n\nThere are also rules on what questions may be legally asked; lawyers know these and jurors generally don't, which is why jurors may almost never directly ask a question to a witness. Where they can ask questions, it's virtually always *written* questions, which the judge reviews, gives to both sides to see if anyone objects, and then reads to the witness in a neutral tone.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the adversarial model used in US and Australian criminal trials, why are jurors generally not allowed to directly ask questions to witnesses?\n\nA) Jurors lack the legal expertise to formulate proper questions\nB) It could compromise the impartiality of the jury and introduce bias\nC) It would make trials last too long if jurors could ask questions\nD) Witnesses might become intimidated by direct juror questioning\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The adversarial model relies on the prosecution and defense presenting their cases, with the jury as a neutral evaluator. Allowing jurors to directly question witnesses could compromise their impartiality for several reasons:\n\n1. Jurors might develop their own theories or arguments, stepping outside their role as neutral evaluators.\n2. They might give too much weight to answers to their own questions.\n3. The act of questioning might indicate that a juror is forming opinions before hearing all evidence.\n4. Jurors might get into arguments with witnesses, further compromising neutrality.\n\nWhile A is partially true (jurors may lack knowledge of legal rules for questioning), this is not the primary reason for the restriction.

This is merely used as an example of what I'm talking about and I'm sure I could look up a lot more examples if I knew the right term.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While less specific than the term mentioned by @DavidSiegel (i.e. an \"Antinomy\"), \"impossibility\", \"impossibility of performance\", and \"impracticability\" are more frequently used. If the obligation is imposed by contract rather than by a statute or regulation, the term \"frustration of purpose\" is also frequently used. Even more generally, a situation like this is called a \"dilemma.\"\n\nMore obscurely, sometimes this gets litigated in the frame of whether non\\-compliance with the law was a voluntary act, i.e. the *[actus reus](https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/criminal-law/actus-reus/#:%7E:text=Actus%20reus%20is%20the%20Latin%20term%20used%20to%20describe%20a%20criminal%20act.&text=Actus%20reus%20is%20commonly%20defined,result%20of%20voluntary%20bodily%20movement.)* necessary to establish a prima facie case of a violation of a law imposing a criminal or quasi\\-criminal penalty. The \"choice of evils\" doctrine could also apply although this is a much narrower doctrine excusing liability than many people believe it to be.\n\nThere are also a couple of other possible outcomes.\n\nSometimes a court would treat this situations as an implied ambiguity or inconsistency in the law that calls for the court to interpret the true meaning of the statute or regulation. For example, in this circumstance, it is implausible that the statute or regulation was intended to put good faith vaccine distributors in a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation where they would be fined no matter what they did because conforming to the law was impossible. So a court might conclude that the requirement that \"If you don't use up your vaccine doses, you're getting a huge fine\" contains an implied condition that this only applies if there are sufficient people who eligible to obtain the vaccination to use all of your vaccine doses (which as as matter of practicality is very likely to be true, so it is something of a false conflict as applied in most cases).\n\nBut it isn't at all uncommon for people to put themselves in situations where their on ill advised or wrongful conduct puts them in a position in which now, after their prior bad acts, anything they do will be a crime or a civil offense, and they are indeed damned if they do and damned if they don't.\n\nFor example, if you start to attempt to steal a car and see a baby in the back, you can either continue, and face kidnapping charges and car theft charges, or you can stop after you have already done enough to make you guilty of attempted car theft even if you abandon the crime at that point to prevent yourself for kidnapping the child. No matter what you do, you are stuck committing one crime or another. But you actions will determine which crime you will be guilty of committing. The fact that at the final moment of decision that determines which crime you will be guilty of, any choice you make will expose you to criminal liability, doesn't make these laws invalid, because this [Hobson's choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobson%27s_choice#:%7E:text=A%20Hobson%27s%20choice%20is%20a,take%20it%20or%20leave%20it%22.)

Call NICS to verify that the DOJ/FBI is not aware of any prohibitions against the transfer (I'm not sure which agency exactly handles this call)\n3. NICS may approve or deny the transfer right away, but they may also delay it so they can take additional time (days) to review the request\n\nThere is a commonly stated provision that if NICS does not make a decision in 3 days, the seller may proceed with the transfer. So in effect transfers are automatically approved after 3 days.\n\nI know there are various laws prohibiting the transfer of firearms to certain people, such as felons or fugitives.

Specifically, I'm curious to know:\n\n* Is there a law that background checks may not delay a firearm transfer by X days?\n* Is there a law saying that background checks may not delay a firearm transfer \"excessively\" without giving a number of days?\n* Is the above process with 4473, NICS and the 3 day cap specified in a law, or is it just a policy the ATF came up with on its own?\n* If the DOJ/FBI uses a way to delay the transfer by more than 3 days, are they breaking any laws?\n\nClearly, when the above process was put in place, there was some concern that the background check would be a way for the government to slow walk each purchase and infringe on the rights of the public to keep and bear arms. Accordingly, there is a rule that the background check will take at most 3 days, and if it's not done by then the transfer is approved by default. This seems a reasonable compromise between the need for an opportunity to catch prohibited transferees, while also limiting the harm to those that are not prohibited.\n\nTo summarize the question, where is this 3 day compromise coming from?

Assume the plaintiff is in the United States in California.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Does the statute of limitations apply if the company to be sued wasn't operating in the U.S.?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the company is not operating in the USA then, of course, US law does not apply to it. There may be statutes of limitations where it is operating but the US ones are irrelevant.\n\nHowever, the company you describe which is entering into a contract with a California resident to provide goods or services in California is most definitely operating in California. The fact that it doesn't have a physical presence in California doesn't mean it's not operating there.\n\nIf you wish to bring an action in California, the Californian statute of limitations will most definitely apply and time will run from when the breach of contract occurred.\n\nYou are suffering under the misapprehension that you can't sue a foreign company in a US court\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**You can.**\n\nIt's technically more complicated and there can be disputes over jurisdiction, the appropriate venue and which law applies but assuming all of that can be managed and a Californian court has jurisdiction and considers itself the most appropriate venue (it may be that a Chinese court is more appropriate) then there's no reason why you can't sue a foreign company with no physical presence in California.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A California resident entered into a contract with a Chinese company 12 years ago.

The standard statute of limitations for contract breaches in California is 4 years. Can the California resident now sue the Chinese company in a California court for the 12-year-old breach of contract?\n\nA) No, because the statute of limitations has expired.\nB) Yes, because the statute of limitations only starts when the company establishes a physical presence in the U.S.\nC) No, because U.S. courts have no jurisdiction over foreign companies.\nD) Yes, but only if the contract specified that California law would apply.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. The statute of limitations for contract breaches in California (4 years) applies from the time of the breach, regardless of whether the company had a physical presence in the U.S. The fact that the company was foreign does not prevent it from being sued in a U.S. court, nor does it toll (pause) the statute of limitations. U.S. courts can have jurisdiction over foreign companies doing business with U.S. residents, even without a physical U.S. presence. The establishment of a U.S. headquarters 12 years later does not reset or extend the statute of limitations.

If a $10,000 forgiveness is announced, is there a basis for a class action lawsuit against the Federal Government?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have no injury and so no basis for a suit, unless your claim is that the educational institutions you attended were fraudulent (in which case you'd most likely sue them, or try to petition the government for existing relief procedures for such cases). Since you don't, you have no injury.\n\nAll parties entered their loans under the understanding that paying them off was necessary and potentially long term and arduous. The government forgiving amounts on existing loans does no injury to those who already paid. There is no injury in you having done what you agreed to do, in accordance with governing laws. Forgiving some debt for some people is just an act of executive largesse, and does not hurt you in any legally cognizable form.\n\nIndeed, it could be said that you have benefitted from having paid them off. For since doing so you have no longer been burdened by them, saving you both money and potential credit score or even legal issues, whereas those who still have debt are still so burdened. Plus paying them off yields benefits in your credit score and general loan worthiness; you can expect to have been able to get meaningfully better interest rates than someone identical to you but with substantial student debt. These are all benefits nobody who gets forgiveness will retroactively receive. At best, going forward they will get to be on similar footing as you. And having more people on the same beneficial footing as you is not a legally cognizable injury in fact to you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A borrower who previously paid off their $40,000 student loan debt is considering legal action against the government after a new policy forgives $10,000 of student loan debt for current borrowers. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal standing of this individual?\n\nA) The borrower has grounds for a class action lawsuit against the Federal Government for unequal treatment.\nB) The borrower can sue for a $10,000 refund as compensation for their previous payments.\nC) The borrower has no legal standing for a lawsuit as they have not suffered any legally recognizable injury.\nD) The borrower can petition the government for relief under existing fraudulent education claim procedures.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, the borrower who has already paid off their student loans has no legal standing to sue the government over the new forgiveness policy. This is because they have not suffered any legally recognizable injury. The act of forgiving current debts does not harm those who have already paid their debts. In fact, the documentation suggests that those who paid off their loans may have already benefited from improved credit scores and loan worthiness.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no basis for a class action lawsuit due to the lack of legal injury.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as there is no legal mechanism to claim a refund for previously paid debts when new forgiveness policies are implemented.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because this option only applies if the educational institution was fraudulent, which is not the case presented in this scenario."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73405/when-does-a-threat-become-a-crime", "docs_id": 73405, "title": "When does a threat become a crime?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is prompted by two cases:\n\n* [Richard Barnard](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/police-arrested-non-violent-palestine-activists-under-terror-legislation/) was charged with conspiracy to blackmail after saying he would go on a hunger strike against LaSalle Investment Management, the company from which Elbit Systems \\[Israeli arms company] rents its London office building, unless it evicted the arms manufacturer.\n* [Compound Labs](https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/01/compound_crypto_bug/) said they would dox recipients of their erroneous payout who did not repay 90% of said payout.\n\nAt first glance it would appear that both these are fairly similar, where an entity says they will take some legitimate action if another party does not take some other legal action.

The public defender declined to meet several times and told me he only get's the discovery evidence a day or two in advance. He was already assigned to me for a month. \n\nI had met with the prosecutor myself, before a public defender was assigned, trying to tell him the truth, but he refused to hear, even to take a 50 page document where I described all the harm this woman had done not only to me but to 5 other men (she's a sociopath and member of a cult, horribly deceiving people). You'd think he'd at least take it to use it against me. He said I have to pursue those criminal and civil issues separately from this case. THE SALIENT POINT FOR THIS QUESTION IS HE HAD THE DISCOVERY 1\\-2 MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME, NOTHING GOING TO THE PUBLIC DEFENDER.\n\nIt turns out my public defender only got the discovery evidence the morning of the 1st pretrial, my court meeting at 1:30pm. And when I met with him at pre\\-trial, 1:30pm, he immediately intimidated me twice on first meeting \\-\\- with the discovery in his hand, he starting by saying \"these texts are despicable\", and then to my reply \"you have no idea what this woman did\", and he replying \"still, these texts are despicable.\" At that point I consciously or unconsciously realized this man would not help me, and \"folded\" and accepted one of the charges (no contests) \\-\\- charges very similar almost the same \\-\\- it appears prosecutors like to give you 2 charges so they can get you to accept one, and bypass the longer trial/judicial system.\n\nThe public defender says he regularly only gets discovery a day or two in advance, and in my case as I stated, only the morning of. Is this court misconduct?\n\nWondering how these public defenders are paid/incentivized, I asked the court multiples times to tell me how they pay their public defenders, and they refused to reply/comment. But it seems very \"fishy\" to me, like the prosecutor(s) have a racquet going with the public defenders \\-\\- this is a large court, the Phoenix Municipal Court. \n\nThe public defender has 3 terrible reviews, is a debt collection attorney primarily, and I think he uses the discovery information \"just fine\", to knock the legs out from under those he is supposed to defend. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> The public defender says he regularly only gets discovery a day or two\n>  in advance, and in my case as I stated, only the morning of. Is this\n>  court misconduct?\n\nIt is a serious breach of substantive criminal law (it is called a *Brady* violation) not to turn over discovery prior to a plea or trial, and it is also an ethical violation not to do so.\n\nFailure to turn it over until a day or two before then, when it could have been made much sooner, is another question. The public defender could have insisted on a continuance, but that would have left open the possibility that the prosecutor would have withdrawn the prosecutor's offer.\n\nNothing that the public defender did appears to be misconduct.\n\nThe prosecutor is forbidden from communicating directly with you once the public defender is assigned as a matter of legal ethics. He isn't ignoring you because he is a jerk (maybe he or she also was a jerk, but this particular act of ignoring you doesn't reflect that).\n\nThe public defenders office probably could act collectively, or the ACLU or a similar entity might consider bringing a class action, to push for more than a day or two of advanced delivery of discovery from the prosecutors and might be able to convince a judge to change the prevailing custom. But, typically, public defenders are overworked as they are and wouldn't have much time in advance to look at the materials even if they were received sooner, so that is not a hill that they choose to die upon.\n\nPublic defenders routinely lack time to meet with their clients and time to really explain things properly. For what it is worth, some studies (I will update with a citations if I have time, but don't have it at hand) have shown that in terms of substantive conviction and sentencing outcome, that public defenders do no worse than much more expensive private criminal defense counsel (whom you probably couldn't have afforded anyway), although private criminal defense counsel usually has much more time to discuss the case with you leading to greater \"customer satisfaction.\" Of course, even that is only \"on average\". Your mileage may vary.\n\nAll of this, however, is really just side commentary. The fact that you, (admittedly) under the perhaps high pressure advice of your public defender, agreed to a plea bargain that you weren't entirely comfortable with from the prosecutor's office, in and of itself isn't improper. Your conviction in all likelihood would not be set aside on that basis, even if you collaterally attacked the plea bargain in a post\\-trial motion or habeas corpus action. \n\nThe judge almost certainly had you formally accept the plea after an advisement or had the advisement waived based upon your public defender's representation and consent. This makes the plea binding and extremely difficult to overturn. It is for all practical intents and purposes final and irreversible.\n\nGiven the kinds of cases that are brought in municipal court, it would not make sense to challenge the convictions on such mushy grounds, even if you could. It often takes many years for such challenges to run their course and 99% of the time they lose. If you were facing decades in prison or a death penalty on the charges, it might make sense to try, but you aren't.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case described, what legal issue is most likely present regarding the handling of discovery evidence?\n\nA) The public defender's refusal to meet with the defendant prior to the pretrial meeting\nB) The prosecutor's refusal to accept additional evidence from the defendant\nC) The late disclosure of discovery evidence to the public defender\nD) The public defender's comments about the text messages being \"despicable\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most significant legal issue in this scenario is the late disclosure of discovery evidence to the public defender. The answer states that \"It is a serious breach of substantive criminal law (it is called a Brady violation) not to turn over discovery prior to a plea or trial, and it is also an ethical violation not to do so.\" In this case, the public defender only received the discovery evidence on the morning of the pretrial meeting, which could potentially violate the defendant's rights and impede the ability to prepare an adequate defense.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the public defender's refusal to meet earlier is problematic, it's not necessarily a legal violation. Option B is also incorrect because the prosecutor is not obligated to accept additional evidence from the defendant, especially after a public defender has been assigned. Option D, while potentially unprofessional, does not constitute a legal issue in the same way that the late discovery disclosure does."}}
