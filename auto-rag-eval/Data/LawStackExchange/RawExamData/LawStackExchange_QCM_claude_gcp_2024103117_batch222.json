For instance, the document *L'interpr\u00e9tation de la Bible dans l'\u00c9glise* (The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church), published in April 15, 1993, is in German, Italian, Portuguese, Swahili, and Ukrainian.

Well, as this was published in 1993, probably in a printed book, it must have a copyright. There is no mention to it however in the website.\n\nNow, assuming the document has a copyright, is the pdf version in Spanish infringing the copyright of the original document? \n\nReasons why it should:\n\n* it's a translation, which require [official permission](http://www.translatorsbase.com/articles/42.aspx).\n* it's the whole document, and so not under *[fair use](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/59106/is-it-legal-to-share-an-electronic-copy-of-a-few-book-chapters)*\n\nAm I right?

There are four factors included in fair use, and that's only one of them.

(The idea is not very unique though, similar applications have been developed by others). The client wants to be able to sell the resulting company in the future, and have the company own the mobile app. The developer wants the app stores to show his or her name (or the developer's firm name) as developer.\n\nMy main question is:\n\nWhich software license can be used, so the developer can legally claim to be the developer of the app?\n\nAlso:\n\na.

But we can indicate some aspects of the relevant law.\n\nThe particular license that a developer grants is not as important as who holds the copyright, and the terms of the contract between developer and client, which may include specifying the license.\n\nLet us call the developer D, and the client C. D will hold the initial copyright for the software unless it is a work\\-made\\-for\\-hire (WFH). In the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), under 17 USC 101, a work can be a WFH in two ways. Either a) the creator (D) is a regular employee of C, acting within the scope of D's employment, or b)\nthere is an explicit written contract saying that the work is a WFH, **and** the work falls into one of a limited set of categories. Neither a) nor b) seems to apply to the situation described in the question.\n\nThat the developer (D) grants a license to the client (C) shows that D holds the copyright. A transfer of copyright would be a different agreement (and must be in writing in the US).\n\nC and D will want to have a written contract that specifies who holds the copyright, and what rights each has. This will affect the price for the work.\n\nSince C wants to create a company based on the software to be created, and sell interests in it or acquire funding, D will need to be able to clearly show that the rights to the IP involved are secure. D will want either the transfer of the copyright, or at least a permanent, non\\-revocable license. D may well want such a license to be exclusive, as well. D will not want any opensource or copyleft license to be used.\n\nNote that even if the agreement transfers the copyright from D to C, under 17 USC 106A D retrains the right to assert authorship, which cannot be transferred waived. Many other countries, particularly European countries, grant a similar \"moral right\" to the author. This right could be mentioned and acknowledged in any contract between C and D.\n\nIf D's primary interest is to be able to show others the significance of D's work, that might be sufficient. If D wants to be able to resell the developed code, or part of it, then a transfer of copyright will not serve D. In that case C and D should agree on just what rights D will have. D should not attempt to hide from C any intention to resell the code, or parts of it, to others later.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer (D) is contracted by a client (C) to create a mobile app. C plans to start a company based on this app. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright and licensing of the software?\n\nA) D automatically owns the copyright, and C needs to purchase a license to use the software.\nB) C automatically owns the copyright because they commissioned the work.\nC) D owns the copyright by default, but can transfer it to C through a written agreement.\nD) The copyright is automatically shared equally between D and C.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, the developer (D) will hold the initial copyright for the software unless it is a work-made-for-hire (WFH), which doesn't seem to apply in this scenario. The copyright can be transferred from D to C through a written agreement. This is often necessary when the client (C) wants to create a company based on the software and secure IP rights for potential investors or buyers.\n\nOption A is partially correct but oversimplifies the situation. While D does initially own the copyright, the licensing arrangements can be more complex than just purchasing a license.\n\nOption B is incorrect because commissioning work doesn't automatically transfer copyright to the client.\n\nOption D is incorrect because copyright is not automatically shared between the developer and client.\n\nThe correct answer, C, reflects that the developer initially holds the copyright but can transfer it to the client through a written agreement, which is often necessary in situations like the one described."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46907/old-western-guns-trademark", "docs_id": 46907, "title": "Old Western Guns Trademark", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm going to be making a computer game with a \"western\" setting and was wondering if it would be illegal to use guns from that era, like the popular Colt Single Action or the Schofield Model 3, and other weapons of course.

According to the documentation, using brand names like \"Colt\" to accurately represent historical weapons in a game is considered nominative use and is generally acceptable. This allows developers to include authentic representations of firearms from the era. However, the documentation warns against using these brand names in ways that could be seen as trademark abuse, such as in the game's title (e.g., \"Colt Single Action Simulator 1848\"). This would imply that the brand is being used as a trademark for the game itself, which could lead to legal issues.

However, nothing in any such legal system **requires** them to sue. Instead, offering a resolution out of court \\- like arbitration or offering to relinquish a claim for payment \\- is legal. Adding pressure by saying \"This is my offer, otherwise I sue\" is not extortion, because after the suit is filed, it is with the courts.

It's not illegal to present this option.\n\nB) Demanding payment to settle a legitimate claim before filing a lawsuit is a common practice and is often done through demand letters. This is a legal way to attempt to resolve disputes without court intervention.\n\nC) This is the correct answer because threatening to expose embarrassing personal information unless the other party agrees to settle could be considered extortion or blackmail, which is illegal. This goes beyond the scope of a legitimate legal threat and enters into coercion territory.\n\nD) While threatening to sue for a frivolous claim is not advisable and could potentially lead to sanctions if a lawsuit is actually filed, the threat itself is not inherently illegal.

The Court held that the law, which prohibited employing a baker or baker's assistant for more than 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week, was an:\n\n> unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right and liberty of the individual to contract.\n\nThe Wikipedia article on the era (linked above) states that:\n\n> The beginning of the era is usually marked earlier, with the Court's decision in [*Allgeyer v. Louisiana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allgeyer_v._Louisiana) (1897\\), and its end marked forty years later in the case of [*West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_Hotel_Co._v._Parrish) (1937\\), which overturned an earlier Lochner\\-era decision.{2}\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article:\n\n> The Lochner era has been criticized from the left for judicial activism, routinely overturning the will of Congress, and also for the Court's failure to allow the political process to redress increasingly unequal distributions of wealth and power.{3}\n> \n> \n> Criticism among conservative scholars has focused on the use of substantive due process as a vehicle for protecting rights not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.{4} Robert Bork called the Court's decision in *Lochner v.

The \"Lochner era\" in US law was an anomaly in this regard, and has been over for more than 80 years now.\n\nThis axiomatic rule in no way changed when anti\\-discrimination laws were passed (by the US Federal government, by most US states, by the UK, and by other jurisdictions).

Nextel Communications, Inc](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1533724.html): the couple declared *no* community property at the time of the divorce, meaning the wife who was not a party in in infringement case, had no standing \u2013 and therefore the infringement suit could procede).

[This letter from the DoJ](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1841-copyright-law-prosecution-policy) explains the policy on prosecutions and while they are non\\-committal on many issues, it is clear that\n\n> the statutory scheme also requires that the government prove, as an\n> element to any criminal violation\\-\\-felony or misdemeanor\\-\\-that the\n> infringement has occurred \"willfully and for purposes of commercial\n> advantage or private financial gain.\"\n\nEven if making thumb\\-drive backups is a violation of the EULA, it is not criminal infringement.\n\nThen one must inspect whatever license terms exist for use of the content. Musical content is often vended with minimal licensing of unclear authority, but commercial software is generally vended with a license agreement that is directly presented to you and you have to at least say \"I agree\". A license might explicitly allow, forbid, or be silent on a particular kind of copying. Copyright protection only protects the creations of the creator A, and does not lay claim to the creations of user B who uses A's software. Therefore you can sell documents that you create with Word for large sums of money, as well as backing them up.\n\nWhether or not you can use \"peripheral stuff\" created by the copyright holder, such as clip\\-art, depends on what the license says. Some such files are licenses for any usage, not everything is. Explicit statements of permission are very useful in that situation (also explicit denials). If you cannot find an explicit statement covering your case, there is a risk that you are violating copyright law by copying material without permission.\n\nIn general, one has or had non\\-statutory permission to make backups of your installed \"stuff\" (software, ancilliary files, music and so on). It is *not* safe to assume that you have permission to make duplicate copies of an installation CD (if you have one), rather, the installation CD *is* the backup and you execute the installed copy. It is also not guaranteed that you have permission to make backup copies on other devices, indeed there may be technical means implemented to limit you to just one installation (which can cause problems if you don't uninstall before the drive crashes). It's all in the agreement, and there is a reasonable chance that with current software, you do not have permission to make a backup copy.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) This action is always legal under fair use doctrine and doesn't require explicit permission.\nB) This is potentially a criminal copyright violation that could result in prosecution by the Department of Justice.\nC) The legality depends on the specific terms of the license agreement, but it's likely permitted for personal backup purposes.\nD) This action is always illegal as it violates copyright law, regardless of the license terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legality of making backups of licensed software depends on the specific terms outlined in the license agreement. Many software licenses, including those for Microsoft products, often allow users to make a single backup copy for personal use. However, this is not universally true for all software or all types of files associated with the software.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because fair use doctrine doesn't automatically cover all backup scenarios, and explicit permission in the license is typically required.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because, according to the information provided, this would be a civil matter, not a criminal one. The Department of Justice typically only pursues criminal copyright cases involving willful infringement for commercial advantage or private financial gain.\n\nAnswer D is overly broad and incorrect. While some backup actions might violate copyright law or license agreements, many software licenses explicitly permit limited backup copies for personal use.\n\nThe key takeaway is that users should carefully review their software license agreements to understand what backup rights they have for different components of the software."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78712/right-to-your-own-photo-at-the-opticians", "docs_id": 78712, "title": "Right to your own photo at the opticians", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: At the opticians, such as [Boots](https://www.boots.com/opticians),\nthey use photographic technology to capture an image of your eye.

According to copyright law, the photographer (in this case, the optician) owns the copyright to the image, not the subject (Sarah). However, since the photograph is linked to Sarah's personal information, it likely qualifies as personal data under GDPR. As such, Sarah has the right to request access to the image and potentially request its erasure, subject to certain exceptions.

Domain name: The email address for the account at the registrar typically belongs to an individual.\n2. Facebook page: Facebook requires that the administrator of a page be an individual. This individual has complete control of the page and is effectively the owner.\n3. Any other accounts on 3rd party services that require registration by an individual.\n\n**Followup Question**\n\nWhat would be the preferred way set up and manage accounts owned by the business for accounts on services that require they be attached to an individual; or what stackexchange should I direct this question to?\n\n**Goal:**\n\nThe goal is to prevent a rogue admin from hijacking the intangible property, and *getting away with it* (business has no legal recourse).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As the saying goes, [possession is nine\\-tenths of the law (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_is_nine-tenths_of_the_law).\n\nJust about any web\\-based property is owned by the person (or company) who owns the email address that allows access to that property. Email addressees are owned by the person who controls the access to the email account at the email provider, i.e. the login and password. (For simplicity, I'm ignoring the fact that the individual's listed name on the email account can come into play in ownership disputes).\n\nA Facebook page is owned by the owner of the administrative email for the account at that service. A domain is owned by the domain registrant, who opens an account at a domain registrar with an email and registers the domain. The domain registrant administers the ownership of the domain via an administrative email, and that email owned by the person who has the access to that email account. \n\nVery basically, in your situation, if you want to *\"establish legal ownership\"* of a web property owned and/or administered by someone else, you determine if there is a contract in place (written or verbal) that established your partial ownership to the property, or an agreement to transfer full ownership of the property to you at some point. See [Elements of a Contract \u2014 Judicial Education Center](http://jec.unm.edu/education/online-training/contract-law-tutorial/contract-fundamentals-part-2).\n\nIf there is an agreement or contract to transfer full ownership to you, execute the contract. Have everyone sign off on it and do the technical transfer of the property, i.e. change ownership and access of the email account associated with the property.\n\nIf there is an agreement or contract that you have partial ownership and you want full ownership, you attempt to renegotiate the contract, if both parties agree to renegotiate. Or you go to court and let a court decide the status of the contract.\n\nIf there isn't an contract and/or agreement in place regarding your current partial or future ownership of the property, you're out of luck. Whoever owns the property owns it.\n\nYou can go to court alleging something, like breach of contract, or you deserve the property (such as a domain or email address or Facebook page) because it's the same as your business name, but that's your choice.\n\nFurther, in particular to domain names, there is also a dispute resolution process [Uniform Domain\\-Name Dispute\\-Resolution Policy \\- ICANN](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/help/dndr/udrp-en) that seeks to resolve *trademark\\-based domain\\-name* disputes, which may or not be relevant in your question, which is primarily about ownership.

Tom registered a domain name for the business and set up social media accounts, including a Facebook page, using his personal email address. After a dispute, Tom refuses to transfer control of these accounts to Sarah. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal ownership of these digital assets?\n\nA) Sarah automatically owns all the digital assets because they were created for her business.\nB) Tom owns the digital assets because they are registered under his email address, regardless of any agreements.\nC) The ownership depends on the existence and terms of a contract between Sarah and Tom.\nD) Sarah can easily claim ownership by proving to the platforms that she runs the business associated with the accounts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The ownership of digital assets like domain names and social media accounts primarily depends on the existence and terms of a contract between the parties involved. As stated in the documentation, \"if you want to establish legal ownership of a web property owned and/or administered by someone else, you determine if there is a contract in place (written or verbal) that established your partial ownership to the property, or an agreement to transfer full ownership of the property to you at some point.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because creating assets for a business doesn't automatically transfer ownership, especially if they're registered under personal accounts.\n\nOption B is partially true but oversimplified. While control of the email address associated with an account does provide significant control, it doesn't override contractual agreements.\n\nOption D is incorrect because proving business ownership isn't usually sufficient to claim ownership of digital assets registered by someone else. Platforms typically don't arbitrate such ownership disputes.\n\nThe key factor is the contractual agreement between Sarah and Tom. If a contract exists that specifies ownership or transfer of these assets, it would be the basis for determining legal ownership. If no such agreement exists, Tom's control of the email addresses associated with the accounts would give him a strong claim to ownership, making it more challenging for Sarah to assert her rights without legal action."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11275/a-license-agreement-that-is-automatically-terminated-in-practice", "docs_id": 11275, "title": "a license agreement that is automatically terminated in practice", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When I read the license agreement of my samsung cell phone, I noticed that **lending** the phone's software (its OS) is prohibited.

This aligns with the top answer's explanation that lending the physical device is not the same as copying the software elsewhere. Additionally, the answer points out that such strict automatic termination clauses are uncommon, and license agreements often include provisions to maintain the validity of other terms even if one is violated or found unenforceable.

Evidence will have to be obtained to determine this.\n\nA question of law never requires evidence (as in, exhibits), only legal argument. A question of law is something like: \"Does it count as self defence if I am protecting not myself but someone else?\" Lawyers will make submissions to the judge and the judge will be the one who answers the question of law. \n\nIn civil cases, all questions of fact are determined by the judge, in criminal cases it will be by the jury or magistrate.\n\nAn easy way to seperate them is this:\n\nIf the way to answer the question is by obtaining evidence, then its a question of fact (\"Is this a drug?

I\u2019ll address the second part first (where Rob argues for the decision in Bob\u2019s favour to be overturned in his response to Bob's appeal), because it\u2019s easier. For both parties to partially succeed at trial, and both parties to contend on appeal that they should have been wholly successful, is not that unusual. It is usually called a cross\\-appeal in Commonwealth jurisdictions, or in the Supreme Court of the United States, a cross\\-petition.\n\nAn example from the United Kingdom: in [*R (on the application of Carmichael and Rourke) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions*](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2014-0125-press-summary.pdf) \\[2016] UKSC 58, the court dealt with four appeals arising out of challenges to the so\\-called [bedroom tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedroom_tax). In one case, the claimant succeeded on one of two grounds, the government appealed, and the claimant cross\\-appealed on her failed ground:\n\n> The Rutherfords succeeded in their claim on the ground of disability discrimination. \\[Ms A\u2019s] claim succeeded on the grounds of sex discrimination. Both A\u2019 and the Rutherfords\u2019 Equality Act claims were rejected. The Secretary of State appeals the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision to allow the Rutherfords\u2019 and A\u2019s discrimination claims. A cross\\-appeals the rejection of her Equality Act claim \u2026 The Secretary of State\u2019s appeal in respect of A is allowed, and A\u2019s cross appeal is dismissed, by a majority of 5 to 2\\.\n\nThe first part of your question is more difficult, which is why you have received two conflicting answers. Usually appellate courts have the formal power to go beyond the issues raised by the parties, as pointed out by @Dale M. In any event, if an apex court exceeds its powers, there is no further court of appeal to say so. However, as @ohwilleke points out, to decide the case on a ground not argued violates due process. When an appellate court does this, it is said to act \u201con its own motion\u201d or [*sua sponte*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sua_sponte).\n\nAs @ohwilleke says, in the United States, appellate courts may be able to *affirm* the trial court\u2019s decision for any reason supported by the record, even if not raised by any party. This is the \u201cright for any reason\u201d or [tipsy coachman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipsy_Coachman) doctrine. However, your question asks whether a court can *overturn* part of decision not appealed against. That is, by appealing his partial win, does Bob run the risk of the court ruling *sua sponte* that he ought to have suffered a complete loss?\n\nThis is discussed in Miller, \u2018[Sua Sponte Appellate Rulings: When Courts Deprive Litigants of an Opportunity to Be Heard](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sanlr39&div=41&id=&page=),\u2019 39 *San Diego Law Review* 1253 (2002\\). In the introduction, Miller observes:\n\n> In fact, some of the Supreme Court's most famous opinions decided issues not presented by the briefs or addressed below. In [*Erie Railroad v. Tompkins*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Railroad_Co._v._Tompkins), the Court overturned sua sponte an ancient precedent on applying the common law in diversity cases. [*Mapp v. Ohio*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapp_v._Ohio) overrules a prior case and applied the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule to the states, without briefing or argument on the issue. In [*Washington v. Davis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_v._Davis), the Court decided that Title VII standards did not apply to constitutional discrimination, even though the parties had agreed that they did. [*Younger v. Harris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_v._Harris) prohibits injunctions against pending state court criminal cases, even though the issue was not argued on appeal. Indeed, in [*Stanley v. Illinois*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_v._Illinois), the Court held that due process requires hearings and an opportunity to make submissions before a state can terminate the parental rights of unwed fathers. But the Court decided this without briefing or argument \u2013 without a hearing on the issue or an opportunity for the parties to make submissions.\n\nMost of those cases involve a petition for certiorari in which the petitioner got more than they asked for. However, *Younger v. Harris* is closer to the Bob/Rob scenario. Younger, the [District Attorney of Los Angeles County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_District_Attorney), prosecuted Harris under the [California Criminal Syndicalism Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Criminal_Syndicalism_Act). Before the criminal trial, Harris sued Younger in the Federal District Court, which held the Act void for vagueness and overbreadth, and enjoined the prosecution. Younger appealed to the Supreme Court, but rather than determining whether the Act was constitutional, the Supreme Court reversed the district court\u2019s decision on the ground that federal courts should only enjoin state criminal prosecutions in extraordinary circumstances. So, Younger \u201cwon,\u201d but Harris\u2019s constitutional argument remained open and supported by the district court\u2019s opinion, which Younger could not challenge again without first securing a conviction at trial.\n\nTo summarise, appellate courts sometimes do overturn decisions based on arguments not raised by the parties. However, this is exceptional and is generally considered procedurally unfair. If an appellate court thinks the parties have missed an important legal argument, it is more common and appropriate for the court to raise it at the hearing, and invite the parties to consider and make submissions about it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In an appellate court proceeding, under what circumstances is the court most likely to overturn a lower court's decision on grounds not raised by either party?\n\nA) When the appellate court discovers a clear error in the lower court's interpretation of a statute\nB) When the issue involves a fundamental constitutional right that wasn't addressed in the original arguments\nC) When new evidence emerges that wasn't available during the initial trial\nD) When the appellate court believes both parties have misinterpreted a key precedent\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

I am asking specifically about their protection status under the second amendment.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One can only be certain when a case is decided by SCOTUS, and so far, no law has attempted to ban the publication of manuals for firearms.\n[Jackson v. City of S.F.](https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf), 746 F.3d 953 gives good reason to think that the court would find such a ban unconstitutional. There is an analogous line of thinking regarding ammunition regulations, where some municipalities took the position that ammunition is not \"arms\" and therefore is not protected, since the amendment does not explicitly say \"and ammunition\". The Jackson court comments that\n\n> A regulation eliminating a person's ability to obtain or use\n> ammunition could thereby make it impossible to use firearms for their\n> core purpose\n\nreferring to [Heller](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf), and SCOTUS's finding that\n\n> the Second Amendment protects an individual\u2019s right to\n> possess firearms and that the city\u2019s total ban on handguns, as\n> well as its requirement that firearms in the home be kept\n> nonfunctional even when necessary for self\\-defense, violated that right.\n\nThe Jackson court\n\n> conclude\\[s] that prohibitions on the sale of ammunition do not fall\n> outside \u201cthe historical understanding of the scope of the \\[Second\n> Amendment] right.\u201d\n\nThe reasoning that brings ammunition within the scope of Second Amendment protection applies equally well to e.g. ammo cases, gun oil, cleaning brushes, and instruction manuals, all of which are necessary to the lawful exercise of one's Second Amendment rights.

Instruction manuals directly contribute to this proficiency.\n\nOption D (Fashion magazines featuring firearms) is the least likely to be protected under the Second Amendment. While it might be protected under the First Amendment as free speech, it doesn't directly contribute to the ability to keep and bear arms or maintain proficiency with firearms.\n\nThe correct answer is D because, unlike the other options, fashion magazines aren't necessary for the core purpose of firearms use or maintenance of proficiency, which are the key factors courts have used to extend Second Amendment protections beyond just the firearms themselves."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9196/partners-logos-legal-obligation", "docs_id": 9196, "title": "Partners logos - legal obligation", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am using services such as AWS and MS Azure to host websites for my clients.

Indeed, generally speaking, you can't bring a federal sex discrimination lawsuit against a private company without first presenting it to the EEOC.\n\nBut, to the extent that the conduct doesn't exclusively involve employees or prospective employees, the EEOC would not be involved in those matters, and the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and private attorneys for the victims might have concurrent jurisdiction to bring civil claims.\n\n> Can federal prosecutors investigate a pattern of sexual harassment\n>  inside a company\n\nWhen the EEOC gets a complaint, it can expand the scope of its case beyond the person bringing the complaint. Saying \"federal prosecutors\" in this context is somewhat misleading, however, since that term is usually reserved for federal government lawyers who bring criminal cases, rather than civil sexual harassment charges.\n\nI don't recall whether the EEOC brings civil cases discrimination cases that goes to trial with its own lawyers (I think that this is usually the case) or with Justice Department lawyers. Both, in any case, are federal government lawyers, and in neither case would this be a criminal prosecution. \n\nThe EEOC can choose not to bring the claim, in which case a private attorney for the victim can bring it.\n\nSexual harassment, in a narrow sense, is not a state or federal crime, *per se*, although often sexual harassment involves conduct which is a state and/or federal crime. Usually, state law has a crime for unwanted sexual contact, a crime for unwanted sexual intercourse, a crime for extortion, and a crime for coerced prostitution, to name a few. I won't attempt to enumerate the potentially relevant federal crimes which usually must have some form of \"federal\" hook (e.g. transporting someone across state lines for purposes of sexual activity, or raping a federal employee).\n\nState crimes can be prosecuted by the state prosecutor (often both a county or district attorney and a state attorney general with concurrent jurisdiction, but sometimes integrated into a single agency with local branches in others like Florida). \n\nFederal crimes can be prosecuted by a federal prosecutor, usually a U.S. Attorney's office for a U.S. District Court District (which is part of the Justice Department), but sometimes federal crimes are prosecuted by lawyers assigned to a particular national level sub\\-division of the Justice Department (e.g. the Civil Rights Division). Private parties cannot prosecute crimes as a general rule (with some exceptions in a handful of cases in a few states most in the East).\n\nIt wouldn't be unheard of to have one set of federal government lawyers press a civil EEOC claim for sexual harassment, while a separate team of federal government lawyers press criminal charges related to the same conduct, with the separate teams of lawyers coordinating with each other to some extent. \n\nIt would be exceedingly rare to have the same lawyers handling both civil and criminal charges at the same time in a sexual harassment fact pattern. There would almost always be different lawyers handling civil cases and criminal cases in the federal government.\n\n> Can the acts of executives and assistants who aided Weinstein be\n>  viewed as solicitation?\n\nIndividuals who personally participate in some manner in the civil tort of sexual harassment or the crimes charges could have civil or criminal liability respectively in most circumstances.\n\nUPDATE: The FBI is basically investigating this kind of thing right now per Fox News. But, the FBI is an investigative/law enforcement agency, rather than attorneys prosecuting a case (even though a large share of FBI agents have law degrees). Federal agencies have broader powers to *investigate* potential crimes or civil rights law violations than they do to prosecute claims. Investigation requires only probable cause to believe that there was wrong doing, or even a reasonable suspicion or less for many forms of investigation (like asking for voluntary testimony from witnesses without conducting any 4th Amendment searches), even if there is not more solid evidence of it at the outset. \n\nFederal agencies also often have statutory civil subpoena power to investigate if there have been violations of particular federal statutes that does not require a showing of probable cause and can be utilized prior to bringing a civil action or criminal charges against anyone.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a sexual harassment case involving a large company like Weinstein's, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding federal involvement and prosecution?\n\nA) Federal prosecutors can directly file criminal charges for sexual harassment without any involvement from the EEOC.\n\nB) The EEOC can only investigate individual complaints and cannot expand the scope of its investigation beyond the person bringing the complaint.\n\nC) The FBI can investigate potential sexual harassment cases, even if there isn't solid evidence at the outset, based on reasonable suspicion.\n\nD) If the EEOC decides not to pursue a case, the victim has no recourse to file a federal lawsuit.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because the documentation states that federal agencies like the FBI have broader powers to investigate potential crimes or civil rights law violations, even with just reasonable suspicion and without solid evidence at the outset. \n\nOption A is incorrect because sexual harassment itself is not typically a federal crime, and the EEOC generally handles civil claims related to workplace sexual harassment.\n\nOption B is false because the documentation explicitly states that when the EEOC gets a complaint, it can expand the scope of its case beyond the person bringing the complaint.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation mentions that if the EEOC chooses not to bring a claim, a private attorney for the victim can still bring it.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the roles of different federal agencies in sexual harassment cases, the scope of their investigative powers, and the options available to victims."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28516/mistake-in-our-lease", "docs_id": 28516, "title": "Mistake in our lease", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We entered into a 2 year lease agreement in July 2016\\.

As stated in the documentation, anyone can sue anyone else, and lawsuits often aim for settlements rather than court victories. The property owner can indeed be personally sued along with the LLC and the management company. However, if the case were to go to court, the LLC structure would likely protect the owner from personal liability, as explained by the Nolo.com quote. The key point is that being sued and being held liable are two different things, and the legal process often involves strategic decisions that go beyond the theoretical protections of an LLC."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7209/use-of-encryption-and-storage-of-personal-information-on-website-based-in-india", "docs_id": 7209, "title": "Use of encryption and storage of personal information on website based in India", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to launch a website that stores users' personal information, encrypts user passwords, and uses SSL for secure transmission.

Though I would be careful to differentiate \"inter\\-state\" litigation from \"stave vs. state\" litigation. These disputes did happen regularly over the years yes, but with differing success as the strength of the Federal Government and Supreme Court increased\\*. In general state v. state cases are not too common, and generally deal with issues such as land and border disputes or questions.\n\n\\*(See as a partial reference this video where when NJ sued NY over a land dispute, NY effectively ignored the Court/ the Court didn't hear the case in 1832\\. Whereas in the 1990s NY did not ignore it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=SgZ1f4ACZBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZ1f4ACZBQ))\n\nFor background the relevant provisions of the Constitution and statute are as follow:\nU.S. Const. Article III: Sec 2:\n\n> In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and\n> consuls, and those in which a **state shall be party**, the Supreme Court\n> shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before\n> mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both\n> as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations\n> as the Congress shall make. <https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii>\n\n28 USC Sec. 1251\n\n> **(a)The Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of\n> all controversies between two or more States.**\n> \n> \n> (b)The Supreme Court shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of:\n> (1\\)All actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, \\> consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties;\n> (2\\)All controversies between the United States and a State;\n> (3\\)All actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens. <https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1251>\n\nFor a recent/ current state v. state case see Mississippi v. Tennessee: [https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22o143\\.html](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22o143.html) concerning territorial matters/ water rights.\n\n> Is it therefore at least in theory possible for two states to have\n> contrary laws and scotus be forced to make a value judgment contrary\n> to state law to resolve some dispute?\n\nGenerally no, unless the state law is impermissible under the United States Constitution or otherwise preempted by federal law for example. But the Supreme Court wouldn't really rule on \"contrary\" state laws, most cases are concerning federal laws or land matters. Also, unless there is a matter of Federal Law (\"federal question\") or the state v state controversy under Article III the Supreme Court doesn't have jurisdiction to rule on state matters (again unless a \"federal question\" is involved).\n\n> Can scotus decide not to hear inter\\-state litigation in the same way\n> it often does with constitutional matters or are they forced to\n> mediate because there is no other way to settle such matters?\n\nYes, they can choose not to hear state vs. state cases. Rule 17 of the Supreme Court Rules regards \"Procedure in Original Action\" <https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/rule_17> in which the Court \"Court thereafter may grant or deny the motion, set it for oral argument, direct that additional documents be filed, or require that other proceedings be conducted.\"\n\nThough, and I will note for completeness in answering your question, some current Justices believe it is not discretionary.

Standard procedure is for the prosecutor, police and medical examiner to work together to investigate crimes and prosecute criminals.\n3. **Does a District Attorney (when not the Coroner) have the means and/or authority to conduct an independent and contrary investigation?** Yes. But it's unusual. See answer to number 2\\.\n4. **Or do any other offices have the right to investigate a death to look for evidence of homicide in opposition to a verdict of the Coroner?** Same answer as \\#2 and \\#3\\.\n\n---\n\nExplanation\n-----------\n\n### They work together on the same team\n\nThe medical examiner is a state employee and usually works on the side of law enforcement. If a medical examiner were to report a cause of death that did not support evidence of a crime, that information would have to be made available to any potential defendant. In the hands of any competent attorney that should be sufficient basis to create reasonable doubt and achieve an acquittal. I doubt many prosecutors would ever consider hiring an outside examiner in this case except under highly unusual circumstances like an internal investigation as mentioned above.\n\n### The defendant must create reasonable doubt\n\nIn the alternative scenario, when evidence of a crime is supported by the M.E. report, it would be up to the defendant to produce reasonable doubt by cross\\-examination or producing expert testimony that contradicts the M.E.'s conclusion. This might or might not include hiring an independent third party ***forensic pathologist*** as an ***expert witness***. [Dr. Cyril Wecht is a famous one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Wecht).\n\n### All opinions are subject to error, disagreement and cross\\-examination\n\nAll that said, the \"cause of death\" reported by the Coroner is just a medical opinion and is subject to error and disagreement like any other opinion. It's just that it's unlikely that disagreement would come from the side of law enforcement in most cases.\n\nFor further reading, [here is a link to the Coroner's Handbook](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/hb_me.pdf).

However, this is unusual in practice because typically, the prosecutor, police, and medical examiner work together as a team to investigate crimes and prosecute criminals. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Coroner's determination is not final and can be challenged.

The [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/about/overview) regulates interstate and international communications over TV, radio, satellite, cable, etc., throughout the US and its territories. \n\nAmong its duties and powers, it [prohibits](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/broadcasting-false-information) the broadcast of false info regarding a crime or catastrophe if the broadcaster \"knows the information is false and will cause substantial 'public harm' if aired.\" FCC rules indicate that the harm \"must begin immediately and cause direct and actual damage to property or the health or safety of the general public; or divert law enforcement or public health and safety authorities from their duties.\" \n\nAdditionally, while law prohibits the FCC from engaging in censorship or otherwise infringing on First Amendment rights of the press, it is nonetheless illegal for \"broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge.\" \n\nThe FCC may not interfere with how a broadcaster chooses to select or present news or commentary and its authority to respond to complaints regarding the above is [narrow in scope](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/complaints-about-broadcast-journalism). Generally, it cannot intervene without testimony from a person with \"direct personal knowledge of an intentional falsification of the news.\" \n\nThe FCC's authority for this may be found at [47 CFR \u00a7 73\\.1217](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/73.1217), which states: \n\n> \u00a7 73\\.1217 Broadcast hoaxes. \n>  No licensee or permittee of any broadcast\n>  station shall broadcast false information concerning a crime or a\n>  catastrophe if:\n> \n> \n> (a) The licensee knows this information is false;\n> \n> \n> (b) It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause\n>  substantial public harm, and\n> \n> \n> (c) Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause\n>  substantial public harm.\n> \n> \n> Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to\n>  pose foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the\n>  program as a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable\n>  under the circumstances.\n\nImportant context is included in the accompanying note, which states: \n\n> For purposes of this rule, \u201cpublic harm\u201d must begin immediately, and\n>  cause direct and actual damage to property or to the health or safety\n>  of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public\n>  health and safety authorities from their duties.

Of course, [fraudulently claiming to have licensure](http://abc3340.com/news/local/claimed-naturopathic-hoover-doctor-indicted-for-defrauding-cancer-patients) is also a crime over and above practicing without a license.\n\n[Administering non\\-FDA approved medicines to cancer patients](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2016/07/seen-worlds-naturopathic-one-terrifying.html), for example, is a federal crime, even if this is done with full disclosure and good intentions. The approval process is described [here](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/) by the Food and Drug Administration under the [Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act). (Similarly, a [conviction](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/port-angeles-naturopath-sentenced-prison-distributing-hormone-drug-weight-loss) was obtained in another case for distributing a hormonal weight\\-loss treatment without a license.)\n\nFor example, in 2006, a naturopath in Wheat Ridge, Colorado was [convicted](http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/naturopath-pleads-guilty-to-negligent-homicide) of \"theft, perjury, criminally negligent homicide, illegal practice of medicine and third\\-degree assault\" for providing alternative holistic treatment to someone resulting in their death.\n\n[Criminal negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_negligence) generally involves conduct sometimes also called \"gross negligence\" that is not just careless but is almost reckless given the serious potential harm that could foreseeable result (and in all cases that are prosecuted, actually did result) from the course of conduct taken. \n\nFor example, while ordinary medical mistakes by a medical doctor such as confusing two drugs with similar names or putting the decimal point in a prescription dosage, causing harm to a patient, would not ordinarily result in criminal liability, coming into an operating room while too drunk to drive and without reviewing which limb of a patient needs to be amputated despite a clear indication in marker on the leg of a patient showing that fact, might constitute criminal negligence on the part of a medical doctor. Here, if the need for and possible benefits of conventional treatment for breast cancer with particularly clear, prescribing alternative diet based treatment and mental exercises while discouraging conventional medical treatment, might very well constitute criminal negligence on the part of the holistic practitioner.\n\nSimilarly, a naturopath was [criminally charged](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/09/sydney-naturopath-arrested-after-baby-comes-close-to-death-on-treatment-plan) in Australia with \"reckless grievous bodily harm and failure to provide for a child causing danger of death\" for urging parents to discontinue medical treatments for a child in favor of a raw food diet, causing serious harm to that child almost causing the child's death. The naturopath admitted that she endangered the child with her medical advice and was [ultimately convicted in that case](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/naturopath-marilyn-bodnar-admits-raw-food-diet-advice-endangered-babys-life-20170825-gy42fk.html).\n\nLiability would be fact specific. Does the person have a license of some kind? Are they within the scope of their license? Do they falsely convey the impression that they are licensed medical practitioners? Did their actions constitute the practice of medicine?\n\nBut, often, in the fact pattern you describe, particularly if it is not \"faith healing\" protected by the freedom of religion, this would be a crime.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that a [self\\-help remedy of murdering the holistic practitioner](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/10/widower-slain-naturopath-said-chemotherapy-is-for-losers/) after the fact is legal.\n\nCivil liability for professional negligence and failing to meet the applicable standard of care for a person engaging in the kind of treatment conduct described is also possible. In other words, one can sue a naturopath of money damages for malpractice, just as one could sue a doctor for malpractice. As noted [here](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/cam-and-the-law-part-3-malpractice/):\n\n> Alternative medicine providers can, of course, be guilty of\n>  malpractice if they perform their interventions below the commonly\n>  accepted standards of their own communities.

By prescribing an ineffective treatment for a serious condition like cancer and discouraging conventional medical treatment, Dr. Green may have committed criminal negligence. This could lead to criminal charges such as practicing medicine without a license or criminally negligent homicide. Additionally, Dr. Green could face civil liability for malpractice, as alternative medicine providers can be sued for failing to meet the standard of care in their field or for discouraging patients from seeking necessary conventional care.

There must be some legal protection against people pooping in your bed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You should probably call the cops as this sounds like it could be assault, which covers a number of actions that would inflict or threaten bodily harm (typically if paired with Battery, then \"Battery\" is the infliction and Assault is the threat of action). Assault can be considered in cases such as spitting upon someone or unwanted exposure to bodily fluids... while what you described is neither of these things, I would say any judge and cop would be well within the spirit of the definition of \"unwanted exposure\" portion of some laws, though it's highly jurisdiction specific (and depending on where, it might be a case law since it's not something that happens every day).\n\nIf you have any evidence that it happened, be prepared to turn it over to the cops as well (I really hope you took pictures of this just for evidence documentation. If not, it's not all lost. Did you text him when you had your justified WTF? outrage at him? That works too. I have more ideas, but as I said, jurisdiction is important.).\n\nI would also look into filing for a restraining order in either case as the crime is probably not gonna keep him away for long. Again, you are accusing, so you need to show some evidence.\n\nYou should also notify your landlord in a way that will not alert him right away. Your landlord is ultimately going to have to deal with eviction stuff, not you.

I handed in the paper personally, because I still worked out there. I made sure to get some sort of confirmation in order to prove afterwards that the termination was handed in. I handed it in to one of the employees, which signed that he had received it and then copied it (one copy for me, one copy for the gym/boss). In the termination I wrote, that the gym owner (who is obviously the contract holder) should send me another confirmation of receiving the termination and telling me the actual termination date of the contract.\n\nSince then, I have not received any mail from the owner regarding this additional confirmation paper. I asked him about 1 week after turning in the termination if he got it, he said he got it. Another 2 weeks later I asked if he already sent the confirmation, he said he'll do it at the end of the month (for whatever reason). I wasn't really worried about that because we never had any disagreements or something. I just quit the membership because I'm moving soon. Today I asked again, and he said something along the lines \"oh, you did not get it? I'll send you one the next day\".\n\nSince he already said he'd send the confirmation weeks ago, without him actually doing so, I don't really trust him this time either. So my question now is: **Is the termination of the contract valid without me receiving (or him sending) the confirmation?** Or in other words maybe: Is the signiture of the employee under the termination enough for me to be sure I don't have to pay the next membership period (which is 6 months, starting in march).\n\nAll this takes place in Germany, may be relevent to the case because of local laws and stuff I guess.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you have done all that is required to terminate the contract then the fact they have not done what they are required to do is irrelevant \\- the contract has been validly terminated.\n\nHowever, are you sure you that hand delivery of a termination notice meets the requirements of the contract?

This means that a non binding agreement is made between multiple parties to abide by rules set forth in a documented standard.\n\nExamples of this include The USB Device Working Group, Jedec, The C\\+\\+ Standards Committee, and PCI\\-SIG.\n\nWhile presumably in the public's interest, these groups appear to be a fragrant violation of antitrust laws. Do they require a special license to operate?\n\nIf so, what would such a license look like and what agency would issue it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Standards\\-setting by industry groups is not inherently anti\\-competitive and these groups do not require a licence from the government to operate. They are a prototypical example of \"private ordering\" (see David J. Teece \\& Edward F. Sherry, \"Standards Setting and Antitrust\" (2003\\) [87 Minn. L.R. 1913](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217211884.pdf), p. 1987\\).\n\nWhat can be anti\\-competitive is when a corporation advocates for an element to be included in a standard for reasons other than technical considerations. See e.g. the International Standards Organization's \"[Competition Law Guidelines](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/competition_law_guidelines.pdf).\"\n\nAn example violation is [the behaviour of Rambus, Inc.](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2007/02/ftc-issues-final-opinion-order-rambus-matter):\n\n> According to the FTC complaint, Rambus nonetheless participated in JEDEC\u2019s DRAM standard\\-setting activities for more than four years without disclosing to JEDEC or its members that it was actively working to develop, and possessed, a patent and several pending patent applications that involved specific technologies ultimately adopted in the standards.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> In its liability opinion dated July 31, 2006, the Commission found that, \u201cRambus engaged in exclusionary conduct that significantly contributed to its acquisition of monopoly power in four related markets.\u201d\n\nIn [another example](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/speeches/antitrust-intellectual-property-law-adversaries-partners#a.%20Complaint%20allegations), Dell Computer Corporation was alleged to have\n\n> voted to approve the VL\\-bus standard and certified that the standard did not infringe its intellectual property.

By failing to disclose relevant patent applications during the standard-setting process and then attempting to enforce the patent after widespread adoption, TechInnovate's conduct is likely to be viewed as exclusionary and monopolistic. This behavior violates the principles of fair competition in standards-setting and could be considered a violation of antitrust laws. As seen in the Rambus and Dell cases, such actions can lead to regulatory intervention by bodies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), potentially resulting in orders prohibiting the company from enforcing its patents against standard implementers. The correct answer is C, as it accurately reflects the potential antitrust implications and regulatory consequences of TechInnovate's behavior."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86332/limits-of-navy-jurisdiction-authority-in-international-waters", "docs_id": 86332, "title": "Limits of navy jurisdiction/authority in international waters", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Once and then I read news about US navy stopping, searching and even sinking commercial vessels flowing non\\-US ensign (most recently Iranian).

However, a warship executing a war\\-like function against a non\\-complying vessel also has more leeway if a collision occurs.\n\nOf course, Article 95 of UNCLA gives a warship complete immunity other than in their home state for acts on the High Seas, so an Iranian merchant ship that wished to pursue damages would need to do so in the US Admiralty Courts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which of the following scenarios would NOT justify a warship boarding a foreign ship on the high seas?\n\nA) The warship suspects the foreign ship is engaged in piracy\nB) The warship suspects the foreign ship is transporting illegal drugs\nC) The warship suspects the foreign ship is engaged in the slave trade\nD) The warship suspects the foreign ship is without nationality\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Article 110 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a warship is justified in boarding a foreign ship on the high seas only under specific circumstances.

That would be a waste of energy, in part because \\-\\-as you rightly point out\\-\\- laws change. There are many introductory books. [Law 101, by Jay M. Feinman](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0190866322), is an excellent starting point.\n\nThe next step \\-\\-broadly speaking\\-\\- consists of reading court decisions (aka court opinions). Opinions released by upper (aka reviewing) courts are available online for free. If you are interested in jurisdictions in the US, [Leagle.com](http://www.leagle.com/leaglesearch) is one of many very good resources; EU cases are available [here](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/recherche.jsf?oqp=&for=&mat=or&lgrec=en&jge=&td=%3BALL&jur=C%2CT%2CF&dates=&pcs=Oor&lg=&parties=&pro=&nat=or&cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&language=en&avg=); and so forth.\n\nAcquainting yourself with court opinions is quite beneficial. First, court opinions \\[collaterally] teach how to formulate one's legal positions. Rather than merely being formulaic and a copycat, a litigant is to convey that his legal position is more consistent (compared to the adversary) with the laws and underlying doctrines. His points are easier to get across by adapting his presentation thereof to how courts are used to handle the legal principles involved.\n\nSecond, court opinions identify the statutes that are relevant to the type of disputes that arise between parties. This is indicative of importance that a statute or procedural rule entails in relation to other laws.\n\nThird, court opinions reflect how statutes, rules, and doctrines are interpreted. Oftentimes the way how legislation is worded leads \"laypeople\" to have misconceptions on the interpretation of laws and rules, when in reality these are construed usually in a much narrower way.\n\nLaw journals are a good source once you have gained some background in law and are interested in a sort of monograph about a topic that is new to you. But, as explained above, court opinions also serve that purpose (perhaps less *scholarly*).\n\nHaving a legal dictionary is always a good idea. Courts in the US oftentimes quote definitions from [Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) for crucial terms which statutory law does not define.\n\n> What is most applicable to real life?\n\nWithout knowing whether you are interested in a particular field, it is safe to say that contract law is the most applicable.\n\nEntering contracts is part of our everyday life even if laypeople don't notice it when they purchase goods \\& services, reach an agreement, or engage in a course of conduct which reasonably fosters expectations. And good news is that the principles of contract law are largely similar among modern jurisdictions, including the America (the continent, not just the USA), many member states of the EU, and Asian countries.\n\nThe [Restatement (Second) of Contracts](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/restatement-second-contracts.html) is a very useful formulation of contract law. Courts in the US very often cite the *Restatement* for premising their decisions on contract disputes. In countries with a *civil law* system, the principles of contract law are usually formulated in one or multiple sections of the \\[countries'] Civil Code.\n\nProcedural law (aka rules of criminal or civil procedure) is also highly applicable: Large portions thereof apply to all disputes which are brought to court. To a great extent these rules are very similar across the jurisdictions of one same country, but the litigant ought too ensure his compliance with the rules lest he loses the case for a technicality.

The [most recent decree in Washington State](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-49%20-%20COVID-19%20Garnishment.pdf) suspends garnishments and post\\-judgment interest. The governor was given broad powers by the legislature ([RCW 43\\.06\\.220](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.06.220)) to suspend laws in case of an emergency. If a state has no such powers (every state does) or if a particular action is not within the scope of the governor's emergency powers, then no. Otherwise yes. The governor of Washington has the emergency power to limit assembly, anything to do with flammables, sale of anything related to preservation of life, health and peace, and \"other activities as he or she reasonably believes should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace\". He also can suspend government enforcement actions, such as garnishment and post\\-judgment interest (and court proceedings resulting in judgments), an suspects statutory / regulatory restrictions on actions (could suspend the sales tax). He cannot, however, single\\-handedly write new laws. There is no existing provision that would allow cancellation of interest obligations, although the legislature has the power to restrict interest in various ways (such as the usury statutes). So without a new power being passed by the legislature, the answer is Washington is \"no\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of emergency powers during a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, which of the following actions would the Governor of Washington State likely NOT have the authority to implement without new legislation?\n\nA) Suspend garnishments on wages\nB) Halt post-judgment interest accrual\nC) Prohibit public gatherings and assemblies\nD) Cancel all mortgage and rent payment obligations\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because the governor has the power to suspend government enforcement actions, including garnishments, under emergency powers.\n\nB) is incorrect as the governor can suspend post-judgment interest accrual, as demonstrated by the recent decree mentioned in the passage.\n\nC) is incorrect because the governor has explicit emergency powers to limit assembly to help preserve public health and safety.\n\nD) is correct because the governor cannot unilaterally create new laws or cancel existing contractual obligations like mortgage or rent payments.
