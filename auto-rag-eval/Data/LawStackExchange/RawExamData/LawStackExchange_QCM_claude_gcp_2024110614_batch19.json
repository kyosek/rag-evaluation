I mean the customer sign a contract.\n\nTechnically, every time I offer people to download an e\\-book, for example, I can put terms that people agree to be my slave somewhere on the contract or pay me $1 million dollar. Not that it'll be enforceable in court, or is it?\n\nTechnically insurance agents can say that the whole money is invested. Somewhere deep in the contract there could be a term saying that there is a fee of 100% of all money put, for example. The last one is pretty real and happen a lot.\n\nAnother sample could be Trump's university. Most of people there is unhappy with the money.\n\nSo it's not technically a fraud. It's legal. Just like time share sells.\n\nBut it's not normal win win trade either. \n\nSo what is it?\n\nScam?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are three answers here.\n\nFirst, as is common on this site, you are using the term, \"legal\" and \"illegal.\" Those are not legally meaningfully terms. A good lawyer won't use those terms to mean allowed or disallowed. We talk in terms of potential civil or criminal liability, or other sanctions and consequences. To say that something is \"legal\" does not communicate much.\n\nSecond, all contracts are governed by a duty of good faith. That means that you cannot try to \"trick\" someone with the terms of the contract and expect to enforce that contract against them and you cannot try to skirt your obligations by finding a tricky form of compliance not within the mutual understanding of the agreement. As with all things, defining good faith is not easy, and depends on the specific context of a situation. It is worth distinguishing between the duty of good faith, and the duties one owes to a fiduciary; good faith is surely far less, but nevertheless still meaningful.\n\nThird, a defense to non\\-performance of a contract is that the agreement as written is unconscionable. A contract that is a grossly unfair deal where the contract was not actively negotiated (i.e. Blindly signing a bad form contract), may fall under this category.\n\nNote: I am not your lawyer; this is not legal advice; contact a licensed attorney in your area; do not rely on my statements; I merely am providing a general answer that is academic in nature.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A startup company is offering a revolutionary new app that promises to double users' investment within a month. The terms of service, which users must accept to use the app, contain a clause stating that the company is not liable for any losses and that users agree to pay a \"success fee\" of 90% of any gains. Many users are disappointed with their results after using the app. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The company's actions are entirely legal because users agreed to the terms of service\nB) This is a clear case of fraud and the company will face criminal charges\nC) The contract may be unenforceable due to unconscionability, despite user agreement\nD) The company is protected from liability as long as they disclose all fees upfront\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of contract law, good faith, and unconscionability as described in the documentation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"all contracts are governed by a duty of good faith,\" which means that trying to trick someone with contract terms is not enforceable.\n\n2. The concept of unconscionability is explicitly mentioned: \"A defense to non-performance of a contract is that the agreement as written is unconscionable.\" This applies to \"grossly unfair deal[s] where the contract was not actively negotiated.\"\n\n3. The scenario presents a situation where users are likely not actively negotiating the terms (similar to \"blindly signing a bad form contract\") and the terms are extremely unfavorable to users (90% \"success fee\" and no liability for losses).\n\n4. While users did agree to the terms (option A), this doesn't automatically make the contract enforceable due to the principles of good faith and unconscionability.\n\n5. It's not necessarily fraud (option B) if the terms are disclosed, even if hidden, but it may still be unenforceable.\n\n6. Simply disclosing fees (option D) doesn't protect from all liability, especially if the overall deal is unconscionable.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario, integrating multiple ideas from the documentation, and goes beyond simple memorization to test critical thinking about contract law and consumer protection."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14598/faking-your-own-death-for-taunting-purposes", "docs_id": 14598, "title": "Faking your own death for taunting purposes", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose you cause it to be falsely reported that you have died, and your purpose is only to see your enemies gloating over your demise at your funeral and then being disappointed to learn that you are alive.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. While filing a false death certificate would be a felony (option A), the question doesn't specify that the prankster went this far, stating only that they caused it to be \"falsely reported\" that they died.\n\n2.

It's often repeated as some kind of dogma, I've never seen explanations for it.\n\nSo, what are the exact advantages of suing someone without warning? I doubt it's the effect of surprise, and they will have plenty of time to consult their own lawyers before anything crucial happens.\n\nThat the following example: Alice wants to sue Bob, because he caused her some damages. The damages are high enough that she wants to be made whole, but not as high that a lawsuit would be surely expected. Let's also assume that both know that Alice will have very good chances of winning if it comes to a trial. At first Alice asks him nicely to be repaid (without mentioning a lawsuit), and Bob refuses because he thinks that Alice won't bother suing over such a thing. At this moment Alice could say that if he doesn't repay the damages she will sue. Bob would then have an incentive to pay, as he now knows that Alice is likely to sue and if it comes to that, he will likely lose much more (legal fees, time, etc.) So it would be optimal for both of them if Alice tells Bob that she will sue, as both of them would be saving time and money if he just paid her without going to court.\n\nSo, in the above situation, why should Alice just sue Bob without first threatening/warning/telling him?

The best, most efficient, most effective and cheapest way to resolve a dispute is to negotiate a settlement. The best, most efficient and quickest way to derail a negotiation is to make threats.\n\nPeople don't like being threatened. It makes them upset and angry. People who are upset and angry like to make the person who made them upset and angry upset and angry in return. This rapidly leads to an escalation of tensions often to the point that the thing (a lawsuit) that was previously only one option out of many is now the only option.\n\nSo instead of resolving the dispute cheaply, quickly and under the control of the parties to the dispute, it gets resolved expensively, slowly and by someone who doesn't give a rat's arse about the parties.\n\nLawyers can't make empty threats\n--------------------------------\n\nLawers have an ethical duty not to make threats they don't intend to follow through on.

The key elements to consider are:\n\n1. The statute applies to both resident and nonresident operators (subsection A).\n2. The \"reduced\" $50 penalty applies when evidence of current registration is presented (subsection B).\n3. The court cannot dismiss the action \"merely\" because the defendant obtained proper registration after the violation (subsection C).\n4. The court has some discretion in imposing penalties, especially for non-owner operators (subsection C).\n\nIn this scenario, the driver doesn't have current registration at the time of the citation, so they don't qualify for automatic dismissal. The \"merely\" clause in subsection C suggests that while obtaining registration after the fact isn't sufficient grounds for dismissal, the court may consider other factors.\n\nThe driver's efforts to renew and the delay caused by another state's DMV are mitigating circumstances the court could consider. However, the statute's language, particularly in subsection B, implies that some penalty should still apply even when there's evidence of attempting to register.\n\nTherefore, the most likely interpretation is that the court would consider the circumstances but would still be bound by the statute to apply at least the minimum $50 penalty. This balances the strict liability aspect of the law with the court's limited discretion to consider extenuating circumstances.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the statute, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the nuances of judicial interpretation and discretion within the bounds of the law."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/829/does-texas-have-a-legal-right-to-leave-the-union-or-secede", "docs_id": 829, "title": "Does Texas have a legal right to leave the Union or secede?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many people, possibly even including recent Texas governors, think that Texas has a right to secede from the Union.\n\nDoes it, or does it not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The U.

The reason I am asking is that I was recently asked to help with an IT project which would require incorporating this data that is now in the hands of multiple people. \n\nWould I be putting myself at any risk to provide tools to work with this data (intellectual property) that belonged to the bankrupt company?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on your description, it may not be property. Let us say that the IP in question is acoustic readings from sending sound waves into the ground (revealing huge oil reserves). I also assume that you are certain that this IP fell through the cracks and there was no official transfer. That table of data could be subject to copyright restrictions, so that people could not legally copy the table, but they could still make use of the data. Copyright protects the mode of expression, not the underlying facts (which would include the measurements). See [this standard characterization](http://www.lib.umich.edu/copyright/facts-and-data) of the non\\-protected status of data, and [this testimony before Congress](http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat092303.html) for broad discussion of copyright law as applied to databases. Data is not protected, databases are.\n\nCopyright is not extinguished with bankruptcy, and probably should have been sold off with other assets. The owner of the company would not necessarily have owned the copyright, unless s/he created the database (if it is a database). It would be perfectly normal for the creator to be required to transfer copyright to the company, assuming that this was a work for hire. But then the copyright would be owned by the company, not the owner of the company.\n\nAnother possibility is that the data is protected by a non\\-disclosure agreement. Assuming you signed some such NDA which forbids you from in any way disclosing this data, I would then say that you really do need to ask an attorney how to deal with this situation. The essential question is who acquired the contract that you signed, and whether they will go after you for breach of the NDA. Providing a tool to use such data may be prohibited by the contract, and if it is that valuable, [whoever assumed the contract](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-happens-leases-contracts-chapter-7-bankruptcy.html) could have a leg to stand on in preventing you from working on this project, even though others not covered by that NDA would be free to.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer previously employed by a now-bankrupt company is asked to create a tool that utilizes proprietary industry data collected by their former employer.

The highest risk scenario is B because:\n\n1. NDAs can survive bankruptcy and company closure. As stated in the documentation, \"Assuming you signed some such NDA which forbids you from in any way disclosing this data, I would then say that you really do need to ask an attorney how to deal with this situation.\"\n\n2. The documentation emphasizes that the essential question is \"who acquired the contract that you signed, and whether they will go after you for breach of the NDA.\"\n\n3.

Option C is a lower risk because factual data itself isn't copyright protected, but the NDA could still apply. Option D presents some risk, but not as high as a specific NDA, as copyrights and contracts can still be transferred even if not explicitly mentioned in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking about the interplay between bankruptcy, intellectual property, and contractual obligations."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7409/i-hit-my-head-leaving-a-large-commercial-building-and-the-security-guards-asked", "docs_id": 7409, "title": "I hit my head leaving a large commercial building and the security guards asked for my ID, phone number, and email - why?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Today I was leaving a large commercial building (\\~15 stories) and walked straight into the glass surrounding a revolving door, thinking that the opening was not so narrow. \n\nI went to the security desk and asked to use the bathroom to clean myself up.

This conclusion is drawn from several key aspects of the scenario:\n\n1. Documentation of incident: By taking down the visitor's contact information and details about the injury, the building management is creating a contemporaneous record of the event. This is crucial for defending against potential future claims.\n\n2. Immediate response: Providing first aid and allowing the visitor to clean up demonstrates that the building took reasonable care of the injured party, which could help mitigate claims of negligence.\n\n3. Limited information gathering: The security staff collected basic contact information and identification, which is consistent with creating a record rather than initiating an insurance claim or complying with specific reporting requirements.\n\n4. No mention of follow-up: There's no indication that the building intends to contact the visitor for a wellness check or any other purpose.\n\n5. Legal implications: As suggested in the top answer, this action protects the building if the visitor later tries to sue, claiming more severe injuries.

Does that invalidate the patent?\n\n**Example**\n\nFor example, suppose that Sharp Co. develops a process of making steel for knives that is superior in some way (e.g., it makes it much cheaper and quicker to manufacture the knives than an alternative status quo process that produces exactly the same end result), by incorporating flax oil into the process of forging its knives. It is impossible to discern that the flax process was used by physically inspecting a knife made with it after the fact.\n\nAssume that this patent easily qualifies as valid by every relevant legal test evaluated as of 2012\\-2014 and under all changes to patent law since then that do not pertain to prior art. This process was something that no published work available to living people was aware of at the time that Sharp Co. applied for its patent in 2012, and the patent was issued in 2014\\.\n\nIn time, Sharp Co. discovers that Dull Co., a company next door to it, is using the same flax oil process to forge its knives and brings suit in 2022 for patent infringement, having copied the Sharp Co. process from its patent application, and Dull Co. gains 50% of the market share of knives made with this process costing Sharp Co. US $50 million a year in lost profits.\n\nBut after filing an answer in the patent infringement lawsuit in U.S. District Court, the patent infringement defense lawyer for Dull Co. who reads archaeology and linguistics texts in his spare time happens to learn that in 2016, archaeologists discovered an inscription in Old Persian from 1100 BCE in a newly unearthed tomb and translated it and published their findings in the journal *Nature*, describing precisely the same lost art of using flax oil to forge knives that Sharp Co. reinvented independently in 2012 and for which it secured its patent. No one affiliated of Sharp Co. learned about the newly discovered Old Persian texts until after they brought their infringement lawsuit and the lawyer for Dull Co. brought it to their attention. Dull Co.'s lawyer had raised the defense of invalidity based upon prior art in the answer that Dull Co. filed even though he didn't know about this particular prior art at the time.\n\nEvidence from the ancient Old Persian text and some related authentic texts written by Old Persian priests from a few centuries later indicates that there were hundreds of copies of the description of this process which were included in every prayer book of the predominant religion of the region now called Iran in 1100 BCE that was freely available in each of hundreds of temples in the region to anyone interested, but it was not preserved by later scribes who decided that it was considered an obvious piece of knowledge among metal workers that wasn't worth recopying at some point in the early Iron Age, even though they were wrong and the process was later entirely forgotten.\n\n**Question**\n\nDoes the previously lost prior art, that is rediscovered before the patent of the lost prior art process expires, provide Dull Co. with a meritorious prior art invalidity defense to the validity of Sharp Co.'s patent infringement lawsuit against Dull Co.?\n\nI can imagine this question functionally hinging on when prior art has to exist, and I could also imagine it hinging on the definition of what has to happen for something to constitute prior art. But, I'm not really sure exactly what the proper analysis would be.\n\n**Differences from prior similar questions**\n\nThis differs from the similar question \"[What impact does prior art discovered after (US) patent awarding have on enforceability and even validity of that patent?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15542/what-impact-does-prior-art-discovered-after-us-patent-awarding-have-on-enforce)\", because in this question, by design, there was nothing that would have operationally counted as prior art available at the time the patent was applied for and at the time that it was issued, while that question implicitly assumes that the only reason that prior art wasn't discovered was due to an inadequate prior art search when the patent was issued, and that a sufficiently thorough search for prior art at the time the patent was applied for and issued could have possibly found it.\n\nThis also differs from the fact pattern where someone already uses the patented process in a secret manner protected as a trade secret that is not disclosed until after the patent is issued, because, as I understand it, to be prior art, something must be knowable to people in the general public at some prior time (usually in a publication that is not confidential).\n\nThe example is loosely inspired by Rahil Alipour, Thilo Rehren, Marcos Martin\u00f3n\\-Torres. **\"Chromium crucible steel was first made in Persia.\"** Journal of Archaeological Science (2020\\); 105224 DOI: 10\\.1016/j.jas.2020\\.105224 (recounting their discovery that there was widespread manufacturing of chromium steel in Southern Persia around 1000 CE, a metallurgy technique that was subsequently lost and then only rediscovered about nine centuries later).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The patent is invalid\n---------------------\n\nFrom [35 U.S.C. 102](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/102)\n\n> A person shall be entitled to a patent unless \u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) the invention was known or used by others in this country, or patented or described in a printed publication in this or a foreign country, before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent\n\nThere is no doubt that the Persion \"printed publication\" in c.1100 BCE predates the invention of the technique by Sharp Co. in 2012 CE.

Given this scenario, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications for Quantum Co.'s patent?\n\nA) The patent remains valid because the prior art was not publicly available when Quantum Co. filed their application.\nB) The patent is invalidated, but Quantum Co. can still sue for infringement that occurred before the declassification.\nC) The patent is invalidated, and Quantum Co. has no legal recourse for any past or future infringement.\nD) The patent remains partially valid, protecting only the specific implementations not described in the 1985 document.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of prior art in patent law, particularly when previously unknown prior art is discovered after a patent has been granted. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. According to 35 U.S.C. 102, a person is entitled to a patent unless the invention was \"described in a printed publication\" before the invention by the applicant. The 1985 government document, despite being classified, counts as a \"printed publication\" for patent purposes.\n\n2. The fact that the document was declassified after the patent was granted doesn't change its status as prior art. Prior art is evaluated based on its existence, not its public availability at the time of the patent application.\n\n3. When prior art is discovered that predates the patent, it invalidates the patent entirely, not just from the point of discovery. This is because the patent should never have been granted in the first place, as the invention was not truly novel.\n\n4. Unlike copyright law, there's no concept of \"independent creation\" in patent law. It doesn't matter that Quantum Co. independently developed the algorithm without knowledge of the prior art.\n\n5. Once a patent is invalidated due to prior art, the patent holder loses all rights to sue for infringement, even for infringement that occurred before the invalidating prior art was discovered.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about the implications of discovering prior art after a patent has been granted.

The Wikipedia article suggests the concept of \"dominion\" is defined in the Statute of Westminster, but that statute did not exist until the 1930s, so it could not have governed whatever it was that happened in 1907\\.\n\nWhat is the difference between the status of Newfoundland before 1907 and the status after 1907?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *I'll be referencing the* \"Minutes of proceedings of the Colonial Conference, 1907\" *throughout ([600\\+ pg. PDF](https://archive.org/download/minutesofproceed00colo/minutesofproceed00colo_bw.pdf)). The page numbers refer to the ones printed on the page instead of any software page number.*\n\nIt seems that @owjburnham's comment is essentially correct, it is mainly a shift in terminology. It came from a desire to further distinguish self\\-governing from non\\-self\\-governing colonies (or \"Crown Colonies\" as the official term seems to have been). As such, \"Dominion\" came to be (re)defined as \"self\\-governing colony.\"\n\n---\n\nDuring the 1907 Colonial Conference, Prime Minister [Sir Joseph Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ward) of New Zealand opined the following \\[pg. 30\\-31]:\n\n> I think the term \"Colony,\" so far as our countries are concerned, ought to cease, and that that term ought to apply to the Crown Colonies purely, and that those of us who are not at present known as Dominions or Commonwealths, should be known as States of the Empire, or some other expressive word, so as to make a distinction as between the Crown Colonies and the self\\-governing\n>  Dependencies.\n\nHe also stated the following \\[pg. 48]:\n\n> I assume that in this resolution New Zealand, now known by the term \"Colony,\" will be included in the expression \"Dominion,\" which I think it ought to be.\n\nAwkwardly, this was right at the end of the day and no one reacted to this statement as the conference adjourned.\n\n---\n\nAs the participants were deciding upon the structure and participants of subsequent conferences, there is a lengthy discussion of the exact term to be used to refer to the self\\-governing colonies \\[pg. 78\\-90]. Near its conclusion, the chairman states the following \\[pg. 89]: \n\n> We agreed \\[...] that instead of the word \"Colonies\" we should use the word \"Dominions;\" but is it sufficiently defined if we use the word \"Dominions\" alone throughout? \\[...] I would suggest that we might take what is really the official term \"the Dominions beyond the seas\" in the first place where it occurs \\[...] and any other reference to it in the course of the Resolution might very well be \"Dominions.\" That would make it absolutely clear what we mean by the expression in the first place.\n\nThus, the conference opted for an implicit rather than explicit definition of \"Dominion\". The designation of Newfoundland as a Dominion in 1907 is just a reconciliation of the fact it was a self\\-governing colony and the new understanding that the word \"Dominion\" was to mean roughly that. There was no effective change of status. An explicit definition of \"Dominion\" would not come until the [Balfour Declaration of 1926](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration_of_1926).\n\nIronically, Newfoundland played no role in deciding the term to be used for itself as [its Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bond) only arrived on Day 4 of the conference \\[pg. 87].", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about Newfoundland's status change in 1907, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the 1907 Colonial Conference, which of the following best explains the practical implications of Newfoundland's transition from a \"self-governing colony\" to a \"dominion\"?\n\nA) Newfoundland gained the ability to conduct its own foreign policy independently of Britain\nB) The change primarily reflected a shift in terminology rather than a significant alteration in constitutional status\nC) Newfoundland's laws could no longer be altered by the British Parliament without local consent\nD) The transition granted Newfoundland representation in subsequent Imperial Conferences\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question requires analyzing the historical context and integrating multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation emphasizes that the change was mainly terminological. The 1907 Colonial Conference participants sought to distinguish self-governing colonies from Crown Colonies, leading to the redefinition of \"Dominion\" as essentially meaning \"self-governing colony.\"\n\n2. There's no evidence in the provided information that Newfoundland gained new powers in foreign policy (ruling out A) or constitutional independence from British Parliament (ruling out C) as a result of this change.\n\n3. While D might seem plausible, the documentation doesn't suggest that Newfoundland's participation in future conferences was contingent on this status change. In fact, Newfoundland's Prime Minister was absent for most of the 1907 conference where this terminology shift was discussed.\n\n4. The answer requires understanding that despite the grand-sounding change from \"colony\" to \"dominion,\" there was \"no effective change of status\" for Newfoundland. This tests the ability to look beyond superficial changes and analyze the actual impact of historical developments.\n\n5.

The conclusion of the majority opinion by Justice Scalia states that (some citations and footnotes omitted):\n\n> We conclude, therefore, that respondent did not, for purposes of the\n> Due Process Clause, have a property interest in police enforcement of\n> the restraining order against her husband.

So, you can't bring a federal civil rights action to enforce a deprivation of that right.\n\nThe situation is even worse under state law, where police have absolute immunity from liability for all tort claims (i.e. roughly speaking, lawsuits to enforce rights other than contractual rights), unless it comes within a specific exception (of which are there are several) for cases of ordinary negligence such as car accidents when just driving around and not having emergency lights illuminated, or failing to clear ice from a sidewalk on police department property.\n\nTheir boss may not take kindly to their indifference, but that is a purely discretionary issue for their boss in the context of an employer\\-employee relationship (often further limited by civil service protections for public employees and/or protections as members of a law enforcement union).\n\nThe primary exception, not applicable in the example in the question, is that law enforcement officers have certain obligations to protect people who are in law enforcement custody from harm. This obligation is stronger prior to a criminal conviction, and is weaker after someone has been convicted of a crime and is serving a sentence of incarceration for that crime.\n\nIf you brought a lawsuit of the type described in the question, you would probably lose the case on a motion to dismiss filed swiftly after you filed your lawsuit, and there is a very good chance that you would be compelled to pay the legal fees of the people whom you sued.\n\n**Comparative Law Footnote**\n\nIncidentally, while this rule of law is widely shared in countries with \"common law\" legal systems derived from English law, it is not the case with nearly the same degree of clarity in \"civil law\" legal systems based upon the civil codes found in Continental Europe such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy. Almost all countries in Latin America, most countries that are not former British colonies in Africa, and most countries in East Asia and Southeast Asia, are civil law countries.\n\nIn civil law countries there generally are both statutory obligations and human rights law obligations for which the government or government officials can have liability for willfully refusing to enforce criminal laws.

[FCC regulations](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-04-29/pdf/2013-08528.pdf) allow operation of interfering equipment (for tests and experiment) provided the interference is fully contained in a Faraday cage.

They plan to construct a Faraday cage within their office building to block all external radio and cellular signals. The CEO wants to install a cell phone jammer inside this room to ensure absolute privacy. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this plan?\n\nA) It's legal as long as the jammer's effects are confined to the Faraday cage\nB) It's illegal because cell phone jamming is prohibited on all private property\nC) It's legal only if they obtain explicit permission from the FCC\nD) It's illegal despite the Faraday cage due to potential interference with emergency communications\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the provided information to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is A, based on the FCC regulations mentioned in the documentation. These regulations allow the operation of interfering equipment for tests and experiments, provided the interference is fully contained within a Faraday cage. The key point is that the jammer's effects must be completely confined to the cage, which is the case in this scenario.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that jamming can be legal if confined to a Faraday cage on private property. Option C is a distractor that might seem plausible, but the documentation doesn't mention any requirement for explicit FCC permission in this case. Option D is incorrect and represents a common misconception; while emergency communications are typically protected, the Faraday cage's complete signal isolation makes this a non-issue in this specific scenario.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply the given legal information to a practical business situation, requiring critical thinking about the intersection of technology and law.

He loves weapons. Above all, he loves practice shooting with his shotgun, which he jokingly nicknamed *shotzooka*.\n\nOne summer, Billy decides to innovate. He spends his days adding new features to his shotzooka. First, he adds a telescope. Then he adds a laser sight. But does not stop there. Somehow he manages to attach a remotely controlled anti\\-tank guided missile to his beloved gun.\n\nThe now upgraded shotzooka is capable of immense destructive power. Strangely enough, though, the weapon still resembles a regular shotgun. Billy decides to test his weapon's new capabilities on a tree. He locks his target, then takes a 180 degree turn and pulls the trigger. The missile turns 180 around and, flying at Mach 3 speed, pulverizes the tree to the ground. Billy had never had such power in his hands.\n\nCan Billy legally possess his *shotzooka*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, we need to determine what laws this new hybrid gun falls under. We got a normal shotgun, which in itself might be under the National Firearms Act (NFA) a Class 3 Destructive device, but most aren't. So, let's assume \"Shotzooka\" is a standard Remington 870\\.\n\nBecause Billy wants his gun to be more compact, he shortens the gun with a telescopic stock. Great, there are 2 options for that: a full stock that can be lengthened and one that is pretty much folding out completely. This can be a problem if the total gun in its shortest configuration gets below 26 inches length \\- then it is illegal under Texas law as a short barrel firearm. And the complete removal makes it **no longer** a shotgun under federal law but pushes it to a different weapon category: Any Other Weapon. Since it once was a proper shotgun (which means it had a stock) it can't ever become a Pistol Grip Firearm.\n\nNow, here comes the crux: owning and operating these is totally fine if you have them registered at the Bureau of Alcohol Tabacco and Firearms. But you need to register your intent to manufacture them **before** you start with the conversion and have the approval of your project. It also costs 200$ tax \\-but you need to also make sure your new gun is allowed locally (see below).\n\nThe Laser sight likely isn't a problem... but now comes the really big problem:\n\nThe laser\\-guided anti\\-tank missile. THAT is a problem. Because anti\\-tank weapons are explosive and all explosives are classed as Destructive Devices under the NFA (well,technically that's Title II of the Gun Control Act of 1968 amending the NFA of 1934\\...). And possession of such a Title II weapon like a Destructive Devices demands them to be registered and tax\\-stamoed for 200$ federally \\- and manufacturing them is prohibited for private citizens.\n\nThis means in the act of mounting the missile to his shotzooka he turned her into an illegal, unregisterable NFA Class3 DD of the explosive type, illegally manufactured it, and just for the possession alone put himself up to a [fine of 250k and 10 years jail time:](https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/houston/press-releases/2011/texas-man-charged-with-unlawfully-possessing-destructive-devices)\n\n> The charge of unlawful possession of a destructive device in violation of the National Firearms Act carries a maximum statutory penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nBut the trouble doesn't stop there, Texas itself has a penal code that defines that anti\\-tank missile somewhere!

See that? The mounting of the missile launcher just turned the gun highly illegal, and even in the act of shortening the shotgun by altering the stock to be telescopic, it might have become illegal if the gun became too short. And it gets worse. The mere possession of the guided missile is impossible unless it's a curio or relic (which would mean it is old!) or registered, but it can't be because private citizens can't make it... and even owning the **parts** for the missile would be illegal if they would be used in a crime... wait, manufacturing of a missile **is** a crime, so owning the parts also is a crime!\n\ntl;dr:\n------\n\nBilly is screwed under **both** texas and federal law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: Billy, a weapons enthusiast in Texas, has modified his shotgun (nicknamed \"shotzooka\") by adding a telescope, laser sight, and a remotely controlled anti-tank guided missile.

Texas state law: The Texas Penal Code (Title 10, Chapter 46) defines the anti-tank missile as an \"explosive weapon.\" Possession, manufacture, or transportation of such a device is illegal unless registered in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record (which is not possible for private citizens to do for this type of weapon).\n\n3. The telescopic stock modification could potentially make the shotgun a \"short-barrel firearm\" if it reduces the overall length to less than 26 inches, which is also illegal under both federal and state law without proper registration (which must be done before modification).\n\n4. Even possessing components of an explosive weapon with intent to combine them for use in a criminal endeavor (which manufacturing such a device would be) is illegal under Texas law.\n\n5. The laser sight is likely the only legal modification made to the weapon.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from both federal and state laws, applies them to a real-world scenario, and tests critical thinking about the legal implications of weapon modifications. The distractors represent common misconceptions, such as state law providing protection (A), the possibility of registration making it legal (B), or the idea that pre-modification licensing would make it permissible (D)."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49209/re-release-of-mit-licensed-open-source-app-to-the-ios-app-store", "docs_id": 49209, "title": "Re-Release of MIT-licensed open-source app to the iOS App Store", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **TL:DR** someone re\\-uploaded my MIT\\-licensed open\\-source app to the iOS App Store.\n\n---\n\n**WHAT HAPPENED**\n\nI have created a small app for iPhone, which has been available on the App Store for over 2 years now. \n\nIt is licensed under MIT and I am the copyright owner.

Which of the following scenarios is most likely to present legal challenges for the company?\n\nA) Offering different prices to users in the United States and Canada based on market analysis\nB) Charging higher prices to users from countries with higher average incomes\nC) Implementing dynamic pricing that results in male users receiving consistently lower prices than female users\nD) Using A/B testing to offer slightly different prices to random subsets of users within the European Union\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer is C because it involves price discrimination based on a protected class (gender), which is illegal in most jurisdictions. \n\nOption A is likely legal as it's based on geographic market analysis rather than protected characteristics. Option B, while potentially controversial, is generally legal as income level or country of residence are not typically protected classes. \n\nOption D is tricky because it involves the EU, where price discrimination can be illegal if it's an abuse of market power. However, the question specifies \"random subsets of users,\" which suggests it's not targeting specific groups, and \"slightly different prices,\" which is less likely to be considered an abuse of market power. Additionally, the startup probably doesn't have the market power required for this to be illegal in the EU.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring the candidate to integrate multiple concepts: the global nature of the business, the legality of price discrimination in various contexts, and the specific protections against discrimination based on protected classes.

A person commits the offense of making a terrorist threat in the first\n>  degree if such person, with the purpose of frightening ten or more\n>  people or causing the evacuation, quarantine or closure of any portion\n>  of a building, inhabitable structure, place of assembly or facility of\n>  transportation, knowingly:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Communicates an express or implied threat to cause an incident\n>  or condition involving danger to life; or\n> \n> \n> \u2003 (2\\) Communicates a false report of an incident or condition\n>  involving danger to life; or\n> \n> \n> \u2003 (3\\) Causes a false belief or fear that an incident has occurred or\n>  that a condition exists involving danger to life.\n> \n> \n> \u2003 2\\.

And it's not going to be seen by the council as some sort of security; threats are not security.\n\nIf you did put up such a turret, and the state didn't take action under 574\\.115, and there is no local law on the books that applies, the council can easy put one in place at their regular council meeting with a simple motion and vote.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The city council warned that if someone feels threatened on the property, the homeowner could be charged with a crime. This indicates potential legal consequences.\n\n2. Missouri state law (RSMo Section 574.115) defines making a terrorist threat, which includes causing \"a false belief or fear that an incident has occurred or that a condition exists involving danger to life.\"\n\n3. The proposed system, resembling a gun turret that tracks people, would likely cause fear in pedestrians, meeting the criteria of the law by creating a false belief of danger to life.\n\n4. The law specifies that this offense is a class D felony, matching the description in option C.\n\n5. The system's purpose of tracking pedestrians suggests an intent to frighten multiple people, aligning with the law's condition of \"the purpose of frightening ten or more people.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the offense described in the law is more serious than a misdemeanor. Option B is wrong because the law doesn't provide an exception for marked non-functional systems; the perception of threat is what matters. Option D is incorrect because the law specifically addresses causing fear, regardless of property rights, and the council's advice contradicts this option.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a practical scenario, and understand the potential consequences of actions that may seem innocuous to the implementer but threatening to others."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76388/i-supposedly-owe-91-dollars-for-a-4-dollar-toll-from-half-a-decade-ago-can-it-b", "docs_id": 76388, "title": "I supposedly owe 91 dollars for a 4 dollar toll from half a decade ago.

But it's okay because Delaware has an amnesty program and if I just pay in the next 20 days I 'only' have to pay 64 dollars on my 4 dollar toll.\n\nAs I said the state is hours of driving away from me and I couldn't imagine why I would be driving through it, though it's close enough, and long enough ago, that I can't rule out some forgotten long drive that took me through it.

EZ Pass violation notices can be appealed.\n\nYour communication is apparently from a debt collector. You may demand evidence that the debt is valid before deciding whether to pay or contest the alleged debt.

In addition to the toll, a Violation Notice has a $25 Administrative Fee, $10 Ambulance Company Fund Fee, and a $15 fee to Combat Violent Crimes.\n> \n> \n> A Toll Violation Final Notice (see example) is issued if the Violation Notice has not been paid within 30 days. The Toll Violation Final Notice adds a Civil Penalty of $25 and a Civil Penalty Surcharge of $12\\.50 to the fees listed on the first Notice of Toll Violation. If the Toll Violation Final Notice is not paid, it will be subject to registration hold, collection activities or legal action.\n\nThose fees would add up to $91\\.50 on a $4 toll if a violation went unpaid for 30 days or more.

This approach is justified for several reasons:\n\n1. Verification: The driver should first verify the legitimacy of the debt. As mentioned in the documentation, \"You may demand evidence that the debt is valid before deciding whether to pay or contest the alleged debt.\"\n\n2.

The FAQ states, \"Delaware E-ZPass Customers with accounts in good standing can appeal their violation notices by accessing the Appeal Page of this website, over the phone, in person, by fax or mail.\"\n\n3. Potential errors: Given that the driver doesn't recall driving in Delaware and has always used an EZ-Pass, there's a possibility of an error or misidentification.\n\n4.

Avoiding unnecessary payments: Paying the amnesty amount (option B) without verifying the debt could result in unnecessary payment if the violation was issued in error.\n\n6. Legal approach: Filing a complaint against the debt collection agency (option D) is premature without first verifying the debt's validity with the issuing authority.\n\nBy contacting the Delaware EZ-Pass authorities, the driver can verify the debt, understand why their EZ-Pass didn't register (if they did drive through Delaware), and potentially appeal the violation if there was an error.

It is unclear to me at this point whether or not the difficulty stems from the websites' unwillingness to remove the content based on her location, or if it is more a matter of her not fully understanding the English language and not meeting the requirements for an effective DMCA takedown notice. So my questions are:\n\n* What makes for an effective DMCA takedown notice specifically in regards to websites that host pornographic material?\n* Is a website more likely to respond to a DMCA takedown notice if the notice comes from within the United States?\n* If the answer to the previous question is Yes: how would someone from outside of the United States authorize someone residing in the United States to send a DMCA takedown notice on their behalf?\n* When sending a DMCA takedown notice, does one send the notice directly to the website in question?\n\nMany pornographic websites have a DMCA link on their page.

If the site fails to comply with a valid notice, they lose the benefit of DMCA's safe harbor provisions and become themselves liable for continuing to host the infringing work, and you can sue them. (Prior filing suit, though, I imagine a letter from a lawyer that says, \"Hey, my client sent you a valid DMCA notice a while ago; kindly comply at once, or we will actually sue you,\" should be sufficient.)\n\nThe requirement to submit a photo appears to be totally unnecessary. A valid DMCA notice includes a signature (electronically including your name in an email is sufficient) and an assertion, under penalty of perjury, that the writer is authorized to control the copyright work and that the work is being used illegally. Beyond a signature and contact information, no further identity verification is necessary. The DMCA handles this by opening the submitter to perjury charges if the takedown was submitted illegally.\n\nOf course, any site might choose to ignore your DMCA takedown, at their own peril. They might bet that you won't actually hire a lawyer and follow through on your legal right to file suit, or they might not understand that identity verification is not a legal requirement listed in [17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(3\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512).

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The DMCA applies to websites hosted in the U.S., regardless of the copyright holder's location.

A standard DMCA takedown notice, as outlined in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 512(c)(3), does not require additional identity verification beyond a signature and assertion under penalty of perjury.

I doubt that your strategy would work.\n\nThe GDPR does not explicitly allow you to choose in which format your requests will be answered. If the data controller chooses a different format or medium, I would assume they are compliant. All the GDPR says is this (Art 12(1\\)):\n\n> The information shall be provided in writing, or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means.\n\nFor example, it would likely be perfectly compliant if they provide a response through physical mail. Electronic mail is common as a convenience to both parties. You as the data subject have no legal basis for forcing the data controller to interact with any website.\n\nFurthermore, the GDPR does not give you a right to receive responses in a machine\\-readable format. In addition to your Art 15 right to access, you may have a separate Art 20 right to data portability. While generally similar \u2013 and usually handled by data controllers together \u2013 they have different conditions and cover different information. For example, information on the source and recipients of personal data is required under Art 15(1\\) letters (c) and (g), but that information will usually not be machine readable and is not in scope of Art 20\\. In any case, there are no commonly used machine\\-readable formats for responses to data subject requests, so that each controller could choose its own format (typically a JSON or XML file or a ZIP archive with a custom schema/structure) \u2013 but only for the copy of your data, not for the additional information mentioned in Art 15\\.\n\nSending data subject requests from a no\\-reply address could be an indication that you're not actually interested in the responses, which could indicate that your requests are \u201cmanifestly unfounded\u201d and can therefore be rejected under Art 12(5\\).

There are all sorts of laws establishing duties of care, such as between doctor and patient, which may be created by a legislature or may be part of common law tradition. There is a duty of care imposed on a landlord w.r.t. the tenant, requiring that the premise be \"secure\", therefore a landlord might easily be held liable if the main door into the building was not locked. This duty is a specific instance of a general duty from tradesman/businessman to customer.\n\nAs far as I can determine, there is no such statutory duty imposed on tenants in Washington state, and none from case law being revealed by a few cursory searches.

It is said that \"If something is foreseeable, it is a probable and predictable consequence of the defendant\u2019s negligent actions or inaction\".

So is \"individual\" in the Dictionary Act equivalent to a \"natural person,\" and thus, a \"human being\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Caveat**\n\nKeep in mind that words do not have uniform definitions for all times and places and contexts. Words can have different meanings in particular contexts and can be defined in a contract or statute to have a meaning different from the common meaning.\n\n**\"Person\" Usually Includes Entities Of Any Kind**\n\nThis said, usually the term \"person\" in the law refers to any human being and any trust, estate or entity that is capable of suing and being sued and entering into contracts. \n\nAn \"entity\" in this sense would often include partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations, non\\-profit associations (whether or not incorporated), business trusts, joint ventures, local governments, states, the federal government and foreign governments. \n\n(I break out trusts and estates separately because there is divided authority in different jurisdictions over whether trusts and estates are entities, or are simply a special hat that the trustee or executor wears that are not entities, which can be relevant in some highly technical situations.)\n\n**Agency Situations**\n\nThe term \"person\" is also often used in the sense that it refers to the principal and not the agent, when an agent is taking action on behalf of the principal. \n\nThus, if there is a law that says \"a person who enters into a real estate contract must disclose that person's taxpayer identification number\", and someone with a power of attorney from you signs a real estate contract on your behalf, the power of attorney agent should disclosure your taxpayer identification number and not theirs.\n\n**Why Is The Term \"Person\" Defined So Broadly?**\n\nOne important reason for using the term \"person\" to apply to entities as well as human beings, is that it allows for statutes and contract terms or case law legal rules to be stated in very general terms without being wordy in a way that accurately reflects how those legal rules or contract terms should apply to entities.\n\nFor example, a statute using the word \"person\" might say: \n\n> A person who is engaged in business in this state must register with\n>  the department of business licenses.\n\nBy using the word \"person\" in this way, the statute wouldn't have to say instead (probably less accurately and less comprehensibly): \n\n> Any individual, partnership, limited liability company, corporation,\n>  business trust, non\\-business trust, estate, governmental entity, or\n>  other entity, including the principal of any agent acting on behalf of\n>  the principal, engaged in business in this state, must register with\n>  the department of business licenses.\n\nThe phrasing without the word \"person\" would be more likely to create loopholes because some kind of entity is omitted, and would be prone to ambiguity because one would have to decide which words that define the kind of persons and entities that are covered modify which other words in the sentence. \n\nThus, using the word \"person\" is often makes entities more rather than less accountable to the law, by making legal language more clear and more general (and hence containing fewer loopholes).\n\n**\"Individual\" or \"Natural Person\"**\n\nUsually the term \"individual\" or \"natural person\" would mean a human being, although, of course, there are other senses of the word \"individual\" such as \"an individual Widget\" referring to exactly one Widget in particular, as opposed to Widgets in general.\n\n**Alternative Definitions Of \"Person\"**\n\nThere are isolated times when the word \"person\" would not include minors and incapacitated people who are incapable of suing or entering into contracts in their own name due to lack of legal capacity.\n\nIt isn't uncommon to have a definition of \"person\" in a statute or contract that omits governmental entities, that omits all kinds of entities, or that omits particular kinds of entities (e.g. foreign entities or corporations).\n\nFor example, a tax statute might define \"person\" in a way that includes natural persons and entities, but excludes governments.\n\nSome of the definitions of terms like these in the bankruptcy code are particularly non\\-intuitive.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the legal definition of \"person\" in U.S. law, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A newly enacted state law requires that \"any person operating a business within the state must submit an annual environmental impact report.\" A local environmental group is trying to determine which entities are required to comply with this law.

In these cases family court intervention is used to deem what's in the best interest of the child.\n\nComplexities can also arise for children facing medical treatment. The most common example would be a parent attempting to refuse specific care for their child. In these cases it's possible to get a court to deem the parents \"unfit\" in order to force the medical treatment to go forward. This is usually a high\\-bar to achieve as the courts don't want to interfere in the parent\\-child relationship unless there is no other choice. Such medical treatment can also apply to mental\\-health services.\n\nNew York, [as an example](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/2014-child-welfare-legislative-enactments.aspx),\n\n> allows the local commissioner of social services or local commissioner\n>  of health to give consent for medical, dental, health and hospital services for any child found by the family court to be an abused, neglected or destitute child.\n\nOklahoma created the [Parent's Bill of Rights](http://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/2014-child-welfare-legislative-enactments.aspx) (same link as above) which:\n\n> prohibited the state from infringing upon parental rights, directed the board of education of a school district to develop a policy listing parental rights related to education, including sex education; prohibited a surgical procedure on a minor without parental consent\u2014excluding abortion\u2014 and, prohibited a mental health evaluation of a minor without parental consent.\n\nYou will find that it will take court intervention to interfere with parental discretion and that court intervention will likely need to find the parents unfit to make the decision.

A state could certainly prescribe some criminal punishment in a case like this one, but punishing under existing manslaughter or murder laws would almost surely not be upheld under existing law (subject to change without advanced notice by the U.S. Supreme Court).\n\n> If someone knowingly and intentionally destroyed an embryo conceived\n> via IVF but not implanted yet what kind of consequences do they face?\n> Is the potential life treated differently or is this just destruction\n> of property?\n\nThis is a tough question that probably doesn't have a uniform answer under the law of all U.S. states.\n\nFor one thing, it isn't clear who, if anyone, has property rights in the embryo. It is certainly conceivable that a state might instead conclude that the donor receiving the IVF treatment has only contract rights in it (and breach of a contract is not a crime).\n\nIt might be viewed as a property destruction case. There might be a specific statute on point. There might be a civil lawsuit remedy. In most states, this would be an issue of first impression and a court would look a competing ways that cases had been handled in other jurisdictions to decide what to do in its case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A fertility clinic experiences a power outage, resulting in the accidental thawing and destruction of several frozen embryos created through IVF.

The correct answer is C because the documentation states that \"it isn't clear who, if anyone, has property rights in the embryo\" and that a state might \"conclude that the donor receiving the IVF treatment has only contract rights in it.\" This suggests that courts are more likely to treat such cases as breach of contract rather than property destruction or criminal matters.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that manslaughter charges would \"almost surely not be upheld under existing law\" for destruction of non-implanted embryos.\n\nOption B, while plausible, is less likely than C given the uncertainty around property rights in embryos mentioned in the documentation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation indicates that most states don't have specific statutes on this issue, stating it would be \"an issue of first impression\" in most jurisdictions.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically analyze the most likely legal outcome based on the current state of law as described."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21187/does-llc-protect-from-personal-lawsuit", "docs_id": 21187, "title": "Does LLC protect from personal lawsuit", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am looking on taking my first job as a freelance developer and the project involves ecommerce. We are starting to get to the contract talks and I wanted to make sure if anything goes horrible wrong in the event of hacking or loss of money from their store being down. I am not open to be sued personal and have my personal assets at risk. If I created an LLC for my freelance work would this protect me from losing an personal assets in the case of a lawsuit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An LLC (subject to exceptions that authorize piercing the corporate veil, the most common of which are co\\-mingling personal and LLC funds without proper documentation and fraudulent transfers such as distributions of profits from the LLC to the owner while the LLC is insolvent or facing litigation) protects its owners from personal liability for obligations of the LLC in tort or in contract, *in their capacity as owners of the LLC*.\n\nIf the LLC is a party to a contract which the owner does not guarantee, the LLC is very good protection against personal liability for the contractual debts of the LLC (of course, the property of the LLC itself, including its intellectual property, is subject to the LLC's creditors claims).\n\nIf the LLC is sued for a tort, the protection is less perfect because in addition to suing an LLC for a tort (since the LLC is vicariously liable for anything done by its employees or agents under the doctrine of respondiat superior) anyone who personally participated in tortious activity may be sued personally, rather than as an agent of the LLC, for their own personal tortious actions.\n\nFor example, suppose that the LLC sold software that contained code that embezzled funds from the customer's bank accounts and gave the money to the Salvation Army which had no involvement whatsoever in creating the software (a Robin Hood virus). This would be tortious (probably conversion or civil theft, at a minimum), and the LLC would be liable in tort for this tortious act because it was committed by someone acting on its behalf. But, the human being who actually wrote that code while working for the LLC would also be personally liable in tort for the harm caused because they personally participated in that tort. But, if that person's manager at the LLC never knew that this was done by the employee, the manager would not have personal liability.\n\nOf course, nothing under the sun can prevent you from being sued. Anyone with a word processor, the filing fee and a process server can sue you for anything. The substantive law can make it more or less likely that you will be found by the court to have legal liability in the end. Also, some suits can be dismissed early in the process, while in the case of other suits, even if you are in the right, it can take a long court process to prove that fact.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A freelance developer is hired to create an e-commerce platform for a client.

Which of the following scenarios is most likely to result in personal liability for the developer, assuming they have formed an LLC?\n\nA) The developer's LLC signed the contract without personal guarantees, and the breach was due to a previously unknown software vulnerability.\nB) The developer personally wrote code that intentionally harvested customer data for personal gain, unbeknownst to their LLC.\nC) The developer's LLC distributed all profits to the developer immediately after the breach occurred, leaving the LLC insolvent.\nD) The client's lawsuit names both the LLC and the developer personally, claiming negligence in website security implementation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation, including LLC protection, personal liability, and exceptions to LLC protection. The correct answer is B because it represents a scenario where the developer personally participated in tortious activity. \n\nAs explained in the documentation, an LLC generally protects its owners from personal liability. However, there are exceptions, particularly in cases of personal participation in torts. The documentation states: \"anyone who personally participated in tortious activity may be sued personally, rather than as an agent of the LLC, for their own personal tortious actions.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it represents a standard business risk that the LLC structure is designed to protect against. \n\nOption C, while problematic, relates more to piercing the corporate veil due to fraudulent transfers, which is a separate issue from personal participation in a tort.\n\nOption D is a distractor because merely being named in a lawsuit doesn't necessarily result in personal liability if the developer was acting appropriately as an agent of the LLC.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking about the limits of LLC protection and personal liability in the context of software development and cybersecurity."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4452/can-you-prevent-att-from-raising-prices-by-making-such-suggestion", "docs_id": 4452, "title": "Can you prevent AT&amp;T from raising prices by making such suggestion?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As per the recent news ([*LA Times: Contact AT\\&T's CEO, hear back from his lawyer*](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20151013-column.html)), making suggestions to AT\\&T as an existing lifelong customer results in escalation to their legal dept, which subsequently sends the suggestion back to the suggester, with the lawyer articulating that the company respectfully declines to consider said suggestion.\n\n> \"AT\\&T has a policy of not entertaining unsolicited offers to adopt, analyze, develop, license or purchase third\\-party intellectual property ... from members of the general public,\" Restaino said.\n> \n> \n> \"Therefore, we respectfully decline to consider your suggestion.\"\n\nThis prompted the rival [T\\-Mobile US' CEO to run a twitter campaign](https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/654025014916722688) to publicly collect such declined suggestions ([even](https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/654026653119590400) issuing an official press release \u2014 [https://newsroom.t\\-mobile.com/news/att\\-customer\\-ideas\\-welcome.htm](https://newsroom.t-mobile.com/news/att-customer-ideas-welcome.htm)).\n\n> .@ATT \\& \\#Randall are nuts.

The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, \"There is no IP in ideas!\" The explanation clarifies that copyright only applies to the exact wording, and sending a suggestion implies an implicit license.

Even the most recent NCDRC ruling leaves open a distinguishing factor, that the putative deficiency relates not to education, but to an extracurricular activity made available by the institution.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. For federal purposes, the IRS does not have a specific form for revoking S-corporation status. Instead, they require a written statement submitted to the appropriate service center. This statement must include specific details such as the corporation's name, EIN, shareholder information, and the intention to revoke the S-corporation election.\n\n2.

You can say the nastiest untrue things you like in a private diary or private correspondence between you and the person concerned \\- its only when *you* put that correspondence in the hands of someone else that you may have committed libel.\n* The settlement they get will be related to the harm that has been caused \\- a person of already low reputation may only be awarded a small amount.\n* \"Actual malice\" is a particularly US thing: it applies nowhere else.\n* Jurisdiction matters: the US is a very hard place to successfully sue for defamation because of their strong freedom of speech laws.

The correct answer, B, is the most legally sound approach because:\n\n1. Copyright protection: The documentation clearly states that both published and unpublished essays are protected by copyright. This eliminates options A and C, which incorrectly assume that unpublished or discarded works are not protected.\n\n2. Fair use limitations: While fair use exceptions exist, the documentation suggests it would be difficult to justify copying entire essays into a database under fair use, ruling out option A.\n\n3. Data vs. content: The key distinction is made between the essays themselves and the data derived from them. The documentation states that \"data from the essays, as opposed to the texts of the essays themselves, are probably facts. Facts are not protected by copyright in any Berne Convention country.\"\n\n4. Legal use of factual data: By extracting and analyzing only factual data (such as word count, topic frequency, and citation patterns), the professor can conduct her research without infringing on copyright or requiring individual permissions.\n\nOption D, while ethically sound, is not necessarily required from a legal standpoint if only factual data is being used.

I noticed that while the document always contains the same persons name on the signature line there appears to be 3 different signatures between documents (like other people signed them for him).\n\nIs it legal to send a document with your signature claiming to be somebody else?\nIs it legal to allow somebody to sign a document \"for you\" (using your name)?\nIs it legal for a single individual to use multiple signatures when signing legal documents (ie, is there a requirement your signature be identifiable or consistent)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Is it legal to send a document with your signature claiming to be somebody else?**\n**Is it legal to allow somebody to sign a document \"for you\" (using your name)?** \n\nI'll answer these two questions together.\n\nIt depends on what laws apply to the specific document.\n\nFor example:\n\n* For a contract for the sale of land, the Statute of Frauds requires a signature. However, the Statute provides that the signature may be made by a person authorised by you.\n* In Australia, a Commonwealth income tax return must be signed by the taxpayer. The taxpayer must sign it personally. If you get your assistant to sign it then you haven't filled it in properly and you are liable to be fined for failure to lodge a valid tax return. There are rules in the legislation for corporations, e.g. the public officer signs it. Sometimes the law allows a tax agent/accountant to sign a form. The theme is that the law provides specific rules.\n* In Australia, banknotes must bear the signatures of two senior officials such as the Secretary of the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. However, the law imposing this requirement allows a great deal of flexibility about how these signatures are applied, freeing these officials from the tedium of signing millions of banknotes: Reserve Bank Act 1959, s 37\\.\n\nIn the case of a letter, there are no specific laws about who can sign it and how. You could very well get an employee to sign it for you.\n\nThe other issue to be aware of is deception. If I write you a letter signed \"Kim Kardashian\", but she has no idea I've done this and has not given me permission, but I lead you to believe that Kim Kardashian just wrote you a letter saying you're great, and then you go and embarrass yourself posting that letter on Facebook, then potentially I am in a bit of trouble. (A more serious example would be where I impersonate your bank and purport to waive the repayments on your mortgage, resulting in you defaulting.) In such a case, the relevant laws are the various laws to do with deception, not laws specifically about who can sign a document.\n\n**Is it legal for a single individual to use multiple signatures when signing legal documents (ie, is there a requirement your signature be identifiable or consistent)?**\n\nThis is fine. A real signature is not like a cryptographic signature. Its function is not to, by itself, prove the authenticity of a document. The act of signing something is significant because it shows commitment, etc, and for very important documents (e.g. deeds) people (or the law) will ask for the signature to be witnessed. The verification in that case comes from the witness being able to testify as to who they saw sign the document, not the appearance of the signature itself. \n\nKeep in mind that the law related to signatures evolved at a time when not everybody could write their name and continues to accomodate people who cannot today. \n\nThere is no reason or principle requiring an individual to use a consistent signature.\n\nThere is a practical exception in relation to banks. Banks keep a specimen signature on file for each customer and use this to decide whether to accept withdrawal slips, cheques etc. It is not an ideal system (it is not hard to forge a signature well enough to get past a teller) but in conjunction with the banks' other fraud prevention methods it is the best they can do. However, this is a matter of their own risk management not a legal requirement. If you were transacting in person at the branch and the teller knew you and the bank manager was happy, legally you could sign withdrawal slips with an \"X\" or a different signature every time.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A company has sent you several documents demanding money, with inconsistent amounts.

It will be divided among ten beneficiaries, each receiving a percentage.\n\nOne heir currently lives in a house that would be part of the estate. The elder relative has stated that they must keep the house, anything inside it, and perhaps some additional funds for property taxes and such \"off the top\" (meaning, they receive this in addition to their percentage of the remainder).\n\nFor reasons that stretch over decades of family history, I believe strongly in the justice of this arrangement (which I do not benefit from).

Under the C\\-P contract the platform agrees to collect the money from the client.

This is a perfectly sensible thing for a contract to address; contracts are fundamentally about risk allocation after all. So, if there is fraud or suspected fraud, the freelancer cops the loss. They have no cause of action against the platform because the platform is only doing what the F\\-P contract requires \\- that is, there is no breach of contract.\n\nThe freelancer does have a cause of action against the client under the F\\-C contract, so they can sue the client for the money.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that the freelancer has a direct contract (F-C contract) with the client, independent of the platform.\n2. The platform's right to withhold funds is likely protected by their terms of service in the freelancer-platform (F-P) contract.\n3.

This is defined as a \"disorderly persons offense\".\n\nUpon conviction, a disorderly persons offense is punishable in New Jersey by a term of up to 90 days in jail and probation, ([section 2C:43\\-2 (b) (2\\)](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-2c/chapter-43/section-2c-43-2)), and a fine of up to $1000 ([section 2C:43\\-3 (c)](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-jersey/2018/title-2c/chapter-43/section-2c-43-3/)). \n\nThis represents the maximum. I do not know what kind of sentence is actually likely. It could depend on common practice in the state, the prosecutor's opinion of the severity of the crime, and the judge's discretion.\n\nA lawyer would be best qualified to help you find out how to contest the charge, or to receive a lesser sentence if convicted.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: In the described New Jersey fender bender incident, the defendant is charged with simple assault. Given the circumstances and legal information provided, which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur in this case?\n\nA) The defendant will automatically be sentenced to 90 days in jail due to the physical evidence of a bruise on the accuser.\n\nB) The case will be immediately dismissed because the alleged assault was not mentioned in the initial police report.\n\nC) The defendant faces a potential maximum sentence of 90 days in jail and a $1000 fine, but the actual outcome will depend on various factors including prosecutorial discretion and judicial interpretation.\n\nD) The defendant will be charged with a more serious form of assault due to the car accident context, potentially facing years in prison.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the provided legal information to the specific scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that simple assault is a disorderly persons offense in New Jersey.\n2.

Once they follow up and the person has responded, there's no longer a basis for prosecuting.\n\n> What is the point of one of the oldest laws, in which some people have cared enough to amend, but not enough to actually enforce?\n\nThe possibility of prosecution is presumably thought to increase the response rate even if virtually nobody is ever prosecuted. The law also serves as a formal statement by congress that responding to the census is important, even if the executive doesn't prosecute people for failing to do so.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that an element of the offense specified in [13 USC 221](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/13/221) is refusal or *willful* neglect. Without evidence of an affirmative refusal to respond, the prosecutor would need evidence of willfulness, which goes to state of mind, and that is notoriously difficult to prove.

Option B is the most effective and legally sound approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Historical context: The documentation mentions that despite the law's long existence and amendments, prosecutions have been extremely rare. This suggests that punitive measures (Options A and C) are not the preferred or most effective approach.\n\n2. Enforcement strategy: The top answer notes that the Census Bureau's more effective strategy is to follow up in person with non-respondents, rather than pursuing prosecution. This aligns with an educational approach (Option B) that informs residents about the follow-up process and importance of participation.\n\n3. Legal considerations: The answer mentions the difficulty in proving willful neglect, a key element of the offense. An educational campaign (Option B) addresses this by reducing the likelihood of unintentional non-compliance.\n\n4. Psychological impact: The existence of the law itself is described as potentially increasing response rates, even without active enforcement. An educational campaign can leverage this psychological effect by reminding people of their legal obligation without resorting to threats.\n\n5. Practical implementation: Option B is the most feasible to implement and doesn't raise legal or ethical concerns like the other options might.\n\nOption A (additional fines) could face legal challenges and might not address the root causes of non-response. Option C (threats of prosecution) goes against the historical trend of non-enforcement and could be seen as intimidation. Option D (financial incentives) could be seen as coercion or bribery, potentially compromising the integrity of the census data.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate legal, historical, and practical considerations in developing an effective public policy approach, requiring higher-order thinking skills and application of multiple concepts from the provided information."}, "83": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42692/do-i-need-user-consent-to-respond-to-their-email-sent-through-my-websites-conta", "docs_id": 42692, "title": "Do I need user consent to respond to their email sent through my website&#39;s contact form?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a contact form on my website which collects the follow four fields: Full name, email address, subject, message.\n\nI'm not storing any of the data in a database or in cookies.\n\nWhen the user submits the form I receive an email with the information so that I can respond to them via email.\n\nAm I breaching GDPR? Do I need permission to send them an email etc?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are probably not breaching GDPR1.\n\nFirst, *consent*(art 6\\.1\\.a of GDPR) cannot be implied, but it does not require that the user formally ticks a box. If you leave a field for \"E\\-mail to answer back to you\" and the user fills it, he has already consented to you processing his e\\-mail for the specific purpose of answering. It would be a [\"clear affirmative action\"](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/consent/what-is-valid-consent/).\n\nAsserting that you have consent could be a little more complicated if you were forcing the user to provide the e\\-mail in order to send the form, since consent must be \"freely given\". If the kind of communications that are send to you may not require a reply (for example, to inform you that your website has some mistake), then it could be better to leave the e\\-mail field optional2.\n\nBesides, consent is just one of the motives that allow you to process user data, and you might have a [*legitimate interest*](https://www.gdpreu.org/the-regulation/key-concepts/legitimate-interest/)(art 6\\.1\\.f). For example, to avoid being spammed you might want to have a system that sends a confirmation link to that address, to confirm that it is indeed a legitimate user and not some bot, or to filter out messages send from some particularly troublesome person.\n\nThe limits of legitimate interest are a bit fuzzy, but I would be surprised1 if this use would not be contemplated as legitimate.\n\nBesides,\n\n> I'm not storing any of the data in a database or in cookies.\n\nis irrelevant; GDPR does not bother with the technical details of how the information is stored. It does not matter if you have the e\\-mail in a cookie, a database, a contact in you e\\-mail client or written in a clay tablet, what matters is that you have that piece of personal information.\n\n---\n\n1I am not a lawyer, I am not your lawyer.\n\n2Although in that case maybe you could say that contacting you to complain or inform about mistakes in the web is not a \"service\" by itself.

Option B is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It addresses the concept of \"freely given\" consent by making the email field optional, which aligns with the documentation's statement that \"consent must be freely given\" and that forcing users to provide an email could be problematic.\n\n2. It leverages the idea of \"clear affirmative action\" mentioned in the documentation. By clearly stating that providing an email constitutes consent for a reply, the business owner is obtaining consent through the user's voluntary action of filling out the email field.\n\n3. It balances GDPR compliance with practical business needs. The owner can still respond to queries without implementing overly complex systems or significantly disrupting the user experience.\n\n4. It avoids unnecessary data storage, aligning with the business owner's current practice of not storing data in a database or cookies, which minimizes potential GDPR compliance issues related to data storage and security.\n\nOption A is incorrect because mandatory consent checkboxes are often seen as coercive and may not truly represent freely given consent. Option C is impractical and would significantly impair the ability to respond to individual queries.

The boundaries of it are well known as I did a redefinition survey to find them out.

Let's call this adjoining local authority land ***B***.\n\nPrevious owners used to graze sheep on the whole fenced area (A\\+B) and both the local community and authorities were fine with it. To be clear, neither the previous owners nor I have had any lease (or whatever) agreement to occupy B \u2014 it simply has been a de facto status quo.\n\nNow B has grown [gorse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_control_of_gorse_in_New_Zealand) on it.

Then they state they can only hold the apartment until the October 27th (74 days into the lease and 37 days since this email notice) because of high demand, and that that if they do not have a renewal lease signed point they will mark the apartment as available and we may \"lose your house/apartment for next term\".\n\nI dug through the lease and there is no mention of when any party must give intention to renew, however they do state that any notice to end a current term by either party or change any details about the current term must be given 60 days prior to the end of the term (July 31, 2018\\).\n\nThis time to renew is way to early, we still have maintenance issues that haven't been addressed which we'd like to know the outcome of before signing up for another year, plus things could change. I'm wondering, short of any relevant information being in the lease, is there any recourse to being prompted to sign for renewal early in a term. Surely it would be an obvious issue if they forced you to renew 1 day into your lease, 49\\-74 days in doesn't feel much different. Is there options, short of emailing them and begging, to extend that term?\n\nThis is in Virginia, USA to be specific.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no obvious reason that it would be illegal, although it certainly wouldn't be customary practice. Unless a lease says otherwise, it does not include a legal option to renew the lease. \n\nThe landlord has every right to lease the property for the period after the end of your lease term without asking you first and then to give you timely notice to terminate before your lease term ends.\n\nBut, Patrick87 rightly notes that it isn't clear if the form in question is legally binding lease extension, or simply constitutes an expression of present intent that you retain the right to change your mind about. Indeed, I would bet that the landlord hasn't consulted a lawyer about this and doesn't really know himself (or itself). It isn't clear that without a proper lease extension that the agreement to renew could be enforced.\n\nContrawise, it also isn't clear if you signing an intent to renew form gives you a legally enforceable option to renew your lease, or if the landlord could ignore your wishes and lease it to someone else anyway if they got a better offer.\n\nOn the whole, the ambiguity over the enforceability of this request, on both sides, is a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A couple renting an apartment receives an email from their landlord 49 days into their lease, requesting they sign an intent to renew form for the next term or risk losing their apartment. The lease doesn't mention renewal timelines, but states that notice to end a current term must be given 60 days prior to the end of the term. What is the most appropriate legal analysis of this situation?\n\nA) The landlord's request is legally binding, and the tenants must comply or risk eviction\nB) The tenants can safely ignore the request as it contradicts the 60-day notice clause in the lease\nC) The request is likely unenforceable, but creates ambiguity that could lead to legal complications\nD) The tenants have grounds to immediately terminate their lease due to the landlord's unreasonable demand\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This situation requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The landlord's request is not explicitly supported by the lease terms, which only mention a 60-day notice period for ending the current term. This suggests the request may not be legally enforceable.\n\n2. However, the absence of specific renewal clauses in the lease doesn't automatically make the landlord's request illegal. Landlords generally have the right to lease properties for future terms.\n\n3. The ambiguity lies in whether signing the form constitutes a legally binding lease extension or merely an expression of intent. Without clear legal language, this creates uncertainty for both parties.\n\n4. This ambiguity could lead to legal complications. For example, if tenants sign and later change their mind, or if the landlord ignores a signed form and leases to someone else, it could result in disputes over the enforceability of the agreement.\n\n5. The situation demonstrates a real-world application of contract law principles, highlighting the importance of clear lease terms and the potential consequences of ambiguous requests.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect as they oversimplify the legal situation.

Individuals/consumers also don't have places to report such observations (do they?), and any state or federal agencies would find even giveaways worth a few thousand dollars not worth doing anything about.

[The elements of a lottery are:](http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/u-2.shtml#) a prize, distributed by chance, with consideration required to be eligible for the prize (e.g. \"you must make a purchase to be eligible\"). If the store would actually let someone enter without a purchase but represents that paying is necessary or helpful, or treats people who \npaid differently than those who didn't, it isn't a lottery, but is an illegal sweepstakes ([source](http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/legal_guides/u-3.shtml)). \n\nRunning a lottery in California, with the exception of chartable bingo, charitable raffles, and the official state lottery, is a crime. So is running an illegal sweepstakes. It can be reported to the police; the entity with standing to bring a case is the People of the State of California. \n\nAs for lawsuits, it is possible that someone who paid to enter could sue under section 17200 of the Business and Professions Code, which allows those directly harmed by unlawful business practices to sue. A [case](http://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1279149.html) before a California appellate court found that someone who paid to enter an illegal lottery could sue a payment processor who had actual knowledge that the site was a lottery; I can't find the ultimate result of the lawsuit (and the appeal doesn't cover the website itself), but it at least strongly suggests that someone who paid to enter can have standing to bring a lawsuit.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small online retailer is planning to run a promotional contest where customers who make a purchase of $50 or more are entered into a drawing to win a luxury vacation package.

Which of the following approaches is most likely to result in legal consequences for the retailer?\n\nA) Providing an alternate, free method of entry that requires significantly more effort than making a purchase\nB) Omitting any mention of an alternate entry method in the contest rules\nC) Limiting the contest to residents of states with more lenient sweepstakes laws\nD) Setting a high purchase threshold to ensure only serious customers participate\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Omitting any mention of an alternate entry method (option B) is most likely to result in legal consequences. The documentation clearly states that requiring a purchase to enter a drawing can constitute an illegal lottery in many jurisdictions, including California. By not providing an alternate, free method of entry, the retailer is effectively creating an illegal lottery.\n\nOption A, while potentially problematic if the alternate method is overly burdensome, at least attempts to comply with the requirement for a free entry method. Option C might reduce risk but doesn't eliminate it entirely, especially for web-based promotions. Option D, while potentially limiting participation, doesn't directly violate sweepstakes laws as long as an alternate entry method is provided.\n\nThe explanation in the documentation that \"Running a lottery in California, with the exception of charitable bingo, charitable raffles, and the official state lottery, is a crime\" underscores the seriousness of this violation. Furthermore, the document mentions that individuals who paid to enter such an illegal lottery might have standing to sue under California's Business and Professions Code, section 17200. This creates a real risk of legal consequences, including both criminal charges and civil lawsuits, making option B the most legally problematic approach."}, "96": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82606/are-raffle-tickets-sold-by-charitable-organizations-in-virginia-required-to-have", "docs_id": 82606, "title": "Are raffle tickets sold by charitable organizations in Virginia required to have date, time of drawing printed on them", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: some raffle tickets have \"drawing when all tickets are sold\" printed on them.

There is no constitutional provision, or law, which limits taxation to citizens or those on a path to citizenship.

Lawful immigrants who work in the US must pay federal and (in most states) state income tax, and I believe some undocumented immigrants pay Federal income tax as well. \n\nMany countries tax people who are not citizens, nor immigrants in line for citizenship, and this has been true far back in history.
