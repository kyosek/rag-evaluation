It should be noted that I am from Australia where gambling websites are legal. Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n\nThe [AusPat database](http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/auspat/index.htm) is an excellent source for looking for Australian patents. I did a quick search for [\"card game\"](http://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/ols/auspat/quickSearch.do?queryString=card+game&resultsPerPage=) and came across 276 results fitting those keywords.

The AusPat database shows 276 results for \"card game\" patents, including examples of modified versions of traditional card games. The patent would provide legal protection against copying by other companies, regardless of their size. While patenting variants might provide additional protection, it's not strictly necessary to patent every small variation.

One party will just lose some money or property, will have to perform some work, will lose some opportunities etc. So, initially, both parties play the same game and each of them is in to lose it down to a similar level of peril.\n\nWhat follows is that, at the baseline, neither of the two parties should be in more advantageous position to prove their rightness than the other. In other words, if any of them proves that they are more than 50% likely to be right than the other, they should win.\n\nIndeed, why would one party have to prove their rightness beyond reasonable doubt?

In civil cases, the standard of proof is lower than in criminal cases to give both parties an equal opportunity to prove their case. This is because, unlike criminal cases where the state prosecutes an individual, civil cases involve disputes between two parties who are on relatively equal footing.

G.F.*, [2021 SCC 20](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18884/index.do)) and\n* administering a stupefying substance.\n\nIf someone were to use a \"substance such as everyday alcohol\" (I would reject the premise that this is \"benign\") for the purpose of facilitating sexual assault, this would be an offence under [s. 246 of the *Criminal Code*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-35.html#docCont). Section 246 makes it an offence for a person, \"with intent to enable or assist himself or another person to commit an indictable offence\" to administer or cause any person to take a \"stupefying or overpowering drug, matter, or thing.\"\n\nThe Court of Appeal for Ontario has accepted that the element of administering a stupefying thing could be established by oversupply of alcohol. They have said that alcohol is a \"stupefying substance\" (*R. v. Vant*, [2015 ONCA 481](https://canlii.ca/t/gjrjd)) and can support a conviction under s. 246\\.\n\n---\n\n\"Date rape\" has no legal significance and even criminologically, misframes the circumstances in which people experience sexual assualt. Further, your premise that intimate partner sexual assault \"usually happens when someone uses narcotics to drug another into an unconscious state\" is not supported by the evidence. While this is a criminological point, rather than a legal point, it is important context for understanding such crimes. This [2005 study](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/212000.pdf) estimated that 4\\.6% of intimate partner sexual assaults were facilitated by surreptitious drug use.

According to the documentation, the Court of Appeal for Ontario has accepted that alcohol is a \"stupefying substance\" and that oversupply of alcohol can support a conviction under section 246 of the Criminal Code for administering a stupefying thing with intent to commit an indictable offense.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the court has explicitly recognized alcohol as a stupefying substance.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the law does not require complete unconsciousness for alcohol-facilitated sexual assault to be an offense.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because \"date rape\" has no special legal significance in Canadian law, and sexual assault is treated based on lack of consent, regardless of the specific circumstances.\n\nThis question tests understanding of how Canadian law treats alcohol in sexual assault cases, particularly in relation to the offense of administering a stupefying substance."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11697/does-nationality-affect-punishments-under-the-kuwait-system-of-justice", "docs_id": 11697, "title": "Does nationality affect punishments under the Kuwait system of justice?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I saw another American steal some expensive items in Kuwait.

If so, the client may reasonably demand that you agree that any code or other software including such confidential information or trade secrets shall not be provided to anyone else without the client's permission. Such a provision should also be in writing, and should specify clearly what information is confidential, or how confidential information is to be marked or indicated.

Too many lawyers nitpicking and wasting time and money on unimportant issues that should better be resolved directly between people. Too many lawyers could stifle innovation and creative people doing things differently because they will worry \"is this or that allowed, will I be sued?\".

Do 'No Trespassing' signs protect us (the private property owners) from liability if individuals were to get injured on our property?\n2. If yes, would an 'Enter at Your Own Risk' or similar sign provide the private property owners with the same liability protections?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThis is a somewhat complex issue. The presence of \"No Trespassing\" signs would make anyone who enters the property without a specific invitation a trespasser. So would the presence of a fence, even if there was a closed but unlocked gate. An \"Enter at your own risk\" sign probably would not make such people legally trespassers.\n\nIn West Virginia, a landowner or lessee or other lawful occupant owes a duty of \"reasonable care\" to invitees and other non\\-trespassers. No such duty is owed to trespassers. However, the owner or lawful occupant is expected to avoid dangerous conditions and reckless hazards, as well as intentional causes of harm (such as booby\\-traps). If through recklessness or serious negligance a dangerous condition exists and a person, even a trespasser, is injured or killed because of such a condition, the owner or lawful occupant is likely to be liable. However, if the danger is \"open and obvious\" or is as well known to the injured person as to the owner or occupant, there is no liability. A warning sign **might** make a danger \"open and obvious\".\n\nI do not see that video cameras will be relevant to the matter at all. Cameras do not warn a pedestrian not to enter, nor do they warn of any danger, nor do they prevent a pedestrian from being injured. They may help in detecting or even preventing crime, but will not affect liability for injury to a pedestrian.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n### West Virginia Code Code Sections\n\n[\u00a761\\-3B\\-3\\.

The legislature then amended \u00a755\\-7\\-27\\. (a) to restore the exception.\n\nThe article also reads:\n\n> West Virginia state law requires property owners remove hazards from their property to reduce the risk of these injuries. The expectation is dependent on the type of person that is on the property. Previously, visitors were broken into one of four categories: invitee, licensee, social guest or trespasser. The duty of care owed to the visitor depended on the category under which the visitor qualified. Today, there are only two categories: trespasser and non\\-trespasser. The West Virginia Supreme Court, in *Mallet v. Pickens*, abolished the four categories mentioned above, and held that \u201clandowners or possessors now owe any non\\-trespassing entrant a duty of reasonable care under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nThe article [\"Property owners may be liable for injuries to trespassers\"](https://www.farmerclinecampbell.com/blog/2017/01/property-owners-may-be-liable-for-injuries-to-trespassers/) from the law firm Farmer, Cline, \\& Campbell reads:\n\n> West Virginia homeowners are not obligated to protect those who trespass upon their property. However, they should be aware that they cannot willfully cause injury to any who do trespass. This law can become an issue for homeowners with frequent trespassers as they may find themselves liable for injuries any people, even the uninvited ones, sustain if their properties are left in an unsafe condition.\n> \n> \n> For example, homeowners and landowners could potentially face lawsuits if they purposefully made their properties unsafe. They may also be held liable if the condition of their properties could cause serious bodily harm or death. Further, landowners can also potentially face legal consequences if they fail to warn potential trespassers that there are hazards on their properties.\n\nThe article [\"Determining Duty in West Virginia Premises Liability Cases\"](https://www.colombolaw.com/west-virginia-blog/determining-duty-in-west-virginia-premises-liability-cases/) from Colombo Law reads:\n\n> Most states use three categories to determine whether a duty is owed to individuals who enter the property of another. These three categories are business invitee, licensee, and trespasser. In the past, West Virginia was one of the many states that followed this standard. However, in 1999 West Virginia abolished and replaced the three specific classifications with a new, more general standard of determining whether the individual is a trespasser or a nnon\\-trespasser\n> \n> \n> * Trespasser. A trespasser is an individual who enters the property of another without the permission of a landowner. An individual will be deemed a trespasser if they do not have either express or implied permission from the owner. In West Virginia, the courts offer little protection to those who are trespassers. As a trespasser, a landowner must only refrain from intentional or reckless conduct.\n> * Non\\-Trespassers. Contrary to trespassers, landowners owe a duty to anyone that is permitted to be on the property. If an individual enters private property with the express or implied permission of a landowner, the landowner must ensure that the premises are reasonably safe for those on the premises. To ensure you are meeting the standard of care, the landowner must inspect the premises to determine whether there are any dangerous conditions present on the property and repair and/or warn individuals of the danger.\n> \n> \n> Premises liability is the legal premise for which landowners are responsible for harm caused by unsafe conditions existing on the landowner\u2019s premises. Premises liability is a broad concept that may be raised for a variety of harms present. One main reason for personal injury actions stemming from premises liability include slip and fall accidents as a result of:\n> \n> \n> * Slippery floors\n> * Uneven sidewalks or pavement\n> * Objects protruding from carpeting , floorboards, or store shelves", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In West Virginia, a property owner is considering how to address pedestrians cutting through their vacant property to avoid a dangerous road.

Are Congressionally imposed deadlines in resolutions proposing an amendment to the States for ratification binding?\n2. Does a state withdrawal of its ratification of an amendment annul its ratification of the amendment?\n3. Who decides when an amendment is ratified?\n\nFor the first question this is perhaps the most unresolved question. Clearly if the deadline is imposed in the text of the amendment it is binding. For example, see the text of the 18th amendment, Section 3\\.\n\nWhat is not clear is what if any binding effect a deadline in the text of the resolution proposing an amendment has as to the validity of the proposed amendment. Article V makes no provision on such deadlines. In fact the most recent amendment ratified was submitted for ratification on September 25, 1789, but ratified May 5, 1992\\. In this instance the Archivist of the United States declared the amendment ratified, but Congress also acted to do so and several members scolded the Archivist for doing so before Congress acted. However, there was no resolution of who had to actually approve the ratification.\n\nFor the second question there is absolutely no answer to this question except Coleman v.

This essentially means that the question should be resolved by Congress, not the courts.\n\nLastly, for the third question see also my response to the first question. If Congress is indeed the ratifier, what happens if one Congress decides the amendment was not ratified, but a future one decides it was?\n\nHonestly, ratification of the ERA would open a whole can of worms and make it difficult to really resolve this issue.

Firstly, in England and Wales there is no obligation to be a Good Samaritan \\- in other words, there is no obligation to be a rescuer. Until you intervene to try and rescue someone, you do not owe that person a duty.\n\nAs soon as you do intervene, however, you **do** owe them a duty. Specifically, you owe them a duty not to make the situation worse (Horsey and Rackley, *Tort Law*, 3rd ed., OUP 2013, p. 75\\). The specific situation Horsey and Rackley give is that of resuscitating a drowning child and breaking a rib as you do so: this *may* be 'making the situation worse' (Horsey and Rackley, pp. 75\\-76\\). \n\nDoes this mean that you'll be liable if you give someone first aid and in doing so, you make the situation worse? Not necessarily, because, as Horsey and Rackley point out, duty is different to liability. Using the drowning child example again, they state:\n\n> So, for example, while someone who intervenes may owe a duty not to make the situation worse, their actions would still be judged against those of a 'reasonable person' in the circumstances (and so if a reasonable person would have tried to resuscitate the child in the same way, there will be *no breach* of their duty and therefore no *liability* to pay compensation.) (p.76\\)\n\nThe 'reasonable person' standard corresponds to what you mentioned in the question about lack of expertise. If a doctor intervenes in such a situation, the standard of care they'd be expected to give would be higher than, say, for someone who's simply done a basic first aid course. The question is whether or not you've acted as the reasonable person in your situation would have done.\n\nOn that basis, then, your tutor is pretty much correct: so long as you take such care as is reasonable based on your expertise, or lack thereof, then under English and Welsh law, you're unlikely to be liable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In England and Wales, a bystander attempts to perform CPR on a heart attack victim in a public place.

However, this duty is judged against the standard of a 'reasonable person' in similar circumstances with similar expertise. The bystander's actions would not be evaluated against the standard of a medical professional if they don't have that level of training.

I disagree.\n\nTheir point was that they extend, through replacements, the lifetime of the computer until it is 'vintage'. Vintage seems to be 5 years for them.\n\nMy point was that since we have machines made in the 80s that are still running, 5 years is not acceptable as a lifespan. Even if a machine is made obsolete, it should have a significantly longer lifespan. And I argued that swapping a part with another one that both parties know will fail is not a repair.\n\nI made the argument that if a part is known to have catastrophic failure on an airplane, we don't replace that part with the same model, but with a fixed design. At that stage they wouldn't comment anymore.\n\nA current situation is very similar with the Boeing 737 where it was found that, on some planes, a critical component started to fail at 1/3 of its expected lifespan. My assumption is that the component will not be replaced with one that has the same flaw.\n\nThe short version of my question is \"who is right?\" :)\n\nBut the real question is:\n\nWhat is the accepted expectation of 'repair', according to the law?\n\nIs it:\n\n* put a product back in service, regardless of what may happen later? This would probably be the literal meaning of the word,\nor\n* perform work on a product so that the part repaired will perform for its expected lifespan?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [australia](/questions/tagged/australia \"show questions tagged 'australia'\")\n\nAustralian Consumer Law you are entitled to a [repair, replacement or refund](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/consumer-rights-guarantees/repair-replace-refund) if the product does not meet a [consumer gurantee](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/consumer-rights-guarantees/consumer-guarantees).\n\n> If you have a minor problem with a product or service, the business can choose to give you a free repair instead of a replacement or refund.

This is where to begin the analysis.\n\nOften, when parents aren't married there is a custody decree from a court that spells out who does and does not have custody of a child with respect to issues like medical care, but it does not appear that this is the case here.\n\nThe way paternity law works is that there are certain circumstances which cause someone to be presumed to be a parent until disproven (a couple of which are conclusive presumptions that can't be overcome with facts at some point), but a lack of a presumption doesn't mean that you aren't a parent, just that it is harder to prove that you are a parent. \n\nSomeone who is, or is presumed to be, a parent, continues to be a parent until that status is legally terminated (usually in a legal proceeding, but sometimes by operation of law). Since you are an actual parent, you continue to be a parent and have that authority, until that status in terminated for purposes of the law or until a court order limits your parental authority.\n\nA lack of a father's name on a birth certificate does not create a presumption that a child does not have a father or that you are not a father, although the name of a different man on a birth certificate does create a presumption which can become conclusive at some point, that the person named on the birth certificate is the father. \n\nOften this presumption becomes conclusive after five years, although I haven't (as I write this) confirmed that this is the case in New York. It isn't clear from the question if there is a different man named as a father on the birth certificate although it sounds as if it simply fails to name any father. And, often paternity petitions are disfavored or disallowed once a child turns eighteen for at least some purposes.\n\nA [written acknowledgement of paternity](http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/family-court-act/fct-sect-516-a.html) delivered to the appropriate vital statistics record keeping office can establish paternity if not contested. The [standard version](https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/family/paternityAcknowledgment.shtml) of [this form](https://www.childsupport.ny.gov/dcse/aop_howto.html) must be signed by both parents, in each case before two witnesses.\n\nThe extent to which you are acknowledged as the parent of the child by the mother and others, and the extent to which you are involved in a child's life is also relevant to legal paternity, because a termination of parental rights can proceed in the absence of showing these things. The fact that the child share's your last name and that you are actively involved enough in the child's life to make it seem unlikely that this could be established even if a proceeding was brought, and in the absence of a formal termination of parental rights proceeding, you would not normally have your legal status as a parent terminated.\n\nSo, probably, you are legally the child's parent whose authority is not limited by any custody decree, and therefore, you are entitled to authorize a vaccination. But, for a wide variety of reasons, it would be prudent to have your paternity formally established under the law if you are going to have an ongoing involvement in your child's life.\n\nAlso, as DaleM notes, if you have the child with you, even if you are not the legal parent, you would usually be considered \"in loco parentis\" and have the authority to do this even in the absence of actual paternity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In New York State, an unmarried father who is not listed on his child's birth certificate wants to have his 4.5-year-old son vaccinated against the mother's wishes.

I am confused why the two bases are **different**, and what **impact** they give to us in today's claim handling.\n\nThank you. Any help is welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Strict Liability**\n\nThis [means](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/strict_liability) that a defendant is liable for committing the action and it does not matter what his mental state was nor what he intended to do when he committed the action. Easy examples are possession of narcotics (you have them, it doesn't matter what you were going to do with them, you're liable) or statutory rape (it doesn't matter if she said she was 18, if she showed a (fake) ID, etc., if you sleep with someone underage, you're liable).\n\n**Negligence**\n\nThis is [failing](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/negligence) to behave with a level of care that a reasonable person would have behaved with under the same conditions. In order to prevail on negligence claim, one must establish four elements:\n\n1. the existence of a legal duty from the other person to you\n2. the other person's breach of that duty\n3. you having suffered an injury\n4. proof that the breach of that legal duty was the cause of that injury\n\nWhile usually this has to do with actions taken (e.g., you negligently sped your car out of a parking lot...) in situations where there is a duty to act, even an omission can suffice.\n\n**The Difference?**\n\nStrict Liability and Negligence are both standards are liability. Put simply, negligence law requires a defendant to pay for the harms done by their unreasonable activity; strict liability requires a defendant to pay for all harms caused by their activity, regardless of whether the activity was reasonable or unreasonable.\n\n**Res Ipsa**\n\n[Res Ipsa Loquitur](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/res_ipsa_loquitur) doesn't apply to strict liability. Strict liability is *strictly* the simple formulation described above: you did it, it's on you. None of your \"But\\-buts...\" or proclamations of \"I was misled!\" are going to get you off the hook.\n\nRes Ipsa Loquitur is Latin for \"the thing speaks for itself.\" Basically, it allows a Plaintiff to create a rebuttable presumption of negligence by the defendant by proving three things:\n\n1. The thing that happened was the type of thing that generally doesn't happen without negligence.\n2. It was caused by something solely under control of the defendant.\n3. The plaintiff did not contribute to causing that thing that happened.\n\n**Difference in Final Compensation**\n\nThis is hard to answer because of the types of cases usually found applying each. Strict liability is usually seen in criminal law in the ways described above and in tort law in specific circumstances... One is owning an abnormally dangerous animal and another is conducting abnormally dangerous activities. The dangerous animal concept is why pitbill owners don't want the breed classified as a \"dangerous breed.\"\n\nNonetheless, though, here's a [Harvard](https://cyber.harvard.edu/bridge/LawEconomics/neg-liab.htm) article actually comparing compensation in strict liability vs. negligence lawsuits!\n\nI hope this helps.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner installs a trampoline in their backyard without any safety enclosure.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The homeowner would likely be held strictly liable, as trampolines are considered inherently dangerous objects.\n\nB) The homeowner could only be found liable if the child's parents can prove negligence in the trampoline's installation or maintenance.\n\nC) The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur would automatically apply, shifting the burden of proof to the homeowner.\n\nD) The homeowner would likely be judged under a negligence standard, but res ipsa loquitur could potentially be invoked to create a rebuttable presumption of negligence.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This situation would most likely be judged under a negligence standard, not strict liability. Trampolines are not typically classified as \"abnormally dangerous\" objects that would trigger strict liability. The homeowner's duty of care and whether they breached it by not installing a safety enclosure would be key factors.\n\nRes ipsa loquitur could potentially apply here, as trampoline accidents without safety measures might be seen as something that doesn't typically occur without negligence, the trampoline was under the homeowner's control, and the child likely didn't contribute to the accident. However, res ipsa loquitur is not automatic and only creates a rebuttable presumption of negligence.\n\nOption A is incorrect because trampolines aren't typically subject to strict liability.

You should speak to him and let him know that you feel his herbicide made its way (it could've come with the wind if its just on the borders) to the land, and as a result your animals were harmed. It's always better to see if you can handle this by appealing to his sense of responsibility. Just ask him to not spray the border, or not spray on a day with any breeze if he insists on spraying the entirety of his land. If he denies spraying the border (or at all), you can try to catch him in the act and film it, or find neighboring witnesses, such that you can file a complaint for trespass. It is probably not illegal in the true sense of the word, but it may subject him to damages. \n\nYou may try contacting your department of agriculture.\n\nIf he is a commercial applicator there are likely regulations that dictate the necessity of following label instructions or specific regulations or laws in your community that may also subject him to liability under common law, if the pesticide drift enters the properties of others (like yours) and causes damage. While pesticide particles carried by air may cause harm to people, your type of damage or damage to another's agricultural crops is the typical claim made and the typical measure of damages. More\\-so when they drift to organic crops. \n\nGenerally, plaintiff(s) must show that defendant(s) breached either the label instruction or a regulatory provision to succeed in recovering damages outside of common law. Typically, there are labeling instructions or regulatory provisions that limit spray drift. \n\nIs he spraying whole fields such that you think he is purchasing commercial amounts? \n\nIf he is just spraying his small field or plot of land, you will have to establish a claim for trespass in order to recover damages. You also must be able to prove damages \u2013 e.g., veterinarian bills, loss of use of the animals for plowing or whatever. You have to have show the act (spraying), causation (the cause and effect) and damages (the actual effect to you that brought about specific damages) to make a claim. So far, you don't seem to have actual evidence of the act, although if you can acquire that, causation seems to be met, as well as the potential to show specific damages.\n\nUnfortunately, the pain and suffering of animals does not have the same impact or carry any of the same rights as people incurring some sort of physical harm. It must be some actual quantifiable damage to you. Only you can determine what this is. \n\nIn neighborly disputes, the measure of damages is often not worth the cost of litigation. Sad but true.\n\nAs a plaintiff (if it comes to that), you'll need to establish trespass or another common law cause of action as a basis for the recovery. Or you could seek equitable relief (ask the court to order he stop the practice). These claims prove challenging for plaintiffs to establish because of the common usage of pesticides. Also, strict liability is generally not available as a cause of action. You may have a claim in nuisance, but you still must show those three elements of proof. There are typically laws that preempt negligence claims concerning labeling (like in the US), and remaining negligence claims tend to be difficult to prove, for the very reason you stated (you didn't see him do it but you know he did).\n\nThis means that in order to show you (or your chattel) were injured by spray drift you will probably have to file a claim in trespass. However, chemical spray drift is so intangible it is difficult for plaintiffs to meet the requirements for a trespass claim. States\u2019 approaches to trespass for securing damages resulting from spray drift vary, and this can mean that a plaintiff must carefully plead interference with exclusive possession (your right to the land) together with injury meaning substantial property damages or damage that is physical, to establish their cause of action in trespass.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a case of suspected pesticide drift causing harm to animals on rented land in England, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal options available to the affected party?\n\nA) The affected party can immediately file a criminal complaint with the police, as pesticide drift is inherently illegal.\n\nB) The affected party must only prove that the animals were harmed to successfully claim damages, regardless of evidence of the spraying act.\n\nC) The affected party should first attempt to resolve the issue by speaking with the suspected sprayer and, if unsuccessful, gather evidence of the act, causation, and specific damages before considering legal action.\n\nD) The affected party can easily claim for the pain and suffering of the animals as the primary basis for damages in a civil suit.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate based on the information provided. The documentation suggests a step-wise approach: first, attempting to resolve the issue amicably by speaking with the suspected sprayer. If this fails, the affected party should gather evidence of the spraying act, establish causation between the spraying and the harm caused, and document specific, quantifiable damages. This approach aligns with the legal principles outlined, including the need to prove trespass or nuisance, and the challenges in establishing claims without direct evidence. The other options are incorrect because: A) pesticide drift is not inherently illegal and immediate criminal action is not advised; B) proof of harm alone is insufficient without evidence of the act and causation; and D) animal pain and suffering alone are not typically considered for damages in these cases, as the documentation explicitly states that quantifiable damage to the owner is required."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64407/is-a-contract-allowed-to-have-illegal-unenforceable-clauses", "docs_id": 64407, "title": "Is a contract allowed to have illegal / unenforceable clauses?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My understand of contract law in general, is that an illegal or unenforceable clause does not render the whole contract void, but rather that specific clause is essentially stricken out, as if it did not exist.\n\nSo, if an employment contract has a clause which said \u2018in order to resign you must kill a man\u2019 that clause would not apply, because it would require illegal behaviour.\n\nOr, in a legal system which had a maximum one month notice period, a clause which required three months notice would not be enforceable.

If the severed portion leaves a remainder that does not meet the requirements of a contract (e.g. because the severance totally removed one party\u2019s consideration), then the whole contract is void.\n\nSimilarly, if the severed item is central to the purpose of the contract, then the whole contract is void.\n\nFinally, at least in Common Law countries, there is a difference between provisions that are unenforcable (e.g. unfair restraint of trade clauses) and those that are illegal (e.g. your murder before resignation clause).\n\nIn most jurisdictions, if a provision is unenforcable at common law or through statute, severability is an option. However, if the provision is illegal, then responses differ.\n\nIn England and Wales, a provision that requires criminality or the commission of a tort cannot be severed \\- the illegality 'infects' the entire contract and makes the whole thing void. However, in Australia, the degree of illegality matters \\- heinous illegality infects the entire contract, but incidental illegality may not. For example, see [*REW08 Projects Pty Ltd v PNC Lifestyle Investments PTY LTD* \\[2017] NSWCA 269 \\[23 October 2017]](https://www.turnbullhill.com.au/articles/illegal-contract-void-enforceable/) \\- the NSW Court of Appeal ruled that a property sale that contained clauses designed (by both parties) to defraud the state of Stamp Duty was nevertheless enforceable against the vendor \\- this would likely have been decided the other way in England and Wales.\n\nOf course, many contracts make express provision for unenforcable terms in what are known as severability clauses. These can go further than mere severance and allow the court to add words or even redraft entire sections to preserve the contract. However, this is not a [panacea](https://whitmanlegalsolutions.com/blog/severability-clause) because what you agreed to in your severability clause may not be what you thought you agreed to when the rubber hits the road. For example, when you are forced to sell your Picasso for the 1,000USD deposit only, and you can't get the 100,000,000,000 Iranian Rial balance due to US sanctions.\n\n**Therefore, deliberately leaving unenforcable provisions in a contract is dangerous because you don't know what you are going to get.**\n\nHowever, is it unlawful?\n------------------------\n\nWell, that depends.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with making legally unenforceable agreements. You and I can agree to go to the movies this Thursday. That's an unenforcable social arrangement, not a contract. If you stand me up, I can't sue you even if I bought popcorn for you.\n\nSimilarly, there is no prohibition on having unenforcable terms in an otherwise legally binding contract, particularly if everyone knows they are unenforcable. Indeed, many large contracts are accompanied by Memorandums of Understanding that are unenforcable statements about how various organisations intend to work together to give effect to the contract.\n\nHowever, if the term is included to be deceptive or misleading by one party against the other (intentionally or otherwise), there may be legal consequences. A person who was misled into entering a contract may be able to have that contract declared void. Also, many jurisdictions make misleading and deceptive conduct in trade or commerce an offence.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company includes a clause in its employment contract stating that employees must give 3 months' notice before resigning, despite knowing that the legal maximum notice period in their jurisdiction is 1 month.

Colorado Civil Rights Commission* 584 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2018\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission) ([Docket via Justia](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/584/16-111/)) was not settled on the merits. The Commission decision against the cake maker was overturned on procedural grounds, and no final decision on the merits has been made to date, to the best of my knowledge. And as Trish points out, the baker claimed that the law was, in effect, forcing him to use his individual artistic talents to make a statement endorsing a view that he deemed religiously wrong.\n\nNote that anti\\-discrimination laws are not an inherent right, they are statutes, created in the US by Congress and the state legislatures, and they prohibit just what the legislators have chosen to prohibit. For most of the history of the US there were no such laws, and Congress could repeal them tomorrow if it chose. So in a sense the only real reason **why** the laws grant certain religious exemptions is because Congress (or the various state legislatures) has said so.\n\nThe actual exemption is found in [42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2000e\u20131 (a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-1) which provides that:\n\n> This subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the employment of aliens outside any State, or to a religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect to the employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities.\n\nThus it exempts a \"religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society\" from complying with that part of the anti\\-discrimination law that refers to **employment**. That would particularly be [42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2000e\u20132 (a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2) which provides that:\n\n> (a) Employer practices \\-\\- It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014  \n> \n> (a) (1\\) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or  \n> \n> (a) (2\\) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\n\nThere is a further similar but more limited exemption in 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 2000e\u20132 (e)\n\nIt would pretty obviously violate the free exercise clause to require a religious organization to hire, say, priests, ministers, or other religious leaders regardless of religion. But the exemption goes farther than that. A church may discriminate on religion, or on race or sex, say, in hiring janitors or other people whose functions have nothing to do with religion. Nothing in the US Constitution requires that broad an exemption. But on the other hand, nothing forbids it either. That was the decision of Congress, and was no doubt in part the product of a political compromise. There is a long history in the US of providing churches and other religious organizations a degree of exemption from ordinary laws, and this is in line with that tradition. Beyond that, why this particular exemption and not a somewhat narrower one was chose, is a matter of politics, not law.\n\nThe question asserts:\n\n> Government sanctioned religions prayer is already illegal per \"Engel v. Vitale\".\n\nThat is an over\\-broad reading of [*Engel v. Vitale*, 370 U.S. 421 (1962\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_v._Vitale). In that case (as the Wikipedia article puts it):\n\n> the Court ruled that it is unconstitutional for state officials to compose an official school prayer and encourage its recitation in public schools, due to violation of the First Amendment. ... The Court held that the mere promotion of a religion \\[by the government] is sufficient to establish a violation, even if that promotion is not coercive.\n\nThe case focused on the fact that the government had composed the text of the prayer in question, and that encouragement to recite it was a matter of official government policy.

The only potential minimum amount mentioned is $20, as per Section 22, which states that executions issued by a district court for damages exceeding twenty dollars shall be framed to direct a levy upon the lands and tenements of the debtor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no $200,000 threshold mentioned in the law.

Option D is incorrect because the seizure is not limited to Superior Court orders; district courts can also issue such executions.\n\nThe correct answer highlights that as long as the judgment exceeds the minimal amount of $20 and the property is not exempt, it can potentially be seized and sold, regardless of the judgment amount in relation to the property value.

Once that image is hashed and discarded, it will use that hash to verify the identity of that person, using websites that are commonly used such as Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr, once identity is confirmed it will crawl known and common dating websites. My question is, Is this first part of data collection against any type of law, because the crawler will also extract not only the person's identity, but also if they are married, and to whom they are married to. \n\nWhich leads me to my second question, in the event that no laws are broken, what should the Terms of Service and legal disclaimer cover, to keep any type of legal recourse from coming back onto me as the owner/webmaster of the site.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> ...using websites that are commonly used such as Facebook, Twitter,\n>  and Tumblr, once identity is confirmed it will crawl known and common\n>  dating websites.\n\nRead the TOS for each of the sites your crawler or bot will access.

If the TOS says no automated access is allowed, then automated access by you and your software could get you in legal trouble. The penalties for breaking their TOS would be civil in nature; each service could take you to court individually.\n\nYou may be able to enter into a licensing agreement with each service to be able to crawl the content under their TOS; that's up to you and a lawyer.\n\nAs to your second question: \n\n> ...what should the Terms of Service and legal disclaimer cover...\n\nTalk to a lawyer to draw up a TOS for your software and service; Law SE is not for legal advice, as per the Law SE TOS: <https://law.stackexchange.com/help/disclaimer>\n\nAnd, in fact, if you are \n\n> in the process of building a web\\-based framework to implement a search\n>  engine based on Facial Recognition...\n\nthen you should talk to a lawyer before you go to far down the development path with an App that could possibly be a legal liability.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A developer is creating a facial recognition search engine that crawls social media and dating websites.

Bob, as a financial advisor, falls into this category. He should have reported Rob's initial offer, as it constituted suspicious activity related to potential money laundering. His failure to do so is an offense. \n\nThe fact that the money laundering has now occurred doesn't change Bob's original duty, but it does mean that Bob now has knowledge of an actual crime, which he is still obligated to report.

How might a more conscientious tool creator properly declare that their tool's contributions can be merged in without licensing and IP problems?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As @amon stated in a comment, copyright requires creativity. If the author of a tool wants to claim copyright on the output of that tool, then that output must contain something that required the creativity of the tool author.\n\nFor a tool that just re\\-indents its input, the output is created from the input with a mechanical, non\\-creative, transformation and the output does not contain any creative content that wasn't already present in the input. For that reason, authors of such tools can't claim any copyright on the output.\n\nFor a tool like `bison`, which was mentioned in the comments, the output contains a measurable amount of creative content that was *not* present in the input, but which was provided by the authors of `bison`. For that reason, the authors of 'bison' *do* have a copyright claim on the output of the tool (for which they give a broad permission to use).\n\nSo, the basic question becomes, how much of the (creative) content of the output can be traced back to the tool itself and not to the input that the tool processed. For linters/formatters, that is likely to be very little. For code generators, it can be anywhere between very little and all of the output. \n\nThe license restrictions on the code produced by the tool itself are by default the same as the license restrictions on the source of the tool, but the tool author can choose to apply any other license to the tool code that ends up in the output.  \n\nIf the output of the tool is, at least in part, dependent on an input file, then the authors of the input file also have a copyright claim on the tool output (as their creative work influenced the output), so the tool author can not claim exclusive ownership.\n\nThe usual situation is that for tools that don't add creative content to the output, the author explicitly states that the don't have any copyright claims on the output.  \n\nFor tools that *do* add creative content, that content might be released under very permissive conditions (like, \"you can use the output as a whole for any purpose, but you can only separate out the code that comes from the tool's codebase if you adhere to the \\<X\\> license\")", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company develops an AI-powered code refactoring tool that automatically suggests and implements complex code restructuring in GitHub repositories.

My understanding is that you bought a domain from a provider, and they allowed you to use a web server for some period.

If under the contract you agree to pay a certain amount per year, then you have been racking up charges for some time, and you would need to actually cancel. Ultimately, they could take you to court to force you to pay what you owe, although usually there are less drastic intermediate steps. In court, they would produce their documents to show that you owe money, and your attorney would somehow counter, perhaps by alleging that you had a good\\-faith belief that the contract had been terminated. It is possible that they simply messed up and failed to send you an invoice earlier, which could explain the lack of invoice.

Depending on what jurisdiction you're in, it may be that by creating a record of yourself going about fulfilling your obligations in public employment, you've created a record subject to the state's public\\-records laws. If that's the case, then the government may, in fact, have not just a right but a duty to take custody of the original recordings.\n\nIt might seem strange because you made the recordings on your own initiative using your own tapes or whatever, but you might think of it like someone who brought their own paper into the office and then used it to type up correspondence or the agency's budget.

Those are still the government's records, even if an employee decided to create them using personal media.\n\nIt's a really weird situation all\\-around.

It seems very strange that a person at a company who might be interested in using the nonprofit's services cannot even be sent a one\\-line opt\\-in request to receive more details on LinkedIn. **Any thoughts gratefully appreciated.**\n\nSome solutions I have considered:\n\n1. Take advantage of the difference between 'corporate subscribers' and 'individual subscribers' in the UK's implementation of the ePrivacy Directive (PECR), which [allows direct marketing to employees' corporate email addresses](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/direct-marketing/business-to-business-marketing/). *Only applies to the UK and probably does not apply to LinkedIn.*\n2. Phone the individual concerned to obtain consent prior to sending a message. *Requires knowing the phone number and is time\\-consuming.*\n3. Contact the company's official email address (e.g. info@company.com) instead. *Impractical as reply rate is very low from such addresses.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You seem to have a solid understanding of the ePrivacy implications, but lack a fundamental insight: your organization does not have a right to achieve its mission or a right to disseminate unwanted marketing. But other people do have a right to not be subject to excessive marketing.\n\nOf course, reality is more complex, so it's probably not entirely impossible to do marketing.\n\n* In your point 1, you note that some EU/EEA/UK countries distinguish ePrivacy protections between consumer and business subscribers. You can research the exact rules in the potential customer's country. This may allow you to email corporate/business accounts.\n\nI would strongly advise against messaging via Linkedin if there is a chance that the person is using that account for personal purposes like networking or hunting jobs, not just for conducting official company business.\n* ePrivacy has markedly different rules for email marketing vs phone marketing. Whereas there are pretty strict rules for electronic messages and robocalls, manual cold calling can be OK from an ePrivacy perspective. However, many EU/EEA/UK countries have rules that go beyond ePrivacy, and may have a kind of do\\-not\\-call registry that you must respect. Of course manual calls take more effort than spamming emails, but recall the above point that you don't have a right to spam other people.\n\nPhone calls are probably the most appropriate approach when the company lists individuals' phone numbers on its website. This will at least give you a few seconds of attention with a real human, more than you can expect from an email that is likely to be caught by spam filters.\n* Marketing via physical mail tends to have very lax rules. Note that every company/business that has a website will have to disclose its contact details including an address there, so this information is easy to acquire. However, chances are low that anyone would seriously engage with that marketing.\n* You can consider alternatives to direct marketing, so that interested companies eventually come to you. Things like press releases, writing guest articles in industry publications, speaking at relevant conferences, working on search engine optimization, buying ads.\n\nOn the GPDR aspects:\nGDPR and ePrivacy overlap, and it is necessary to comply with both sets of rules (GDPR likely applies here via Art 3(2\\)(a)). But where they potentially contradict each other, ePrivacy as the more specific law has precedence. For example, ePrivacy overrides the default GDPR legal basis rules when it comes to email marketing to existing customers (opt\\-out basis, no consent needed) or to using cookies (needs consent unless strictly necessary).\n\nInformation that relates to corporations is not personal data, but information that relates to individual employees or to sole proprietors would typically be personal data. Since you are unlikely to obtain consent for using this data, you would need an alternative GDPR legal basis such as a \"legitimate interest\".\n\nRelying on a legitimate interest requires that you conduct a balancing test, weighing your interests like marketing against the recipient's interests, rights, and freedoms. Core question in this context is whether the data subject can reasonably expect their personal data to be used like this, taking into account the nature of their relationship with you. Since there is no pre\\-existing relationship, claims of a legitimate interest are weak to start with. However, it may be possible to argue that when a company makes employee contact details available via its website (not LinkedIn!) then relevant marketing can be reasonably expected.

While it's not mandatory to use the emergency brake when parking in Germany, proving that its use wouldn't have prevented the collision due to the force of impact is a strong defense against liability. This aligns with the principle that Party A should not be held responsible for unforeseeable circumstances beyond their control.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using only the gear (not the e-brake) for parking isn't automatically negligent. Option B oversimplifies the situation by ignoring the crucial role of the hit-and-run driver (Party C). Option C, while seemingly logical, overstates the insurance company's obligations - they aren't required to investigate every aspect claimed by the insured.\n\nThe correct answer emphasizes the importance of demonstrating that the damage was unavoidable given the circumstances, which is a key factor in determining liability in such cases."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/71067/does-an-active-case-before-an-inquest-jury-give-rise-to-contempt-rules", "docs_id": 71067, "title": "Does an active case before an inquest jury give rise to contempt rules?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The horrible [Plymouth shooting](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58202760.amp) has now led to an inquest into the deaths there, and an inquest jury will be summoned for the haring in coroner's court.\n\nIf the gunman had survived and was to be criminally tried, there would be very strict rules about what anyone could say on social media because of contempt of court laws designed to protect the integrity of the jury's ruling.\n\nDo any such contempt rules apply to an inquest jury, or can I tweet whatever I like about what I think about the way this tragedy occurred?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: * **Do any such contempt rules apply to an inquest jury?**\n\n**YES** but only if [section 2(3\\) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49/section/2?timeline=false) applies:\n\n> ... only if the proceedings in question are **active** within the meaning of this section at the time of the publication.\n\n[Schedule 1, paragraph 12 of the 1981 Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49/schedule/1?timeline=false) identifies that an inquest becomes active once the [coroner beings their investigation](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/1?timeline=false) which in this case was [on 19/08/21](https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/live-plymouth-shooting-coroners-inquest-5806212).\n\n* **Can I tweet whatever I like about what I think about the way this tragedy occurred?**\n\n**NO**, one would be in contempt if the publication falls within [section 2(2\\) of the 1981 Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/49/section/2?timeline=false) so it...\n\n> ... creates a substantial risk that the course of justice in the proceedings in question will be seriously impeded or prejudiced.\n\nThis latter requirement allows for things like fact\\-specific reporting (such as my 19/08/21 link).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of an inquest jury for a tragic event like the Plymouth shooting, which of the following statements is correct regarding contempt of court rules and social media commentary?\n\nA) Contempt rules never apply to inquest juries, so people can freely comment on social media about the case.\n\nB) Contempt rules apply to inquest juries only after the coroner begins their investigation, and social media comments are restricted if they create a substantial risk of seriously impeding or prejudicing the course of justice.\n\nC) Contempt rules apply to inquest juries from the moment the tragic event occurs, and all social media commentary about the case is strictly prohibited.\n\nD) Contempt rules apply to inquest juries, but only fact-specific reporting is allowed on social media, with no opinions permitted.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the Contempt of Court Act 1981, contempt rules apply to inquest juries once the proceedings become \"active,\" which occurs when the coroner begins their investigation.

This is based on several key points from the provided information:\n\n1. For stays longer than 3 months in temporary accommodations like hostels or pensions, standard registration rules apply.

[32 CFR Part 809a](https://ecfr.io/Title-32/pt32.6.809a#se32.6.809a_13) grants authority\nto the base commander to enforce order within Air Force installations, and I believe that there are similar provisions in Part 631 which grant authority to enforce order to the base commander of an Army base. These codes apply to civilians as well as members of the military.\nI doubt that there is a specific \"no shirt, no service\" statute passed by Congress. Instead, it is a consequence of the fact that the base commander can establish rules of conduct that includes a dress code, when a person is on a military installation (where permission is required to enter). However, it is difficult to find a official online written statement of dress code which is also applicable to civilians.\n\nIf we suppose that on this particular base there is no dress code but the guard mistakenly / over\\-zealously thought there is one, (military) disciplinary action could be taken against the guard.

While there may not be a specific federal law requiring shirts on military bases, base commanders have the authority to establish and enforce rules of conduct, including dress codes, for both military personnel and civilians on the installation. This authority is granted by regulations such as 32 CFR Part 809a for Air Force installations, with similar provisions for other branches. The inconsistent enforcement does not necessarily make the requirement illegal, as the guard is likely acting under the perceived authority of base regulations.

REGISTRATION REQUIRED; GENERAL RULE](http://tx.elaws.us/law/tn_title7_chapter502_sec.502.040):\n\n> a) Not more than 30 days after purchasing a vehicle or becoming a resident of this state, the owner of **a motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer** shall apply for the registration of the vehicle for:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) each registration year in which the vehicle is used or to be used on a public highway; and\n> \n> \n> (2\\) if the vehicle is unregistered for a registration year that has begun and that applies to the vehicle and if the vehicle is used or to be used on a public highway, the remaining portion of that registration year.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nNow, you might argue that this requires owners of motor vehicles also to register their non\\-motorized vehicles, but I doubt that this is the prevailing interpretation. Regardless, an Amish person who does *not* own a motor vehicle is certainly not required by this subsection to register horse\\-drawn vehicles.\n\nSimilarly, the requirement to hold a driver's license is at [Sec. 521\\.021\\. LICENSE REQUIRED](http://tx.elaws.us/law/tn_title7_chapter521_sec.521.021):\n\n> A person, other than a person expressly exempted under this chapter, may not operate **a motor vehicle** on a highway in this state unless the person holds a driver's license issued under this chapter.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nSimilarly, this requirement does not apply to the operation of a horse\\-drawn vehicle.\n\nIn other words, one statement in your question is incorrect:\n\n> A driver's license is required for all persons \"driving\" a vehicle.\n\nIn fact, a driver's license is generally required to drive a *motor* vehicle (and even there, exceptions exist).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Texas Transportation Code, which of the following statements is correct regarding the operation of horse-drawn carriages on public highways?\n\nA) Operators of horse-drawn carriages are required to have a driver's license.\nB) Horse-drawn carriages must be registered with the state within 30 days of purchase.\nC) Amish people are exempt from all vehicle regulations due to religious reasons.\nD) No driver's license is required to operate a horse-drawn carriage on public highways.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe Texas Transportation Code specifically requires driver's licenses and vehicle registration for motor vehicles, not for all vehicles. The driver's license requirement in Sec. 521.021 states that a license is needed to operate a \"motor vehicle\" on a highway. Similarly, the registration requirement in Sec. 502.040 applies to \"motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer\" owners. \n\nHorse-drawn carriages do not fall under the category of motor vehicles. Therefore, operators of horse-drawn carriages, including Amish people, are not required to have a driver's license or register their carriages with the state. This is not due to a specific exemption for the Amish, but because the law does not require licenses or registration for non-motorized vehicles.\n\nOption A is incorrect because driver's licenses are only required for motor vehicles. Option B is wrong as registration is not required for non-motorized vehicles. Option C is incorrect because there isn't a blanket exemption for Amish people; rather, the regulations simply don't apply to their horse-drawn carriages.
