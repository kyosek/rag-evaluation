And are those constraints known to the jury? For instance, there was a last minute witness that somehow offered herself up to testify, a very crucial character witness, that i would have thought the plaintiff would spare no expense in finding. There was a photo expert that was somehow prevented from talking about colors, there is a lot of confusion about the existence or non\\-existence of a wall mounted phone, but both parties have refrained from showing images of the wall that the phone should have hung on \\- although the existence of such photos is a near certainty, etc.\n\nSo my questions: How are such no\\-show\\-no\\-tell boundaries established, does the jury get to know them, and is this also in the public record somehow?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> How are such no\\-show\\-no\\-tell boundaries established\n\nThey largely stem from the rules of evidence which are complicated, vary from state to state and knowing which is a big part of what litigation attorneys are paid for.\n\nParties to litigation become aware of all the evidence/topics that their counterparts wish to broach in the courtroom well in advance \u2014 during [discovery](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law)). They will usually disagree whether some bits and pieces can be presented to the jury. In this case the court will hold admissibility hearings \u2014 again, well in advance before the trial.\n\nDespite all the preparations, some of these disagreements arise *during* the trial, and then they are resolved in place by way of voiced objections. The attorneys and the judge talk about them using professional jargon of the rules of evidence \u2014 having themselves seen all the evidence in advance.\n\n> does the jury get to know them\n\nNo, the jury doesn't need to follow the professional talk. In fact, they should hear as little as possible of it \u2014 which is the reason why admissibility disagreements are resolved in advance as much as possible. If serious issues arise during the trial, the judge will ask the attorneys to speak to them in chambers \u2014 away from the jury. Or they will ask the jury to take a break while the professionals talk.\n\nThe jury just needs to listen to the evidence that is allowed in, and disregard any evidence the judge say they have to.\n\n> is this also in the public record somehow?\n\nIt is in the court record. It may be accessible to the public if the court allows. If someone wishes to see the record they need to apply to the court, provide reasons and a judge will decide if anything can be released."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a high-profile trial, which of the following statements is true regarding the handling of evidence and information that is not presented to the jury?\n\nA) The jury is fully informed about all evidence and witnesses that were excluded from the trial, including the reasons for their exclusion.\n\nB) Admissibility hearings are typically held during the trial, with the jury present, to determine what evidence can be presented.\n\nC) The rules of evidence vary by state, and decisions about admissibility are often made well in advance of the trial through processes like discovery and pre-trial hearings.\n\nD) The court record containing information about excluded evidence and witnesses is automatically made public and easily accessible to anyone interested in the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The rules of evidence do vary by state, and many decisions about what can be presented at trial are made well in advance through processes like discovery and pre-trial admissibility hearings. This allows attorneys to prepare their cases knowing what evidence will be allowed.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the jury is not informed about excluded evidence or witnesses, as this could bias their decision-making.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while some admissibility issues may arise during the trial, many are resolved in advance to avoid disruptions. When issues do come up during the trial, they are often discussed away from the jury.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the court record is not automatically made public.

The WhatsApp messages can be considered as evidence, but their evidentiary value is not absolute and depends on several factors:\n\n1. Authentication: While the messages can be presented as evidence that they were sent from John's account, he could claim that someone else used his phone or that the messages were forged.\n\n2.

The documentation specifically mentions that tax-exempt interest is considered income for child support purposes.\n- Unrealized capital gains (the $100,000 appreciation in stock value) are not considered income for child support calculations, as they are not realized gains and do not represent actual income received.\n- The court cannot force John to sell his stocks to increase his income for child support purposes.

In a case like this, the buyer should have known that there was something suspicious going on, and so had a duty to look into things. In any case ignorance is not a legal defense to an accusation of non\\-payment of a tax properly due.\n\nBy the way, it is not a question of a court learning something, but of a tax official, The tax official could refer to matter to a prosecutor, who could bring charges and take the matter to court.\n\nHowever, relatively minor tax issues are most often handled as civil matters with a tax penalty or fine being imposed, and even if it were handled as a criminal matter (unusual for a first offense) the Judge would have the option to impose only a fine.\n\nThe California sales tax rate on autos is currently 7\\.25%, so the tax due would have been something less than $725\\.\n\nThe Californium Sales And Use Tax Law [section 6476](https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/lawguides/vol1/sutl/6476.html) specifies a penalty of 6% of the tax due but not paid. However, this applies to:\n\n> Any person required to make a prepayment pursuant to Section 6471 who fails to make a timely prepayment ...\n\nThat would normally be the seller. Remember these taxers are normally collected by the seller from the buyer, and the seller, particularly one whose business is such sales, must make regular payments to the state. I have not found a law or regulation specifying a penalty rate for the buyer in such a situation, but it is probably a similar rate. Note that a later section specifies a 10% penalty instead of 6% when the non\\-payment is negligent or willful.\n\nThe official page [\"Sales And Use Tax Regulations\"](https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/lawguides/vol1/sutr/1703.html) from the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration (CDTFA) summarizes a number of regulations and sections of law, particularly Regulation 1703\\. It reads in part:\n\n> (c) (1\\) (B) Other Late Payments. A penalty of 10 percent of the amount of all unpaid tax shall be added to any tax not paid in whole or in part within the time required by law.\n> \n> \n> (c) (1\\) (C) Vehicles, Vessels and Aircraft. A purchaser of a vehicle, vessel or aircraft who registers it outside this state for the purpose of evading the payment of sales or use taxes shall be liable for a penalty of 50 percent of any tax determined to be due on the sales price of the vehicle, vessel or aircraft.\n> \n> \n> (c) (3\\) (A) Negligence or Intentional Disregard. A penalty of 10 percent of the amount of the tax specified in the determination shall be added to deficiency determinations if any part of the deficiency for which the determination is imposed is due to negligence or intentional disregard of the Sales and Use Tax Law or authorized regulations.\n> \n> \n> Generally, a penalty for negligence or intentional disregard should not be added to deficiency determinations associated with the first audit of a taxpayer in the absence of evidence establishing that any bookkeeping and reporting errors cannot be attributed to the taxpayer's good faith and reasonable belief that its bookkeeping and reporting practices were in substantial\n> compliance with the requirements of the Sales and Use Tax Law or authorized regulations.\n> \n> \n> (c) (3\\) (C) Fraud or Intent to Evade. A penalty of 25 percent of the amount of the tax specified in a deficiency determination shall be added thereto if any part of the deficiency for which the determination is made is due to fraud or intent to evade the Sales and Use Tax Law or authorized regulations. In the case of a determination for failure to file a return, if such failure is due to fraud or an intent to evade the Sales and Use Tax Law or authorized regulations, a penalty of 25 percent of the amount required to be paid, exclusive of penalties, shall be added thereto in addition to the 10 percent penalty for failure to file a return. Fraud or intent to evade shall be established by clear and convincing evidence.\n> \n> \n> (c) (3\\) (E) (8\\) Relief from Penalty for Reasonable Cause. If the Board finds that a person's failure to make a timely return, payment, or prepayment, or failure to comply with the provisions of section 6074 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is due to reasonable cause and circumstances beyond the person's control, and occurred notwithstanding the exercise of ordinary care and the absence of willful neglect, the person may be relieved of the penalty provided by sections 6074, 6476, 6477, 6480\\.4, 6511, 6565, 6591, and 7051\\.2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code for such failure.\n> \n> \n> Any person seeking to be relieved of the penalty shall file with the Board a statement under penalty of perjury setting forth the facts upon which the claim for relief is based.

The threat of legal action is likely an intimidation tactic, as suing over a subscription dispute would be unusual and potentially costly for the seller.

They explained their purpose in the first section of the bill:\n\n> The legislature finds that a maximum sentence by a court in the state of Washington for a gross misdemeanor can, under federal law, result in the automatic deportation of a person who has lawfully immigrated to the United States, is a victim of domestic violence or a political refugee, even when all or part of the sentence to total confinement is suspended. The legislature further finds that this is a disproportionate outcome, when compared to a person who has been convicted of certain felonies which, under the state's determinate sentencing law, must be sentenced to less than one year and, hence, either have no impact on that person's residency status or will provide that person an opportunity to be heard in immigration proceedings where the court will determine whether deportation is appropriate. Therefore, it is the intent of the legislature to cure this inequity by reducing the maximum sentence for a gross misdemeanor by one day.\n\nIn federal law, [8 USC 1227](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227) (2\\) (A) (I) provides that:\n\n> Any alien who\u2014\n> \n> \n> (I) is convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years (or 10 years in the case of an alien provided lawful permanent resident status under section 1255(j) of this title) after the date of admission, and\n> \n> \n> (II) is convicted of a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed,\n> \n> \n> is deportable.\n\nThe Washington State legislature didn't think that deportation was an appropriate punishment for an alien who committed a gross misdemeanor. Therefore, they reduced the maximum sentence by one day so as not to trigger deportation under 8 USC 1227 (2\\) (A) (I)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the reasoning behind Washington State's decision to change the maximum sentence for gross misdemeanors from \"not more than one year\" to \"up to 364 days\"?\n\nA) To reduce prison overcrowding by shortening sentences for minor offenses\nB) To align state law with federal sentencing guidelines for misdemeanors\nC) To prevent automatic deportation of lawful immigrants convicted of gross misdemeanors under federal immigration law\nD) To create a clear distinction between gross misdemeanors and felonies in the state's legal system\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The Washington State legislature specifically changed the maximum sentence for gross misdemeanors from \"not more than one year\" to \"up to 364 days\" to prevent the automatic deportation of lawful immigrants under federal law. According to 8 USC 1227 (2)(A)(I), non-citizens can be deported if they are convicted of a crime for which a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed. By reducing the maximum sentence by one day, the state legislature aimed to protect lawful immigrants, including victims of domestic violence and political refugees, from facing disproportionate consequences (i.e., deportation) for gross misdemeanors.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because reducing prison overcrowding was not mentioned as a motivation for this change.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the change was not made to align with federal sentencing guidelines, but rather to work around federal immigration law.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because creating a distinction between gross misdemeanors and felonies was not the primary goal of this change. In fact, the legislature noted that some felonies could result in sentences of less than one year, which would not trigger deportation proceedings."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83967/what-happens-if-someone-checks-into-a-hotel-for-a-night-and-refuses-to-leave", "docs_id": 83967, "title": "What happens if someone checks into a hotel for a night and refuses to leave?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Bob checks into a hotel for a night (term; let's say 24 hours) for \u00a340 (rent) and his room isn't shared with anyone else (exclusive possession).

Perhaps the hotel offers complimentary cleaning service, but Bob has the option to invite or refuse this by hanging the paper thingy on his door either on the side that says please clean my room or do not disturb accordingly.\n\nCheckout time comes, and he refuses to leave. He goes out, and they disable his keycard and pack up his stuff so he returns to find it put downstairs in the lobby.\n\nHas Bob been illegally evicted?

There was no renewable or extension clause in the rental agreement. Bob also is not a tenant: he is a guest in a hotel. The Hotel offers cleaning services, as the OP specified.\n\nBy overstaying, his items now were trespassing, the removal was legitimate.\n\nHowever, there is a point at which a short term renting of a hotel becomes living at it. Where this is is often dependant on how long or in what way you stay.\n\n### Where's the line between a Tenant and a Guest?\n\n**THAT** is the operative question. When does a Guest/Lodger become a Tenant and can get eviction protection?\n\n* In [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\") a couple of Hotels actually do have renters with a special rental contract \\- which is vastly different from the normal room rental. For example, the Maritim in Hamburg has year\\-rentals. These are actual renters with a rental contract and eviction protection, that give up some tenant rights for services (e.g. room cleaning service for limits in remodeling). However, overstaying at a hotel can actually become a crime: Einmietbetrug \\- obtaining a room in a hotel or a residency but not wanting to pay or mischaracterizing your ability to do so \\- is a variant of fraud and thus can be punished under [\u00a7263 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__263.html); Under the operating law, a hotel guest is not afforded with all rights of a tenant, unless they are explicitly pointed out like with *longstay* contracts.\n* In [california](/questions/tagged/california \"show questions tagged 'california'\") the line is [30 days](https://www.findlaw.com/realestate/landlord-tenant-law/rights-of-renters-in-extended-stay-hotels.html), in [new\\-york\\-state](/questions/tagged/new-york-state \"show questions tagged 'new-york-state'\") it is the same but they *also* need to not have a different residency.\n* in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\"), the operative case when someone is a lodger or tenant is Brillouet v Landless (**1995**) 28 H.L.R. 836: a hotel Guest is **not** a tenant, even after more than a month of stay. In fact, courts following this case argue, that such a person is only licensed to be on the premises, and the license could be revoked without eviction procedures.\n\nIn fact, the Brillouet v Landless case is very close to the example. Brillouet rented a room in September, and extended the stay. Then he did not pay (or rather, his accommodation services didn't. In October, Landless sought to get rid of Brillouet for non\\-payment, just telling him to leave. Brillouet applied for an injunction against the eviction and got a temporary one (to preserve the status\\-quo) till the hearing. Mere days later, and the first instance court handed out judgement against the application of an injunction to protect Brillouet. The Hotel guest, so the court, was **not** a tenant under the Housing Act 1988:\n\n> The Protection from Eviction Act depends on premises having been let as a dwelling.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of protection from eviction and seeing no tenancy (emphasis mine):\n\n> It is an essential prerequisite of any tenancy that the tenant should have, so it is said in some of the authorities, **exclusive possession**. In my judgment the facts of this case particularly when one bears in mind that Mr Brillouet upon his own assertion avails himself of at least some of the facilities (he goes to the restaurant occasionally for his breakfast) \u2014 come nowhere near demonstrating that he has or has had within this room exclusive occupation. At best in my judgment he could conceivably be a **licensee**. One then has to examine once more the terms of the statute to ascertain whether he is a licensee entitled to protection under the 1977 Act.\n> \n> \n> As the section to which I have alluded makes plain, only licensees who occupy as a dwelling premises which they do occupy are entitled to protection. If, as in my judgment the facts here clearly demonstrate, **the occupant is no more and no less than a hotel guest properly so\\-called, then the accommodation is not let to the licensee as a dwelling.**\n\n[Street v Mountford (1985\\) AC 809](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1985/4.html) most likely doesn't apply if any hotel services are offered by the hotel. In the case, Mountford was found a tenant because Street did not offer any services beyond the room and furnishings itself. The presence of any service would change the pattern significantly, as the House of Lords decided: It applies *against* Bob if the hotel offers cleaning service/room service, and by offering service beyond the room and the furnishing within it, it is lodging, not a tenancy:\n\n> **The occupier is a\n> lodger if the landlord provides attendance or services which require\n> the landlord or his servants to exercise unrestricted access to and\n> use of the premises**. A lodger is entitled to live in the premises\n> but cannot call the place his own.\n> \n> \n> \\[...] Street provided neither\n> attendance nor services and only reserved the limited rights of\n> inspection and maintenance and the like set forth in clause 3 of\n> the agreement. On the traditional view of the matter, Mrs.\n> Mountford not being a lodger must be a tenant.\n\nMehta v Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (2000\\) 32 H.L.R. 45 doesn't apply, as that case revolved around a *verbal contract with the manager for 6 month exclusive use of rooms*. Mehta became a tenant by that contract and eviction protection applied.\n\nIn contrast, due to how agreements with hotels are generally written, Westminster CC v Clarke (1992\\) might apply: If the contact specified that the hotel does have unlimited access (which is typical) and that reassignments of rooms (like, another guest in the room) might apply, then there is no tenancy.\n\n### *Could* Bob be a tenant?\n\nFor Bob to be a tenant under the E\\&W interpretation (following the pattern established by Street \\& Brillouet), the facts must be such, that several things must be true:\n\n* **Exclusive possession**: No services are offered at all beyond the room. For example, there can't be any shared facilities with the rest of the hotel that Bob has access to, and services such as room cleaning or fresh towels or laundry are not offered either. Not using them is not enough, they can't be offered at all. (both Street, Brillout)\n\t+ If in exclusive Possession, Bob still isn't a tenant if he is what Street calls a *service occupier*. That's an employee who is given a place to sleep in to perform his duties to the employer, like a Butler or Maid. (Street)\n\t+ Bob is also not an owner in fee simple, trespasser or mortgagee in possession, or an object of charity \\- for which all other rules apply. (Street)\n\nIn the alternative, one fact makes them automatically one:\n\n* There was a contract that in its form stipulates they **are** a Tenant (Mehta v RBS)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scenarios would most likely result in Bob being considered a tenant rather than a hotel guest under English law?\n\nA) Bob stays at the hotel for 45 days, using the daily housekeeping service and eating breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning.\n\nB) Bob verbally agrees with the hotel manager to stay for 6 months in a specific room, with no housekeeping or other hotel services provided.\n\nC) Bob stays for 2 weeks in a room with its own kitchenette, but the hotel offers and he occasionally uses the laundry service.\n\nD) Bob stays for 3 months, declining housekeeping services, but has access to the hotel's gym and pool facilities.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the correct answer because it most closely aligns with the conditions that would establish Bob as a tenant rather than a hotel guest. The key factors are:\n\n1. A verbal agreement for a longer-term stay (6 months), which suggests a more permanent arrangement.\n2. No hotel services are provided, which is crucial for establishing exclusive possession.\n3. The agreement is for a specific room, further supporting exclusive possession.\n\nThis scenario is similar to the Mehta v Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (2000) case, where a verbal contract for exclusive use of rooms for 6 months resulted in tenant status.\n\nOptions A, C, and D all involve the provision of hotel services (housekeeping, restaurant, laundry, gym, pool), which would likely categorize Bob as a hotel guest rather than a tenant, based on the Brillouet v Landless (1995) case and the principles established in Street v Mountford (1985)."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16340/how-does-personal-drug-possession-affect-interstate-commerce", "docs_id": 16340, "title": "How does personal drug possession affect interstate commerce?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to the [Controlled Substance Act](http://www.fda.gov/regulatoryinformation/legislation/ucm148726.htm):\n\n> \u00a7 801\\.

In what way does this affect the cannabis market in other states so that Congress has the power to prohibit it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To pick up on your comment 'Does this mean if I wish to build a chair for personal use, then since trade of chairs exists between states, Congress has the authority to outlaw possession or manufacturing of chairs?': Yes.\n\nFor example, the US Congress can legislate to prohibit a farmer from growing wheat for use on his own farm, on the basis that there is interstate trade in wheat and therefore the Commerce Clause permits Congress to regulate the growing of wheat: *Wickard v Filburn* (1942\\) 317 US 111\\.\n\nIf you grow marijuana, or build a chair, or whatever, you conceivably affect the number of marijuanas, chairs, etc that are traded between states. Therefore you affect interstate commerce. Therefore the US Congress can regulate you. The fact that your marijuana or your chair or your what is trivial in the scheme of the national economy is irrelevant if the aggregation of all regulated marijuana, chairs or wheat is significant: 317 US 111, 127\\-128\\.\n\nIf the law didn't prohibit possession of marijuana absolutely but instead prohibited, say, the carrying of marijuana in schools, then the US Congress might have trouble relying on the Commerce Clause: see *United States v Lopez* (1995\\) 514 US 549 and replace 'marijuana' with 'handguns' (OK the marijuana/handgun analogy is bad but hopefully this illustrates that there are at least some limits on Congress' power \\-\\- it's not just 'any physical object that relates whatsoever to interstate trade therefore unfettered federal legislative power')."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the Commerce Clause and the Controlled Substances Act, which of the following activities would most likely be considered beyond Congress's power to regulate?\n\nA) Growing a single marijuana plant in your backyard for personal use\nB) Manufacturing a small amount of synthetic drugs in your home lab for personal consumption\nC) Possessing prescription medications obtained from another state without a valid prescription\nD) Building and using your own chair instead of purchasing one from a store\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) Incorrect.

The key phrase is \"or for which a reimbursement would be available but for the application of contractual limitations such as... waiting periods.\" This indicates that services performed during waiting periods are still considered covered services, even if reimbursement is limited due to the waiting period. Therefore, the dentist is still bound by the contracted prices agreed upon with the insurance company. The dentist's interpretation is incorrect, and the insurance company's letter aligns with the legal definition. This is not a gray area, but a misinterpretation by the dentist of the clear language in the legislation."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84488/i-bought-a-premium-domain-and-now-the-registrar-says-that-domain-wasnt-really-a", "docs_id": 84488, "title": "I bought a premium domain and now the registrar says that domain wasn&#39;t really available for purchase", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I purchased a domain name from a popular domain registrar, I immediately got the confirmation email and receipt for the purchased domain but the domain wasn't added to my account so I contacted the GoDaddy support, they said as I won the domain in auction so it may take up to 7 days to transfer the domain to may account.

However, one cannot just perform any old music in public without permission. [Section 19](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/19) restricts public performance of copyrighted works: that means, in order to publicly perform a work, one needs permission (a performance license).

The father, as the producer of the video, holds copyright to the recording itself. However, the underlying music is still under copyright protection, and the performance at a school event where parents are present constitutes a public performance, which typically requires a license.

He is now 18, 6'9\", 300 pounds, and bearded, resembling Andre the Giant. During each weekly orthodontics visit, the other children in the waiting room are clearly shaken and parents report that their 5 year olds are becoming scared to go to their dentist. They ask if the owner of the practice could kindly talk to the parents of the 18 year old and ask if he could attend an adult dentistry. The owner obliges, not wanting to upset and possibly lose customers. The owner explains the situation to the \"giant's\" parents and offers an alternative practice, one run by the owner's friend from dentistry school who happens to have worked with children for 20 years before opening a general practice, i.e. whose service is equal with that of the current dentists. The parents refuse. Would the owner of the practice be able to deny service to this individual without losing a discrimination lawsuit?\n\nI think this is a pretty interesting question. One, we are dealing with children, who can't expected to be rational actors (e.g. observe that the giant is peacefully going about his business and is perfectly innocuous by the determination of any sane adult), but are also in a sense \"customers\". In addition, there are perfectly viable alternatives available that would only enhance the experiences all involved parties if exercised. \n\nThis feels like discrimination; if we replaced the giant with a black child, or anyone else with \"abnormal\" but immutable features, it seems the answer would be clear. We would say that the children need to learn how to live with others in their society that don't look like themselves. But this is maybe a bit more acute, considering it would seem much easier to convince a 4 year old who hasn't been exposed to Nazi propaganda or \"Birth of a Nation\" that a random African American is harmless than it would given the real\\-world manifestation of the cartoon antagonist of the latest Disney flick. After all, on top of the desired for specialized care, part of the ethos of the children's dentistry is the desire to create a sort of dental \"safe space\", a friendly environment that assuages the anxiety of this otherwise possibly frightening experience. Should we really expect children to learn life lessons while dealing with the immediate fear of the dentist?\n\nTL;DR: \nKids at a children's dentist are scared because an 18yo who has been going there since he was 5 looks like Andre the Giant. The dentist denies service to the 18 year old and his family, saying that of course it would be discriminatory if everyone involved were rational, but that little children can't be expected to be rational actors, and that if the 18yo keeps coming, it will hurt the business of the dentist. **Is there any sort of precedent that firmly classifies discrimination against an individual based on immutable characteristics as illegal, or can this take place under certain circumstances?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Discrimination is not illegal per se\n------------------------------------\n\n*Some* discrimination is illegal, details vary by jurisdiction, for example discrimination on the following bases is illegal in Australia:\n\n* race\n* colour\n* sex\n* sexual preference\n* age\n* physical or mental disability\n* marital status\n* family or carer\u2019s responsibilities\n* pregnancy\n* religion\n* political opinion\n* national extraction\n* social origin\n\nSome of these apply only in particular circumstances (e.g. employment) and not in others (e.g. consumer rights).\n\n**Physical appearance is not one of the illegal ones**, unless it is as a result of a physical disability.\n\n**Age** discrimination is illegal *but* not universally.

However, pediatric practices are allowed to differentiate between children and adults. The practice can likely argue that moving an adult patient to an adult practice is a reasonable age-based policy for a pediatric service, rather than illegal discrimination.

Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338, 342, 31 S. Ct. 421, 55 L. Ed. 489, and authorities cited. In that case this court quoted from and adopted the language of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass. 433: 'A single act may be an offense against two statutes; and **if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other.**' Compare Albrecht v. United States, 273 U. S. 1, 11, 12, 47 S. Ct. 250, 71 L. Ed. 505, and cases there cited. Applying the test, we must conclude that here, although both sections were violated by the one sale, two offenses were committed.\n\nWhat this says in more plain language is that a person can be prosecuted under two different statutes for the same logical act as long as there is at least one fact that has to be proven for each count which doesn't have to be proven for the other count. This does mean, for example, that a person could not be prosecuted for aggravated assault, acquitted and then later prosecuted for simple assault on the same facts if there aren't any facts required for simple assault that aren't required for aggravated assault.\n\nFor the example in the question, this does seem to mean that if, for example, a robber was first prosecuted for murder, and then later separately prosecuted for carjacking after the murder, this would not be double jeopardy. I would guess in practice that courts wouldn't appreciate this kind of game\\-playing since it wastes the court's time as well to adjudicate two trials when there could just be one, but I don't know if there's a hard rule against it. Blockburger was actually arguing that multiple convictions from one trial should be overturned because some of them relied on the same facts as another. In this case SCOTUS ruled against Blockburger, but on the basis that the facts did not overlap, not that the legal basis of the argument was unsound.\n\nI noted in the beginning that this applies to particular sovereigns, which in terms of US law means either a state or the US Federal Government. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine (e.g. [Gamble v United States](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/17-646)), if the same set of facts of a case constitute both a state crime and a federal crime, or the also likely case that a federal crime requires all the facts of a state crime plus a few more, both the relevant state government and the Federal government can prosecute the person under their own statutes. This would technically also apply if two states wanted to prosecute someone, although it's unlikely that there is any way to have the exact same set of facts break two different state's laws since state laws generally can only cover actions taken inside the state or affecting that state in particular."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a complex criminal case involving multiple charges stemming from a bank robbery, which of the following scenarios would most likely be permissible under U.S. criminal law, based on the Blockburger test and the concept of double jeopardy?\n\nA) A prosecutor charges the defendant with murder, loses the case, then immediately charges the same defendant with first-degree murder based on the exact same evidence and facts.\n\nB) A state prosecutor tries the defendant for armed robbery, wins the case, and then a federal prosecutor charges the defendant with violating federal bank robbery laws for the same incident.\n\nC) A prosecutor charges the defendant with aggravated assault, wins the case, then later charges the same defendant with simple assault based on the same incident.\n\nD) A prosecutor charges the defendant with resisting arrest, loses the case, then immediately charges the defendant with the same resisting arrest charge in hopes of a different outcome.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \n\nOption B is correct based on the dual sovereignty doctrine. Even if the state has already prosecuted the defendant for armed robbery, the federal government can still prosecute for a federal crime arising from the same incident, as they are separate sovereigns.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it violates the principle of double jeopardy. The prosecutor cannot retry the same charge (or a charge requiring proof of the same elements) after losing a case.\n\nOption C is likely impermissible because simple assault is typically considered a lesser included offense of aggravated assault. The Blockburger test requires each offense to have at least one unique element the other doesn't have.\n\nOption D clearly violates double jeopardy, as it's an attempt to retry the exact same charge after losing."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/88201/how-shall-i-handle-user-consent-remember-option", "docs_id": 88201, "title": "How shall I handle user consent &quot;remember&quot; option", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I get consent from user for some operation.

Assault causing bodily harm via indictment is max 10 years sentence, against over the limit of what moral turpitude \n\ni.e. theoretically, any assault causing bodily harm, is in fact a moral turpitude issue.

Massachusetts](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/197/11), 197 U. S. 11 where Jacobson was criminally arraigned for refusing to comply with a mandatory vaccination law (applicable to all persons over 21\\).

The documentation discusses that while there is an implied right to privacy in the Constitution, it is not absolute. The Supreme Court cases of Jacobson v. Massachusetts and Zucht v. King affirmed that states have the power to enact mandatory vaccination laws under certain circumstances. These laws can be constitutional if they meet the criteria of strict scrutiny: serving a compelling state interest, being narrowly tailored, and using the least restrictive means to achieve their goal. This balances public health concerns with individual liberties.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to privacy is not absolute and can be limited for compelling state interests. Option B is overly broad, as not all vaccination laws would automatically be constitutional; they must still meet certain criteria.

(I said might, I did not say is: let's first determine if POTUS *is* one). That section also says\n\n> For the purpose of this section\u2014 (1\\) the term \u201cpublic official\u201d means\n> Member of Congress, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, either before\n> or after such official has qualified, or an officer or employee or\n> person acting for or on behalf of the United States, or any\n> department, agency or branch of Government thereof, including the\n> District of Columbia, in any official function, under or by authority\n> of any such department, agency, or branch of Government, or a juror;\n> (2\\) the term \u201cperson who has been selected to be a public official\u201d\n> means any person who has been nominated or appointed to be a public\n> official, or has been officially informed that such person will be so\n> nominated or appointed\n\nPOTUS is not a Member or Congress, etc: is POTUS \"an officer or employee or\nperson acting for or on behalf of the United States, or any\ndepartment, agency or branch of Government thereof\". Is POTUS \"an officer\", or \"an employee\"? [18 USC 202](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202) gives a terminological flow chart for specific sections of 18 USC Ch. 11, stating that\n\n> Except as otherwise provided in such sections, the terms \u201cofficer\u201d and\n> \u201cemployee\u201d in sections 203, 205, 207 through 209, and 218 of this\n> title shall not include the President...\n\n\u00a7201 is not included in this list of exclusions; but it is also not explicitly included: the law simply does not say.\n\nThe problem is that this chapter treats POTUS in three ways. For some sections, he is explicitly not an officer or employee; for one section he is explicitly a covered government person; and for \u00a7201, the law does not do not say. Regarding the second term \"covered government employee\", [18 USC 227](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/227) uses a different term that does include POTUS:\n\n> In this section, the term \u201ccovered government person\u201d means\u2014 (1\\) a\n> Senator or Representative in, or a Delegate or Resident Commissioner\n> to, the Congress; (2\\) an employee of either House of Congress; or (3\\)\n> **the President**, Vice President, an employee of the United States Postal\n> Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission, or any other executive\n> branch employee (as such term is defined under section [2105 of title\n> 5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/2105), United States Code).\n\nThat law, btw, says\n\n> (a) Whoever, being a covered government person, with the intent to\n> influence, solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation, an\n> employment decision or employment practice of any private entity\u2014 (1\\)\n> takes or withholds, or offers or threatens to take or withhold, an\n> official act, or (2\\) influences, or offers or threatens to influence,\n> the official act of another, shall be fined under this title or\n> imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both, and may be\n> disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under\n> the United States.\n\nThis law applies to POTUS, not Kodak Black. And the scope of the law is limited to influencing employment decisions of a private entity \u2013 so this law is not applicable.\n\nWhat SCOTUS would have to rule on is how to interpret the *lack* of definition w.r.t. \u00a7201\\.

As indicated in the subsection on the DoJ's interpretation of the law, it's not a difficult stretch to conclude that POTUS is capable of being bribed, but that's not really the final word on the matter, since that conclusion is influenced by the fact that bribery is constitutionally enumerated as a high crime triggering impeachment.

In that case, would you be eligible for Portuguese citizenship without the residency requirements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [current law](https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/69889521) does suggest so. The law does not actually contrast \"nationality\" and \"citizenship\" as the translation suggests: it says that the grandparent \"n\u00e3o tenha perdido essa nacionalidade\" (has not his his/her nationality). The part that would remain to be determined is whether both grandparents lost their Portuguese nationality somehow. The most likely reason for that would be renouncing Portuguese citizenship, for example to take US citizenship. That matter could probably be resolved by researching the law of Portugal and the US at the time the grandparents became US citizens (if they did). Both countries currently allow dual citizenship and as far as I know the US has never *required* a person to formally renounce their other citizenship to be naturalized. The verbiage in the current US naturalization oath that resembles a renunciation of citizenship:\n\n> I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and\n>  abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate,\n>  state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a\n>  subject or citizen...\n\nmight suffice. Loss of nationality under Portuguese law simply says\n\n> Perdem a nacionalidade portuguesa os que, sendo nacionais de outro \n>  Estado, declarem que n\u00e3o querem ser portugueses. (\"Those who,\n>  being nationals of another state, declare that they do not want to be\n>  Portuguese lose Portuguese nationality\")\n\nSome other countries make it much more difficult to renounce citizenship. One would need a Portuguese con\\-law attorney to know whether this legally means that you must *first* become a national of another state, *and then* declare that you don't want to be Portugese (or, can the renunciation precede the moment of naturalization?).

The main practical questions is, what were the laws at the relevant time?"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Jo\u00e3o's grandparents were born in Madeira and emigrated to the United States in the 1950s.

However, the key factor is whether Jo\u00e3o's grandparents retained their Portuguese nationality when they became U.S. citizens. \n\nThe naturalization process in the U.S. in 1965 included an oath that could be interpreted as a renunciation of previous citizenships. Portuguese law states that nationals lose their Portuguese nationality if they declare they no longer want to be Portuguese while being nationals of another state.\n\nTherefore, Jo\u00e3o would need to investigate the specific circumstances of his grandparents' naturalization and the interpretation of Portuguese law at that time to determine if they retained their Portuguese nationality.

Signing something means you accept it and it becomes legally binding. However if signatures are to have more than a symbolic meaning, they must be verifiable. Otherwise I can always claim that I didn't really sign that document when it becomes convenient for me.\n\nBut how can this be done with any degree of confidence? It feels to me like signatures could be faked too easily, and the process for verifying them is more art than science (as far as I understand it, it just involves a supposed \"expert\" looking at them and judging how \"similar\" it is to some other example).\n\nSo, why are they used *everywhere*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DR: You have to do something to accept a document; a signature is often used because it is simple and permanent; signature alone is often not enough (e.g. wills); claiming a false signature annuls the contract for both parties and you cannot keep the accrued benefits.\n\n> Signing something means you accept it and it becomes legally binding.\n\nMany things can become binding without signature (including your usage of this website) and signatures alone are not considered trustworthy in many circumstances.\n\nImportant documents (e.g. wills, marriages, real estate transactions) in many jurisdictions require a public official (notaries, marriage commissioners etc.) or a trustworthy person (lawyers, doctors, professional engineers, etc.), who will often require rigourous identification documents, and/or witnesses to be involved for the documents to be legally effective.\n\nSome high\\-value commercial transactions will also involve witnesses for signature, or require witnesses for executions of certain articles.\n\n> Otherwise I can always claim that I didn't really sign that document when it becomes convenient for me.\n\nYou can and people do. Then the parties go to court or other dispute resolution mechanism, and the judge will consider all relevant evidences to decide (often on a balance of probabilities, i.e. more likely than not) if you consented to a document. Particularly, \"when it becomes convenient for me\" is often after some elements of the contract having been executed, which is evidence in favour of the existence of the contract **and nonexistence of a contract removes obligations and rights for both supposed parties, as such the executed part could be undone**. If for a sales contract the other party has sent you a computer, you cannot claim that you did not sign that contract *and* keep the computer they sent. Without the contract, the computer is not rightfully yours.\n\nAlso, claiming false statements for benefit or under oath is fraud/perjury and can be criminally prosecuted.\n\n> So, why are they used everywhere?\n\nYou have to do *something* to affirm your consent to a document.\nIt is symbolic but symbolic does not mean meaningless and a symbol of your consent is often desirable.\n\nA signature is simple *and*:\n\n* affirmative of your intention, unlike a simple visual inspection of document (perhaps eventually someone will argue your eye movement can be used, e.g. for VR)\n* permanent, unlike oral declarations (which can still be legally valid, even if hard to prove)1\n\nwhich is enough for most purposes.

And what happens to weaker cases, do they result in an acquittal or do they generally not get cleared at all?\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction_rate>\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Japan's justice system is sometimes called [hostage justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage_justice)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn general, the Japanese justice system has a more than 99% conviction rate! In part, this is because the number of state attorneys is super low \\- on about half the population of the US, there were only 2000 State attorneys out of 35000 lawyers in Japan, whereas the USA has a five\\-to\\-six digit number of state/district/... attorneys and 1\\.5 million lawyers in total. Or in other words: each state\\-employed attorney is responsible for more than 10 times the people and the caseload they create, and lawyers are prohibitively expensive.\n\nThis leads to a [two\\-pronged result](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/82077/10334): on the one hand, only the best cases should be followed up on and brought to court. Depending on the statistics, **about every other case (\\~50%) that the police investigators hand to the prosecution is not followed up on by the prosecution**. The other result is, that **the Japanese justice system relies heavily on confessions** obtained from the defendants.\n\nAs I elaborated when comparing the [detention time without charges](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/84030/10334), the Japanese justice system is unlike almost any other modern justice system in the world in some regards, even though it is a civil law system and most of the same principles can be found. The Japanese prosecution can detain people for up to 23 days without bringing the case, you can't have your lawyer present when talking to the police, and by clever tactic, the prosecution can hold a person nigh\\-indefinitely without even filing a case. As a result, the prosecution can often get confessions, and with a confession, the actual court case can become super fast: charges are brought, the confession is read, a little extra evidence is presented, and to *spare the victim a lengthy trial* with the confession in the room, the judge comes down with a guilty verdict.\n\nThis is compounded by how the rules of evidence are laid out: investigation and the court case are allowed to happen at the same time! As a result, the case of the prosecutor tends to become *better* the longer the case drags on, resulting in the defendant either settling or giving a (partial) confession to some of the charges just to get it over because lawyers are crazy expensive. By giving a confession, they *throw themselves at the mercy of the court* for a mild verdict.\n\n### And it's very much stacked\n\nAs shown above, the Japanese justice system is already stacked against the defendant. But it is even more stacked than what is shown up there.\nAs [ohwilke](https://law.stackexchange.com/users/9517/ohwilleke) noted in excellent comments, I want to preserve them here:\n\n> Also the vast majority of Japanese criminal cases are tried without lay judges,\n\nThis is by the way a result of the Japanese legal system that was set up in the Meiji era being based on the Prussian branch of the [german](/questions/tagged/german \"show questions tagged 'german'\") Civil Law school. That was one of the dominant systems of the Meiji era next to the French and Spanish schools of Civil Legal Systems \\- and after WW2 they did not swap to a Common Law system but stayed with their own take on this Prusso\\-German branch of the Civil Legal System. This means there are no juries like in the common law system, and since 2009 [lay judges in japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lay_judges_in_Japan) are increasingly used, but not in every case. Those lay judges are very much akin to the Sch\u00f6ffen in Germany, being allowed to question the evidence and such \\- the German school is based on an inquisitorial system after all \\- but it is not used in every case. And the whole system is lived *extremely* differently from the inspiring Prussian system, such as this part of the comment shows:\n\n> and from my experiences talking with several Japanese judges at length about the issue (back in the early 1990s, maybe it is different now), the institutional mindset is for judges to believe that all of the prosecution evidence is true and all of the defense evidence is lies unless the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming and unshakable. The level of judicial bias towards the prosecution is greater than in any other common law or civil law legal system, that is not in an authoritarian regime, in the world.\n\nThis for example shows in the 23 days without charge. Technically, 23 days is not the initial time, but the police has 72 hours. But they can extend this time by 10 days with a judge's order, and then again by another 10 days on the same charge offered on the paperwork. According to a statistic, 99\\.8% of these requests are granted, meaning they are almost rubberstamped. Legally, people that are detained are not yet defendants, they are *suspects* and kept in [*Substitute Prisons*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiy%C5%8D_kangoku) which are located in police districts \\- which further helps to get confessions.\n\nAnd this plays directly into another factor that differentiates the Japanese system from other countries: There's a huge cultural factor, which is what makes the Japanese system so different from others.\n\n> Additional factors are that police officers in Japan have much more authority to handle minor cases outside the court system and routinely do so, that a certain level of criminal conduct from organized crime and by authority figures is tolerated, that there is much less crime per capita in Japan than most places, and that Confucian values re deference to hierarchy and the Japanese specific high cultural obligation to apologize influences how Japanese people interact with the criminal justice system as defendants and as implementers of that system.\n\nThis has its problems too: Because the prosecution is notoriously overworked, citizens with problems are often more reluctant to bring cases to their attention. Further, the shame culture works against not just the perpetrators, but also the victims and the people that report certain crimes \\- for example, [a female police officer was groped on a train, and when she reported it, **she** became the target of shunning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dajKNczCPRs)\n\n### Further reading \\& Research papers\n\n* US Department of Justice: [Toward a Balancing Approach: The Use of Apology in Japanese Society](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/toward-balancing-approach-use-apology-japanese-society).\n* US Department of Justice: [Confession, Apology, Repentance and Settlement Out\\-of\\-Court in the Japanese Criminal Justice System \\-\\- is Japan a Model of Restortative Justice?

As a minor, the courts *could* allow your parents to change from Dweezil to William without involving you, until you are old enough that the judge thinks you might be able to have reasonable input into the matter. Once you're over 18, your parents can't change your name \u2013 you would have to do that, at least if you are mentally competent.\n\nIn Washington, the courts juggle the wishes of the child, the wishes of the parents, how long the child has had the name, and the social advantages or disadvantages of the name change, and permission from the minor is required if over 14 (child input would be solicited for a child over 7\\).

Also bear in mind that the initial filing of a birth certificate may well not have a child's name, which may not be supplied until the parents make up their minds.\n\nChanges to the birth certificate are knowable (they don't erase anything), but can only be revealed to the subject of the record, or in case of court order.

For older children, the process is more complex and typically involves court approval, considering factors such as the child's wishes (especially for those over 14), the parents' wishes, how long the child has had the name, and potential social impacts.

(Some, but not all, jurisdictions, allow a law enforcement officer to directly submit a warrant request without the prosecutor's intervention.) The judge can ask that a hearing be held, but is authorized to issue a warrant on the basis of the written affidavit alone. Usually, an affidavit can be issued with the prosecutor appearing by telephone or on the basis of a written submission that is e\\-filed, rather than in person. But, local practice varies and the technology available to judges in different localities varies a great deal.\n\n> Or, do officers/prosecutors instead have a system to submit their\n>  documents into a \"pool\" that eventually gets to a judge?\n\nAbsent the most extraordinary and exigent circumstances, the documents are submitted to the clerk of the court who forwards the documents (electronically or on paper as the case may be) to the appropriate judge's personal court clerks who in turn forward it to the judge (often with a recommendation). Usually a judge has the authority to sign a warrant anywhere (on a golf course, at his home, etc.) without clerk intervention, but that would be unusual if not entirely unprecedented (e.g. it might happen a few times a year for a given judge with the right kind of docket).\n\n> How is the judge chosen? Is it random? Whoever is available to look\n>  over the case?\n\nThe default rule is random assignment, but it isn't uncommon for one or a few judges to be the on call judges to handle warrant requests at any given time. Usually, other judges have the authority to sign a warrant if the on call judges are not available but this is very uncommon.\n\n> How fast are warrants typically approved by a judge? (from the moment\n>  the request is made until it is approved)\n\nThis is entirely up to the judge (once the judge receives it). It can be as little as ten or fifteen minutes (a recent U.S. Supreme Court case discussed this), to a matter of days. If the judge is skeptical and wants in person testimony before issuing the warrant and is considering requiring a modification of the warrant, it might take several days. A judge receiving what is flagged as an \"urgent\" request, that the judge finds to be less than urgent might very well intentionally delay issuing the warrant to discourage prosecutors from crying wolf.\n\n> Are warrants given on a first\\-come\\-first\\-served basis? (e.g., an\n>  officer submits a request to have a hearing and his request is put in\n>  a queue until a judge gets to it)\n\nNot necessarily. If a judge understands that one request is more exigent than another, the judge doesn't have to consider them in the order they are received."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer needs to obtain a search warrant urgently.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys don't testify or provide evidence themselves.\n\nThe judge is usually not told what evidence will be offered at trial in advance, although sometimes a pre\\-trial hearing is held to consider a particularly important piece of evidence's admissibility prior to trial, in a hearing on what is called a \"motion in limine\" or a \"motion to suppress\". If that happens, the judge's decision made in advance will be honored by the judge when anyone tries to introduce the evidence at trial.\n\nBut those are the exception and not the rule. Usually, any witnesses can be asked any questions at trial and the judge does not consider the admissibility of the answer to the question until it is asked and objected to by the other side's lawyer at trial.\n\nA defendant can choose to be, but is not required to be, a witness in his or her own case.\n\nIn a trial, when it is their turn, the prosecution and defense, respectively, ask witnesses to sit at the witness stand one by one and ask them questions, which the witness answers under oath, absent an evidence objection from the other side's attorney. While a witness is on the stand, exhibits such as documents or physical objects can also be introduced into evidence in connection with the authenticating testimony of the witness (except in cases where both sides stipulate to the admission of the documents or other non\\-testimonial evidence).\n\nAs the lawyers try to introduce evidence by asking a question to a witness on the stand, or by asking the judge for permission to introduce non\\-testimonial evidence, the other side's attorney can say, \"I object\". If that happens, the witness on the stand is not allowed to answer the question and the non\\-testimonial evidence (e.g. documents, or a knife allegedly used in a crime) is not made available to the jury until the judge rules on whether it is admissible or not in accordance with the rules of evidence.\n\nUsually, the judge rules on the evidence objection immediately in the moment, although in rare cases, the judge will let the jury have a break for a few minutes while hearing arguments from the lawyers for both sides on about the relevant evidence rules and/or researching the legal issue, before ruling on the evidence issue. Once the judge rules on the evidence issue, the trial continues immediately.\n\nIf the judge \"sustains\" the objection to the evidence, then the question doesn't get asked and/or the jury doesn't get to see the non\\-testimonial evidence. The lawyer whose question or offer to introduce evidence was successfully objected to moves on to their next question (if any) for the witness instead.\n\nIf the judge \"overrules\" the objection to the evidence, then the witness answer the question and/or the jury gets to see the non\\-testimonial evidence which is \"received\" into evidence by the judge.\n\nThis process continues continuously, for as many business days as it takes, until all witness testimony and all non\\-testimonial evidence has been presented to the court and both sides have told the court that they have presented all of their evidence. Then each side makes closing arguments to the jury, the judge reads the jury instructions of law on how to resolve the case, and the jury is sent to closed room to discuss the case and decide whether to say \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" with respect to each charge brought by the prosecution in the trial. This decision is called a \"verdict\" and when the jury has made up its mind on all charges present to it, the jury lets the judge know that it has made up its mind, and the judge calls everyone back to the courtroom, and the jury tells the judge what they decided in open court.\n\nIf the verdict is \"not guilty\" on all criminal charges in the case, then the case is over, with no post\\-trial motions and no appeals. If the verdict is \"guilty\" the defendant is convicted, subject to post\\-trial motions to declare a mistrial and appeals by the convicted defendant.\n\nIf the convicted defendant appeals the case, and the judge abused his discretion in overruling an objection to the evidence that is made by the lawyer for the defendant (or the defendant personally if the defendant is not represented by a lawyer), because no reasonable judge could have found that the evidence was admissible under the circumstances, then the appellate court rules that the judge has made an \"error\". The appellate court will not find that the judge's ruling is an \"error\" if the judge made the correct decision for the wrong reason.\n\nIf it is reasonably possible that \"error\" possibly in combination with other errors made by the trial court judge could have caused a convicted criminal defendant to have been acquitted by the jury if the errors weren't made by the judge, then the defendant gets a new trial.\n\nThe new trial usually before the same judge with a new jury. But the new trial is before a different judge and a new jury if the judge is no longer a judge on the court for any reason, or if the judge has been so defiant of the appellate court (typically ignoring its instructions in a retrial after a first appeal) that the appellate court decides it must remove the judge from the case.\n\nA criminal defendant is only acquitted by an appellate court if the appellate court finds that it would be impossible under any circumstances for the defendant to be convicted in a new trial, possibly with different evidence presented by the prosecution.\n\n> What happens if a private citizen does the above?\n\nThis doesn't make sense. Private citizens don't rule on the admissibility of evidence in a criminal trial, and can't introduce evidence in a criminal trial except at the request of a prosecuting attorney or defendant's attorney by being called as a witness and asking the questions that the lawyers (and sometimes the judge as well) asks the witness.\n\nWitnesses are not allowed to volunteer testimony or provide documents to a jury unless asked to do so by a lawyer in the case.\n\n> What happens if someone provides evidence in court without the\n> knowledge of the judge?\n\nAs the process described above should make clear, this is basically impossible absent some extremely irregular event on the same level of irregularity as someone bribing a jury or threatening a jury with harm if he votes the wrong way."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal jury trial, how is evidence typically introduced and what role does the judge play in determining its admissibility?\n\nA) Evidence is introduced by the judge, who decides in advance what will be allowed in the trial.\n\nB) Lawyers can present any evidence they want directly to the jury without the judge's involvement.\n\nC) Evidence is primarily introduced through witness testimony and exhibits, with the judge ruling on objections in real-time during the trial.\n\nD) Private citizens can volunteer evidence to the jury at any time during the proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In a criminal jury trial, evidence is typically introduced through witness testimony and exhibits presented by the prosecuting and defense attorneys. As questions are asked or exhibits are offered, the opposing attorney can object. The judge then rules on these objections in real-time, either sustaining (disallowing) or overruling (allowing) them. This process continues throughout the trial, with the judge making immediate decisions on admissibility as issues arise.

Simpson case is a famous example where he was acquitted in the criminal trial but found liable in the civil case.\n\nB is incorrect because criminal cases actually require a higher burden of proof (\"beyond reasonable doubt\") compared to civil cases (\"preponderance of evidence\").\n\nC is correct. As demonstrated by cases like O.J. Simpson's, the outcomes of criminal and civil cases can differ, even when they relate to the same incident. This is due to different standards of proof and different purposes of the proceedings.\n\nD is incorrect because while the defendant's ability to pay may influence the decision to pursue a civil case, it's not the sole determining factor.

I've written a few books and, without thinking, I used the term Arcane to be the general name for magic practiced by witches and warlocks and prayer magic used by the clergy. I never thought about it until now, but is Arcane, or Arcane magic, a copyrighted word/phrase/term?\n\nTo clarify, the spells in my work aren't direct copies of any from those other games, it's simply the usage of what I at first considered a generic word.

A word can be protected, in a certain context, by trademark. To take one example, the word \"Apple\" is protected in the domain of computer products, because Apple computers has registered \"Apple\" as their trademark, and you can't then start selling a line of computers named \"Apple\". You can however sell fruits called \"apples\", or you could sell knives with that name (unless someone has registered \"apple\" as a brand of knife). There are currently 45 [\"classes\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_(Nice)_Classification_of_Goods_and_Services) for trademark protection.\n\n\"Arcane\" is a normal word of everyday language (YMMV), which means that there is relatively little protection for the word, as contrasted with \"Microsoft\", a word created by that company. It is unlikely that the courts would recognize \"Arcane\" as being distinctive. You can search the trademark database [here](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=searchss&state=4806:rml4r1.1.1): there is nothing for \"arcane magic\", and little for \"arcane\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An aspiring author is writing a fantasy novel that includes \"arcane magic\" as a general term for magic practiced by witches and warlocks.
