You'd be allowed to keep abandoned property, but keeping lost property without looking for the owner is in many places considered theft. \n\nA car on your land is quite likely abandoned by the last driver (people don't usually lose cars). But the question is whether it is abandoned by the owner; if the car looks like it has some value then it is unlikely to be abandoned by the owner and more likely that it has been stolen. \n\nI'd report the car to the police; then it's up to them to find the owner or not. If they can find him, and the car was not abandoned, but actually lost (unlikely) or stolen (more likely), you have the satisfaction of being an honest person helping either a very stupid car owner or a crime victim to get their property back. If they can't find him, usually the property will then belong to the finder."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In South Carolina, a car has been left on private property for several months. The landowner wants to claim ownership. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landowner can automatically claim ownership of the vehicle after a specific time period, regardless of its condition or registration status.\n\nB) The landowner must report the vehicle to the police and can only claim ownership if the police are unable to locate the original owner.\n\nC) If the vehicle's registration is expired, the landowner can immediately claim ownership without any further action.\n\nD) The landowner has no obligation to report the vehicle and can dispose of it as they see fit after a reasonable waiting period.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In such situations, the key consideration is whether the property is truly abandoned or just lost. A car left on someone's land is likely abandoned by the driver, but not necessarily by the owner. The proper course of action is to report the vehicle to the police. This allows for an attempt to locate the rightful owner, which is important especially if the car appears to have value (as it might be stolen rather than abandoned). If the police cannot find the owner, then typically the property would belong to the finder (in this case, the landowner). This process ensures due diligence in trying to return lost or stolen property while also providing a legal pathway for the landowner to potentially claim ownership if the original owner cannot be found.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there isn't an automatic transfer of ownership after a set time period. Option C is wrong because an expired registration doesn't immediately grant ownership rights to the landowner. Option D is incorrect because there is an obligation to make a reasonable effort to find the owner, typically by reporting to the police, rather than just disposing of the vehicle after a waiting period."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/71184/when-can-employer-on-hourly-basis-cancel-work-at-the-latest", "docs_id": 71184, "title": "When can employer on hourly basis cancel work at the latest?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm trying to find out if a new policy implemented by my employer is legal. I'm employed on an hourly basis, no minimum amount of work, with shift plans made yearly. Now they started cancelling some work less than 3 hours in advance depending on business needs (which make sense, but aren't my problem).\n\nI can't track down any specific legislation, I found SR 220 Art. 324 and SR 822\\.111 Art. 69 (official [commentary/explanations](https://www.seco.admin.ch/seco/de/home/Arbeit/Arbeitsbedingungen/Arbeitsgesetz-und-Verordnungen/Wegleitungen/Wegleitung-zur-ArGV-1.html#-305982440) by SECO) which both seem to support me, but aren't specific enough to be of any use to me.\n\nSwitzerland, Canton of Zurich.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **First Part**\n\nOR 324 is quite the right article for this. If the employer doesn't want that you work (because he has nothing to do for you) it's his problem, not yours. He still has to pay if you are there and ready to do work. This is for instance also mentioned in [this article](https://www.20min.ch/story/unverschuldete-minusstunden-was-tun-560345018339).\n\nThe meaning of this is obvious if having a contract with a fixed number of work hours per day/month/year.\n\n**Second part**\n\nProve that you have a fixed work contract.\n\nIf the shift plans are made in advance you have a proof that you have a certain number of hours to work (and thus an expected income). If I interpret [this here](https://www.slp.ch/lohnfortzahlungspflicht-bei-gelegenheitsarbeit/) correctly, this is \"echte Arbeit auf Abruf\" (true work on request), because if your employer wants your work, you *have to* be there according to the shift plan, as opposed to your employer asking \"who is ready to work tonight?\".\n\nSo your employer must pay you the hours agreed on in the shift plan, regardless of whether he has work for you or not (but you must explicitly tell him that you are willing to take work).\n\n**Third part**\n\nCan the employer change the shift plan, and to what extent?\n\nThe employer must announce changes to work hours as soon as possible, and changes on short notice are only acceptable in [emergency cases](https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/wirtschaft/sozial-und-sicher/die-festlegung-der-arbeitszeit-ist-chefsache/story/13793839). A reduction in work hours due to not enough work shall not reduce the employee's salary. The business risk is entirely with the employer and he must not shift that responsibility to his employees.

The employer must still pay if the employee is ready to work. For employees with shift plans made in advance, this is considered \"echte Arbeit auf Abruf\" (true work on request), and the employer must pay for the hours agreed upon in the shift plan, regardless of whether they have work or not.

The scenario doesn't mention any written contract, and verbal promises without consideration are not legally binding. At-will employment means the employer can terminate the job at any time for any reason (except for legally prohibited reasons like discrimination).

I wasn't aware she was working, so I asked her more about what the job entailed and she told me that she doesn't actually provide her services as an agent, she only uses the license to get deep discounts for her own travels.\n\nI don't think I can convince her it's fraud, but I don't want to see her in jail. I couldn't find any sources online that said one way or another whether it is fraudulent behavior. Are there any referencable sources I can point her to that could be helpful? Or is what is she doing entirely legal?\n\nAlso, unfortunately, I don't know any more details about her license or method of obtaining it as we spoke in casual passing about it. I can probably ask her though, if necessary.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Utah Department of Professional Licensing](https://dopl.utah.gov/licenses/) does not issue licenses for travel agents, and there seems to be no evidence of a statutory requirement for licensing. Therefore it's unclear what status this license has. I did see a number of online places offering to train people to be travel agents, and perhaps one of them offers a certificate of training.\n\nThere is such a thing as an IATA number, and some hotel might require providing one's IATA number. If a person does not have an IATA number and the hotel does not verify the IATA number, then it would be fraud to falsely make up a number in order to obtain a benefit. The person could be sued to recover the amount of the discount. If the person has an IATA number, then there nothing obviously fraudulent, but you would have to inspect the conditions for using an agent discount.\n\n[IATA](https://www.iatan.org/en/accreditation/idcard) requires you to work at a registered agency to get an agent number, and the proof requirements are substantial enough that it would be surprising if a person could get away with just claiming to work at a travel agency. The organization would certainly be in a good position to sue a person for falsifying the application (note also that the application is subject to binding arbitration by the Travel Agency Commissioner).\n\nSo it depends on who gave the discount, what the required, what if any accreditation was used to get that discount, and what the actual facts are (i.e. does the person actually work for an agency making at least $10,000 a year)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A person obtains discounts on travel by claiming to be a travel agent.

In options A, C, and D, XYZ Corp initiated the transfer in 2023, making these expenses deductible in the 2023 tax year, regardless of when the recipient actually received the funds.\n\nHowever, in option B, although the recipient received the funds in 2023, the transfer was scheduled for 2024.

Something like a list of one\\-liners from songs from the 80s for example or movies.\n\nWould this be legal? I am aware of fair use, but it seems that this could fall either under fair use (since it's a form of commentary) or under copyright infringement (since I use it for commercial use and use the essence of the artifacts).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such a booklet might or might not be ruled fair use under US law. This isn't really commentary, unless you add some analytical or critical materiel, in short some **comments**, on the quotes. That woukld make it pretty clearly fair use. But fair use is significantly broader than commentary. Let us look at the statutory factors. [This question and its answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) lists and describes them. [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107) is the actual law.\n\n1. **The purpose and character of the use.** The use is commercial, which weighs soemnwhat agaisnt fair use, but not overwhelmingly. The use is arguable soemwhat trasformational, but it seems to me not highly so. That weighs a little towards fair use.\n2. **The nature of the copyrighted work.** The works quoted are creative, works of entertainment, not factual or educational. This weaighs agaisnt fair use, but not overwhelmingly.\n3. **The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.** This nis not really clear from the question. One or two lines from a short song might be a substantial portion. \"*Like a bridge over troubled water / I will lay me down.* Might alone be considered the \"heart\" of the Simon \\& Garfunkel song, as it in my view, captures the key feeling of the song, even if it is only 2 short lines, one sentence. A line or two for a feature\\-length film is much less likely to be a substantial part. This factor can be quite subjective. Recall *Harper vs Nation* where a 300\\-word quote from President George H. W. Bush's long autobiography was judged to be the \"heart\" of the work, and fair use denied.\n4. **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.** This is also hard to judge without specifics, but short quotes rarely harm the market for an existing work, much less one decades old. This provably weighs in favor of fair use.\n\nSo fair use is possible for the kind of use described, but a long way for assured. Adding significant commentary on each quote would make the case for fair use significantly stronger.\n\nAs for Sweden, while the basic framework of modern copyright, derived from the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) is the same, Sweden has nothing like the fair use doctrine in its law. I think the case for copyright infringement under Swedish law would be fairly strong.\n\nAnd of course, even if a use is clearly an infringement, there is no penalty unless the copyright holder shooses to sue. One can never know if that will happen, but corporate media copyright owners tend to be more ready to sue than the general population. They often have the resources, and are inclined to think that way.

The answer states that \"short quotes rarely harm the market for an existing work, much less one decades old.\" This suggests that using brief quotes from older songs is unlikely to negatively impact their commercial value, weighing in favor of fair use.

How does the estate administrator set a date for valuing the stocks/cryptos for purposes of income tax, inheritance tax, and distribution.\n\nExample, investments are worth $10,000 on the death of the trustor and $10,000 in checking account. Then $11,000 when the tax return is filed, and $12,000 on the day the assets are distributed. And the second beneficiary gets 10%. So the date of the valuation determines whether they get $1000, $1100, or $1200 (for the those assets) paid out of the checking account.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sort of depends on what the will says, for example if the will says \"shall receive 1% of the value of my estate at the moment of my death\", that answers your question. That's a bit unlikely, more probably it just says \"shall receive 1% of my estate\", in which case this refers to \"the totality of what is left to disburse to beneficiaries\", that is, after obligations have been discharged (debts, taxes, funeral expenses, expense of estate administration).\n\nYou also have to disburse specific benefits first, for example \"$10,000 to Aunt Luddy\", \"the car to cousin Billy\". Thereafter, percentages (implied such as \"equally\" or explicit such as \"2%\") are then computed over the remainder. Ideally, you will know the current value of everything left and can do the math and transfer title all at once. This might be a bit impractical for an entire estate, but it is practical for an estate composed of a bunch of divisible assets. All of the securities can be transferred on one day; the house may be sold a month later and assets re\\-distributed according to the formula at that point.\n\nIn other words, you don't need a fixed instant for computing and distributing the estate, you just need to distribute each asset according to the terms of the estate."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An estate consists of $100,000 in stocks, $50,000 in cryptocurrency, and $50,000 in a checking account.

This is because the will typically refers to the estate as it existed at the moment of the testator's death. In this case, the total estate value at death was $200,000, so Beneficiary B's 10% share would be $20,000. \n\nOptions B and C are incorrect because they use later valuations, which could unfairly increase or decrease percentage-based bequests depending on market fluctuations. Option D is incorrect because it misinterprets the meaning of \"estate,\" which includes all assets, not just liquid cash.\n\nIt's important to note that specific bequests (like the stocks and cryptocurrency to Beneficiary A) are typically distributed as is, regardless of later value changes.

Nobody is entitled to a \"standard of living\". Just because you lucked out to marry a high\\-net\\-worth or high\\-earning individual, it should not \"entitle\" you to live the good life in perpetuity after you stopped being married.\n\nThis is *separate* from the idea that a spouse may have contributed to said high\\-earning status by supporting their career, which is a far valid \\- but a wholly separate \\- reason in divorce court. For example, I assume a judge can apply \"standard of living\" idea even if the wealthy spouse can show that the wealth/income didn't change upwardly during the marriage; and that the spouse didn't contribute economically at all, due to paying for hired help to do house chores, and no children resulting etc...\n2. It seems like a moral hazard, in that it encourages lower income earners to trick higher income earners into marrying them under false pretenses, just to divorce them after a couple of years for a big payout in raised standard of living, or to simply not be a good spouse since they won't suffer in the divorce.\n\nIdeally, I'm looking for an authoritative answer to \"why\", for example a reason given by a judge establishing precedent, or a politician proposing the law that passed which establishes the idea). However, a solid legal analysis would also be good.\n\n**UPDATE**: Just to clarify \\- the question isn't asking why there is spousal support/maintenance in general. It's asking very specifically, why \"established standard of living\" is the criterion used to decide the amount. In other words, if a spouse is used to a billionaire lifestyle, why is the support aimed at perpetuating that same expensive lifestyle, **as opposed to** being a modest livable amount (say, mode or median or average wage).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [A brief explanation](https://mavrideslaw.com/history-alimony-massachusetts/) follows. The Code of Hammurabi articulates the first form of alimony:\n\n> 137. If a man wish to separate from a woman who has borne him children, or from his wife who has borne him children: then he shall\n> give that wife her dowry, and a part of the usufruct of field, garden,\n> and property, so that she can rear her children. When she has brought\n> up her children, a portion of all that is given to the children, equal\n> as that of one son, shall be given to her. She may then marry the man\n> of her heart\n\nIn the Middle Ages, English ecclesiastical law mandated that a husband still has an obligation to support his wife even when they are separated (recall that divorce was not possible). This carried over to the US. As discussed in [this article](https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1631&context=luclj), there was a view (articulated in Bradwell v. Illinois by Justice Bradley that \"Man is, or should be,\nwoman's protector and defender .... The paramount destiny and\nmission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator\".\nThe basic rationale at the time was that the wife had a right to support as a consequence of the marriage, and would continue to exercise that right were it not for the conduct of the husband (by law, someone was at fault, and if it was the husband, he would have to compensate his wife).\n\nWhen no\\-fault divorce became a possibility in the late 60's, concepts of alimony were re\\-worked, so that alimony was no (usually) longer a permanent property right, and in its place there developed a desideratum of \"maintenance\" allowing the spouse with lesser economic power to maintain a diminishing property right. See [this 1973 version](https://leg.wa.gov/CodeReviser/documents/sessionlaw/1973ex1c157.pdf?cite=1973%201st%20ex.s.%20c%20157%20%C2%A7%209) of Washington's replacement\\-for\\-alimony law, which includes \"The standard of living established during the marriage\" as [the law now](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=26.09.090) does.\n\nBecause this is established by state law in the US, and state legislatures aren't infamous about keeping close track of legislative debates, I don't think there are any surviving records of the rationale of the author of these bills. In fact, this law was drafted a few years earlier by The Uniform Law Commission \u2013 there may be some record of their discussion.\n\\[This article]\\[5], written after the law was passed, takes note of the history of contractual concepts being applied to marriage (e.g. the territorial legislature enacted a measure that \"marriage is declared to be a civil contract\"), from which perspective one expects there to be compensation for breach of contract."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the historical evolution of the concept of alimony and its relationship to \"standard of living\" considerations in divorce proceedings?\n\nA) Alimony originated in the 20th century as a response to no-fault divorce laws, with standard of living becoming a factor only in recent decades.\n\nB) The concept of alimony has remained unchanged since ancient times, always considering the standard of living established during marriage.\n\nC) Alimony evolved from ancient codes through religious law and fault-based divorce, eventually incorporating standard of living as a factor in maintenance laws after the advent of no-fault divorce.\n\nD) Standard of living has always been the primary factor in determining alimony, with its importance diminishing in modern times due to gender equality.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The concept of alimony has a long history, tracing back to ancient codes like the Code of Hammurabi. It evolved through religious law in the Middle Ages, where husbands were obligated to support wives even when separated. In early U.S. law, alimony was viewed as a wife's continuing right to support based on fault-based divorce. With the introduction of no-fault divorce in the late 1960s, the concept was reworked into \"maintenance\" laws, which began to incorporate \"standard of living established during the marriage\" as a factor in determining support. This evolution shows how the concept changed over time, adapting to new legal and social contexts, eventually leading to the inclusion of standard of living as a consideration in modern divorce proceedings."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52732/does-eu-law-require-permanent-usage-of-catalytic-converters-in-cars", "docs_id": 52732, "title": "Does EU law require permanent usage of catalytic converters in cars?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many countries have vehicles with permanently active catalytic converters despite the fact that they lower efficiency and produce more carbon dioxide for the same mechanical power output.\n\nThe gases the catalytic converters combust, like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, are not dangerous in the concentrations they often appear, and they spontaneously react to become other chemicals after some time in the atmosphere.\n\nCatalytic converters were introduced 35 years ago when environment policies and car configurability were different. I don't question the motives of why the laws were passed then. **Today there is a big focus on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, so why are catalytic converters still in permanent use?** Catalytic conversion can be avoided with just a software change or configuration change in the engine control unit, that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by some percent.\n\nA solution could be an adaptive system that configures combustion depending on circumstances, like turning off the oxygen supply to the catalytic converter when the car is moving at higher speed and turning it on in confined spaces like parking places and smoggy cities. It could also easily be turned off and on depending on geographic location or based on data from an carbon monoxide sensor.\n\n**Does the law require permanent usage of catalytic converters in cars?**\n\nThe setting of the engine control unit is the direct cause of increased fuel consumption, since the combustion process in the engine cylinder is providing more air than is optimal in order to provide oxygen to the combustion in the catalytic converter. [Back pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_pressure) from the catalytic converter also decreases engine efficiency and increases fuel consumption. In some vehicles there is a [secondary air injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_air_injection) to provide oxygen to the catalytic converter. This requires energy and increases fuel consumption.\n\nFor example in regard to carbon monoxide the catalytic converter can be deactivated when levels are within [WHO guidelines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK138710/#ch2.s11) at 6 ppm. In average CO levels are [0\\.1 ppm in the atmosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide#Occurrence).\n\nA common misunderstanding of this question is that people seems to think that I write that the total carbon dioxide produced per unit of fuel will be different with or without catalytic conversion. I have not written that. I write that there will be a diffence per mechanical power produced.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no EU law that *requires* vehicles to have a permanently active catalytic converter installed. There are various \"clean air\" regulations such as [Regulation 715/2007/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2007:171:TOC) which covers the emissions standards vehicles must meet before they can be approved for sale within the EU. As long as the standards are met, the law is not particularly concerned with *how* those standards are met (excluding obvious cheating mechanisms, etc.)\n\nAdditionally, [Directive 2014/45/EU](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:02014L0045-20140429&from=EN#tocId2) covers vehicle roadworthiness and mandates regular emissions testing as part of it. All vehicles must meet the standards of the test to be considered roadworthy. In the UK, this is performed as part of the annual MOT test.\n\nIt appears that catalytic converters are simply one of the easiest ways to meet those standards, and it is probably cheaper/more efficient for manufacturers to install a permanently active catalytic converter (which can be applied across multiple markets) rather than implementing software or alternative solutions which may or may not meet regulations in all the markets the vehicle is sold in."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal status and usage of catalytic converters in the European Union?\n\nA) EU law mandates that all vehicles must have permanently active catalytic converters installed.\n\nB) There is no specific EU law requiring catalytic converters, but emissions standards must be met, which often results in their use.\n\nC) EU regulations prohibit the use of adaptive systems that could turn catalytic converters on and off based on driving conditions.\n\nD) Catalytic converters are only required during annual vehicle inspections but can be deactivated at other times.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The provided information states that there is no EU law specifically requiring permanently active catalytic converters. Instead, there are emissions standards that vehicles must meet to be approved for sale and to pass regular roadworthiness tests. Catalytic converters are commonly used because they are an efficient way to meet these standards across various markets.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the EU does not mandate permanently active catalytic converters specifically.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the information does not mention any prohibition on adaptive systems.

Is there any specific protection for privacy in social media?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nEven in the 49 U.S. states that are \"employment at will\" states in the U.S., there are reasons for which termination of employment is prohibited under both state and federal law, and termination without cause entitles an employee to unemployment benefit if certain other conditions are met.\n\nMost unionized employees, most public sector employees, most private sector employees in Montana, and a small number of employees (mostly senior management) with written employment contracts that so provide can only be fired for cause.\n\nThere is a split of authority in the U.S. on the status of not making full disclosure is something that the employer required you to disclose and that you represented that you did disclose in the hiring process, such as your social media accounts. This is commonly called \"resume fraud\" even though it actually applies more broadly than resumes. Also, sometimes the question might be resolved differently under parallel state and federal laws.\n\nIn general, in the U.S., asking about social media accounts is something that an employer may permissibly ask unless it is use to facilitate discrimination on a prohibited ground.\n\nOne rule, which applies in some jurisdictions, is that \"resume fraud\" (i.e. a material misstatement in a resume or employment application) discovered by an employer after an otherwise wrongful termination can serve as a lawful basis for terminating employment that excuses the wrongful basis for termination of employment (at least assuming that the information withheld or misrepresented was on a matter that the employer could lawfully consider). Even if the information not disclosed was not itself a basis upon which the employer would not have hired someone, the dishonestly in the hiring process would be a basis for termination of employment.\n\n[For example](https://www.hallrender.com/2012/05/15/resume-fraud-embellishment-embarassment-and-worse/):\n\n> The Seventh Circuit, which covers Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin,\n> has consistently held that it\u2019s permissible for employers to reject\n> job applicants and fire employees who are suspected of engaging in\n> resum\u00e9 fraud. The rationale for the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning is\n> very straightforward: lying to employers is a legitimate and\n> non\\-discriminatory basis for turning down an applicant or firing an\n> employee. The cases of *Carter v. Tennant Co*., *Aubuchon v. Knauf\n> Fiberglass* and *Gilty v. Village of Oak Park* all stand for this\n> proposition. . . . .\n> \n> \n> If the employer, as part of its investigation of the allegations in\n> the lawsuit, discovers that the employee engaged in resum\u00e9 fraud, can\n> the employer use that belated discovery to its advantage? According\n> to the United States Supreme Court, the answer is yes. More\n> specifically, in *McKennon v. Nashville Banner Publishing Co.*, the\n> Supreme Court essentially held that an employer\u2019s belated discovery of\n> an independent, alternative basis for firing an employee (e.g., resum\u00e9\n> fraud) can be used by the employer to reduce the plaintiff\u2019s potential\n> recovery. (Think of this as the employer\u2019s \u201cif we knew then what we\n> know now, we wouldn\u2019t have hired you in the first place\u201d defense.)\n\nIn other jurisdictions, \"resume fraud\" is not itself a basis for discharge, although it might be used as evidence to support an initially claimed valid reason for terminating employment in the face of an employee allegation that this was a mere pretext for wrongful termination.\n\nI don't know which states or how many U.S. states fall in each category. The former rule is the rule in almost all cases under federal private sector employment law.\n\nA variety of cases that address the question in the context of public employment sector employment can be found [here](https://www.aele.org/law/Digests/empl226.html).\n\nIn addition to these general rules of law, there are also often reasonable questions of fact about whether a prospective employee substantially complied with an employer's social media disclosure question on a fact by fact basis that turns on the exact wording of the question and the reasonable interpretations that language could be given by the employee.\n\nFor example, if a question has a social media disclosure requirement and one doesn't disclose a blog, one might reasonably argue that a blog is not a social media account, depending on the language used in the question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of an employee not disclosing all social media accounts during the hiring process, as requested by the employer?\n\nA) Failure to disclose all social media accounts is always considered \"resume fraud\" and is universally accepted as grounds for termination in all U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nB) There is a split in legal authority across U.S. jurisdictions, with some considering non-disclosure as potential \"resume fraud\" that could justify termination, while others do not view it as an independent basis for discharge.\n\nC) U.S. law uniformly protects employees from termination based on undisclosed social media accounts, considering it a violation of privacy rights.\n\nD) The legality of termination for non-disclosure of social media accounts depends solely on whether the information in those accounts is related to job performance.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The provided information indicates that there is indeed a split of authority in the U.S. regarding the status of not making full disclosure of information requested during the hiring process, such as social media accounts. Some jurisdictions, like the Seventh Circuit, consider this \"resume fraud\" and a legitimate basis for termination. Other jurisdictions do not view it as an independent basis for discharge, though it might be used as evidence to support a claimed valid reason for termination.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the universality of the \"resume fraud\" doctrine. Option C is incorrect because U.S. law does not uniformly protect employees in this manner; in fact, many jurisdictions allow termination for non-disclosure. Option D is too narrow, as the legality of termination isn't solely dependent on job performance relevance, but also on factors like jurisdiction, exact wording of the disclosure request, and whether the non-disclosure is considered material."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15385/reasons-for-uk-citizen-to-not-get-an-irish-passport", "docs_id": 15385, "title": "Reasons for UK citizen to not get an Irish passport?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The United Kingdom has opted to leave the European Union, this may make travelling and visiting my holiday home abroad more difficult, or even stop me from working abroad in the future.\n\nMy mother is about about to get an Irish passport, as her mother (my grandmother) is Irish.

I'm fortunate enough to have a good job and ultimately I'll be fine even if I do have to pay these costs.

Any additional details require a decent amount of background on parts of the Constitution, so please bear with me.\n\nCanadian Federalism\n===================\n\nA quick discussion on Canadian federalism may help understand the context of the sections you are asking about. Canada's federal system has some blurry or intricate lines between provincial and federal legislative domains. Beyond the federal appointment of provincial superior court judges, a few other cases of these lines can be found in the distribution of legislative powers found in [sections 91 and 92](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-4.html) of the Constitution Act, 1867\\. \n\nFor example, while marriage and divorce is a federal competency, the solemnization of marriage is a provincial competency. Another common example is that with criminal law being a completely federal concern, the federal government can often enact criminal law on what would otherwise be a provincial concern.\n\nIn dealing with the interplay of provincial and federal powers, the Supreme Court noted in [Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_(AG)_v_PHS_Community_Services_Society) that Canadian constitutional interpretation is evolving \"towards the more flexible concepts of [double aspect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_aspect) and cooperative federalism.\"\n\nFor more info, see [this Wikipedia article on Canadian federalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_federalism), which is surprisingly detailed.\n\nCanada's Judiciary\n==================\n\n[Section 92(14\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-4.html) of the Constitution Act, 1867 places the judiciary under primarily *provincial* responsibility:\n\n> The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.\n\nThere are of course exceptions, the Supreme Court being the most obvious example. These exceptions are authorized by [section 101](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-5.html#h-25) of the Constitution Act, 1867 which gives Parliament the ability to set up federal courts by ordinary statute:\n\n> The Parliament of Canada may, notwithstanding anything in this Act, from Time to Time provide for the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of a General Court of Appeal for Canada, and for the Establishment of any additional Courts for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada.\n\nThis has been done for example in the areas of intellectual property, and tax, among others.\n\nNote that Canada's judiciary is **unified**. As a general rule, *any* court is competent to adjudicate both provincial and federal law, unless that jurisdiction has specifically been removed from the provincial courts by a section 101 statute. Note that the Supreme Court has final say on all provincial and federal law. This is in contrast with the U.S. where its Supreme Court cannot overrule a state supreme court on matters of state law.\n\nFor more info, see [this Wikipedia article on Canada's court system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_system_of_Canada), which again, is surprisingly detailed.\n\nAnswers to your specific questions\n==================================\n\n\"Why\" questions are usually more of a political or historical question than one of law, but I'll do my best.\n\n> Why did the framers allow provincial superior courts to adjudicate some matters falling under federal legislative power (for example, bankruptcy cases)?\n\nI would say \"some matters\" is a little misleading, it is instead most. It's less about the Constitution allowing provincial superior courts to adjudicate matters falling under federal legislative power, and more about allowing the federal government to take away jurisdiction under section 101\\. Note that provincial superior courts aren't special in this respect, any provincial court can still adjudicate on matters falling under federal legislative power.\n\n> Why didn't the framers confine to the Federal Court?\n\nBecause of section 101, this isn't needed. Should the federal government wish to take over exclusive jurisdiction of a federal competency, they can.\n\n> Why blur the distinction between provincial v. federal jurisdiction?\n\nThis question really strikes at the design of Canadian federalism. With respect to federal appointment of provincial superior court judges, I think it's only natural to have some federal input in the spirit of cooperative federalism, especially given that provincial courts can adjudicate federal legislation.\n\n*Disclaimer: The rest of this answer is much more history than law*\n\nAs a more general question with respect to these blurry or intricate distinctions throughout the Constitution, we have to go back to its design from 1864\\-1867\\. I am greatly summarizing, but the design of Canadian federalism is mainly due to two things: the American Civil War and Quebec (and a third, staying under the British monarchy, but that's less relevant to this question). For further information see [here](http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp187-e.htm) and [here](https://www.macdonaldlaurier.ca/18745/).\n\nHaving just seen the American Civil War at its end, the framers wanted a unitary government with little to no provincial rights. However, as a practical matter, Quebec's distinct culture and legal system made this infeasible. A federation with a strong central government and provinces having power over local matters was thus envisioned. The separation of legislative domains flowed from that principle.\n\nThis does raise the question of why the judiciary was given to the provinces by default, as it does seem like an important piece that should have been given to the federal government. One reason might be that section 101 does reserve the federal government some control anyway. Another might be that the judiciary was just not that powerful at confederation. For example, it wasn't until the Constitution Act, 1982, that the courts were explicitly allowed to strike down a statute as unconstitutional thanks to [section 52(1\\)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-16.html#h-58) (though I believe they already had been with respect to *ultra vires* laws)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why provincial superior courts in Canada can adjudicate matters falling under federal legislative power?\n\nA) The framers of the Constitution wanted to create a clear separation between provincial and federal jurisdictions.\n\nB) Provincial superior courts have exclusive jurisdiction over all matters, both provincial and federal.\n\nC) The Constitution allows provincial courts to hear federal matters by default, with the option for Parliament to create federal courts for specific areas.\n\nD) Federal appointment of provincial superior court judges automatically grants them jurisdiction over federal matters.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Canada's judiciary is unified, meaning that by default, provincial courts (including superior courts) can adjudicate both provincial and federal matters. This is based on Section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867, which places the judiciary primarily under provincial responsibility. However, Section 101 of the Constitution Act allows Parliament to create federal courts for specific areas of federal law if desired.

In this case, can Uber company sue against the developer because they have also bought copyrights for the Uber application?\n\nIt's a little bit confusing for me as a developer because most of the time we use similar codes to create similar behaviors in an application. Also the way you code is like your handwritten and you can not code similar applications in different ways, it's kinda meaningless! Because most of the time we just copy and paste similar codes that we already use in another application if we want to build something similar.\n\n**So how does copyrights law work for the applications?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A fundamental principle of copyright law is that protection is only afforded to the concrete expression, and not the abstract idea. Therefore, if you write a sort program, what is protected is \"that specific program\", and not the general idea of a sort program. There are many kinds of sort algorithms: if you write a bubble sort program, you don't \"own\" all bubble sort programs, you only own the one that you wrote. If you sell your right to a particular bubble sort program, you don't thereby prevent yourself from writing another bubble sort program. But, technically, you *do* prevent yourself from copying that program, changing some variable names or maybe manually recoding a couple of lines, and re\\-licensing the code (assuming that you fully transferred copyright, or gave the customer exclusive rights to the code).\n\nThe basic question that the courts will ask is \"did you copy that program\", which they answer by looking at the similarity between the two programs. All bubble sorts have a necessary similarity. To prove infringement, the plaintiff would (ultimately) have to prove that the similarity had to have come from copying rather than independent coincidental re\\-creation. Functional considerations and general programmer practice\nwould tend to weigh against an allegation of infringement in certain cases, where \"counter\" is a common name for a counter variable, and bubble sort is a well known algorithm with limited practical differences in lines of code.\n\nThe hard part is establishing that it would be natural for such similarities to exist even when independently coded by a single person. It may be common practice to take a program that you've sold and tweak it in some fashion, but that is copyright infringement, whereas \"applying the lessons that you learned in writing X to a new program\" is not infringement, it is using the same ideas, and the ideas are not what is protected."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a ride-sharing application similar to Uber and sells it, including the copyright, to Company A.

Copyright law protects the specific expression of an idea (in this case, the actual code), not the general concept or functionality. The developer can create a new ride-sharing application for Company B, using similar ideas and algorithms. However, if the new code is too similar to the original application sold to Company A, it could be considered copyright infringement. The courts would examine the degree of similarity between the two programs to determine if copying occurred, taking into account that some similarities are expected due to the nature of the application and common programming practices.

Probably if you could provide information that would wipe ISIS out, the DoJ would grant you immunity from prosecution for this specific offense, but there is no law that requires granting immunity from prosecution.

For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\nIn software, making a work based on another work (excluding the fact that your work only links, i.e. makes API Calls \\- `ApacheAPI.do_something()`. Mind you, other licenses may change the definition of a derivative work, and this is not universal to all licenses) is a derivative work. To make a derivative work requires modifying, or creating a new work that is heavily reliant on the existing work.\n\nThey are basically the same thing.

According to the information provided, modifying software and creating derivative works are essentially the same thing in the context of software licensing. Any modification to the software typically results in a derivative work, as long as it's not merely linking to the original software's interfaces.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the rights are not completely separate and distinct; they heavily overlap.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it suggests that some derivative works don't require modification, which goes against the definition provided. All derivative works involve some form of modification or elaboration on the original work.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it implies that some modifications don't result in derivative works, which is generally not the case in software licensing.

It would otherwise seem like an email exchange between people who work remotely. I've always imagined them as nine people working in the same office building. Do the nine justices continually send written letters to one another? (Is this because they don't always work in proximity to one another?) Are there assistants typing up each person's notes and sending them to the other eight Justices?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Justices communicate by exchanging written memoranda, or at least they did during Justice Stevens\u2019 time. See Jeffrey Toobin, [*The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nine_(book)) (2007\\), p 48:\n\n> Outsiders tend to be surprised by how rarely Supreme Court justices speak to each other, one on one. Under Rehnquist, the nine spent a good deal of time together as a group. Argument days, most Mondays and Wednesdays when they were in session, were preceded by the traditional thirty\\-six handshakes, each justice with every other, and they had lunch together most of these days as well. There were also conference discussions every Friday during these weeks. **After the conference, however, the justices tended to communicate with one another through memos, which were often drafted by their law clerks.** (After e\\-mail became ubiquitous, the memos also circulated electronically, but always with paper copies as well; among the justices, only Thomas and Breyer, and eventually Stevens, were fully comfortable communicating by e\\-mail.)\n\nSome further detail about the distribution of these memos appears later in an anecdote about *Bush v. Gore* (p 170\\):\n\n> Stevens drafted an order of just a few sentences remanding the case to the Florida Supreme Court for the setting of a statewide standard to continue the recount. He sent his messenger scurrying down the marble hallway to Kennedy and the rest of the justices. He heard nothing back, except from Ginsburg, who said she would join if it was a way of bringing the whole Court together. (The rush of events in Bush v. Gore strained the Court's technology, which was, in 2000, still rather primitive. As a security precaution, the e\\-mail system circulated only within the building. Plus, there was only a single, communal computer from which the justices and clerks could obtain access to the Internet. Because only Thomas and Breyer used computers regularly at the time, there was little pressure from the justices to update. For the most part, the justices communicated with one another by hand\\-delivered memos, which were typed by their secretaries.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided about Supreme Court communication practices during Justice Stevens' time, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Justices primarily communicated through email, with paper copies sent as backup.\nB) Justices rarely spoke one-on-one, relying mainly on written memoranda for communication.\nC) The Court had a sophisticated internal computer network for sharing draft opinions.\nD) Justices held daily face-to-face meetings to discuss cases and share their views.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect.

Option B is too absolute, as bill-paying isn't always a violation.

Fraud is using deception to receive an advantage \\- if the director said the would pay by a certain date in order to get something from the contractor and *at that time* they had no intention of doing so, then that could be fraud. However, you can see how difficult it would be to prove that circumstances hadn't changed.\n\nTrading while Insolvent\n-----------------------\n\nIts pretty much universal in insolvency law that trading while you are insolvent is unlawful and possibly criminal. In this context, \"trading\" means incurring debts an \"insolvent\" means being unable to pay your debts as and when they fall due. Again, unless it is egregious, its hard to prove. Insolvent trading only occurs when a reasonably prudent director knows that the company is insolvent.

The CEO's lie alone does not automatically constitute fraud, as fraud requires proof of intentional deception for gain at the time of the statement. However, if the CEO knowingly continued trading while the company was insolvent, this could be considered unlawful and possibly criminal, potentially leading to prosecution. This doesn't typically make the CEO personally liable to creditors, but it can result in legal consequences for the CEO.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lying itself is not automatically fraud, and personal liability isn't guaranteed.

While it is generally possible for a website or software to include payment terms in their service agreement, the key factor is whether the user clearly agreed to these terms. In this scenario, burying the payment clause in section 17 of a 20-page document makes it unlikely that most users would have seen or agreed to this term.

An H\\&R Block associate instructed me to contact tech support to unlink the accounts. Upon talking to tech support I was told my ex\\-wife needs to call to unlink. When she called they told her the same thing after trying to change the account.\n\nIs H\\&R Block breaching my privacy? \n\n[H\\&R Block Privacy practices](https://www.hrblock.com/universal/digital-online-mobile-privacy-principles.html)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can only address the question at a general level, and you'd need to hire an attorney to get an answer tailored to your circumstances. Also, there isn't enough information available to us about your relationship with Block.\n\nPresumably, you have some kind of client agreement with the company, which will say things about what they will and can do, and likewise for you. That agreement will be the primary source of privacy\\-related restrictions on what they can do w.r.t. you. If \"you\" (the account holder) are defined as being you and your ex\\-wife, then they cannot deprive your wife of her contractual right to access to information. It does not matter that you are now divorced: what matters is what is in the agreement. It is highly likely that her access to this information is based on her being a party to the contract. There is a tiny chance that this is due to a screw\\-up on their part, such as them typing in the wrong ssn when modifying an account or creating a new account.\n\nThe document you link to regarding privacy policies is just one of many \u2013 they provide 4 other links applicable to other client relations. That document tells you what information they collect, there they get it from, what they do with it and who they share with. For example they say they do not sell your information. The applicable promise in this document seems to be:\n\n> We do not sell, or rent your information (including your social\n>  security number). We may share your information to support the\n>  products and services you request or provide you information on\n>  products and services that may benefit you. We may also share your\n>  information as permitted by law or with your additional consent.\n\nThis does not preclude freely sharing information in a way that is allowed by law. [26 USC\u202f6103](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6103) is relevant law. The general rule is that returns are confidential and cannot be disclosed if obtained by certain people in connection with service as an employee acording to provisions of that section. In particular,\n\n> (3\\) no other person (or officer or employee thereof) who has or had\n>  access to returns or return information under subsection\n>  (e)(1\\)(D)(iii), subsection (k)(10\\), paragraph (6\\), (10\\), (12\\), (16\\),\n>  (19\\), (20\\), or (21\\) of subsection (l), paragraph (2\\) or (4\\)(B) of\n>  subsection (m), or subsection (n),\n\nSection (e) is about permitted disclosures to persons having material interest. That section starts by saying that that is \n\n> (A) in the case of the return of an individual...(ii) the spouse of\n>  that individual if the individual and such spouse have signified their\n>  consent to consider a gift reported on such return as made one\\-half by\n>  him and one\\-half by the spouse pursuant to the provisions of section\n>  2513\n\nThus they are allowed to disclose your return to your wife. It does not matter whether you file jointly or separately. What *does* matter is whether she is your spouse.\n\nIf they disclosed a return for a tax year where you were not married (and she had none of the other listed interests), that might be a violation of the law. For the most part, this law restricts government disclosure of tax returns, but there is that clause applicable to *all* employees. Your attorney would then scrutinize that extremely long section to see whether such a disclosure is illegal, and whether there is some escape from liability if you fail to notify the company that X is no longer your spouse.\n\nYou need an attorney to solve your problem. If you are just curious as to how the law works, that is why we are here, but it's impossible to say anything useful without details on how she got access, and what your agreement states."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A recently divorced individual discovers that their ex-spouse can still access their tax returns through H&R Block's online system.

If the ex-spouse accessed tax returns for years after the divorce was finalized, this could potentially be a violation of privacy laws. The answer isn't A because H&R Block isn't automatically in violation; it depends on the specifics of the situation. C is incorrect because while H&R Block has some sharing permissions, they are not unlimited and must comply with legal restrictions.

If no other legal basis allows the processing, you need to acquire consent. Consent must be *freely given*. If something is gated behind consent without that consent being really necessary, this might coerce users and they would not be able to consent freely. The GDPR does not have a hard ban on this, but it explicitly calls out that this case must be considered when determining whether consent is valid.\n\nSo what your company is trying to do is in a dark grey area. Not necessarily wrong, but likely so.\n\nConsent could be made free if users have an actual choice. For example, some online newspaper sites had success with a \u201cpay or consent\u201d wall. (Success in the sense that some data protection authorities allowed this). In your case, this could mean that users either consent to extra data collection, or that they buy some reasonably priced premium mode.\n\nBut none of this is for you to decide. You can voice your doubts that the software would be compliant. You could also ask if the Data Protection Impact Assessment document for this proposed processing is available (creating such an assessment is likely mandatory in this case).

Trademarks must be actively used to remain valid.\n2. Anyone can apply to have a disused trademark deregistered.\n3. The owner's public announcement of never using it again would make it difficult to prove continued use or intent to use.\n4. The owner might be estopped (legally prevented) from opposing a deregistration application due to their public statement.\n\nA is incorrect because trademarks require active use. B is incorrect as there's no automatic termination. D is incorrect because legal processes are required for deregistration, and it's not immediately available for use by others without potential consequences."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35992/can-i-register-current-vehicle-on-another-state-for-my-wife-to-use-it-and-buy-an", "docs_id": 35992, "title": "Can I register current vehicle on another state for my wife to use it and buy another in the state I am currently In?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I currently stay and work in Texas and own a vehicle which is titled and registered in Texas.

In fact failing to do so might be a violation of the law.\n\nIt is legal to allow any licensed driver to use your car if you choose to. That certainly includes your wife (provided that she is properly licensed).\n\nYou should notify the insurance company where you have a policy on the car of the changed address. You should make sure that your policy complies with at least the minimum requirements in West Virginia, which may be different from those in Texas. You should also notify the insurance company that your wife will be driving the car regularly, with an estimate of the average daily or weekly mileage that the car will be driven. All this may change the premium on your policy. \n\nThe state's [DMV site](https://transportation.wv.gov/dmv/Pages/default.aspx) should provide a list of requirements for a car to be registered there.

To sum it up, a teacher fed a dying puppy to a snapping turtle and was charged with animal cruelty.\n\nPersonally, I would never feed a dog to a turtle, as I consider it morally wrong. However, I started thinking, why is it illegal?\n\nPet shops sell live animals for the purpose of feeding other animals.\n\nI have had many pets in my life and fed them live food. I have fed live shrimp to fish. I gave live fish to my snakes. I fed live insects to lizards. I gave rats and mice to my python. None of these are considered animal cruelty.\n\nSo what makes feeding a dying dog to a turtle less legal than feeding a perfectly healthy rat to a snake? Both animals can be pets, so why is one animal cruelty and the other perfectly acceptable? The only thing I can think of is that Americans consider dogs to be cuter than rodents.\n\nIs this a law due to common morality? Or is there some other legal reason?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, the law is not based on the species, it is based on the use of the animal. This gives rise to the difference between food rabbits and pet rabbits, and so on. The definition or applicable offenses are spelled out in each state's criminal code. In Washington, Chapter [9\\.08 RCW](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.08&full=true) covers \"Crimes relating to animals\", and [16\\.52 RCW](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=16.52&full=true) covers \"prevention of cruelty to animals\". 9\\.08\\.065 defines a \"pet animal\" as\n\n> a tamed or domesticated animal legally retained by a person and kept\n>  as a companion. \"Pet animal\" does not include livestock raised for\n>  commercial purposes\n\nand then makes it a crime to steal a pet animal (this is in addition to regular laws against theft that applies to any property). So if you steal someone's pet goat, that's two or more crimes, but if you steal a meat goat, that's one less crime.\n\nThe main anti\\-cruelty laws are in [16\\.52](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=16.52&full=true). Distinctions may be made between between domestic animals and generic animals, or between livestock and others, or food animals and others, so it just depends on the action being forbidden. RCW 16\\.52\\.205 says you commit first degree animal cruelty if you\n\n> intentionally (a) inflicts substantial pain on, (b) causes physical\n>  injury to, or (c) kills an animal by a means causing undue suffering\n>  or while manifesting an extreme indifference to life, or forces a\n>  minor to inflict unnecessary pain, injury, or death on an animal.\n\nThere is no other provision allowing you to torture any animal, not even a backyard rat. It is generally illegal to poison animals, but RCW 16\\.52\\.190 allows euthanizing by poison, or pest\\-eradication by poison (insects are animals too). Thus it is legal to poison a pest rat but illegal to poison a pet rat. There is also a general exception, in 16\\.52\\.180, that\n\n> No part of this chapter shall be deemed to interfere with any of the\n>  laws of this state known as the \"game laws,\" nor be deemed to\n>  interfere with the right to destroy any venomous reptile or any known\n>  as dangerous to life, limb or property, or to interfere with the right\n>  to kill animals to be used for food or with any properly conducted\n>  scientific experiments or investigations, which experiments or\n>  investigations shall be performed only under the authority of the\n>  faculty of some regularly incorporated college or university of the\n>  state of Washington or a research facility registered with the United\n>  States department of agriculture and regulated by 7 U.S.C. Sec. 2131\n>  et seq.\n\nThis allows you to kill chickens for food, and might be construed as allowing you to feed rats to your snake (the law does not say \"used as food for humans\"). The definition of 1st degree cruelty also has an exception that \"Nothing in this section may be considered to prohibit accepted animal husbandry practices\" (however, keeping an animal as a pet or educational object does not constitute \"animal husbandry\" in the ordinary meaning of words). There is no clear statutory division in Washington between feeding rats to reptiles, and feeding dogs to reptiles, and if you were to feed kittens to your monitor lizard, you might well get arrested.\n\nIdaho [animal cruelty law](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3504/) also forbids cruelty to any animal:\n\n> Every person who is cruel to any animal, or who causes or procures any\n>  animal to be cruelly treated, or who, having the charge or custody of\n>  any animal either as owner or otherwise, subjects any animal to\n>  cruelty shall, upon conviction, be punished in accordance with section\n>  25\\-3520A, Idaho Code.\n\nand cruel(ty) is\n\n> (a) The intentional and malicious infliction of pain, physical\n>  suffering, injury or death upon an animal; (b) To maliciously kill,\n>  maim, wound, torment, deprive of necessary sustenance, drink or\n>  shelter, cruelly beat, mutilate or cruelly kill an animal; (c) To\n>  subject an animal to needless suffering or inflict unnecessary\n>  cruelty; (d) To knowingly abandon an animal; (e) To negligently\n>  confine an animal in unsanitary conditions or to negligently house an\n>  animal in inadequate facilities; to negligently fail to provide\n>  sustenance, water or shelter to an animal.\n\nAgain, feeding a rat to a snake is not intrinsically malicious, nor is feeding a puppy to a turtle intrinsically malicious. A distinction *can* be made under the related law on [torturing a companion animal](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3504A/) (an extension of the original anti\\-cruelty law):\n\n> A person is guilty of the offense of torturing a companion animal if\n>  he tortures a companion animal as defined in this chapter.\n\nwhere \"companion animal\" is defined as \n\n> those animals solely kept as pets and not used as production animals,\n>  as defined in this section, including, but not limited to, domestic\n>  dogs, domestic cats, rabbits, companion birds, and other animals.\n\nThis gives a basis for distinguishing feeder rats from feeder puppies.\nTorture is then defined as\n\n> the intentional, knowing and willful infliction of unjustifiable and\n>  extreme or prolonged pain, mutilation or maiming done for the purpose\n>  of causing suffering. \"Torture\" shall not mean or include acts of\n>  omission or of neglect nor acts committed unintentionally or by\n>  accident. \"Torture\" also shall not mean or include normal or legal\n>  practices as provided in section [25\\-3514](https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title25/T25CH35/SECT25-3514/), Idaho Code.\n\nAnd thus it is not clear that feeding an animal to a turtle counts, since the purpose is to feed the turtle, not to cause suffering. The exceptions spelled out in 25\\-3514 might be applicable, but there are not *clearly* applicable. One exception is \"The humane slaughter of any animal normally and commonly raised as food, for production of fiber or equines\" \u2013 perhaps using an animal as feed for another animal can be \"humane slaughter\", perhaps rats are \"normally and commonly\" raised as food, unlike dogs.\n\nIt is not currently against federal law to slaughter cats and dogs for meat, but there is a [bill in Congress](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1406?r=1) which would make it so. The bill has 245 sponsors in the House, so it is likely to pass."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal distinction between feeding a rat to a snake and feeding a puppy to a turtle?\n\nA) Feeding rats to snakes is explicitly protected by law, while feeding puppies to turtles is explicitly forbidden.\n\nB) The legality depends entirely on whether the animal being fed is considered \"cute\" by American standards.\n\nC) There is no clear statutory distinction between the two acts in many jurisdictions, but feeding a puppy may be more likely to be prosecuted due to how companion animals are defined.\n\nD) Feeding any live animal to another is considered animal cruelty and is equally illegal in all cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The information provided suggests that in many jurisdictions, there is no clear statutory distinction between feeding rats to snakes and puppies to turtles. However, puppies are more likely to be classified as \"companion animals\" under the law, which could make feeding them to another animal more likely to be prosecuted as animal cruelty. The legality often depends on the specific wording of local laws and how they define cruelty, companion animals, and accepted animal husbandry practices.

The board receives the hearing officer's report and denies the applicant again, without giving any reason.\n\nAssuming all of the above is permitted by statute, does anybody see a due process problem? Can anyone point to any specific case law? To me it looks awfully close to a sham hearing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The clause \"assuming all of the above is permitted by statute\" introduces an invalid assumption. \"Permitted by the statute\" is (a) a question of legal interpretation and (b) only a part of the \"due process\" question.\n\nIn US law, \"due process\" means \"follows the law\". One source of law is the constitution (state or US). A second is a statute. A third is regulations that are statutorily authorized. A fourth is case law. If you don't follow the law, you have a due process problem. The government has to follow fair legal procedures in depriving a person of life, liberty, or property. If it doesn't, you have a procedural due process problem, and that could figure into a lawsuit (then the courts will decide if your claim is correct). [Here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/due_process) is a bit of a guide.\n\nThe facts as stated to not show that the required fundamental fairness was omitted or that the law was not followed. If the law obligates the board to accept the judgment of an external reviewer, then there has been a violation of due process \u2013 there is no chance that there is any such requirement. If the board is legally required to state a reason for denying an appeal and they fail to do so, then they have not followed the law.\n\nThere is also \"substantive due process\", which involves fundamental rights. The right to ply your trade is a fundamental right \"implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\", but the Commerce Clause (in your favorite state) also gives the government the right to regulate businesses, so there is a balancing act that has to be performed. In this case, a board cannot just say \"we don't want this guy working in our state because we don't like his face\", so they would have to have a reason to deny the person a license. It might take a lawsuit to get them to reveal that reason, and the lawsuit would resolve the question of whether the government followed the law.\n\n[This article](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2346/73994/13_7TexTechAdminLJ205%282006%29.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) touches on Due Process concerns w.r.t. occupational licensing in Texas, and [Patel v.

Due process in US law involves following established legal procedures, which can come from various sources including constitutions, statutes, regulations, and case law. While the scenario raises potential due process concerns, determining if a violation occurred would require examining specific state laws and regulations governing the licensing board's procedures.

I'm just trying to see how long it takes to crack the phone's wifi password, to make it as secure as possible.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: US law ([18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030)) only addresses US government computers, computers used in a way that affects interstate commerce, and those of financial institutions. Turns out, cell phones and home computers affect interstate commerce. So the forbidden acts are delimited by expressions like \"having knowingly accessed a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access\", \"intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access\" or \"knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value\". Notice that the law is stated in terms of authorization to access, and not \"cracking passwords\". Similarly, [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2701) uses phrases like \"accesses without authorization\". Each state has its own laws: in Washington, [RCW 9A.52\\.110\\-130](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.52.110) identifies forbidden acts via phrases like \"without authorization, intentionally gains access\".\n\nThe closest I can find that comes to a law that might imaginably have some bearing on \"password cracking\" is [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1029](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1029) which prohibits uses of \"counterfeit access devices\". An \"access device\" is defined in para (e) as \"any ...means of account access that can be used, alone or in conjunction with another access device, to obtain money...\" (there is the usual attempt at an exhaustive listing behind the ellipses). A password cracker would then be an access device since it along with a user interface to a system allows one to access the system and thus the internet of things. A counterfeit password cracker would be e.g. one manufactured by BlackhatHackersoft which passes itself off as one manufactured by WhitehatHackersoft.\n\nHowever: 18 USC 1029 specifically says \"knowingly *and with intent to defraud* produces, uses, or traffics in one or more counterfeit access devices\", and the intent that you describe is *not* to defraud. If you want a paid analysis by a professional, you can hire an attorney. My view is that if the police were to come after you, that would be an abuse of law, because the law does not prohibit taking reasonable steps to select a safe password (something like \"CorrectHorseBatteryStaple\", which I hear is now just behind \"password\" in use as a password)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to US federal law, which of the following actions would most likely be considered illegal when attempting to test the security of a smartphone's Wi-Fi hotspot?\n\nA) Using a password cracking tool to determine the strength of the hotspot password\nB) Accessing the hotspot without authorization with intent to defraud\nC) Creating a counterfeit version of a legitimate password cracking software\nD) Accessing the hotspot without authorization to test its security, with the owner's permission\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) While using a password cracking tool might seem questionable, the law focuses more on unauthorized access and intent, rather than the specific tools used. If done with permission and without fraudulent intent, this may not be illegal.\n\nB) This is the correct answer because it combines two key elements mentioned in the laws: unauthorized access and intent to defraud. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030 specifically prohibits accessing a computer (which includes smartphones) without authorization and with intent to defraud.\n\nC) While 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1029 does mention counterfeit access devices, it still requires intent to defraud for it to be illegal. Simply creating a counterfeit version without fraudulent intent may not be enough to violate this law.\n\nD) Although accessing without authorization is generally prohibited, if the owner (in this case, the father who owns the phone) gives permission, it would not be considered unauthorized access and thus not illegal.\n\nThe key factors in determining legality are authorization and intent. Unauthorized access with fraudulent intent is the most clearly illegal scenario presented in the options."}}
