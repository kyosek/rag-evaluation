During the ongoing investigation, but prior to trial, the local news ran a piece showing my mug shot.

Does this impact my ability to get a fair trial? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's nothing illegal about the media discussing your case. In fact most media outlets don't hold back many details about the accused, because it's all public information that anyone curious about it can get from the court clerk's office for free and with no reason specified.\n\nIf jury selection hasn't started yet, then asking each juror about what they might know about the case is a pretty standard question that any competent defense attorney would be asking, even without knowledge of media coverage. If they already know about the case and say they can't put that knowledge aside when rendering a verdict, they are almost always dismissed. If you're concerned your defense attorney isn't aware of the media coverage, that's something you need to bring up with them.\n\nIf jury selection already took place, and nobody bothered to ask them if they had prior knowledge of the case, then there's pretty much nothing you can do. A judge *might* ask the jury if anyone's seen the coverage, but it usually results in nothing happening. The media talking about your case is not grounds for a mistrial; it's rarely even grounds for a change of venue.

Media coverage alone is not grounds for an automatic mistrial or change of venue. These are extreme measures that require specific circumstances and proof of juror misconduct.\n\nB) Incorrect. The defendant does have recourse through the jury selection process, where potential jurors can be questioned about their exposure to media coverage and potential biases.\n\nC) Correct. As stated in the documentation, asking jurors about their prior knowledge of the case is a standard practice during jury selection. This allows the defense to identify and potentially dismiss jurors who may have been influenced by media coverage.\n\nD) Incorrect. While judges may ask jurors about exposure to media coverage, they are not required to automatically dismiss jurors who have seen such coverage.

It might be [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) or allowed similar exceptions in other countries or could be a copyright infringement.\n\nFor example, using book covers images in a [blog entry doing a critical analysis of those books covers](http://listocomics.com/el-misterio-de-los-detectives-mellizos/) is OK under [right to quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_quote) (as covered by Spanish law) and it would be OK under fair use.

Using book covers alongside user-written reviews and critical analysis falls under the right to quote and fair use principles.

One Canadian dollars \\= 0\\.77 U.S. dollars. The monetary claim limits in U.S. dollars in Canadian courts (at this rate) are as follows:\n\nThe Civil Division of the Provincial Court of Alberta hears claims up to $50,000\\. ($38,500 USD)\n\nThe Civil Resolution Tribunal hears claims up to $5,000 ($3,850 USD) The Provincial Court of British Columbia\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims from $5,001 to $35,000 ($26,950 USD)\n\nThe Manitoba Court of Queen\u2019s Bench\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $15,000\\. ($11,550 USD)\n\nThe Small Claims Court of New Brunswick hears claims up to $20,000\\. ($15,400 USD)\n\nThe Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $25,000\\.

($15,400 USD)\n\nThe Ontario Superior Court of Justice\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $35,000\\. ($26,950 USD)\n\nThe Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $16,000\\. ($12,320 USD)\n\nThe Small Claims Division at the Court of Qu\u00e9bec hears claims up to $15,000\\.

($18,250 USD)\n\n**The Term \"Small Claims Court\" Is Used Differently**\n\nSecond, this isn't an apples to apples comparison. The Canadian limits are for what would be called limited jurisdiction civil courts in the U.S., (except perhaps, British Columbia's Civil Resolution Tribunal) and aren't strictly equivalent to U.S. small claims courts which are a bit like the \"[Judge Judy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Judy)\" show or \"[The People's Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Court)\" on U.S. television\n\nBut, most U.S. jurisdictions distinguish between small claims cases, which have a lower dollar limit and in which plaintiffs cannot commence cases with lawyers, and have an extremely simplified process, and ordinary civil cases in limited jurisdiction courts, which still have lots of parties without lawyers, and have greatly simplified and shortened pretrial civil procedure, but have higher dollar limits and allow either party to be represented by lawyers without limitations.\n\nMost adversarial U.S. limited jurisdiction court cases that are not small claims court cases are filed by professional debt collection firms on behalf of businesses, *en masse* with many cases resolved by default judgment, or involve protective orders (e.g. in domestic violence situations).\n\nThe charts below for U.S. Courts (from [here](https://www.ncsc.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/13376/civiljusticereport-2015.pdf) as of 2015 and hence seven years out of date) illustrate the difference. As of 2022, Colorado's limits are $7,500 USD for small claims court and $25,000 for its limited jurisdiction court. Some states, like New York State, have different jurisdictional limits in limited jurisdiction courts in different parts of the state.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHvJ9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHvJ9.png)\n\nAccording to the body text, some limited jurisdiction courts in the U.S. can entertain claims up to $200,000 USD (i.e. Mississippi and Texas).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ultTV.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ultTV.png)\n\n**Intrastate Federalism**\n\nMany courts of limited jurisdiction in the U.S. are part of local governments (e.g. a city or municipal court) rather than part of the state court system. State governments have often been reluctant to grant much authority to civil courts which are outside the state court system (that state legislatures can regulate directly) to local governments.\n\nIn contrast, all of the limited jurisdiction courts in Canada are part of either a provincial level court system, or the courts of a self\\-governing territory (also, while not precisely on point, while Canada has federal courts, the jurisdiction of Canada's federal courts is very limited and the federal court dockets make up only a tiny part of the total judicial system case load in Canada).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding small claims courts in Canada and the United States?\n\nA) The monetary limits for small claims courts are generally higher in Canada than in the United States when converted to USD.\n\nB) All Canadian provinces and territories use the term \"small claims court\" uniformly for their limited jurisdiction civil courts.\n\nC) In the United States, small claims courts and limited jurisdiction civil courts are synonymous terms with identical monetary limits and procedures.\n\nD) The jurisdiction of small claims courts in both Canada and the United States is determined by the federal government in each country.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) is correct. When converted to USD, many Canadian provinces have higher monetary limits for their limited jurisdiction civil courts (often called \"small claims courts\") compared to typical U.S. small claims courts. For example, Ontario's limit of $35,000 CAD is equivalent to about $26,950 USD, which is higher than most U.S. small claims court limits.\n\nB) is incorrect. While many Canadian provinces use the term \"small claims court,\" there are exceptions. For instance, Alberta uses \"Civil Division of the Provincial Court\" for claims up to $50,000 CAD.\n\nC) is incorrect. In the U.S., small claims courts typically have lower monetary limits and more simplified procedures compared to limited jurisdiction civil courts. They are distinct entities with different rules and limits.\n\nD) is incorrect.

The boardgame in question has recently been the subject of a Kickstarter campaign for a reprint with various bells and whistles; the company running the Kickstarter campaign, and marketing the new edition of the game, has got in touch with me asking me whether I would be willing to collaborate in promotional activities for the launch, to raise the profile of the new edition of the game among the site's userbase.\n\nOne of the proposed activities is a knockout tournament, the winner (or winner and some runners\\-up) of the tournament to receive prizes in the form of a copy of the Kickstarted product. There has been discussion of also giving a cash prize to the winner of the tournament, in addition to the copy of the game. I am unsure whether in order to run this activity I would require a UK \"casino operating licence\". I consulted [this page](https://www.out-law.com/page-6780) and my concerns are primarily with the paragraph about halfway down the page, headed \"Is the competition gaming?\":\n\n> If a skill competition involves \"playing a game of chance\", it will be\n>  gaming \u2013 and so require the appropriate licence, usually a casino\n>  operating licence \u2013 whether or not any payment is involved.

As such, it appears to fall under the definition of \"playing a game of chance\" as given in the quoted paragraph.\n* There is no charge for registering on the website or for playing games.

This defense is meant for situations like a theft victim telling the thief \"give me back my property or I'll call the cops;\" unless paying the customer is actually a reasonable action to make up for the crime, the customer can't use this defense.\n\nIf the crime is a federal one, this is also blackmail under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 873:\n\n> Whoever, under a threat of informing, or as a consideration for not informing, against any violation of any law of the United States, demands or receives any money or other valuable thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\n\nIf interstate communications are involved, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 875(d) can also apply:\n\n> Whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other thing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation of the addressee or of another or the reputation of a deceased person **or any threat to accuse the addressee or any other person of a crime,** shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer discovers that a company has committed a federal crime.

Or signing a real lease. But do this in conjunction with the landlord; you are still a tenant yourself.\n\nYour landlord deals with the eviction process, not you.

What is the most appropriate initial step for the original tenant to take in this situation?\n\nA) Call the local police department to have the NLYS removed immediately\nB) Consult with the landlord about mentioning potential eviction proceedings through Fulton County to the NLYS\nC) Personally initiate eviction proceedings against the NLYS through the Fulton County Marshal's Department\nD) Change the locks to prevent the NLYS from entering the property\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate initial step is to consult with the landlord about mentioning potential eviction proceedings through Fulton County to the NLYS. This approach is correct because:\n\n1. The police typically defer tenant issues to the county sheriff's department.\n2. The original tenant cannot personally initiate eviction proceedings, as this is the landlord's responsibility.\n3. Changing locks without legal authority could be illegal and worsen the situation.\n4. Mentioning potential eviction proceedings, done in conjunction with the landlord, might motivate the NLYS to either sign the lease or leave voluntarily.\n5. This approach follows proper legal channels while potentially resolving the issue without immediate legal action.\n\nOption A is incorrect because police generally don't handle lease disputes.

One may always create a new image of a skyline on one's own. No permission is needed from others who have created such images.\n\nHowever, an existing image is quite likely to be protected by copyright. In that case permission must usually be obtained, unless an ***exception to copyright*** applies. That is true whether the desired use is for profit or not.\n\nHere it seems that the OP has asked for and received permission to use the image, or a modified version of it. The beast practice is for the owner to specify under what conditions use is permitted, and what acknowledgement or credit must be provided, and what fee if any will be charged. But it seems that in this instance the copyright owner left that vague.\n\nIn that case some acknowledgement is probably a good idea. A note such as \"Skyline image based on image created by {author}. Used by permission of {copyright owner}.\" could be displayed along with the image, or in some other appropriate place.

While the employee created their own version, it was based on an existing copyrighted image. Even though broad permission was given, it's best practice to acknowledge the original work and its use by permission. A credit line such as \"Skyline image based on image created by {author}. Used by permission of {copyright owner}.\" is appropriate and helps avoid potential copyright issues.

I explained that I had not received any other letter and wanted to contest but was not given the opportunity to do so.

Chicago, in particular, has its own specific procedures. There is often a strict deadline for the challenge process, and fines do escalate significantly if they go unpaid for even a short time.\n\nOne who wants to challenge such a ticket would do well to find the name and address of the court where the ticket is returnable. This may be on the ticket, or a google or other online search may reveal it. Having found the address, send a letter explaining why you think the ticket is in error. Be clear and polite but concise, and include the ticket number and other inditing details. Include copies of the letter and anything that came with it. Send this by certified mail, return receipt.

The members' views and opinions are very divided. Where I live there certainly has been talk that some unions may be sued for failing to protect their members against employer COVID policies. My union hired a team of lawyers who they have a long standing relationship with. They were tasked to review legalities of employer COVID policies.

The economics of the arrangement are different, but outside counsel is not more or less objective and neutral, in theory at least, than in house counsel.\n\nOutside counsel and in house counsel owe essentially the same duties in the context of a lawyer\\-client relationship to the client (in this case, the union), although, in practice, outside counsel with evaluate those duties and that relationship in the context of a single one off assignment, while in house counsel will evaluate those duties with a much richer understanding of the underlying facts of a matter and the larger context in which it is playing out.\n\nA lawyer's duty is to advance the objectives of the client, and those objective are largely within the province of the client and not the lawyer, although a lawyer has greater latitude in exercise discretion regarding the means by which this objective is achieved.\n\nFor example, a client could legitimately say that it wants to bring a lawsuit arising out of an incident it was involved in, but the lawyer would usually decide which court it was filed in, what specific legal claims were asserted, and so on.\n\n> \\[If] the lawyers didn't think they had a good chance to win, must the\n> lawyers still work to accomplish this?\n\nThere are a few boundary lines, short of resigning or withdrawing from representation when not legally or ethically required to do so, because the lawyer simply doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, the lawyer isn't allowed to bring groundless, frivolous, or vexatious litigation, or otherwise engage in unethical conduct (e.g. fraud), even if the client wants to do so.\n\nSecond, if a lawyer with an organization as a client (like a union) believes that someone within the organization, possibly with some authority, is about to engage in illegal activity that will hurt the organization, the lawyer has a duty to speak up (internally) about this conduct and urge the client representative not to break the law, if necessary, going up as high in the management or governance of the company as necessary (e.g. up to the highest governing board or CEO) to blow the whistle on this conduct internally within the organization, and to resign if the lawyer can't otherwise avoid being involved in illegal conduct by representatives of the organization.\n\nThird, the lawyer must counsel the client representative in a manner sufficient to make the client's decision to pursue a court of action that is unlikely to win, but is not groundless, frivolous, vexatious, or illegal, an informed decision.\n\nBut, if the client decides to go forward with a course of action or objective after making an informed decision to do so with information provided by the lawyer, the lawyer has to do his or her best to carry out the decision of the client even if it would not have been the decision that the lawyer would have made. The lawyer is still an agent of the client, carrying out the client's wishes, not an entirely independent free actor.\n\n> A member had hired a lawyer with an opposing view to the union's\n> lawyers. Would this other lawyer necessarily have to agree with this\n> view or believe there is a chance at success (e.g. proving it's\n> illegal discrimination to have a COVID policy in the workplace)?\n\nAgain, no. Lawyers don't have to agree personally with the positions that they take on behalf of their clients, so long as those positions are not groundless, frivolous, or vexatious litigation, and the lawyer's work does not otherwise engage in unethical conduct (e.g. fraud), it isn't improper for the lawyer to do that.\n\nTo provide some context for why these rules are the case, keep in mind that lawyers are in the business, primarily, of dealing with situations in which there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in the law. Lawyers, judges, and courts recognize that the law and language are pliable and subject to interpretation and application to a set of facts and that it is very frequently (although not always) possible to make legitimate arguments for different interpretations of it. And, it is hard, in advance, to know which of multiple different interpretations will wind up being found to be correct (with many legal issues in a case often never having those ambiguities resolved in that case because some other factor ends up making the ambiguous issues irrelevant).\n\nLawyers exist to make sure that every legitimate interpretation that benefits a represented party involved in an interaction to which the law applies is given fair consideration, with someone else generally making the final decision about what to do.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A union hires outside counsel to review the legality of employer COVID policies.

It does include a quasi\\-exception for ordinary citizens\n\n> Nothing in this section shall preclude the immediate removal of any\n> bicycle, including, but not limited to, a derelict bicycle or ghost\n> bike, or the taking of any other action by any city agency if the\n> presence of such bicycle which creates a dangerous condition by\n> restricting vehicular or pedestrian traffic, or otherwise violates the\n> law.\n\nWhat you should take away from the ordinances is that you are not legally authorized to remove a non\\-dangerous derelict bicycle.\n\nSupposing that you do take the law into your own hands, [this page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/services/vehicles-property/property-clerk.page) would be useful to you, because you have to turn in any abandoned property to the proper authorities.

That would be a startling reading of the opinion, since it would mean that the National Firearms Act\u2019s restrictions on machineguns (not challenged in Miller) might be unconstitutional, machineguns being useful in warfare in 1939\\. We think that Miller\u2019s \u201cordinary military equipment\u201d language must be read in tandem with what comes after: \u201c\\[O]rdinarily when called for \\[militia] service \\[able\\-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\u201d 307 U. S., at 179\\. \u2026 We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law\\-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short\\-barreled shotguns.\n\nAnd at p.54:\n\n> Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th\\-century cases, commentators and courts rou\u00adtinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. \u2026Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n> \n> \n> We also recognize another important limitation on the\n> right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \u201cin common use at the time.\u201d \u2026\n> \n> \n> It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service\u2014M\\-16 rifles and the like\u2014may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large. Indeed, it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modern\\-day bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern developments have lim\u00adited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right.\n\n\u201cNobody would say machine guns have no military uses\u201d \\- indubitably.

President Donald Trump, along with Cotton\n> and Perdue, announced it at the White House. Within the Trump White\n> House, Trump advisers Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon promoted and\n> helped shape the bill. The bill has not attracted any additional\n> co\\-sponsors.\n> \n> \n> The 2017 bill did not receive a vote in the Senate. A separate bill to\n> restrict legal immigration, supported by Trump, Cotton, and Purdue,\n> was defeated in the Senate by a 39\u201360 vote. In 2019, Cotton, Perdue,\n> and other Republicans re\\-introduced the RAISE Act legislation.\n> \n> \n> Provisions and analysis\n> \n> \n> The bill would cut legal immigration by half, reducing the number of\n> green cards from more than 1 million to about 500,000\\. **The bill would\n> also remove pathways for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens\n> and legal permanent residents to apply for permanent lawful residency\n> status in the U.S., limiting the family path to spouses and minor\n> children.** The bill would also impose a cap of 50,000 refugee\n> admissions a year and would end the visa diversity lottery.\n\nFrom [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAISE_Act) (citation omitted).\n\n### It Is Hard To Know\n\nUsually, the transition rules between one law and another are one of the final things dealt with in drafting legislation, they are often changed late in the legislative process (e.g. in a reconciliation between and U.S. House passed bill and a U.S. Senate passed bill in Conference Committee), are often drafted, in substance, by committee staff, in an inconsistent way from bill to bill, with little supervision from the responsible elected officials. Often transition provisions are omitted entirely from a bill.\n\nEven if the draft bill says one thing now, it is unlikely that it will be enacted in precisely that form with respect to the transition provisions (if any).\n\nWhen transition rules are omitted entirely, the agency charged with implementing the new law, the Justice Department, and the judiciary have to figure out what to do. Under a legal case called *[Chevron](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/82-1005)* an agency that administers a law has considerable discretion in how that law is implemented, to which the courts will defer, so long as the implementation is not contrary to any clear statutory direction.\n\n### General Concepts\n\nA core issue is whether someone has a vested right that cannot be taken from them without due process and compensation, or merely an expectancy that does not amount to a vested right. This distinction is rooted mostly in the 5th Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution to due process and to not have property taken without justice compensation, and, even though it is not directly applicable by its terms to Congress, in the contracts clause in Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution which provides that:\n\n> **No State shall** enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of\n> Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of\n> Debts; **pass any** Bill of Attainder, **ex post facto Law, or Law\n> impairing the Obligation of Contracts,** or grant any Title of\n> Nobility.\n\nThe 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states in the pertinent part:\n\n> No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property,\n> without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for\n> public use, without just compensation.\n\nTypically, someone who had a current visa in force might have some sort of vested right, while someone who merely had an application for a visa (or which what is colloquially called a \"green card\" is one type of many) that was pending would not. Even a visa in force, however, would not always include a right to convert that visa into citizenship.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information about the RAISE Act and general concepts of immigration law, which of the following statements is most likely to be true if the RAISE Act were to be implemented?\n\nA) All pending green card applications for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens would be automatically converted to applications under the new system.\n\nB) Applicants with pending green card applications for family-based categories eliminated by the RAISE Act would likely have their applications summarily denied.\n\nC) Individuals with current visas in force would be guaranteed a path to citizenship under the new law.\n\nD) The implementation of the RAISE Act would have no effect on pending green card applications, as they would be grandfathered in under the old system.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most likely scenario based on the information provided.

In fact, the RAISE Act aims to eliminate these categories altogether.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while current visa holders might have some vested rights, the passage explicitly states that \"Even a visa in force, however, would not always include a right to convert that visa into citizenship.\"\n\nOption D is unlikely to be true because the passage doesn't suggest that pending applications would be grandfathered in.

It is arguably below the threshold of copyright protection.

In the US, such incidental use could be covered by fair use, but as always, it\u2019s a delicate balancing act.

Which of the following best explains why the MLB logo might be considered less problematic from a copyright perspective?\n\nA) MLB logos are always in the public domain and cannot be copyrighted\nB) The incidental use of the MLB logo in a photograph may be more defensible under fair use doctrine\nC) Copyright laws do not apply to sports team logos, only to fictional character depictions\nD) Political campaigns have blanket permission to use any sports team logos\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While both Star Wars imagery and MLB logos can be subject to copyright protection, the incidental use of a logo on a t-shirt in a photograph may be more defensible under the fair use doctrine. This is especially true if the logo is not the main focus of the image and is simply part of the background or clothing worn by individuals in the photo. However, it's important to note that fair use is a complex legal concept and depends on various factors. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because MLB logos can be and often are copyrighted. They are not automatically in the public domain.\n\nAnswer C is false because copyright laws can indeed apply to sports team logos, especially if they meet the threshold of originality.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as political campaigns do not have automatic permission to use any sports team logos without consideration of copyright laws.\n\nThe question highlights the complexity of copyright issues in photography and political campaigns, and the need to consider factors such as fair use, incidental use, and the specific nature of the copyrighted material in question."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7559/on-the-intellectual-property-of-animals-a-story-of-monkeys-and-cats", "docs_id": 7559, "title": "On the intellectual property of animals, a story of monkeys and cats!", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The story of the [monkey who took a selfie](http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2015/09/25/382768.htm) is, by now, probably widely known.

Or we can reduce or increase the number of characters like,\n\n> Steve Anderson\n> Sxxx xxxrxn\n\nI want to implement this in my code but don't now how can I implement pseudonymized Name and Email properly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR does not prescribe how information should be pseudonymized and does not even define the term properly. Yet, pseudonymization is suggested as an safety measure in various places, so that pseudonymization should be implemented wherever appropriate.\n\nThe most useful guidance the GDPR gives is by contrasting pseudonymization with anonymization, where it says that pseudonymized data is still personal data because the data subjects can be identified using additional information (see [Recital 26 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/)). In contrast, re\\-identification is not reasonably likely for truly anonymized data.\n\nA common technique for pseudonymization is to replace identifying information with a pseudonym, for example replacing a name with a random numeric ID. However, this can only be considered pseudonymous if the mapping between the ID and the real value is not available to whoever uses this data.\n\nReplacing individual fields in a data set might not be sufficient for pseudonymization because apparently non\\-sensitive fields could still enable indirect identification. This requires careful analysis taking into account the entire context of the data, so it isn't possible to say whether merely removing names \\+ email addresses achieves pseudonymization or anonymization.\n\nWhat you are doing is redacting *parts* of sensitive data. I think this is a pretty weak pseudonymization method since it still leaks partial information about the true value, and leaks information about the length of the redacted value. It is possible to argue that this is OK (e.g. if you can show that you have multiple similar redactions so that you achieve a level of k\\-anonymity). But by default, such partial redactions are likely to be unsafe. Completely removing the sensitive data is much safer.\n\nThe \u201cArticle 29 Working Party\u201d, a pre\\-GDPR EU body, has published an [opinion on anonymization techniques in 2014 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf). It does not account for the GDPR's specific phrasing, but provides an overview of pseudonymization and anonymization techniques and puts them into context of European data protection law. It considers how such guarantees guard against attacks such as singling out data subjects, linking multiple records of the same individual, and making inferences about the data subject.\n\nIn this guidance, pseudonymization techniques that are suggested include encrypting or hashing the sensitive data. However, the guidance warns that such techniques do not provide strong protection against singling out or linking records of the data subject.\n\nA bit earlier, the [UK ICO had published guidance on personal data, including on the matter of anonymization and pseudonymization (PDF)](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf) with some good examples. For determining whether a data set has been successfully anonymized (or pseudonymized), they suggest a motivated intruder test: could someone without specialist knowledge or skills re\\-identify the data subject? In your example, such a person should not be able to infer that a record about `Stxxx Axxdxrxn` is about a `Steve Anderson`. In my opinion, your pseudonymization approach would fail the motivated intruder test unless you have multiple records that could all be about Steve Anderson (compare k\\-anonymity).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the GDPR and related guidance, which of the following statements about pseudonymization is most accurate?\n\nA) Pseudonymization always involves replacing individual fields in a dataset with random numeric IDs.\n\nB) Partially redacting sensitive data, such as replacing \"Steve Anderson\" with \"Stxxx Axxdxrxn\", is considered a strong and sufficient pseudonymization method.\n\nC) Pseudonymization techniques should be evaluated using tests like the \"motivated intruder test\" to ensure they provide adequate protection against re-identification.\n\nD) The GDPR provides specific, prescriptive methods for how data should be pseudonymized in all cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation emphasizes that the GDPR does not prescribe specific pseudonymization methods, ruling out option D. While replacing fields with IDs is mentioned as a common technique, it's not the only method, so A is too limited. Option B is incorrect because partial redaction is described as a weak method that may fail to provide adequate protection. Option C is correct because the documentation mentions the \"motivated intruder test\" suggested by the UK ICO as a way to evaluate whether pseudonymization or anonymization has been successful. This test helps determine if someone without specialist knowledge could re-identify individuals from the pseudonymized data, which aligns with the GDPR's goal of protecting personal data while allowing for some level of data utility."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80629/can-a-witness-refuse-to-answer-a-question-in-a-civil-proceeding-if-it-would-incr", "docs_id": 80629, "title": "Can a witness refuse to answer a question in a civil proceeding if it would incriminate her on a unrelated criminal matter?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Basically the title.

The passage states that \"Cognizable groups for jury selection purposes generally do not include age groups, such as young adults,\" which rules out option A. However, it also mentions that \"there is authority that whether an age group is a cognizable group, for purposes of a challenge to the array of grand and traverse juries, depends on the time and location of the trial,\" which supports the possibility of exceptions as stated in option B.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage does not single out elderly individuals as consistently forming a cognizable group. In fact, it mentions that \"the elderly\" are among the age groups generally not included as cognizable groups.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage states that the claimed underrepresentation of young persons \"does not invoke a high standard of judicial review,\" which is the opposite of what this option suggests.\n\nTherefore, option B provides the most accurate and comprehensive summary of the information given in the Corpus Juris Secundum regarding age groups as cognizable groups in jury selection."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50458/would-making-a-cyborg-be-legal", "docs_id": 50458, "title": "Would making a cyborg be legal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently, I've re\\-watched the movie Robocop (2014\\), and a question has come to my mind: Would making a cyborg be legal in the US?\n\nNotes:\n\n* By \"cyborg\" I mean a robot\\-human hybrid, where the brain is essentially the unique human part and everything else is robotic.\n* I know that in the movie Robocop was actually built in China, so you can take as a side question if it would be legal in China (but done to a US citizen).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, it depends on why you are doing this, and how you go about performing the operation. There are approved devices and procedures, and there is the other stuff. In an emergency that is life\\-threatening or threatens severe debilitation, it is permitted for a physician to try an extreme measure \u2013 if the state has a \"Right to Try\" law. Otherwise, a review and official approval by the relevant IRB is required. The devices are regulated by the FDA, but the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine, so the feds don't have a say in whether a procedure is allowed. Nevertheless, use of unapproved devices can be taken to be evidence of failing to meet the required standard of care, in the case of a malpractice suit or punitive action by the state regulatory board.\n\nThere is no specific law prohibiting removing lots of organs and replacing them with prostheses, though arguable what happened was that the brain was removed (it's not that a replacement shell was built around the person). Ordinarily, intentionally \"killing\" a person is illegal (except in case of sanctioned execution or self\\-defense). There is zero case law that would tell us whether removing a brain from a body \"kills\" the person.

State laws: Some states have \"Right to Try\" laws that allow extreme measures in certain situations.\n3.

Legal ambiguity: There's no specific law prohibiting extensive organ replacement with prostheses, but it could potentially be prosecuted under existing laws against causing death.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no explicit federal law against creating cyborgs. Option B is too broad, as legality depends on various factors beyond just being a licensed physician. Option D is incorrect because the FDA doesn't have direct authority over medical procedures.

There is no requirement that they do today what they did yesterday.\n\nIf you have in your possession only a Discover card, and if they are unwilling to accept service barter as payment (washing dishes is classical), then you would have a debt to the restaurant which you must pay in a reasonable time, using an acceptable medium (such as cash, unless they don't accept cash).

If someone could definitively clear that up for me, that'd be great.\n\n(Also a possibly related question, though I understand if it should be separate, but would uploading full renders of ripped models to a website be legal, as long as it's not the model itself?)\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Creating copies of a work is generally illegal, since the right \"to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies\" and the right \"to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work\" are both exclusive rights of the copyright holder. If you don't distribute those copies, though, it could be quite difficult for the copyright holder to know anything about it. Whether you acquired the original work legally or illegally has no bearing on the legality of making copies and derivatives.\n\nFan art is generally [*prima facie*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prima_facie) copyright infringement, since it creates a derivative work without permission from the copyright holder. However, it may be permissible under fair use \\-\\- but remember that \"permissible under fair use\" means that when you *are being sued*, you may be able to convince a judge that your use is fair, despite being *prima facie* copyright infringement. It is possible that a particular fan work could be sufficiently transformative and well\\-aligned with the [four fair use factors](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/) to qualify as fair use, but there's no way to know until it is the subject of legal action and a judge assesses the case. \n\nYou see fan art everywhere, despite its unfavorable legal status, because in general, it is not worth the trouble for artists, authors, and corporations to pursue legal action. They will probably see no tangible benefit to justify their legal expenses, since, unlike verbatim copying of their works, fan art does not typically impact their profits. Furthermore it could be harmful to their reputation to be aggressively litigious against their own fans.\n\nTrademark is only relevant if you are using the mark in commerce to identify the source of goods or services.

However, it may potentially be permissible under fair use doctrine, depending on how well it aligns with the four fair use factors and how transformative it is. This determination can only be made by a judge in the context of legal action.\n\nOption A is incorrect because creating copies of copyrighted work, even for personal use, is generally not legal without permission.\n\nOption B is incorrect because fan art is not automatically protected under fair use, even if it's non-profit.\n\nOption C is incorrect because uploading renders of ripped models would still likely constitute copyright infringement, regardless of whether the original 3D files are shared."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67889/can-you-seize-a-companys-intellectual-property-if-it-was-created-using-your-pla", "docs_id": 67889, "title": "Can you seize a company&#39;s intellectual property if it was created using your platform?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can you seize a company's intellectual property if it was created using your platform? Can you put something in the user agreement that allows you to seize any intellectual property created using your platform?

Can you forbid companies or people to take their games out of your game or platform and make their own game using their own platform or someone's else platform, or take ownership of the intellectual property? I am thinking such an abusive user agreement would not be upheld in a court of law, but I could be wrong. Let's assume this is in the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, *you* cannot seize anything. The courts can, and you can ask the courts to do so for you. So the logic of this is that you operate a website that hosts software that creates something for a user. You could just unconditionally let people use it, you could require a subscription, or you could be like SE and put up a TOS with some conditions, like \"you grant us a perpetual license to use your stuff\". Users then have to agree to this in order to get access to your software.\n\nSo the answer to your question depends on whether you can write a legally\\-enforceable contract where you provide something of value in exchange for a user giving you something of value. Then if you hold up your end of the deal and the customer does not, you sue them in court for damages. The main questions are, is such a contract enforceable, and what would be the remedy that the court might order?\n\nYour description of your scheme is a bit sketchy, so I'll fill in some details. The user must submit a functioning software package, which your service plugs into some slot on a platform and makes accessible to others. That's it. In exchange, the customer transfers copyright to your company. This is unenforceable (in the US), because a copyright transfer is governed by [17 USC 204](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/204), which required a written instrument of conveyance signed by the rights owner. This precludes Human Centipad trick\\-transfers \u2013 the rights holder has to actually know and agree.\n\nNext pass, your TOS requires the rights holder to grant a perpetual, unpaid exclusive license to use the stuff. That means you still hold copyright, but you can't do much with it. There's a [revocation window](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/203) open for 5 years, 35 years later, a bit late in the software game. Well, the courts [treat this as a copyright transfer](https://casetext.com/case/fathers-daughters-nev-llc-v-lingfu-zhang). The similarity between your (modified) idea and Fathers \\& Daughters is that the original copyright owner is not a \"beneficial owner\" because they do not receive royalties. Again, I take it your goal is to sneak in the effect of a copyright transfer without alerting the user.\n\nFinally, you include a royalties clause: we've got a contract. But now we've strayed from the notion of \"seizing\". Perpetual licenses are legal, exclusive licenses are legal. You would have to sue the copyright owner for damages if you grant a perpetual exclusive license (for money) and then they grant someone else a license to use. You as platform operator be awarded whatever you had arguable lost from their breach of contract.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the enforceability of such a clause in the United States?\n\nA) The clause would be fully enforceable as long as users agree to the TOS before using the platform.\n\nB) The clause would be unenforceable because it violates copyright transfer laws, which require a written instrument signed by the rights owner.\n\nC) The clause would be enforceable if it's worded as a perpetual, unpaid exclusive license rather than a transfer of ownership.\n\nD) The clause would be enforceable only if the company provides monetary compensation to users for their intellectual property.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, a copyright transfer in the United States is governed by 17 USC 204, which requires a written instrument of conveyance signed by the rights owner. A clause in a Terms of Service agreement would not meet this requirement, as it doesn't constitute a deliberate, knowing agreement by the rights holder. This prevents \"trick-transfers\" of copyright ownership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply agreeing to TOS is not sufficient for copyright transfer. \n\nOption C is incorrect because, while a perpetual unpaid exclusive license might seem like a workaround, courts often treat this as equivalent to a copyright transfer, which would still require the formal written agreement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even with monetary compensation, the fundamental issue of requiring a signed written agreement for copyright transfer would still apply."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81457/is-packing-the-court-legal", "docs_id": 81457, "title": "Is &quot;packing the court&quot; legal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Why is the idea of \"packing the court\" so controversial?

I grant it might, yet this could only be to make place for another nomination by himself. The person ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference, though perhaps not in the first degree. **It is also not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled.** The Senate could not be tempted, by the preference they might feel to another, to reject the one proposed; because they could not assure themselves, that the person they might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination. They could not even be certain, that a future nomination would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them; and as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected, and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the chief magistrate, it is not likely that their sanction would often be refused, where there were not special and strong reasons for the refusal.\n\nand in [No 78](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed78.asp):\n\n> It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive.

Their failure to do so due to technical limitations does not excuse them from liability going forward. The initial implied consent remains valid for the period before the express refusal, but the LHD becomes liable for privacy violations after failing to honor the patient's wishes.

But whether the charge gets dropped before trial isn't the important question \\-\\- after all, people sometimes do get charged wrongly \\-\\- rather, the question is, if it goes to trial, whether you will win.\n\nSince this question is about California, all traffic tickets in California, including red light camera tickets, are criminal cases (that's why the case will be named \"People of the State of California v. \\[your name]\" in court documents). The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the standard of evidence is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". There is no provision in California law to fine or otherwise punish the owner of a vehicle for a moving violation, except through a conviction as the driver who committed the violation.\n\nIf you plead not guilty and it goes to trial, the burden will be on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the driver was you. If the driver in the picture does not look like you, there is no way they can meet that burden, and the court must find you not guilty. (In most cases the prosecution will immediately drop the case when they discover that the picture does not look like you.) Note that you have an absolute right to not testify in your own criminal trial where you are the defendant, so there is no way they can force you to testify at the trial about who the driver was if it was not you (which would be irrelevant to the case against you anyhow).\n\nIf you do not say who the driver was, and the police department fail to guess who it was (e.g. by searching for drivers whose licenses share the same address as you for someone who looks like the one in the picture), then nobody gets fined or punished for the violation.

However, smaller facilities like local natural gas plants may not have such restrictions. The FAA has exclusive jurisdiction over airspace, not the property owners.

We'll call this Act A.\n\nA few years down the line, a bill to initiate a general election is proposed in the Commons which includes a provision that it can pass the Commons with a simple majority vote while a quorum is present, contrary to Act A. Nevertheless, the bill passes both chambers of Parliament with a simple majority, in accordance with the wording of the aforementioned provision (which does not expressly repeal Act A or make any explicit reference to it, but does state that it only applies to this bill), and it receives Royal Assent to become Act B.\n\nAct B is challenged in court on the basis that it is an unconstitutional act of Parliament, because the requirement of Act A was not met, and the provision that allowed Act B to come into law with a simple majority vote was not law at the time Act B received Royal Assent.

It's more that Parliament itself can determine its own processes through Acts, which apply to future Bills before they can become Acts.\n\nThere is precedent for this. The [Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Acts_1911_and_1949) allow the Commons to pass a Bill without the agreement of the Lords, subject to certain conditions and delays.

There is some danger in having untrained people writing up agreements (they don't know the distinction between \"what the law says\" versus \"what we had in mind\"). The agreement is binding, but their interpretation of the contract language does not automatically prevail.\n\nThe statement \"ALL TUTORS ARE PAID 8 HOURS, unless told otherwise\" is slightly problematic since it is not true (you can't pay time, you pay money *for* time spend). With no other statements about time and payment, and just looking at the words, this says that an employee will be paid for 8 hours work, period. Unless they say something different. That could mean \"even if you work 20 hours, you only get paid for 8\" (illegal under various labor laws), or it could be \"even if you only work 2 hours, you get paid for 8\" (the most reasonable interpretation). The interpretation \"You are limited to 8 hours of work per pay period / contract\" is not a reasonable interpretation: that isn't what the clause says. Such a limit could be clearly expressed (\"can work up to 8 hours\" is a clear way to state the limit), and since they didn't say anything like that, that is not how the courts will read the clause. They can, however, inform you otherwise, e.g. say \"your minimum automatic pay is now 2 hours\", or \"we will only guarantee 2 hours work\", and at that point that's what the number is. Since this is (presumably) a take\\-it or leave it contract which they wrote up and you didn't actually negotiate, any unclarities are legally interpreted in your favor.\n\nIf you have worked more than 8 hours and they are using the contract language to argue that you won't be paid for the overage, that is not at all likely to hold up in court. Under terms of the contract (interpreted as stating a minimum guarantee of hours), they *can* inform you that your new minimum is 0 hours. Also, unless there is some kind of tenure clause, they can terminate the contract at will, and maybe they'll hire you under a different contract.\n\nWhat the terms of employment were for you in the past does not matter, what matters is what the current terms are. If you did not pay attention to the fact that they changed the terms of the agreement as of this quarter, that is not their problem. If they decided to change to \"actual hours worked\" after the current contract was formed, and they informed you of that fact later, then thereafter that is what the agreement is. Until you are notified of that change, the guaranteed minimum is what it says in the contract.\n\nIn case their argument is \"The university sets this policy, the department made a mistake in not informing you\", the university has to take responsibility for the errors of their inferiors.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A university student signs an informal employment agreement for a tutoring position that states \"ALL TUTORS ARE PAID 8 HOURS, unless told otherwise.\" A few weeks later, the student is informed via email that they will now be paid for the exact number of hours worked.

A failure to hold any hearing after *ex parte* relief has been granted, or a ruling either way on a preliminary injunction following a hearing, however, is subject to appellate review, so there is much more case law on these issues.\n\nIf you ask for an *ex parte* order, the court could decide to instead hold a hearing first if the request doesn't seem sufficiently urgent to the judge.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, two or three weeks is almost never urgent enough to justify an *ex parte* order, and judges like to hold hearings if they can if the other side's lawyer can be identified and scheduled in for a hearing promptly enough to prevent the issue from becoming moot.\n\nWhen there is a government defendant, that already has a lawyer who is usually available for emergency matters on short notice, a judge will be more reluctant to grant an *ex parte* order than in a case with a private defendant with no counsel retained already in relation to the case.\n\nAnother factor is the amount of time that would be required to comply with an order if one was issued.
