The court stated that the Terms of Use was \"buried in the middle to bottom of every Zappos.com webpage among many other links, and the website never directs a user to the Terms of Use.\" This placement meant that no reasonable user would have reason to click on or be aware of the Terms of Use, making it impossible for users to have knowingly agreed to its contents, including the arbitration clause.\n\nWhile the length of the document (A) was mentioned, it was not the primary focus of the court's decision.

The ADA, specifically 28 CFR 35.150, requires public entities to operate their services and activities so that they are \"readily accessible\" to individuals with disabilities. While the ADA doesn't explicitly mandate the removal of inaccessible content, this requirement could be interpreted to include online educational materials like UC Berkeley's YouTube videos.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ADA does not contain specific language requiring the deletion of inaccessible media. Option B is false because the Department of Justice did not directly order the removal; rather, UC Berkeley made this decision in response to findings about accessibility. Option D is incorrect because the removal was related to ADA compliance concerns, not entirely voluntary or unrelated to accessibility issues.\n\nThe situation highlights the complex interplay between providing open access to educational resources and ensuring equal access for individuals with disabilities, demonstrating how institutions may interpret and respond to ADA requirements in the digital age."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51323/is-it-ok-to-use-the-same-app-name-as-other-unpopular-apps", "docs_id": 51323, "title": "Is it ok to use the same app name as other, unpopular apps?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm currently developing a webapp for language learning in the hopes of turning it into a profitable business. I've been mulling over a certain name for a while though I've looked through the google play store and chrome add\\-on store and both have apps named virtually the same thing. They're all still in the same domain as mine (language learning with emphasis on vocab retention), but none of them have been updated in the last few years and they all have very few users/downloads. None of them seem to be trademarked.\n\nIf I ended up using this name and it takes off, should I be concerned about any of this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's probably not a good idea. You won't get trademark protection if your name is already being used by several others in the same market. You wouldn't really get protection anyway if your name was something obvious like \"Language Learning App\" that just describes what the app does.\n\nBut you might be able to get away with it. The things I mentioned cut both ways; it will be difficult for the existing apps to claim trademark if they allowed each other's existence this whole time. Also, using \"passing off\" instead of trademark requires that the plaintiff prove a loss of goodwill. With few users/downloads, this will be quite hard for them to establish.

While using a name already in use by other apps in the same market is not ideal, the situation described presents a nuanced scenario. The existing apps have few users, haven't been updated in years, and don't appear to be trademarked. This suggests that while obtaining trademark protection might be difficult, it's not necessarily impossible.\n\nThe advice to make the app easily distinguishable (e.g., with a distinctive icon) is a prudent step to reduce the risk of confusion and potential legal issues. Additionally, the low activity and user base of existing apps may make it difficult for them to prove loss of goodwill in a \"passing off\" claim.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the potential risks involved. Option B is too extreme, as it doesn't account for the possibility of using the name with proper precautions. Option D is incorrect because seeking permission isn't necessarily required in this scenario, especially if the name isn't trademarked and the apps are inactive."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86249/inferring-grammatical-order-of-operations-in-us-immigration-forms", "docs_id": 86249, "title": "Inferring grammatical order of operations in US immigration forms", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In mathematics and programming, there exist \"order of operations\" standards for interpreting expressions.

In fact, tax law non\\-enforcement is one of the most well quantified circumstances in which there are good estimates of how often tax laws aren't enforced. For example, as of 2001, the federal income tax tax gap (i.e. the difference between taxes paid and taxes owed) was summarized as follows:\n\n> About 44% of \\[the tax gap] ($148 billion a year) comes from income and\n> self\\-employment taxes owed by closely held businesses. About 16% comes\n> from understated non\\-business income (disproportionately from\n> investment income not subject to information return requirements such\n> as capital gains and rental income), and about 9% comes from\n> overstated deductions, exemptions and credits. About 33% comes from\n> other sources (mostly underreporting of corporate income taxes and\n> employment taxes).\n> \n> \n> Non\\-compliance rates vary greatly by type of income. About 1\\.2% of\n> potential wage and salary tax revenue are not collected. About 4\\.5% of\n> potential dividend, interest, pension and taxable Social Security\n> income tax revenue are not collected. About 8\\.6% of potential tax\n> revenue alimony, partnerships, S\\-corporations, capital gains, and\n> overstated deductions and exemptions are not collected. And, about\n> 53\\.9% of potential tax revenues from farms, rents and royalties, and sole proprietorships are not collected. The biggest factor in tax law\n> compliance is the degree to which income appears on information\n> returns. Taxpayers whose income isn't reported by third parties are\n> much more likely to cheat.\n> \n> \n> More than a third of returns with capital gains incorrectly report\n> that amount of the gain. Independent contractors omit on average 17%\n> of income not subject to information returns, but just 3% of income\n> subject to information returns.\n> \n> \n> The I.R.S. is not funded at at level that maximizes compliance.

[According to the U.S. Treasury Department](https://home.treasury.gov/news/featured-stories/the-case-for-a-robust-attack-on-the-tax-gap) (which includes the IRS), in 2019, the tax gap was as follows:\n\n> Today, the \u201ctax gap\u201d\u2014the difference between taxes that are owed and\n> collected\u2014totals around $600 billion annually and will mean\n> approximately $7 trillion of lost tax revenue over the next decade.\n> The sheer magnitude of lost revenue is striking: it is equal to 3\n> percent of GDP\\[.]\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1l41w.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1l41w.png)\n\nWhile there are countries with low tax compliance (e.g. Greece and Italy) those countries have serious public finance problems as a result, and internationally, U.S. tax law enforcement is weak. See, e.g. [here](https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/21460/1/The%20EU%20tax%20gap%20-%20a%20study.pdf) (quantifying tax gaps in E.U. countries and in the chart below from this source):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SeOj.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/9SeOj.png)\n\n(The U.S. estimate of 3% of GDP is not a fair comparison to these figures which include all taxes in a country, not just federal income taxes as in the U.S. figure).\n\nU.S. expats are, in part, unhappy, because U.S. citizens are taxed as a matter of substantive U.S. tax law on foreign income that many other countries do not tax their citizens upon. But, expat tax enforcement in the U.S. is hardly comprehensive and is generally speaking, less vigorous and less consistent than tax enforcement in domestic cases.\n\n**Cannabis Law Enforcement In The U.S.**\n\nThe shorter story of cannabis law enforcement is that historically, most enforcement of marijuana laws has been by state and local governments, since federal, state and local governments had parallel and similar laws on the subject.\n\nSome localities and states deprioritized enforcement or legalized it under state or local law.\n\nThe federal government did not want to spend the money to replace the state and local enforcement that ceased to be present.\n\nSeveral U.S. attorneys (the federal DA for a U.S. District Court District) decided to allow the state legalization experiment to proceed and to not be arbitrary in making cannabis prosecutions. When they did this they issued statements stating that they would not enforce federal cannabis laws in places where it was legalized where the violators were in compliance with state and local law and where the additional conditions imposed by federal prosecutors were met.\nThis also reflected the fact that with state legalization, the risk of jury nullification in federal prosecutions for marijuana offenses that were legal under state law became much greater reducing the value of attempting such prosecutions.\n\nThis was later rescinded (at least at the national level) but was replaced by Congressional language in appropriations bills deprioritizing such criminal enforcement and not authorizing federal funds to be spent for this purpose.\n\nCBD and hemp (which are cannabis products that are not psychoactive) have effectively been legalized nationally, although THC has not and is only tolerated at the federal level where states have legalized it.\n\n**Is Prosecutorial Discretion Subject To Judicial Review?**\n\n> Can someone sue the DEA for refusing to enforce Cannabis laws?\n\nNo.\n\nAnother answer correctly cites the U.S. Supreme Court case of *Town of Castle Rock vs. Gonzales* as the basis for this realty.\n\nIn some cases, however, individuals can bring a private cause of action against a cannabis law violator under RICO (the Racketeering And Corrupt Organizations Act) if they can show particularized damages to them from this activity.\n\n> Similarly, can someone sue the IRS for heavy handed enforcement of tax\n> laws?\n\nNo.\n\nThe IRS has to prove that taxes are owed, in every cases where the taxpayer contests the liability, in either tax court (prior to payment of the tax) or in U.S. District Court (after payment of the tax in a refund lawsuit). But, there is no private cause of action related to the level of enforcement of meritorious cases that the IRS can bring. That is a political decision for the Secretary of the Treasury, the President, and Congress in funding the IRS.\n\nClaims that equal protection of the laws are violated under the 14th Amendment with discriminatory enforcement choices of prosecutors and law enforcement are almost completely (although not quite entirely) barred.

The Supreme Court case Town of Castle Rock vs. Gonzales established that citizens generally cannot sue law enforcement for failing to enforce laws. Additionally, there is no private cause of action to challenge the IRS's level of tax law enforcement. While options A, B, and C suggest various ways citizens might challenge enforcement decisions, these are not supported by current legal precedent.

That is the same what [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation) says.\n\nIt also says, that to annex territory, occupation is presupposed. Let's take two more clear examples:\n\n* The incorporation of the Sudetenland by Nazi Germany via the [Munich Agreemen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement) was a multilateral contract of other countries but the Czech Republic to accept the demands. This allowed the Nazi Regime to occupy these areas without war or further international backlash and annex them.\n* One can't say that the Federal Republic of Germany did annex the German Democratic Republic, as there was no occupation and it was written into international law by a multilateral contract as an act of union.\n\nThe Kashmir Question\n--------------------\n\nNow, Kashmir is a powderkeg question. And the TL;DR here: No, India did not annex Kashmir and Jammu, Kashmir and Jammu did accede the Dominion of India.\n\nLet's look at it historically, starting with 1846\\. Then, the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu was created when the very ethnically diverse territories that the British east Indian Company annexed from the Sikh Empire as a result of the first Anglo\\-Sikh War were sold to Gulab Singh of Jammu with the [Treaty of Amritsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Amritsar_(1846)).\n\nIn 1857 the Kashmeer sided with the British in the revolt. The British won and established the British Raj and assumed direct control over all the Indian subcontinent \\- but technically the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu still existed as a part of the Raj. Time went by. \n\n1947 comes around, the British have given the Raj some years to negotiate the landscape of the countries to release from their rule as a reward for their part in the second world war. The [Indian Independence Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Independence_Act_1947) comes into reality, creating the Dominion of Pakistan and Dominion of India, with each Princely State having been given time to choose which to join beforehand. Only Hyderabad, Junagadh (and subsidiaries), the Khanate of Kalat and the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir have not chosen by 15th of August 1947\\. Hyderabad joins India 2 months late, Junagadh Pakistan. Kalat signed a standstill with Pakistan but was independent otherwise until March of 1948 as the Khan discussed some terms with the Dominion of Pakistan. However, the Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir and Jammu had planned to join **neither and stay independent**. But time wouldn't allow that to endure...\n\nThe Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu tried to get both Dominions to sign a standstill agreement that would keep the Status Quo on all administrative things until a proper agreement was signed. The Dominion of Pakistan accepted while the Dominion of India did demand that they'd only sign if they had a delegate to discuss terms with. The Dominion of Pakistan then blockaded the Princely State, technically violating their standstill agreement. Hari Singh did reach out for the Dominion of India's help as a result and got essential goods from them as aid. By now it is September 1947\\. Kashmir is still independent.\n\nIn the Poonch District, an uprising happens under Muhammad Ibrahim Khan. Weapons flow from the Dominion of Pakistan to the rebels, and on 22nd October, Pakistani soldiers join the fray and invade the independent Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu. Having no military fit to hold up against the Pakistani armed forces, Hari Singh once more reaches out to the Dominion of India, this time for military aid. The answer has three terms:\n\n* **[Sign the Instrument of Accession for the Dominion of India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_of_Accession_(Jammu_and_Kashmir)).**\n* Convert the Princely State to democracy using a specific model.\n* Appoint a certain official into his government.\n\nOn 26th October, Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession for the Dominion of India. On 27th the Dominion of India accepted it, making the Princely State of Kashmir and Jammu a part of the Dominion of India. It **acceded to the Dominion of India** by a Bilateral contract and brought the Dominions of India and Pakistan into [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947%E2%80%931948). In the Ceasefire of 1948/49, some areas of Kashmir and Jammu were **occupied by the Dominion of Pakistan**. In 1971 the ceasefire line was declared a line of control, but to this day, no land was formally ceased, so technically it is still occupied to this day and the annexation is only *de facto* and not *de jure*.\n\nAs I am a historian, I draw my line here.\n\nWhat's Accession?!\n------------------\n\nAccession is defined by the UN as:\n\n> \"Accession\" is the act whereby a state accepts the offer or the opportunity to become a party to a treaty already negotiated and signed by other states. It has the same legal effect as ratification. Accession usually occurs after the treaty has entered into force.

Option C is incorrect because while the Maharaja initially wanted to remain independent, events forced him to choose a side. Option D is correct because on October 26, 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession, legally joining the Dominion of India in response to a Pakistani-backed invasion.

The weaker form of such laws says that at least one party to the conversation must consent to the recording. The stronger law, operative in Washington, California and about a dozen other states, is that all parties to the conversation must consent. The intent behind these laws is to require consent or knowledge of one or all of the people being recorded. What is not entirely clear (in all\\-party states) is what constitutes a communication, and what a party is, given the *wording* of the statutes.\n\n[Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73.030) is an example of an all\\-party consent law, which states a prohibition against recording without \"first obtaining the consent of all the participants in the communication\". The law does not *state* this in terms of \"the consent of those persons who are recorded\". It is unclear whether a person who could in principle hear and be heard (e.g. in a room full of people, with the phone on speaker) are \"participants\" since the term is not defined. [California law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&part=1.&title=15.&chapter=1.5) refers to \"the consent of all parties to a confidential communication\", again with no specific mention of people who do not speak, and also no exception made for \"parties\" who are not actually recorded.\n\nThe court in CA has determined that a confidential communication is one in which the parties have a reasonable expectation that no one is listening in. Suppose that A and B are having a quiet conversation in public, and they do not expect that anyone else can hear them, but there are other people nearby. This is a confidential conversation, recording of which requires permission of all parties. A and B can agree to record the conversation. A common sense understanding of \"party\" would find that if C *can* actually hear the conversation, he is still not a party to the conversation, therefore he does not have veto power over A \\& B recording their conversation. To the best of my knowledge, the courts have not ruled on what exactly constitutes a \"party\" or \"participant\". Nor have they ruled on what constitutes a \"communication\".

Some of these are fair and others are unfair, depending.

This power is\n> known as the referendum, and legal voters may, under such conditions\n> and in such manner as may be provided by acts of the legislature,\n> demand a referendum vote on any act or measure passed by the\n> legislature and cause the same to be submitted to a vote of the people\n> for their approval or rejection.\n> \n> \n> The people reserve to themselves the power to propose laws, and enact\n> the same at the polls independent of the legislature.

The legislature has become hostile to citizen initiatives and referendums after some laws were overturned and some laws were passed by citizens on popular subjects the legislature refused to pass or even consider for years.\n\nIn 2018, the legislature changed the law to make it much more difficult to get Inits. on the ballot. Previous law (and current as of 2023\\) requires that valid signatures must equal 6% of the total votes cast in Idaho in the last presidential election, and at least 6% of signatures must come **from each of 18 of Idaho's 35 districts** (51%). The new law required 6% of signatures **from all 35 districts** (100%).\n\nBecause of Idaho's vast geography and many rural districts, this makes the process nearly impossible. It effectively empowers **just one district out of thirty\\-five (3%) to effectively veto** the Init. from getting on the ballot for all of the state voters to decide for themselves whether to make it law or not.\n\nTo illustrate the challenge of getting rural signatures in Idaho, legislators are paid extra money for constituent services like fuel to drive around to speak with voters and are paid according to the square miles of each county. Urban county legislators are given $400, while some rural county legislators are paid $3,200 to reach out to their constituents. Those vast distances are what make some areas too difficult to gather 6% of the required signatures.\n\nHowever, the state supreme court unanimously declared the law unconstitutional because it \"was so restrictive that it violated a fundamental right under the state\u2019s constitution.\"\n\nJudicial quotes included:\n\n> \"the legislature\u2019s duty to give effect to the people\u2019s rights is not a\n> free pass to override constitutional constraints and legislate a right\n> into non\\-existence, even if the legislature believes doing so is in\n> the people\u2019s best interest.\"\n> \n> \n> \"dramatic check on the ballot qualification process without showing a\n> compelling need for such a check,\"\n> \n> \n> \"all qualifying initiatives or referenda are already subjected to a\n> statewide vote.\"\n> \n> \n> \"The legislature\u2019s actions amounted to ... a law that made the\n> initiative and referendum process more difficult for proponents of\n> future ballot propositions, while simultaneously making it more\n> difficult for those opposed to the new law to pass a referendum to\n> repeal that very law.\"\n\nAn example given was that the largest urban district, Boise, could stop an agricultural initiative that is popular in the other 34 districts. When Medicaid expansion was passed in 2018 by the citizen initiative process (61%), one single rural district could have vetoed the question from even getting onto the ballot where all voters (urban and rural) got to decide on it.\n\nThis year, 2023, the legislature is close to passing a constitutional amendment that does the same thing as the law that was ruled unconstitutional. Because the people have no power to change the constitution, it's likely to be a permanent death for citizen Inits.\n\n**1\\.

In most jurisdictions, it is generally accepted that tenants must pay rent for the time they occupy a property. Even without an explicit agreement on payment, the extension of stay implies a continuation of the existing rental terms on a prorated basis. The tenants should have reasonably expected to pay for the additional days, as there is typically no legal requirement for landlords to provide free occupancy.

As long as you did not decline to rent to a tenant because of information you learned in a credit report or commercially available criminal background check, you are not required to notify them. However, it is a good business practice to notify them in writing as Nij's post suggests. However, it would be a good idea to keep a copy of the letter for you records and possibly write down some notes.

The FCRA regulates \"[consumer reports](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681a),\" which includes credit reports and criminal background checks that are assembled by companies. (The FCRA does not apply if you, yourself, are going to the state police or courthouse to get background check records). \n\nUnder the FCRA, requires that people who make decisions against someone based on information in a credit or background check, notify that person. The FCRA calls this decision against someone an \"[adverse action](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681a)\" and requires that you provide the affected party the following information: \n\n* The name, address and telephone number of the company that supplied the consumer report, including a toll\\-free telephone number for companies that maintain files nationwide;\n* A statement that the company that supplied the report did not make the decision to take the adverse action and cannot give the specific reasons for it; and\n* A notice of the individual's right to dispute the accuracy or completeness of any information the company furnished, and the consumer's right to a free report from the company upon request within 60 days.\n\nThe FCRA calls this notice an \"Adverse Action Notice.\" [*See* 15 U.S.C. 1681m.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1681m) An adverse action notice can be oral, written, or electronic.

My husband and I would like to stay on the family land and my grandma is overjoyed.

This creates a loophole where suppliers can claim to offer 100% renewable energy tariffs without necessarily increasing the amount of renewable energy in the grid or having direct contracts with renewable generators. It's considered an \"accounting trick\" that allows companies to make green claims cheaply (REGOs cost about \u00a31 per customer per year) without necessarily contributing to additional renewable energy production.

Obviously unlike in the U.S. there is no constitution establishing the framework of law making and keeping, the powers of the parliament and crown, etc.\n\nSo then also how is the whole system of government and separations of powers etc in England and the U.K. defined?\n\nDoes the answer to this differ between different parts of the U.K.?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Organically rather than by design, laws and courts preceded the theoretical constitutional basis. Kings developed a practice of legislating in council, rather than solo, meaning that their edicts went out not as \"the King decrees XYZ\" but \"the King, with the assent of the archbishops, bishops, abbots, barons, etc., decrees XYZ\". This eventually became the Parliamentary system, wherein only Parliament could make laws (especially about raising taxes) and the King alone could not.\n\nBecause of the gradual evolution, it's not easy to point to the first such statute or even the first proper \"Parliament\". The form was not settled. Nowadays we expect Acts to start with a set \"enacting formula\", to be published in a set way, and to be called \"Acts\" at all. Earlier laws lacked these elements. It was common for Parliaments to transact a variety of business, such as appointing officials or distributing money, without strictly distinguishing a category of what we would now call a \"public general Act\", something setting out broadly applicable rules under the tenor of law. To take an early example, the Domesday Book was undoubtedly commissioned by William I in council in 1085, but we could argue for a long time whether that really counted as a law made by the King alone or through a proto\\-parliamentary approach. The Assize of Clarendon in 1166 is closer \\- we have the text and it refers to the counsel of all the barons \\- but still not obviously \"an Act\". Magna Carta came in 1215 and was repeatedly confirmed by successive monarchs in slight variations; only the 1297 version is currently deemed to be an Act still partially in force.\n\nAt the same time as this legislative activity, a bewildering array of courts applied essentially customary law for local cases. If you commit a murder in Durham in 1300 and would like to not be executed, then you would be appealing (I think?) to the mercy of the Prince\\-Bishop in his own court. A few dozen miles away and the process and authority was different.\n\nThings gradually became more uniform and systematized, and by the sixteenth century there was enough critical mass of legal philosophy to try to \"explain\" the legal system more formally and in recognizably modern terms. We may as well take Edward Coke's *Institutes of the Laws of England* (1628\\-1644\\) as a turning point: four volumes setting out a comprehensive view of what English law was all about. In contrast, take Bracton's similar work of 1235, which was the first real analysis of case law in England. Bracton was writing in a context without a general idea of precedent, and where the binding extent of Roman civil law was not clear. By Coke's time that was well established. But they are both trying to make sense of the law as they found it: giving explanations for the data, if you like. (A parallel course was taking place in Scotland with its institutional writers, although they ended up with a different system from England's. They were equally trying to explain what they saw.)\n\nSome of the early modern authors contributed to figuring out which decisions of past Parliaments or councils should be taken to be Acts, as such. Coke, in particular, also set out the criterion that an Act should purport to have been made by all three of the King, Lords and Commons. Our modern consolidated versions of the statute book derive from this time, and on legislation.gov.uk you can see the oldest Act still in force, [The Statute of Marlborough 1267](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Hen3cc1415/52/1/paragraph/p1). That's different from the oldest Acts ever made, as discussed above, a more slippery concept.\n\nIdeas such as the separation of powers are reverse\\-engineered in this way. Indeed, it's not obvious that Britain has that separation. It may not be the right way to understand the governmental and legal order that has developed. John Locke might have thought it would be a good idea, but Walter Bagehot denied it was a useful frame for analyzing the interrelationships of various public bodies.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the development of the English legal system and its constitutional framework?\n\nA) The English legal system was established by a single foundational document, similar to the U.S. Constitution, which clearly defined the separation of powers and the role of Parliament.\n\nB) The English legal system evolved organically over time, with laws and courts preceding a formal theoretical constitutional basis, and concepts like separation of powers being reverse-engineered later.\n\nC) The English legal system was primarily based on Roman civil law, with a clear understanding of precedent and binding statutes from its inception.\n\nD) The English legal system was established solely by royal decree, with Parliament playing no role in its early development or in the creation of laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The passage describes how the English legal system developed gradually and organically, rather than being established by a single foundational document. Laws and courts existed before a formal constitutional framework, and practices like the king legislating in council slowly evolved into the parliamentary system. The concept of separation of powers was not initially present but was later reverse-engineered to explain the system that had developed. The passage also mentions that early legal philosophers like Edward Coke attempted to explain and systematize the existing legal practices, rather than creating them from scratch.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there was no single foundational document like the U.S. Constitution. Answer C is wrong because the passage indicates that the binding extent of Roman civil law was unclear in early English law, and the concept of precedent developed over time.

Language and the law continue to evolve, moving towards even more inclusive language in legal writing. ... The highest levels of our profession have recognized that gender inclusivity is a matter of justice and professionalism.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Jane can file a new restraining order based on the old incidents because the statute of limitations for restraining orders is typically 5 years.\n\nB) Jane cannot file a new restraining order because the principle of double jeopardy prevents her from bringing the same case twice.\n\nC) Jane can file a new restraining order, but she must provide new evidence of recent threatening behavior from John.\n\nD) Jane is unlikely to succeed in obtaining a new restraining order based solely on the 4-year-old incidents, as restraining orders are meant to prevent imminent harm.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because restraining orders are preventative, not punitive measures. They are designed to protect against imminent harm, not to punish past behavior. After 4 years of no contact, Jane would likely struggle to convince a judge that she is in immediate danger from John. The court primarily considers the current situation when granting restraining orders, with past incidents only serving as context for interpreting present circumstances. Options A and B are incorrect because statute of limitations and double jeopardy don't typically apply to restraining orders in this context.

Any case in which liability would be found under \\[42\\.1], it would also be found under \\[42\\.2] The reverse is not the case \\-\\- there are situations in which liability would be found under \\[42\\.2] but not under \\[42\\.1] \\-\\- specifically cases where a properly acting defendant might or might not have been able to avert the harm.\n\n### Question 2\\.\n\n**No**, not at all. There could be a case where it is clear that the accused failed to act to try to avert the harm, and therefore did not \"act as he ought to have\" but it is also clear that any such attempt would have failed, that it was not within the power of the accused to prevent the harm. In that case, the rule stated by Herring says there will be no liability, even though the accused failed in duty.\n\nFor example, suppose someone fell in front of an oncoming train, and that the law is that a bystander has a duty to try to rescue the victim. Suppose that the bystander stays still and makes no attempt to help. Then the bystander did not \"act as he ought\". But suppose further that evidence clearly establishes that given the distance of the bystander from the track, and the distance between the train and the victim, the most diligent bystander possible would not have had time to effect a rescue. Then there is a failure of duty, but no liability under this rule.\n\n(If you argue that a bystander has no duty at all, suppose instead a railway employee or a police officer who does have a duty to assist a victim in such a case.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A train conductor sees a person fall onto the tracks 100 meters ahead of the moving train. The conductor has a legal duty to attempt to stop the train in such situations. However, given the train's speed and weight, it's physically impossible to stop the train in less than 200 meters. The conductor makes no attempt to apply the brakes, and the person is struck and killed. Under the principles discussed regarding causation in omission cases, what is the most accurate legal assessment of the conductor's criminal liability for the death?\n\nA) The conductor is criminally liable because they failed to act as they ought to have by not attempting to stop the train.\n\nB) The conductor is not criminally liable because even if they had acted as they should have, the harm would still have occurred.\n\nC) The conductor is criminally liable because there is evidence that the victim might not have suffered harm if the conductor had acted properly.\n\nD) The conductor's liability depends on whether the court applies the \"would have\" or \"might have\" standard of causation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. This scenario illustrates the principle that even when a person fails to act as they ought to (in this case, the conductor failing to attempt to stop the train), they are not criminally liable if it can be shown that acting properly would not have prevented the harm. Here, it's established that even if the conductor had immediately attempted to stop the train, it would have been impossible to do so in time to save the victim. This aligns with the \"would have\" standard [42.1] discussed in the passage, where liability requires showing that proper action would have prevented the harm. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it only considers the failure to act, not the causation element. \n\nOption C is incorrect because it applies the broader \"might have\" standard [42.2], which is not the stricter interpretation given in the example.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while there is debate about these standards, in this specific scenario, the conductor would not be liable under either standard, as there's no possibility (not even a \"might have\") that proper action could have prevented the harm."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44572/read-written-testimony-instead-of-witnessing", "docs_id": 44572, "title": "Read written testimony instead of witnessing", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am defending myself in a penal case (driving infringement; not a criminal case). \n\nAt time of the events, I gave to the police a very detailed written testimony, which is now part of the proof.\n\nFor the trial, I know that I am allowed to provide an oral testimony or to remain silent. \n\nSince I have nothing to add to my story, am I allowed to remain silent and to read the written testimony instead?\n\nAssuming they both have the same content, could a judge put more trust in the oral testimony than in the written one? \n\nCould remaining silent compromise my defense?

Testimony is given under oath or affirmed as true under penalty of perjury, a statement is just a statement.\n\nThe statement is not part of the \"proof\". Proof is an evidentiary burden that must be met by the evidence to obtain a result. If this is really a criminal matter, the police must prove that you committed the offence \"beyond reasonable doubt\". However, driving offences are almost always civil penalties, not criminal ones, so the burden of proof is the much lower \"on the balance of probabilities\".\n\nThe police are under no obligation to enter your statement into evidence. They might, but if they don't and you want the judge to know about it, you have to enter it into evidence through your testimony. The police are there to prove you guilty, they have very little incentive to help you prove your innocence.\n\nA trial works by the prosecution presenting their case, calling witnesses who testify, can be cross\\-examined by the defense and then re\\-examined by the prosecution. Then the defense has their turn in much the same way. The defense doesn't have to mount an active defense because the burden of proof lies with the prosecution, however, if the only evidence is that given by the prosecution, that burden may not be too difficult to reach. That said, for traffic matters in local courts, this will not necessarily be done with the same formality as the Supreme Court but whatever latitude is allowed is up to the judge.\n\nWhen a witness testifies they are not normally allowed to refer to written materials \\- they are supposed to do it from memory.

Which scenario potentially violates the Sexual Offences Act 2003?\n\nA) Alex (17) and Sam (16) have been in a sexual relationship for 6 months. On Alex's 18th birthday, they continue their relationship.\n\nB) Jordan (19) and Casey (17) begin a sexual relationship after meeting at university.\n\nC) Taylor (18) and Riley (15) engage in sexual activity. Taylor genuinely believes Riley is 16 based on Riley's appearance and statements.\n\nD) Morgan (22) and Jamie (16) start dating and become sexually involved after Jamie's 16th birthday.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is legal because both individuals were over 16 when the relationship began, and it remains legal when one partner turns 18.\nB) is legal as both individuals are over the age of consent (16).\nD) is legal as Jamie is at the age of consent (16).\n\nC) violates Section 9 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. Even though Taylor believes Riley is 16, the law states that it's an offense if the person under 18 \"intentionally touches another person\" who is under 16, and \"does not reasonably believe that B is 16 or over.\" The burden is on Taylor to ensure their partner is of legal age. Genuine belief may mitigate punishment but does not make the act legal."}}
