The idea is that from now on it will not be possible to copyright a basic melodic theme because it will already have been written in a tangible form.\n\nWill this really forestall copyright infringement suits?\n\n**Edit: to clarify**. Suppose I write a melody, and someone else claims that they wrote the same melody and hence have copyright on it. Can I point to the existence of the melody in this generated corpus as a defence?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Seems unlikely that it will \"forestall copyright infringement suits\".\n\n1. Some jurisdictions, e.g the USA, say that \"Works produced by mechanical processes or random selection without any contribution by a human author are not registrable\". On the face of it, in such a jurisdiction copyright can't exist in a randomly generated work. Which the TED talk doesn't mention. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=sJtm0MoOgiU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJtm0MoOgiU)\n2. Let's imagine a case in a jurisdiction where copyright can exist in such a work. There is a dispute between two artists or labels. The plaintiff produced a well known tune and accuses the defendant of copying this work. The defendant says the plaintiff didn't have copyright in that work because it wasn't original in the first place, there is a 1200GB TAR file (compressed file) on GitHub that contains all possible single octave, 8\\-note, 12\\-beat melody combos, which were produced before the plaintiff's work. The plaintiff says, \"like the majority of the population I never heard of GitHub, let alone downloaded, uncompressed a 1200GB file and listened to every melody.\"\n3. That's all aside from plaintiffs or lawyers deciding they have a case or believing the mere threat of civil proceedings will cause the alleged infringer to acquiesce to their demands.\n\nI think they are making a point *about* the law rather than a realistic means of thwarting copyright disputes. It's reasonable of the creators to say there is a finite set of melodies and the likelihood of inadvertently 'creating' the same melody as someone else may be smaller than we think, maybe copyright law has led to some unjust outcomes and led to a chilling effect on music\\-making.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A group of programmers has generated every possible 8-note, 12-beat melody combination and released it under a Creative Commons license.

The project does raise important points about the finite nature of musical combinations and the potential for inadvertent similarity in compositions. However, it's unlikely to completely prevent copyright infringement suits for several reasons:\n\n1. In some jurisdictions, like the USA, works produced by mechanical processes without human input are not eligible for copyright registration.\n2. Even if the database were recognized as copyrighted, it would be difficult for defendants to prove that plaintiffs had access to or knowledge of this specific database.\n3. The existence of the database doesn't automatically invalidate existing copyrights or prevent new ones from being registered.\n4. Legal disputes may still arise based on the interpretation of similarity, originality, and access to works.\n\nThe project serves more as a commentary on the limitations of current copyright law in music rather than a foolproof legal defense against infringement claims."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56533/how-can-i-find-glass-cutting-patents", "docs_id": 56533, "title": "How can I find glass cutting patents?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How can I find glass cutting patents?

The patent information provided refers to a design patent for a cut glass pattern, which uses a different numbering system than utility patents. Design patents typically have a \"D\" prefix before the number. In this case, searching for \"D63795\" would likely yield the correct patent information.

In litigating a breach, idiosyncratic private beliefs of the parties would not matter, what matters is what was objectively agreed on. So words are interpreted as having their ordinary meaning, unless there is a special stipulation as to the meaning of a term in the contract. There may be some dispute over what the \"ordinary meaning\" is, which may be resolved by introducing testimony from language experts or by looking at surrounding circumstances.\n\nThe \"ordinary meaning\" of a word or phrase is often so broad with respect to the intended agreement that a *narrowing* of the definition is necessary (or sometime the definition is expanded). Words are not wholly redefined (redefining \"house\" to mean \"cat\"). Many things can be deemed to be \"private use\", and it may be desirable to specifically say that it means \"exclusive use by the party of the first part\". Unless you overtly signal a change in scope of the term, you inherit all of the problems of ambiguity attached to the plain meaning of the term (in some contracts, that specifically works in favor of the other party).\n\nIf you are *not* talking about a contract, then you are socially free to to use \"glory\" to mean \"a nice knock\\-down argument\", at your social peril. If you are talking about what you are to do in light of some government requirement e.g. to pay taxes, it does not matter if you attach a note saying that you define \"income\" to mean \"money that falls from the sky\", income is whatever the government defines it as, even if you are ignorant of or don't agree with that definition. Governmental word definitions pertain to particular Acts. If the term \"wealth\" is defined in a specific way in some act, that does not mean that the term always is assigned that meaning everywhere. However, if the government has defined a term in some context, there is a reasonable chance that *in that context* a contract will be interpreted following that definition. This is because all parties are assumed to know the law and therefore know that \"licensed premise\" has a particular meaning with respect to liquor sales. A contract could explicitly override that definition, but without such a clause, the statutory definition is evidence of what the objective meaning of the term is taken to be.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A contract between a landlord and a tenant uses the phrase \"licensed premises\" without explicitly defining it. The landlord claims it refers only to areas where alcohol is served, while the tenant argues it means the entire property as per the Licensing Act 2003. How would a court likely interpret this term?\n\nA) The court would accept the landlord's definition, as parties are free to use terms however they like in contracts.\nB) The court would reject both interpretations and create its own definition based on common usage.\nC) The court would likely adopt the statutory definition from the Licensing Act 2003, unless there's clear evidence of a different intended meaning.\nD) The court would automatically side with the tenant's interpretation, as statutory definitions always override contractual usage.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In contract disputes, courts generally interpret terms according to their ordinary meaning, which often includes statutory definitions relevant to the context. The Licensing Act 2003's definition of \"licensed premises\" would be considered strong evidence of the term's objective meaning in a contract related to property rental, especially in the absence of any explicit redefinition in the contract itself. While parties can define terms differently in contracts, they must do so clearly. Without such clarity, the court would likely lean towards the established legal definition, especially in a context where that definition is directly relevant. However, the court would also consider any evidence that might suggest the parties intended a different meaning, making this the most nuanced and accurate answer among the options provided."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67073/is-a-party-liable-for-damages-stemming-from-contract-concealment", "docs_id": 67073, "title": "Is a party liable for damages stemming from contract concealment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose a consumer signs contract of adhesion with corporation.

We have no extradition treaties with the above mentioned countries, and generally speaking the US does not extradite except under terms of a treaty (see [discussion here](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-15000-international-extradition-and-related-matters#9-15.100)), following [18 USC 3184](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3184). There are provisions allowing extradition of those who are not citizens, nationals or permanent residents of the US, and are accused of crimes of violence against nationals of the United States in foreign countries.\n\nIn contrast, there is [no federal law pertaining to enforcement of foreign judgments](http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1529&context=facpubs) against people in the US, so you have to look at the particular laws of the state, or federal government in case the federal government could have jurisdiction. One vehicle for enforcing foreign judgments is a version of the [Uniform Foreign Money\\-Judgments Recognition Act](http://www.uniformlaws.org/ActSummary.aspx?title=Foreign-Country%20Money%20Judgments%20Recognition%20Act), which is enacted in [various states](http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Foreign-Country%20Money%20Judgments%20Recognition%20Act) such as [RCW 6\\.40A](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=6.40A&full=true) in Washington. Enforcement of judgments can be blocked or optional according to circumstance, for example it is blocked if \"The judgment was rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law\", and may be blocked if \"The judgment was obtained by fraud that deprived the losing party of an adequate opportunity to present its case\" or \"The judgment or the cause of action on which the judgment is based is repugnant to the public policy of this state or of the United States\".

While the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia, this doesn't mean the Russian corporation has no legal recourse. The corporation could potentially pursue a judgment in Russian courts and then attempt to enforce that judgment in certain US states. Many states have adopted versions of the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act, which provides a framework for recognizing and enforcing foreign judgments. However, this enforcement is subject to specific conditions, such as the foreign judicial system meeting standards of due process and the judgment not being repugnant to US public policy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia and generally does not extradite except under treaty terms. Option B is too absolute; while extradition is off the table, other legal avenues may be available.

The court in Y is likely to assert jurisdiction since A is providing services to Y's citizens. However, A can petition for the case to be moved to X.

Both definitions require fermentation or brewing, which didn't occur in this case. Instead, the miracle wine would be classified as \"spirituous liquor\" or \"liquor\" under NCGS \u00a7 18B-101 (14).

I also believe (perhaps incorrectly), that inciting somebody else to commit a crime (e.g. the organisers of one of these groups encouraging their members to behave like this) is also illegal.

But a court's injunction sets out in black and white the restrictions on behaviour *after* considering the human rights aspects of the case, and breach of the order is a contempt of court (not a criminal offence as such, but punishable by imprisonment and/or a fine).\n\nSuch injunctions are an *additional* tool for trying to mitigate or deter the behavior to which you refer and in a sense they are more convenient than criminal prosecutions.\n\nSome considerations and more detail in no particular order:\n\n**Standard of proof differences**\n\nYou mention relevant criminal offences. These necessarily have the criminal 'standard of proof'. The trier of fact (the jury at jury trial; the magistrate or judge at non\\-jury trial), having considered all the relevant evidence, must be sure the defendant is guilty.\n\nHowever, the entity seeking an injunction (the claimant) does not need to meet that standard of proof to obtain an injunction that includes restrictions on behaviour. They need only persuade the court there is a real and imminent risk of a civil wrong for which they merit relief, or that there is a serious issue to be tried at a later date for which they merit relief until the conclusion of that trial.\n\n**Criminal prosecution delays**\n\nFor the past two years to the time of writing this answer, circumstances have been such that if there were a criminal trial (which is by no means guaranteed), it may be scheduled months, perhaps even a year or two, in the future. But the claimant (and the wider public) may want relief 'now' and the defendant(s) might be free to continue their behaviour in the meanwhile, the defendant might not be held in custody pending trial.\n\nDue to delays, [some defendants have been in custody for several months pending trial](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-climate-activists-held-in-jail-for-up-to-six-months-before-trial) and this isn't satisfactory either, particularly if they are innocent: \"everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time\" ([article 6 Human Rights Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/I/chapter/5)).\n\n**The behaviour may not be found to constitute a criminal offence**\n\nIn this context, the law providing for the criminal offence must be read 'compatibly' with the human rights legislation \\- the qualified [rights to freedom of expression, to assembly and association](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1). Meaning, is this criminal justice system reponse to that behaviour provided for in law, necessary and proportionate, in pursuit of a legitimate aim, protecting the rights and freedoms of others, and were there no alternative and less restrictive responses?\n\nNow, some of those elements are a definite yes (e.g. trespass to or obstruction of the highway are provided for in law), others may be arguable. But in any case, the police, prosecution and the court (if it gets that far) must consider those things, must do that weighing up \\- it is not explicitly provided for in the legislation that creates those criminal offences. The courts have not found every protest on a highway to constitute a trespass to ([Director of Public Prosecutions v. Jones and Another](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/5.html)) or obstruction of a highway ([Director of Public Prosecutions (Respondent) v Ziegler and others (Appellants)](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2021/23.html)).\n\nOn the other hand, when these claimants seek an injunction the court does that weighing up and may consider alternative, less restrictive approaches (the claimant submits a wishlist, the defendant or court may push back). The court will say \"Yes, this is in pursuit of a legitimate aim and necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of the claimant and the wider public, however X is disproportionate, Y is proportionate, the defendants may go in area A but not area B, this time period is disproportionate, that time period is proportionate,\" and so on.\n\nSo the claimant and the police are now armed with that injunction, the claimant will publish it, defendants are aware of its contents and fellow protesters ought to be made aware of it. It's there in black\\-and\\-white what is restricted and anyone breaching the injunction could be found guilty of [contempt of court](https://www.gov.uk/contempt-of-court) (punishable by up to two years in prison and/or unlimited fine or asset seizure; must be proved to the criminal standard).\n\n**Example judgments about injunctions including lists of restrictions**\n\nHere are some examples from the context that include different kinds of restrictions by court order and the court's weighing up of the competing interests of the claimants, the defendants and the wider public.\n\n[Shell UK Oil Products Ltd v Persons Unknown \\[2022] EWHC 1215 (QB) (20 May 2022\\)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2022/1215.html) The claimant sought (and succeeded) to maintain an injunction that was granted on an emergency basis, its restrictions set out at para 20, conclusion at para 70\\.\n\n[National Highways Ltd v Heyatawin \\[2021] EWHC 3078 (QB)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2021/3078.html) \\- see para 7 for restrictions, the court found some protesters breached the so\\-called M25 Order and the court ordered their immediate imprisonment (para 66\\).\n\n[National Highways Ltd v Persons unknown (blocking traffic) \\[2021] EWHC 3081 (QB) (17 November 2021\\)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2021/3081.html) \\- the reasons for the decision to not set aside the ex parte interim injunction made by Linden J on 25 October 2021, some restrictions at para 4\\.\n\n[High Speed Two (HS2\\) Ltd \\& Anor v Four Categories of Persons Unknown \\& Ors \\[2022] EWHC 2360 (KB) (20 September 2022\\)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/2022/2360.html) \\- restrictions at para 188\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here is a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, injunctions have been used against climate protest groups like Extinction Rebellion to restrict certain activities.

Say for example I present to my users \"there are \\~1000 people that live in California that have a website\", or \"90% of website owners have visited New York\", or those kinds of things. Then say that an organization leaves the SaaS and wants their data removed. Am I to actually literally update the aggregated data with \\-1 user, or let's say \\-100 organization members, so it's calculations are based on 1 or 100 less users? That way, if 100 users left the SaaS and deleted their data, it would now maybe say \"89% of website owners have visited New York\", or however the aggregate was recomputed.\n\nI ask this because, the way we are generating aggregate data currently is by querying over *anonymized* \"data points\". The location might be kept, or the fact they owned a website, or some financial data point, but the organization or user name (and database ID) is deleted from the anonymized data point. Then we do a SQL query on these points to compute the aggregated statistics. But the question is, if some organization or user asks to \"remove their data\", what are we to do with these \"data points\", since they are anonymized? We can't really delete them because they are anonymized, and we don't know where they came from (since org/user name is deleted on them, for example). So they ask to delete data, but we don't delete this data because we have no way to map it back to their org?\n\nIs that acceptable? Or should we be keeping track of the org/user \"under the hood\", (not showing the personal information in the aggregate reports to customers though), and that way when they ask to delete their data, we can actually delete their data points from our analytics system?\n\nThe problem is, we want to build a data set of some kind, and so are keeping everything anonymized from the get go, but there is no way to actually know how to delete their data if they asked, but we did still technically have gained from their signing up and adding their data points originally.

Even with consent, you have to take security measures to avoid the misuse of the data.\n\nRemember the software shrink\\-wrap licenses? \"By opening the package, you agree to the terms inside.\" GDPR makes the equivalent in the cloud world impossible. You have to document exactly what you do with the data, and for any use that is not necessary to perform the service the customer can opt out.\n\nIn the scenario you describe, it is possible that you are not the data *controller* under GDPR but the data *processor*, and that you have a duty to keep the data from separate *controllers* apart.

Is it part of common law, or codified?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does it exist outside of the US? Is it part of common law, or\n> codified?\n\nThis rule is part of the shared common law heritage of common law countries, that is part of the basic structure of the legal system in these countries.\n\nHistorically it was a common law rule of practice. Many jurisdictions have not chosen to codify it, at least not in full, although I am sure that some countries include it as part of their court rules (indeed, most U.S. jurisdictions obliquely reference and modify parts of the common law rule about the need to file post\\-trial motions to preserve appellate issues in their trial court civil rules).\n\nIn general, it isn't uncommon for common law countries to adopt rules and statutes that state only a modification of a common law rule, without affirmatively stating the underlying common law rule that is being modified.\n\nThis said, there are a number of exceptions to the preservation rule which are probably not uniform in common law jurisdictions, although the deviations and elaborations of the common law rule are probably well defined in each common law jurisdiction in case law (because it comes up in literally every single reported appellate case).\n\nSome of the notable exceptions to the requirement of preservation in the U.S. are for \"plain error\", \"structural error\", subject\\-matter jurisdiction (including standing, mootness, and lack of case or controversy), and for errors that aren't made until the final verdict in a case. In general, error must be preserved at trial in cases that are resolved at trial, but there is an exception in most jurisdictions for \"motions in limine\" which are evidence ruling made prior to trial in lieu of a ruling at trial.\n\nDenial of a dispositive motion (e.g. a motion for summary judgment or motion to dismiss), prior to trial, will generally not preserve error, but a grant of a dispositive motion over objections, in full or in part, prior to trial will preserve error as the the portion of the case that is dismissed based upon that motion with respect to the issues raised in the objections to the dispositive motion.\n\nUsually, matters not apparent from the record and only discovered after the fact of a trial can be preserved by raising them in a post\\-trial motion to set aside a judgment if timely made, but can't be raised on a direct appeal.\n\nOne of the reasons that case law is important to the rule of preservation is that a central issue in many cases is whether a particular statement made in court or in a written filing is sufficiently specific to preserve the issue in the manner that it is presented on appeal, which often involves a certain amount of gray area. Some jurisdictions are more strict than others regarding how specifically the action taken at trial that is alleged to have preserved the issue for appeal has to be to preserve an issue. Generally speaking, one in not limited on appeal to the specific legal authority offered up at trial in an appellate briefing. But if one makes an argument on appeal that is similar but has a different twist to it than the way the argument was articulated at trial, it becomes a judgment call.\n\nFor example, suppose that a claim is thrown out based upon the statute of frauds (i.e. because a contract wasn't in writing).

For what purpose? How did the person become an Indian citizen?\n\nFor example, if the person became Indian by naturalization, a naturalization certificate would usually be necessary. If a person became Indian by birth then evidence establishing the relevant facts will be needed, and this evidence will typically include a birth certificate.\n\nWe can see that a passport isn't necessary to prove citizenship because a first\\-time passport applicant needs to prove citizenship in the application. Whatever documents are acceptable for this must therefore constitute proof of citizenship.\n\nBut there is always the possibility that an Indian citizen in possession of any document, including a passport, does something that causes the automatic loss of Indian nationality, such as naturalizing in a foreign country. At that point, the former Indian citizen will be in possession of documents that appear to show Indian citizenship without actually being an Indian citizen. Therefore, we can establish that *no document or set of documents can be conclusive proof of Indian citizenship.*\n\nDepending on the context, the person who needs to be convinced of a person's Indian citizenship may or may not need to take into account the likelihood that the person has somehow done something that would cause loss of citizenship. An airline agent boarding a passenger for an international flight to India will be satisfied by the passport. The immigration officer processing the passenger on arrival might however make a brief inquiry into possible expatriating acts. A judge in a court case may go as far as to undertake an intensive legal\\-factual analysis in which documents play a limited role, if any.\n\nThus, the answer to your question\n\n> What is the sure shot way of proving citizenship of India?\n\nis that there is none. There is always the possibility that a good\\-faith attempt to prove the citizenship of an Indian citizen will fail. There is always the possibility of a noncitizen having documents that were issued legitimately and purport to show that the person is an Indian citizen.\n\nIn the 2013 case, it [appears that the passports were issued in error](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/Passport-alone-no-proof-of-citizenship-Bombay-HC/articleshow/22244467.cms).

The lack of security (such as using HTTP instead of HTTPS) does not automatically make the API public or free to use. Additionally, the absence of public documentation does not grant permission for reverse engineering. It's important to note that while improving security or functionality might seem beneficial, it does not override the legal agreements in place.

EEOC](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/565/171/#tab-opinion-1963681), 565 U.S. 171 especially the holdings make is clear that no absolute exception to a law is created by declaring something to be a religion (we also know that from [Employment Div. v.

In that case, plaintiff who was a form of \"minister\" in the church was fired for reasons related to a disability, and she sued on grounds of illegal discrimination. The court unanimously rejected the suit on First Amendment ground, finding that \"The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment bar suits brought on behalf of ministers against their churches, claiming termination in violation of employment discrimination laws\" (the scope of the ministerial exception is narrowed w.r.t. ministers and employment discrimination laws). Thus the government must \"have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices\", and \"it is impermissible for the government to contradict a church\u2019s determination of who can act as its ministers\" which \"precludes application of such legislation to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers\". Extending this, [Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey\\-Berru](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/591/19-267/#tab-opinion-4270873), 591 U.S. finds that the government also cannot define bright lines as to what a \"minister\" is (at issue was a lack of formal training for ministers).\n\nWith this background, what is to stop you is that you will probably get sued by the government, and it may be impossible to present evidence that your practice is analogous to that involving the prior SCOTUS cases.That is, from Guadalups,\n\n> there is abundant record evidence that they both performed vital\n> religious duties, such as educating their students in the Catholic\n> faith and guiding their students to live their lives in accordance\n> with that faith.

That does not mean that a simple \"declaration\" by itself conveys special immunity to you. The court could well conclude that your claim to being a religion is spurious.

For the force to be justified, you have to reasonably believe you are in danger of being harmed, that you need to use force to avoid the harm, and you may only use the minimum force necessary to eliminate the threat. It then is a matter for the jury to decide whether those principles were followed in your particular instance. The reason why it's hard to predict the outcome is that it depends on a subjective evaluation by the jury, as to whether the shooter had a reasonable fear and whether lesser force was a viable option. \n\nThe jury's decision is guided by instructions to the jury (\\#506, \\#506\\) which focus on relevant distinctions. The jury will be told that \"Belief in future harm is not sufficient, no matter how great or how likely the harm is believed to be\", and that you have to reasonably believe there is \"imminent danger of great bodily injury\".

(I could also see approaching cell phone manufacturers to back the suit for financial or PR purposes, i.e. fighting for the rights of kids to always be connected.)\n\nI caution you that such suits, although always interesting, are generally extremely expensive, and can even be financially ruinous. The process, especially when dealing with constitutional issues, can take years and even decades. *(Outcome of trials can never be known, thus settlement is generally seen as the most prudent choice in business litigation, although your issue is in a different domain.)*\n\nThe first steps in challenging the constitutionality of this contract would be to:\n\n1.

The answer also mentions that challenging the constitutionality of such a contract would involve researching regional laws, reviewing law articles, and potentially a lengthy legal process that could take years and be financially risky.

The actual laws are in the [Florida Code sections 709\\.2100 thru 709\\.2402](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0709/0709.html)\n\n[Health Care Advance Directives](https://www.floridahealthfinder.gov/reports-guides/advance-directives.aspx) from the Florida Health Care Administration is a consumer guide to Living wills, surrogate designations, and related issues.\n\n[Florida Living Wills Laws](https://statelaws.findlaw.com/florida-law/florida-living-wills-laws.html) from FindLaw lists legal provisions related to living wills in Florida. The relevant code sections are stated as 765\\.101, and subsequent sections (Health Care Advance Directives).\n\nTerminology\n-----------\n\nThe person who makes the Power of Attorney (POA) is the *principal* \\-\\- the mother in the situation described in the question. The person appointed to do things for the principal is known as the *agent*, and is sometimes also called the *attorney\\-in\\-fact*.\n\nA *Limited POA* gives the agent power only over a particular transaction, or over a single or small number of types of transactions. One might give a limited POA to manage a particular investment, or to sell a car or a house, say.\n\nA *General POA* gives the agent power to do anything that the principal could do in person, or anything except for some specifically excluded things.\n\nA *Durable POA* remains in force even if the principal becomes incapacitated (for example with serious dementia). It includes specific language to this effect. It is usually also a general POA. Any POA that is not durable is not in effect when the principal becomes incapacitated. The situation described in the question would often be met with a durable POA.\n\nA durable POA:\n\n> contains the words: \u201cThis durable power of attorney is not terminated by subsequent incapacity of the principal except as provided in chapter 709, Florida Statutes,\u201d or similar words that show the principal\u2019s intent that the authority conferred is exercisable notwithstanding the principal\u2019s subsequent incapacity. (*Section 709\\.2104*)\n\nA *Medical POA*, sometimes also called a *Healthcare POA* grants the agent power to make medical or health choices for the principal. It is also known as a *health care surrogate designation*. It is normally a separate document form a POA dealing with non\\-medical issues, sometimes called a *financial POA*, even if the same agent is appointed for each.\n\nA *living will* is \"a written or oral statement of the kind of medical care you want or do not want if you become unable to make your own decisions.\" (*from the Advance Directives pamphlet linked above*)\n\nLiving wills and Healthcare POAs are collectively known as *Advance Directives*. The pamphlet says:\n\n> \\[I]f you have not made an advance directive, decisions about your health care or an anatomical donation may be made for you by a court\\-appointed guardian, your wife or husband, your adult child, your parent, your adult sibling, an adult relative, or a close friend.\n\nUnder section 709\\.2102:\n\n> \u201cIncapacity\u201d means the inability of an individual to take those actions necessary to obtain, administer, and dispose of real and personal property, intangible property, business property, benefits, and income.\n\nAgent\n-----\n\nAny competent adult that the principal selects may be an agent. The pamphlet linked above says:\n\n> Any competent person 18 years of age or older may serve as an agent. Agents should be chosen for reliability and trustworthiness. Certain financial institutions with trust powers also may serve as agents.\n\nThe agent may hire assistants, such as a lawyer,, an accountant, or a realtor. But the agent may not delegate or transfer his or her powers as an agent, or appoint a sub\\-agent.\n\nThe agent must act as instructed by the principal. When no specific instructions apply, the agent must act in the best interests of the principal, to the best of his or her understanding and ability.\n\nCreating a POA\n--------------\n\nThe POA must be in writing, and signed by the principal and two witnesses, and notarized. The principal must be competent when the POA is signed \\-\\- that is, must be in condition to understand the purpose and effect of the POA, and what is going on generally. (See the definitions section above.)\n\nThe agent must accept the POA, and often signs the POA to acknowledge the POA and accept the responsibility of acting as agent.\n\nA POA may appoint backup agents to act if the first agent is unable to act, or resigns, or dies. It may also appoint multiple agents any of whom may act, but this can cause problems if the agents disagree.\n\nThe text of a POA may be drafted by a lawyer. But there are also software programs that will produce the text of a POA, after appropriate information is entered and questions are answered as to the desired effects. Such programs normally produce text tailored to ma particular state's laws.\n\nEnding a POA\n------------\n\nThe principal may revoke a POA at any time, if the principal is competent. A principal may also revoke a living will or other advance directive at any time.\n\nThe agent may resign at any time\n\nIf either agent or principal dies the POA is ended. (If a POA appoints multiple agents, it ends only if they all die or resign.)\n\nIf the agent becomes incapacitated, the agents power ends. If there is not other agent, the POA ends.\n\nIf the agent is married to the principal, a divorce or separation or a petition for a divorce, ends the agent's authority, unless the POA explicitly says it will continue after a divorce or separation.\n\nIf a legal process to appoint a guardian is started, the POA is suspended, unless the agent is the principal's \"parent, spouse, child, or grandchild\". (This may include stepchild.) If a guardian is appointed, the court will rule on whether the POA continues; often it will not, unless the agent is also the guardian appointed.\n\nFlorida code section 709\\.2109\u2003(3\\) (*Link above*) says:\n\n> If any person initiates judicial proceedings to determine the principal\u2019s incapacity or for the appointment of a guardian advocate, the authority granted under the power of attorney is suspended until the petition is dismissed or withdrawn or the court enters an order authorizing the agent to exercise one or more powers granted under the power of attorney. However, if the agent named in the power of attorney is the principal\u2019s parent, spouse, child, or grandchild, the authority under the power of attorney is not suspended unless a verified motion in accordance with s. 744\\.3203 is also filed.\n\nIf the POA includes an ending date or condition, it ends when this occurs.\n\nA third party, one who is neither the agent or the principal, can only have a durable POA revoked by petitioning a court to do so, usually in connection with the appointment of a guardian. The court will do this only if a guardian is needed, and that the action of the agent under the POA is not sufficient to serve he interests of the principal; or if the agent is shown to have been untrustworthy or neglectful, or has become incapacitated.\n\nLiving wills normally remain in effect unless revoked, even if a guardian is appointed.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nNo one has an automatic right to be appointed as the agent, no matter what relationship to the principal that person has, or for how long a relationship has existed. The principal may choose any agent that s/he trusts and thinks will be able to do the job well.\n\nThe husband or stepchildren described in the question will not be able to have the POA set aside by a court unless they can show that the son has not acted in the mother's best interests or has acted dishonestly in regard to the mother, or has misused the powers granted by the POA. If they can show that the son used undue influence to get the mother to sign the POA, that might cause a curt to rule against the POA. But they have no automatic claim to cancel the POA, just because they are related to the mother.\n\nThe Florida laws about a POA are **very** similar to the laws in NJ and NY that I have had occasion to deal with before.

She wants to create a power of attorney (POA) and living will, naming her biological son from a previous marriage as her agent. She is still legally married to her second husband but has been informally separated for years. Which of the following statements is true regarding the creation and validity of the POA?\n\nA) The second husband has the legal right to override the POA if he disagrees with it, as he is still legally married to the woman.\n\nB) The woman must include her stepchildren from her second marriage as beneficiaries in the POA, or it will be considered invalid.\n\nC) The POA will automatically become void if the woman becomes incapacitated, unless it specifically includes language making it a durable POA.\n\nD) The second husband or stepchildren can only challenge the POA in court if they can prove the son is not acting in the mother's best interests or used undue influence.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, the principal (the woman in this case) has the right to choose any competent adult as her agent for a power of attorney, regardless of family relationships. The second husband and stepchildren do not have an automatic right to override or invalidate the POA simply because they are related to the principal.\n\nThe only way for third parties (such as the husband or stepchildren) to challenge the POA would be through a court petition, typically in connection with seeking guardianship. They would need to prove that the son (as the agent) is not acting in the mother's best interests, has been untrustworthy or neglectful, or that he used undue influence to get the mother to sign the POA.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the second husband does not have an automatic right to override the POA, even if he's still legally married to the woman.\n\nOption B is false because there is no requirement to include stepchildren as beneficiaries in a POA for it to be valid.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a durable POA specifically remains in effect even if the principal becomes incapacitated, provided it includes the necessary language as required by Florida law."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87797/app-that-contains-a-feature-that-allows-users-to-deposit-money-that-they-may-use", "docs_id": 87797, "title": "App that contains a feature that allows users to deposit money that they may use to purchase later or get refunded", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my app / website, there is a feature for the user to deposit money that they could then use to purchase later or get refunded 3 months later.\n\nWhat is the legal implication of this feature?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An incomplete list:\n\n* Getting the money.  \n\nHow did you plan to get paid?

It also claims that differences in local practice and polices made absentee or mail\\-in voting easier, or invalid votes less likely to be detected, in some counties than in others, meaning that voters in some parts of those states were treated differently than voters in other parts.\n\nNote that this theory has not yet been accepted, or in any way passed on, by SCOTUS.

It would have nothing to say about the actual content of the various state laws, unless those laws treated different parts of a state differently, in which case there would be an equal protection violation.\n\nThe Electors clause, cited in this suit, gives to the legislature of each state the power to \"direct\" how electors are to be appointed. This is done through laws, statutes. The suit cites this clause as a source of authority, and nothing in it could be taken as suggesting a requirement of national uniformity in election law.\n\nI have not yet seen the response to this suit, if indeed one has been filed. It may be that a response would argue that the changes were, in fact, authorized by provisions of the various state laws granting authority to officials. No one knows how the Court will respond to this suit.

After accepting a presidential pardon, Arpaio loses his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination for the specific crimes covered by the pardon. This means he can be compelled to testify about those matters in both federal and state courts, as well as in civil cases. However, the pardon does not extend to crimes not covered by it. Arpaio retains the right to invoke the Fifth Amendment if his testimony could incriminate him for other crimes not included in the pardon, whether they are federal or state offenses. Option A is incorrect because the pardon removes Fifth Amendment protection for the pardoned crimes.

For example, in *McDevitt v. Stokes*, 192 S.W. 681 (Ky. 1917\\), a breeder who had promised a horse jockey money if he won a race was allowed to renege on the promise because the jockey already had a professional duty to try to win.\n\nLikewise, if you promise the police a reward if they bring the person who burgled your house to justice, they already have a preexisting duty to bring the criminal to justice.\n\nThere's a small window here to argue the opposite if the dad was trying to induce something above and beyond what the judge ordered.\n\n[united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: Matt was sentenced to 10 hours of community service by a judge.

According to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 73, performing a preexisting legal duty does not constitute consideration for a contract. In this case, Matt was already legally obligated to perform the community service as ordered by the judge. Therefore, completing this service cannot serve as valid consideration for a contract with his father. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because, while there was an offer and acceptance, the consideration element is lacking due to the preexisting legal duty rule.\n\nAnswer C touches on a possible exception but is not the best answer. While there might be a small chance of arguing for a contract if Matt did something above and beyond the judge's order, this is not stated in the question and would be a less common interpretation.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because promises between family members can be legally binding if all elements of a contract are present.

She very suddenly files an injunction against harassment, requiring him not to come within 100 yards of her or try to make contact. In great shock and totally ignorant of what this would later entail, he just apologizes and complies, though he's frustrated and thinks this was totally unnecessary. But then she notifies the school, which issues him a suspension to ensure that he complies with the injunction. Devastated, angry, confused and afraid of getting in further trouble he again just apologizes, complies and returns to school the following semester, but both actions remain on his legal and academic records.\n\nDid the school overstep their authority in the suspension? Should there have been a legal hearing of some kind with counsel ensured for both parties? Can he contest the injunction after it has expired to have it removed from his record? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I will assume a typical US university context, and as far as I know it does not matter whether it is a strictly private university versus a state\\-funded university. I assume he is a student (\"suspension\" only makes sense in that context), and also assume she is a student (as a faculty member, a rather different kettle of fish is implied). There will be some code of conduct that students are required to obey, and the university will take the position that by violating the injunction, the student has violated that code. Suspension is a reasonable response, given that the university would open itself up for a Title 9 lawsuit (for tolerating sexual harassment). The university will almost certainly have the authority to suspend or even expel a student for violating an injunction that involves another of their students.\n\nThere may be a requirement for a hearing: you would have to look into the university rules. The chances are low that a university would ignore such a rule (if they did, their action could easily be overturned in the ensuing lawsuit). \n\nIf he is going to contest the injunction, that involves the courts, and not the university. The courts will not remove the injunction from \"the record\". He might get it vacated, dismissed or modified, but there will be \"a record\". The university is likely to keep records of disciplinary actions against students somewhat private, and again there will be university rules about that topic (some of which are compelled by FERPA). Whether or not he has a right to a university\\-internal appeal depends on university rules, but you should assume that there is very limited opportunity for appeal. Decisions at the level of the provost / president / board of regents are effectively final, and the only recourse is a lawsuit against the university (where the question will be whether the university has the right to suspend the student, and did they follow their own procedures for suspension).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A university student receives an injunction for harassment filed by another student, requiring him to stay 100 yards away from her.

The student's options for contesting the suspension are typically limited to the university's internal processes, which often end at the highest administrative levels. Contesting the injunction itself would involve the court system, not the university, and even if successful, records of the injunction and disciplinary action would likely still exist. The other options are incorrect because they misstate the university's obligations (no requirement to provide legal counsel), overstate the ease of removing records, or incorrectly suggest that courts would automatically remove records."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22587/confidentiality-in-employer-employee-relations-defaults-in-us-law", "docs_id": 22587, "title": "Confidentiality in employer/employee relations - defaults in US law?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I may soon be employed by a US company (I've never worked for one before).

According to the information provided, there are no default legal restrictions on either employers or employees regarding the disclosure of information when not specifically addressed in a contract. However, the concept of at-will employment in most US states allows employers to terminate employees for any reason (with some exceptions), including making disclosures the employer doesn't approve of, even if the employee wasn't explicitly told not to disclose such information. This creates a situation where employees technically have the freedom to disclose information, but may face consequences for doing so, while employers have more latitude in their disclosures.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect because they imply legal restrictions that don't exist by default.
