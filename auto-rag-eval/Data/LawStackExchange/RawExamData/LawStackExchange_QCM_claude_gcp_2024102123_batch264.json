Rather, it means the state maintains neutrality towards religion while allowing for diverse personal laws based on different religious traditions. This approach is consistent with India's constitutional claim to be a secular state, as secularism doesn't require the complete removal of religion from all aspects of law, but rather ensures the state doesn't favor one religion over others. The presence of efforts to modernize and bring uniformity to personal laws across religions further demonstrates India's attempt to balance secular governance with respect for religious diversity in personal matters."

Which of the following best describes the teacher's legal obligation to report this situation?\n\nA) The teacher must immediately report this to Child Protective Services as it constitutes child neglect.\n\nB) The teacher has no legal obligation to report this, as suicidal thoughts are not explicitly covered under mandatory reporting laws.\n\nC) The teacher must report this to the school principal within 24 hours, as required by New York Education Law.\n\nD) The teacher should use their professional judgment to determine if reporting is necessary, as the legal requirement is not clearly defined in this situation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question highlights the complexity and ambiguity in the legal requirements for teachers reporting potential suicidal thoughts. Option A is incorrect because vague expressions of not wanting to be around do not necessarily constitute child abuse or neglect. Option B is incorrect because while there's no explicit law requiring reporting of suicidal thoughts, teachers do have certain duties of care. Option C is incorrect as there is no specific New York Education Law requiring such reporting within 24 hours. Option D is correct because, as the documentation suggests, the legal requirement in this situation is not clearly defined. The teacher's duty stems from their role in loco parentis and their professional responsibility, but the specifics of when and how to report in non-imminent situations are \"very muddy.\" Therefore, the teacher must use their professional judgment to assess the severity of the situation and determine the appropriate course of action."

The university's recommendation to support businesses owned by people of color is considered protected speech under the U.S. Constitution, and there is no law requiring public universities to remain politically neutral. However, the implementation of race-based business policies is more complex and depends on various factors:\n\n1. Nine states have laws banning affirmative action, which could affect the university's ability to implement race-based policies.\n2. Supreme Court cases like Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v.

For a state's affirmative action programs to be legal, they must have a clear goal of limited scope without other workable race-neutral means to achieve it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because public institutions are not required by law to remain politically neutral. Option B is too restrictive, as the university may be able to implement some race-conscious policies depending on the circumstances. Option D is overly permissive and doesn't account for the legal limitations on race-based policies."

The key issue here is that the agreement lacks consideration from Person B, which is a fundamental requirement for a legally binding contract. Person B doesn't provide anything of value or suffer any detriment in exchange for the potential $10,000 reward. This absence of consideration means that, legally speaking, no valid contract exists between Person A and Person B. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while people can sometimes terminate contracts early, this isn't universally true and doesn't address the core legal issue here.\n\nOption C is false; there's no general law prohibiting smoking cessation agreements.\n\nOption D is also incorrect; escrow accounts typically follow the terms of the agreement they're based on, but in this case, the underlying agreement itself is not legally enforceable.\n\nTherefore, if Person A went to court after 3 months, they would likely be able to reclaim their money due to the lack of a legally binding contract, regardless of the original 6-month term."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: (Just for reference, this question is for a story I'm working on, and I wanted a realistic look at the law's side of things.)\n\nSo, a lot of fiction likes to play off the trope of a Vigilante. This person, (superhero or otherwise) often cuffs the baddies, and leaves them gift wrapped for the police, along with providing ***damning*** evidence to go with that. So my question is, does that actually ***help*** the police in any way?\n\nThese situations are almost always portrayed as:\n\n* Acquiring evidence without a warrant\n* Falsely imprisoning a person/criminal (This does not always involve the Vigilante seeing the crime happen, but they are usually acting like a police officer and pre\\-empting the crime.\n* The Vigilante is generally unable to be present for the accused to 'face their accuser'.\n\nSo, if evidence came from a known Vigilante, can it be used in a court of law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Can a vigilante perform an arrest?\n----------------------------------\n\nThis depends on whether the vigilante has the power to perform a [**citizen's arrest**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen's_arrest). The rules depend on the jurisdiction (and vary from state to state in the US), but generally the power to perform a citizen's arrest is quite limited. It may include the power to 'pre\\-empt' an offence if the would\\-be offender has [attempted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempt) to commit the offence. However, often the power is limited to particularly serious offences (eg. felonies). There may also be a requirement that the crime occurred in the citizen's presence, or that the citizen was unable to contact the police instead.\n\nIs evidence obtained by a vigilante admissible?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn the United States, the constitutional [**exclusionary rule**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusionary_rule) generally prevents evidence from being admitted if the government obtained it illegally. [I answered a general question about the scope of the exclusionary rule here.](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17851/how-far-does-the-fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree-doctrine-extend/19507) However, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained illegally by a private individual: *Burdeau v. McDowell*, [256 U.S. 465](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/256/465/case.html) (1921\\).\n\nIn *Burdeau*, the defendant's papers had been stolen and turned over to the government, which proposed to present them as evidence to a grand jury. The Supreme Court said:\n\n> In the present case, the record clearly shows that no official of the federal government had anything to do with the wrongful seizure of the petitioner's property ... there was no invasion of the security afforded by the Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure, as whatever wrong was done was the act of individuals in taking the property of another ... We assume that petitioner has an unquestionable right of redress against those who illegally and wrongfully took his private property under the circumstances herein disclosed, but with such remedies we are not now concerned.\n\nHowever, the exclusionary rule in some states goes beyond the Fourth Amendment. For example, [article 38\\.23 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure](http://codes.findlaw.com/tx/code-of-criminal-procedure/crim-ptx-crim-pro-art-38-23.html) provides that evidence illegally obtained 'by an officer *or other person*' is inadmissible. This provision was apparently enacted to deter vigilantes: Bubany and Cockerell, '[Excluding Criminal Evidence Texas\\-Style: Can Private Searches Poison the Fruit?](https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/ttu-ir/bitstream/handle/10601/1554/12TexTechLRev611.pdf)' 12 *Texas Tech Law Review* 611 (1981\\), p 625\\.\n\nCan such evidence be admitted even if the vigilante is not present?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAssuming that no exclusionary rule applies, evidence obtained by a vigilante can potentially be admitted through the testimony of a police officer or other witness, subject to the rule against [**hearsay**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearsay) and the question of reliability.\n\nThe rule against hearsay means that a police officer cannot give evidence that a vigilante told them that the accused was guilty. Evidence of this kind is not admissible because the accused has no opportunity to challenge the reliability of the source of the information in cross\\-examination.\n\nThe rule against hearsay does not apply when the probative value of the evidence does not depend on the truth of the absent vigilante's assertion. If the evidence provided by the vigilante is really 'damning' then it might fall into this category. For example, a vigilante might provide the police with a weapon that has the accused and victim's DNA on it, or tell the police that incriminating evidence can be found at a particular location.\n\nA police officer can then give evidence that the weapon was tested and found to have matching DNA, or a search warrant was executed and the incriminating evidence was found. There is no admissibility issue here. However, the fact that the police were tipped off by a vigilante who has broken the law and is not present to face court may cause the jury to reject the evidence as unreliable (ie. it could have been planted).",

The vigilante does not appear in court. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility and use of this evidence in a U.S. federal court?\n\nA) The evidence is inadmissible because it was obtained without a warrant and violates the Fourth Amendment.\n\nB) The evidence is admissible, but the case will be dismissed because the defendant cannot face their accuser.\n\nC) The evidence is admissible, but its reliability may be questioned by the jury due to the vigilante's absence.\n\nD) The evidence is inadmissible because it was obtained through a citizen's arrest, which is always illegal.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the U.S. Supreme Court case Burdeau v. McDowell, the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence obtained illegally by private individuals. Therefore, the evidence gathered by \"The Night Watcher\" would be potentially admissible in a federal court, even though it was obtained without a warrant.\n\nThe vigilante's absence does not automatically lead to case dismissal, as option B suggests. While the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to face their accusers, this typically applies to testimonial evidence. Physical evidence or video footage can often be introduced through other witnesses, such as police officers.\n\nHowever, as noted in the passage, the fact that the evidence was obtained by a vigilante who is not present in court may cause the jury to question its reliability. They might be concerned about the possibility of evidence tampering or the vigilante's motives.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they misstate the legal principles involved. Private individuals are not bound by the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirements, and citizen's arrests can be legal under certain circumstances, depending on state law."

The key point here is that it's an objective test based on how a hypothetical ordinary, reasonable person would interpret the information. Even if the law firm's claim is technically accurate, they could still be held liable if there's a \"real and not remote possibility\" that the statement could mislead or deceive potential clients. It's not necessary to prove actual deception or harm, just the potential to mislead. This makes option C the most accurate response.

But does this imply that Filipino citizens are **required** to pay income taxes? I mention required with the common understanding that all individuals receiving compensation/income by definition are **\"profiting\"** from the employment.\n\nThere are no mentions of Filipino being **\"required\"** or **\"exempted\"**, thus the ambiguity on whether Filipino citizens should pay or not.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This isn't ambiguous at all.\n\nArticle 5, Section 3 means what it says, non\\-Filipino citizens are exempt to the extent provided.

It does not mention any specific exemption for Filipino citizens. The lack of explicit exemption for Filipino citizens, combined with the principle that taxes apply unless specifically exempted, means that Filipino citizens would be subject to normal tax laws as if they worked for any other employer.

While it is generally illegal to carry a knife with a blade longer than 3 inches in public, there are exceptions. The \"national costume\" exception mentioned in s139 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides a potential defense for carrying a sgian-dubh as part of traditional Scottish attire. However, this is not an absolute protection. The law states it \"shall be a defence,\" which means it's something John could argue in court if charged, not an automatic exemption. The blade length and sharpness might be factors a court would consider in determining if the defense is valid. Option D most accurately reflects this nuanced legal situation, acknowledging both the potential illegality and the possible defense."

And you don't need to register a copyright to have copyright.\n\nThe copyright office has [instructions](https://www.copyright.gov/eco/help-author.html#anonymous) on how to register an anonymous work. I'm not quite sure how that works; presumably you could keep the author secret, but I'm not sure if you can keep your registration secret. \n\nBut even if you can somehow register while remaining anonymous, what if someone infringes your copyright? What are you going to do \\- sue them? You'll be listed as the plaintiff. Courts usually won't allow anonymous plaintiffs in lawsuits unless there is a *very* good reason.\n\nOne thing you might try is creating a corporation to own the copyright.

You have a contract with the land owner, or\n2. You don't have a contract with the land owner\n\n**Do you have a contract with the land owner?**\n\nIf there is a sign which says something like \"If you park here, we will tow your car away and you will have to pay $200 to get it back\", and the sign's placement, fontsize, etc mean that it would be visible to a normal person, then by parking there you are entering into a contract. The landowner likely also has a contract with a towing company allowing them to tow cars from their property. Whether this is a blanket contract covering all cars on the land (they might sign a new contract once a year) or individual contracts for each car (they might call the towing company whenever they need a car towed) is determined by the land owner and the towing company\n\nAlternatively, you may have a contract with the landowner allowing you to park there for free. Is there a sign that says \"Visitor parking\" and were you visiting someone who lives/works on the land?\n\nIf there is no sign and you have not specifically entered into a contract regarding parking there, then depending on the circumstances the landowner can still have your car towed, but it would be difficult for them to require you to pay a specific amount to get it back. They may need to make a claim against you for their towing costs, and show receipts from the towing company etc, because without a contract they have no right to profit from you parking there, even if you were trespassing.\n\nIn most cases there will be a sign, you will see it, and you will agree to it by parking. You can report it to the police as stealing, they can investigate by asking the towing company and the land owner, and they will probably discover that the landowner had the right to tow cars and assigned that right to the towing company.\n\nIf there's a sign, then you may have agreed to it by parking there.

This allows the property owner to legally tow unauthorized vehicles.\n\nOption A is based on urban legends about towing requirements and is not legally necessary.

In this case, there appears to be something in the employment contract, which would therefore be enforced unless specifically prohibited. There is no law prohibiting a contract clause that says roughly \"anything you write while working for us is ours\".\n\nIt is hard to say whether such a clause would he held to be unconsionable, since we don't know what the clause actually says. The basic test is if a condition is manifestly unfair, it cannot be enforced, but if it works to the advantage of one party, it can be. If the clause extends past the period of employment (forward or backward) it might be unfair. It might be unenforceable if \"relates to\" is construed over\\-broadly (for example, if you are hired as a lighting technician for a dance theater company and write sci\\-fi novels as a hobby, the claim could be that dance and sci\\-fi are \"related\" as forms of entertainment, but that would be an unreasonable claim).",

Someone else could implement the algorithm with a different program. This would not be a copyright violation, unless it copies the code verbatim from Matthew's program. \n\nA patent, on the other hand, would protect the right to solve a problem in a specific manner. When Matthew obtains a patent on his algorithm, then nobody else is allowed to use that algorithm without Matthew's permission until the patent expired.\n\nThe problem, though, is that many jurisdictions do not recognize patents on software algorithms (the European Union, for example). So the patent would only be enforceable in jurisdictions which do.\n\nFor further information, check out the [Wikipedia article on Software Patents.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent)",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer, Sarah, has created a novel machine learning algorithm for natural language processing. She wants to protect her intellectual property in the most comprehensive way possible, considering international markets. Which of the following strategies would be most effective for Sarah?\n\nA) Apply for a copyright on the source code in the United States\nB) Seek patent protection in the United States and other patent-friendly jurisdictions, while maintaining the algorithm as a trade secret in non-patent jurisdictions\nC) Register a trademark for the algorithm's name and logo\nD) Publish the algorithm in a peer-reviewed journal to establish prior art\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most comprehensive strategy for Sarah's situation. Here's why:\n\n1. Copyright (Option A) would only protect the specific implementation (source code) of the algorithm, not the underlying idea or functionality. This leaves the algorithm vulnerable to reimplementation by others.\n\n2. Patents (part of Option B) can protect the algorithm itself in jurisdictions that allow software patents, such as the United States. This prevents others from implementing the same algorithm, even if they write different code.\n\n3. Trade secrets (also part of Option B) can protect the algorithm in jurisdictions that don't recognize software patents, like the European Union. This strategy allows Sarah to maintain control over her invention worldwide.\n\n4. Trademarks (Option C) only protect names, logos, and other identifying marks, not the underlying technology.\n\n5. Publishing (Option D) would establish prior art but would also make the algorithm public, preventing Sarah from protecting it as a trade secret or potentially patenting it in some jurisdictions.\n\nBy combining patent protection in some countries with trade secret protection in others, Sarah can maximize her intellectual property rights globally. This approach addresses the variation in international IP laws regarding software algorithms and provides the most comprehensive protection strategy."

The theater management refuses them entry, citing concerns that they might be skipping school. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the theater's right to refuse admission?\n\nA) The theater has no legal right to refuse admission to the students, as they have completed their exams for the day.\nB) The theater can only refuse admission if they have concrete proof that the students are actually skipping school.\nC) The theater has the right to refuse admission for any reason, except those explicitly prohibited by anti-discrimination laws.\nD) The theater must allow the students entry if they can provide evidence that their school day has ended.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Private businesses, such as movie theaters, generally have the right to refuse service or admission to anyone, as long as their reasons do not violate specific anti-discrimination laws. These laws typically protect against discrimination based on factors like race, religion, gender, or disability. In this case, the theater's concern about students potentially skipping school is not a protected category under anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, even if their assumption is incorrect, they still have the legal right to refuse admission on these grounds. The theater is not obligated to admit customers or investigate the validity of their reasons for refusal, as long as those reasons don't violate protected categories."

At the time I started it I didn't know there was another woman in another country who was doing exactly the same, with the same name. Different logo, but same name.\nShe messaged me on Instagram to tell me about this and as soon as I saw her message, I changed everything: Name and logo. Her tone was a bit threatening, so I went along to search for her but although I found different trademarks with the same name along different industries, none of them had anything to do with tarot. Her website does have the same name though and I read on another post that even if it isn't registered, the name might still be legally \"protected\" because of the reputation it has gained. She has more than 18000 followers, I have around 200\\. I'm afraid even after I changed everything, she might want to take legal action (accross countries, I think she is in the US, I'm in Mexico, if that is possible) and I may need to compensate for some of the small profit I've gotten since I started it (not more than 200 dollars in no less than 6 months).

The scenario involves a complex international trademark issue, but several factors support this answer:\n\n1. The Mexican reader acted promptly to change their business name and logo upon being notified of the potential conflict.\n2. There was no intentional copying, and the similarity was coincidental.\n3. The businesses operate in different countries, which complicates enforcement of trademark rights.\n4. The US-based reader's trademark may be protected by common law even if not registered, but enforcing this across borders would be challenging.\n5. The Mexican reader's small scale of operations (200 followers vs. 18,000) and limited profit ($200 in 6 months) make it unlikely that pursuing legal action would be worth the cost for the US-based reader.\n\nWhile there might have been a potential trademark issue initially, the prompt action taken by the Mexican reader to change their branding, combined with the international nature of the situation and the relatively small scale of their operation, likely mitigates significant legal risk. This aligns with the advice given in the original answer to not worry about potential legal issues until they actually materialize."

Anyway, litigation is a lousy way of resolving disputes; generally, if you are heading to court you are sweeping up the debris of a failed relationship.\n\nIn contrast, a lawyer with skills is psychology may be worse at winning arguments but better at gaining consensus.

Such passengers sometimes lose property beyond prohibited items, and are powerless to do anything about it.\n\nIf the passenger tries to complain after, the TSA can simply deny the truth and claim it doesn't happen, or claim the passenger was doing something wrong. The passenger may not have any access to TSA video records which would disprove their claims, as that's considered secret, unless the records clearly show that the passenger was in fact in the wrong. Signs in security screening areas clearly prohibit recording, communicating the message that the passenger cannot have any recording evidence and their word is easily discounted compared to someone in uniform. \n\nThe elimination of ways in which officers can be held accountable opens the door to abuse of power (regardless of whether or not agents legally have much power) and leads to more situations in which the accountability is desired/necessary. \n\nWhat does the law actually say regarding passengers' rights (or prohibitions) on recording interactions with TSA officers?

Or is this immunity waived by the federal law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes and No. The Federal U.S. Government as well as each individual state and territory claim Soverign Immunity to a limited degree. In the case of Federal Government, they claim Soverign Immunity to a near limitless degree (more on this in a moment), while States and Territories claim \"State Soverign Immunity\" which grants them immunity with respect to all soverign powers granted under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTo clarify, each U.S. State is seperately soverign in all matters not explicitly allocated to the Federal Government by the U.S. Constitution and all constitutionally written laws. Where the Constitution does not in writing claim a power for the federal government nor reserver a power for the state government, the power is assumed to be state government. So a State can claim immunity for a police situation but not a law it makes regarding immigration or foriegn policy, since that is the exclusive wheelhouse of the Feds. Per the 11th amendment, states can only be sued in state court by citizens of the state, while non\\-state citizens wishing to sue a state must sue in the Federal Court (Which for the purposes of the trial may adopt the defendant State's laws and regulations for the purposes of questions of fact and law brought up in the suit).\n\nAll U.S. States and the Federal Goverment additionally wave Soverign Immunity under specific conditions outlined in laws. In the case of the Federal Government, the laws governing when this immunity is waived are governed by the [Federal Torts Claims Act (1946\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act) and the [Tucker Act (1887\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Act). The FTCA covers intentional torts by the Federal Government, while the Tucker Act typically covers matters related to contractual obligations or monitary interactions with the federal government. Things that may be sued for include but are not limited too:\n\n* Intentional Torts committed by Government Agents in their Official Capacity (i.e. When the FBI violates your rights or maliciously investigates you).\n* Contractual disputes where the Government is a party to the Contract, either in written or implied terms.\n* Constitutional Claims (i.e. The Government may have violated the Constitution. These tend to be for non\\-monitary relief such as mandemuses, though the 5th Amendment's Taking Clause can be invoked of the government took property and does not justly compensate.).\n* Individual Agencies of the Government when the monitary claim is not drawn from the U.S. Treasury (the agencies own allocated budget is used to pay).\n* Refund for taxes paid\n\nIn all cases, a Judge will determin if the Government, under the laws, can be sued. If in the example of a government employee being sued, the Justice Department will first make a determination if the employee was acting as an agent of the government when they committed the tortious act, and then will declare themselves *Respondent Superior* through the agency of employement. From there, the case becomes a suit against the Federal Government and FTCA immunity waiver is determined by a Judge.\n\nFor example, lets say you (Mr. Rapt) sue Special Agent Jimmy Jones of an intentional tort that he committed in the course of his duty as an FBI agent. The DOJ will first declare that they are *Respondent Superior* in the case of Rapt v. Jones, thus turning the case to Rapt v. United States Government, Department of Justice, Federal Beura of Investigations, and Jones (Rapt v. United States, et. al.). From here, the Judge who gets the case then determins if the U.S. Government under FTCA can be sued by Rapt, based on Rapt's citizenship status (usually permanent legal residents are covered as citizens for this point, but I can say for certain in this particular law), ripeness (the suit must be filed within 2 years of the incident or first knowledge), and immunity waiver under FTCA.\n\nIn the case of the State Government, they should have similar laws, but I'm not going to identify all 50 individual laws here. Additionally, the 11th Amendment permits U.S. Congress to waive a State's immunity to suit in certain cases (mostly comes up with the Due Process Clause in the 14th Amendment.).\n\nAs a fun point, in all cases where a government appears as a defendant in a suit, it is automatically a Bench Trial, as the government usually include a waiver of their right as defendant to a jury trial. The thinking here is that, as a country that was founded by rebelling against the government, a jury of 12 of the government's citizens aren't going to give them any slack at trial, where as a judge (who they pay) is much more likely.\n\nTL;DR: Both questions are yes. The immunity is waived under federal law for certain cases, but it is a judge who will make the ruling if the specific case meets the aformentioned waived immunity.",

The Department of Justice will indeed declare respondeat superior, changing the case from against the individual agent to against the United States government. A judge will then determine if immunity is waived under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the suit would not be directly against the FBI agent, and it would not automatically be a jury trial.

The dentist office confirmed my policy and claimed that I would pay 50% of the total cost and they would charge the insurance company the rest.\n\nI ended up paying, in full, as soon as they allowed. \n\nThe next month, after the procedure, my insurance company contacted my parents to let them know they are dropping me from the plan. It turns out that I wasn't supposed to be on there since I was out of college at the time (recently graduated). They refused to pay the rest of the cost. \n\nI had absolutely no idea about any of that. Apparently, neither did my parents.\n\nNow, I'm being charged with a bill for $1400, which seems to be double the cost they were supposed to charge the insurance company. The last I heard, the dentist has tried to charge the insurance company several times without success.\n\nHad I been informed before the procedure that my insurance wasn't going to cover it, I would have waited until Jan 2019 so that I could use my new insurance provided by my job. \n\n**Question:**\n\n* Can the insurance company refuse to pay the bill? I understand why they dropped me from the policy, but the policy was active at the time of the charge.\n\n**What is my best option?**\n\n1. Should I refuse to acknowledge the debt as mine? Can I claim it's the insurance company's debt?\n2. Contact my old insurance company and try to get them to pay up?\n3. Negotiate with the dentist office to reduce the bill and just pay it?\n4. Simply have them fix the charge so that it's accurate (it should be $700, not $1400, since I already paid half), and pay in full?\n\nDo I have other options?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you were on your parents policy with the understanding you were a student in college, then yes, they can drop you and refuse to pay. You need to read the terms of the insurance very carefully, somewhere in there it says that the policy is only in effect while you are enrolled as a full time student. You (or your parents) broke this agreement, and the insurance company doesn't have any obligation to pay.\n\n> 1. Should I refuse to acknowledge the debt as mine? Can I claim it's the insurance company's debt?\n\nNo, the debt is yours from the moment of service, the insurance company's job is to cover some of that expense on your behalf. It isn't the insurance company's debt, it is yours.\n\n> 2. Contact my old insurance company and try to get them to pay up?\n\nUnfortunately you will not be successful at this. You violated the terms of your insurance (not being enrolled in school), the company has no obligation to pay. Your parents may be owed some refund of money for any extra premiums they paid while you were not enrolled, but that would be the extent of the insurance company's obligation.\n\n> 3. Negotiate with the dentist office to reduce the bill and just pay it?\n\nThis is probably the best route to go. Insurance companies often negotiate fixed prices for certain procedures that are different than what they would charge uninsured customers. You can ask your dentist if they have any kind of help for uninsured patients. \n\n> 4. Simply have them fix the charge so that it's accurate (it should be $700, not $1400, since I already paid half), and pay in full?\n\nIf you already paid $700, and $700 was your insurance providers portion, then yes, the bill that the *dentist* sends to you should be $700, not $1400\\. Make sure though that the entire bill is $1400 though, not $2100 ($700 your portion, and $1400 insurance).",

The total cost was $1400, and the patient paid $700 upfront. Later, it was discovered that the patient was ineligible for coverage due to no longer being a full-time student. The insurance company refused to pay, and the dentist is now billing the patient for the full $1400. What is the most appropriate course of action for the patient?\n\nA) Refuse to acknowledge the debt and claim it belongs to the insurance company\nB) Attempt to force the insurance company to pay by threatening legal action\nC) Negotiate with the dentist's office to reduce the bill and pay the negotiated amount\nD) Pay the full $1400 bill without question\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the debt belongs to the patient, not the insurance company. The patient is responsible for the cost of services received.\nB) is incorrect because the insurance company is within its rights to refuse payment if the patient violated the terms of the policy (in this case, no longer being a full-time student).\nC) is correct because negotiating with the dentist's office is the most reasonable approach. The patient can explain the situation, request a reduction to the uninsured rate, and potentially work out a payment plan.\nD) is incorrect because the patient has already paid $700, so paying the full $1400 again would result in overpayment. Additionally, there may be room for negotiation on the total amount due."

Super. 513 (1974\\) (citing Blackstone)\n* \"The common law rule for computing age is that one is deemed to have reached a given age at the earliest moment of the day preceding an anniversary of birth.\" Fisher v. Smith, 319 F. Supp. 855 (D. Wash. 1970\\)\n* \"The appellant did, then, reach the age of nineteen years on the day before the nineteenth anniversary of his birth\" Turnbull v. Bonkowski, 419 F.2d 104 (D. Alaska 1969\\)\n\nThis is codified in some statutes and regulations. For example, [CFR 404\\.102](https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/cfr20/404/404-0102.htm):\n\n> For the purpose of this subpart \\[...] You reach a particular age on the day before your birthday. For example, if your sixty\\-second birthday is on July 1, 1979, you became age 62 on June 30, 1979\\.\n\nIn Virginia, the [Attorney General has confirmed](https://www.abc.virginia.gov/licenses/retail-resources/preventing-underage-sales) that the common law rule is in effect:\n\n> a person attains his/her next year of age on the day prior to his/her birthday\n\nIn your example, barring a modification by state law, or an idiosyncratic treatment under a particular statute, the person would be deemed 18 years of age at the earliest moment of December 31, 2017\\.\n\n---\n\nFor a bit of comparative law, contrast with the treatment in British Columbia:\n\n> A person reaches a particular age expressed in years at the start of the relevant anniversary of his or her date of birth.

This rule is supported by multiple legal cases and codified in some statutes and regulations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes John turns 18 at the beginning of his birthday, which is not the case under common law.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it assumes John turns 18 at the exact time of his birth on his 18th birthday, which is not how age is legally calculated.\n\nOption C is close but not precise enough. While it's the correct date, it's not the earliest moment of that day.\n\nOption D is correct because it represents the earliest moment of the day preceding John's 18th birthday, which is when he legally turns 18 under US common law.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the common law rule for age calculation in the US, as well as the ability to apply this rule to a specific scenario."

He said if someone is speeding, ran a red light, made a wrong turn etc. those are reasons to pull someone over and THEN if it comes up that you don\u2019t have insurance or they can\u2019t find it I'm their system, that's when they can add that on as no proof of insurance. But he said simply pulling someone over because he doesn\u2019t see insurance is an illegal stop.\n\nWas that a legal stop? Then he asked for drivers license and proof of insurance. The car was not mine so I told him I didn\u2019t have proof of insurance and I didn\u2019t have my license on me. So he gave me a pen and pad to write down the name. I write down my sisters name assuming because it's her car he\u2019d be able to find it's registered to her and he'd find the insurance I didn't know it was my first time ever ever stopped. Another office came and he asked for MY name in specific so I gave it to him and he said is that the same name you gave to the other officer I said no I gave home my sisters name because that's who's car this is.\n\nIn the end the original cop told me to step out, he searched the car (didn't find anything) and then arrested me for failure to ID and false information.\n\nShould I have been taken to jail if I didn\u2019t intentionally give him a wrong name? I told him I didn't intentionally give him a wrong name and in the end he still had my full name, address and date of birth.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The legality of the stop may be somewhat up in the air, but it would seem that the vehicle is not in the Texassure database, so it is reasonable to think that the person driving is not insured, and therefore is breaking the law. And that is all that is required: that the suspicion is reasonable. Until someone makes a sufficiently persuasive legal stink about this, it is probably a legal stop. [This article](http://allentexascriminallaw.com/2014/11/can-an-officer-stop-me-for-no-insurance/) gives some legal discussion. One applicable case is [US v. Broca\\-Martinez](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca5/16-40817/16-40817-2017-04-28.html), a Texas case where a person was pulled over for being \"unconfirmed\" w.r.t. the insurance database: the court held that this was a reasonable suspicion.\n\nThereafter, a charitable interpretation is that you misunderstood the request in providing your sister's information when he asked for your license and insurance: but you are expected to understand that when they request your license and proofs of insurance, they mean you the driver, and not the car owner. That they is even more suspicious, although I understand your confusion. At your hearing you cane explain why you didn't comply with the first officer's request, and the judge may they chalk this up to a simple misunderstanding rather than intentional deception. The problem is that you are expected to know \u2013 whether or not you've ever been pulled over before \u2013 that you have to provide license, registration, and proof of insurance. You will have a hard time making it believable that you didn't understand what the officer told you and what the law requires.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a traffic stop where an officer pulls over a vehicle due to inability to find insurance information in the database, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of the stop and the driver's responsibilities?\n\nA) The stop is illegal, and the driver is not required to provide any information to the officer.\n\nB) The stop is legal, but the driver only needs to provide the vehicle owner's information, not their own.\n\nC) The stop is potentially legal based on reasonable suspicion, and the driver must provide their own license and insurance information, not the vehicle owner's.\n\nD) The stop is always legal, regardless of the circumstances, and the driver must submit to a vehicle search.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, while the legality of stops based solely on lack of insurance information in the database may be debatable, cases like US v. Broca-Martinez have upheld such stops as reasonable suspicion. The driver is expected to understand that when asked for license and insurance, they must provide their own information, not the vehicle owner's. The correct response is to provide the driver's license and explain the insurance situation, not to give false or misleading information. Option C accurately reflects this legal understanding and the driver's responsibilities during such a stop."

Pelosi](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59673930/bravo-v-pelosi/) is the latest attempt to overturn the 2020 US Presidential and Congressional elections. The plaintiffs are suing everyone they think is even remotely related to the election, and a number of those defendants haven't responded to the summons.\n\nNormally, if a defendant fails to respond to a summons, the plaintiff can get a default judgement and the requested relief is granted. However, in this case, the core of that relief is:\n\n* Permanent injunctive relief in the form of a new federal election for Congress, President, and Vice President;\n* Permanent injunctive relief forever restraining Defendants from ever holding public office or participating in any way in an election campaign to public office other than exercising their own right to vote;\n* Permanent injunctive relief forever restraining Defendants from violating Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights described herein,\n\nMost of it looks like it's either outside the power of the court to grant, outside the power of the defendants to provide, or both. How would the court proceed in this case?\n\n(If it matters, ignore the fact that a few of the 643 defendants have responded, some haven't yet been served, and others don't yet need to respond. The case itself is a royal mess.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A federal court may dismiss a complaint *sua sponte* (i.e. without a request to do so from a party) if it is beyond its subject matter jurisdiction (a category of defenses including lack of standing) or fails to state a claim for relief on its face.\n\nA [Motion to Dismiss filed in the case](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1123851/gov.uscourts.txwd.1123851.113.0.pdf) provides a roadmap for the judge to dismiss the entire case. It argues in essence:\n\n* A Texas federal court can't assert jurisdiction over Georgia defendants.\n* A federal court can't entertain claims against state officials in their official capacities for the kind of relief requested.\n* The plaintiffs lack standing to sue.\n\nSubject matter jurisdiction defenses (and lack of personal jurisdiction defenses) are also not barred from being raised later in a motion to vacate the judgment, by a default judgment.\n\nThe Texas federal court can also sanction parties for filing frivolous claims by, for example, awarding all of the costs and attorney fees incurred by the defendants against the party bringing the suit in a motion requesting that relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 against the parties and/or their attorney.\n\nI would not be surprised if the Plaintiffs' attorney in this case, Paul M. Davis, was disbarred and bankrupted by it.\n\nClass action lawsuits can't proceed as such until certified by the court.\n\nFurthermore, a summons has to be personally hand delivered with a complaint to be served in a way that is sufficient to result in an entry of a default judgment, even if the complaint is otherwise valid. This is unlikely to have occurred in all 600\\+ cases.\n\nThere are several instances in which a \"clerk's default\" has been entered, but that simply indicates that a return of service (even if facially defective) was filed by the Plaintiff and that the number of days set forth in the summons for a response has lapsed. In contrast, prior to entering a default judgment, which must be done by a judge, the judge must review the complaint to determine if the court has jurisdiction over the case and if a valid legal claim is stated in the complaint.",

Pelosi, where the plaintiffs are suing over 600 defendants to overturn the 2020 US Presidential and Congressional elections, many defendants haven't responded to the summons. What is the most likely outcome if the plaintiffs seek default judgments against these non-responding defendants?\n\nA) The court will automatically grant all the relief requested by the plaintiffs, including a new federal election and barring defendants from holding public office.\n\nB) The court will dismiss the case sua sponte due to lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a valid claim, even without motions from the defendants.\n\nC) The court will enter default judgments against all non-responding defendants, but only for monetary damages.\n\nD) The court will wait for all 600+ defendants to be properly served before making any decision on default judgments.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Even if defendants fail to respond, the court has the authority to dismiss the case sua sponte (on its own) if it lacks subject matter jurisdiction or if the complaint fails to state a valid claim for relief. In this case, the requested relief is largely beyond the court's power to grant or the defendants' ability to provide. The court would likely recognize these issues and dismiss the case, even without motions from the defendants. Additionally, the court must review the complaint for jurisdiction and valid legal claims before entering any default judgments, making options A and C incorrect. Option D is impractical given the large number of defendants and doesn't address the fundamental issues with the case."

That means you need to have the same speed as the cars\"\n\nThinking that he was just mocking the law, I refused to hand him the ID. He could not articulate any reasonable suspicion. He then took me to jail for obstructing an investigation (where the cops stole/took some of my most treasued memories from my bag because they found some Tylenol and Ibuprofen \nin the same jar) and the next day I posted bail (about $300 in full, cash) I was notified that I had to come back to Oklahoma for a court appearance. Seing that things get more complicated I decided to just pay them to get them off my back, go home and never return to that state. They would not accept my payment as it had been decided I had to come back. I came back, full of hope that the judge would listen and dismiss the case as it was based on a lie. Instead, he said that if I wanted to plead not guilty, I'd have to come back for a new court date to argue my case. At this point I found myself back at square one, so I decided I'd pay them and get it over with (with a \"no contest plea\") as the trips back and forth to OK would have cost me more that the ticket. \n\nLater in the hallway I told the judge the cop's reasoning and his reply was: \"He may have been wrong on the bicycle law, but you still should have handed him your ID\" \n\nNeedless to say, I have not taken my bike on any trips ever since.\n\nNow after 4 years I still can't get it off my mind and it's consuming me thinking that I was fooled into believing that the rule of law was the norm in this country (not the jungle law) and the beautiful constitution we have is not there just to look pretty, but something we can rely on. \n\nMy questions are:  \n\n1 \\- Is making up a law on the spot an acceptable alternative to the requirement that the cops have to have a reasonable suspicion in order to detain a civilian?  \n\nRemember, \"*Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere*\"  \n\n2 \\- Was the cop right? Does anyone know of a \"minimum speed limit\" on US hwy 60 ?

But, we also live in a very complex society and the exact content of the law will always be the subject of fierce dispute.\n\nThe solution is, pretty much, to lower your expectations. The vast majority of the time the law works. Your beliefs about exactly how far you are allowed to disobey an order from a law enforcement officer as a matter of practical reality, were miscalibrated. But, you did get out of jail the next day and the punishment you received was very survivable. In much of the world, this wouldn't be true.\n\nThe rule of law doesn't mean that everyone perfectly obeys the law. It means that when the law is seriously broken in a manner that has big consequences that there is usually a way to legally mitigate the harm or to obtain a remedy.\n\nPushing the limits of the freedoms the law gives you is rarely wise. But, that is no reason to refuse to live your life. It is one thing to learn from experience.

The response emphasizes that while the rule of law is a powerful norm, it exists within a complex society where the exact content of laws can be disputed. It suggests that the rule of law provides mechanisms for addressing serious breaches, but doesn't guarantee perfect application in every interaction. This aligns with the advice to \"lower your expectations\" and recognize that while the system generally works, individual experiences may vary. Options A and B represent overly idealistic views not supported by the text, while D is too pessimistic based on a single incident, contrary to the answer's guidance about not overlearning from one experience."

But a generic answer applicable nationwide would be welcome (if possible).\n\n---\n\n**My Expectations**\n\nI've been working through my first small claims case, and am surprised by how inaccessible the process is, complicated by the lack of direct information online and surprisingly unhelpful attitude of the court staff. When making this claim I had a naive expectation of the process as follows:\n\nA) Fill out a form online or in\\-person to sue the defendant, and be contacted to schedule a court date after turning that in.\n\nB) Arrive at court and win or lose the case.\n\nC) Have my winnings collected by the court and sent to me.\n\nC\\-alt) Receive a letter that it was appealed which includes a new court date.\n\nReturn to \\[B] for next level court...\n\n---\n\n**Reality**\n\nHowever, by following the advice provided by the few helpful members of the court staff I could find, I have instead followed this process:\n\n1\\) Fill out a form in person to file my small claims case with my local magistrate, which I understand is the first level court (similar to step \\[A]).\n\n2\\) Wait and receive a court date via mail (similar to step \\[A]).\n\n3\\) Call just before the date to see if the defendant declared an 'intent to defend' (I think it was called). When they didn't I did not need to show for court and received a 'default judgement'; in short I won (similar to step B above; and here's where it really diverges)\n\n4\\) Wait 30 days (the appeals period), and then I need to take action and contact the court get a notice of judgement (I think it was called) (part of \\[C]).\n\n5\\) Then I was told to go to the prothonotary (new word for me) and get a certification of judgement on file. Then I should take a copy of that an hour away to file it with the courthouse in the defendants county. My understanding that this doesn't actually do anything to help me collect my money; it's just part of the process (part of \\[C]).\n\n6\\) Then I need to get a writ of execution, which I believe is a court order for the defendant to pay me? I think this is supposed to help me collect my judgement, but I don't know what to do with that as I never made it to this stage (part of \\[C]).\n\n4\\-alt) Receive a notice of appeal from the county court (I guess this is the next level court, so part of \\[C\\-alt]). Something about a 'praecipe (another new word for me) to enter rule to file complaint and rule to file'. The defendant appealed so I followed this path.\n\n5\\-alt) Drive to the county prothonotary and file another form. There is no title but it appears to be a brand new complaint (part of \\[C\\-alt]?).\n\n6\\-alt) After giving that new form to the court, I was instructed to take a copy home and mail it to the defendant's address. I don't know why the court didn't do this (part of \\[C\\-alt]?).\n\n7\\-alt) Unknown. I was told to take the next step (whatever that is) after they respond, which apparently comes directly to me. It was not made clear what I should do if they don't respond or how long I need to give them to respond. \n I am now stuck at this step (I have no idea if this is part of \\[C\\-alt] or if I've now completely diverged from my initial expectations).\n\n---\n\n**Explaination**\n\nAlthough it's been explained to me that I need to complete these steps, I don't actually understand what I'm doing when I do them. It's like telling a child to fill a pot with water, then put it on the stove, then turn on the stove, and so on without explaining that the purpose is to make spaghetti or explaining why and how the noodles get cooked. This is especially true at steps 4 through 6 and 4\\-alt through 7\\-alt and beyond for me.\n\nIt would be helpful to me, and probably many others, if I could understand what each of these actions/forms/steps represented and meant and why I'm doing them. I'm leery of following a series of steps I know nothing about, and would rather not have this lack of understanding prevent me from being able to seek justice in the future. And given the limits of small claims cases and low dollar values of many of the injustices us commoners face on a daily basis, in contrast to the high price of law advice, speaking with a lawyer would cost more than a win would provide and is thus an impractical option.\n\nA synopsis of the administrative steps taken as part of a small claims case would provide a lot of clarity and a solid foundation to launch from.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The process of collecting a judgment once you win one is really no different in small claims court than it is in any other court, and as you note, it isn't easy. You may decide that once you have won, that it is easier to turn the judgment over to a collection agency or an attorney to collect (admittedly at a price). \n\nOften, garnishment of wages and bank accounts is the easiest way to collect, although placing a judgment lien on their real property (which you probably did in step 5\\) works too if you are willing to wait until the property is sold.\n\nOf course, once there is an appeal, you are basically back to square zero and have to establish that the default judgment is valid and that they have no shown valid grounds for setting it aside (which they probably haven't), by following the proper appellate process.\n\nMany court houses and public libraries have books on the small claims process and on enforcing judgments (with books on the latter often entitled \"creditor's rights\").",

Then, you need to take action and contact the court to get a notice of judgment (step 4). This waiting period is crucial as it allows time for the defendant to potentially appeal the decision. Rushing to collect immediately after the judgment or expecting the court to automatically collect for you are not accurate representations of the process. Similarly, going directly to garnish wages would be premature at this stage and likely not legally permissible without further court orders."

Probably Channel 4, UK). The UK doctrine is more limited than the US fair use doctrine. [\u00a730 of the UK law](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/30) seems to be what is relevant: usage requires \"sufficient acknowledgement\". It is not clear whether [\u00a733](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/part/I/chapter/III/crossheading/education) on educational use is relevant (is this \"non\\-commercial\"; is this \"instruction\").\n\nSufficient acknowledgment relates to moral rights, covered in Ch. 4 of the law. \u00a72 says that moral rights\n\n> subsist in favour of the author, director or commissioner of the work,\n>  whether or not he is the owner of the copyright\n\nand [\u00a777](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/77) articulates this right to be identified as author or director. In that respect, to comply with the acknowledgement requirement, you would not acknowledge your local source (Netflix) or Channel 4\\. But the owner of moral rights must assert them per [\u00a7 78](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/section/78). You need to carefully read this chapter because there is also a moral right to not be falsely held to be an author, and a right to object to derogatory treatment.\n\nAs for whose law you have to care about, the possibilities are broad, because a work is probably protected under the laws of many nations. I might sue you under US law because my work is protected by US copyright law and that is convenient for me, but I might also sue you under UK law or Swedish law, depending on where you live or where you infringed copyright (took the screen shot; created the slide; displayed the slide; hosted the video).",

The question of jurisdiction is complex, as copyright laws of multiple countries could apply depending on various factors.\n2. Both US fair use and UK fair dealing doctrines are relevant, as it's unclear which law would apply.\n3.

Before\n> that Act came into full effect in 1875 it was necessary for a litigant\n> to decide whether her claim related to common law or to equity. To\n> select the wrong jurisdiction would mean that the claim would be\n> thrown out and sent to the other court. So, if a claim for an\n> equitable remedy were brought before a common law court, that common\n> law court would dismiss the claim and the claimant would be required\n> to go to the Court of Equity instead. This problem was explained in\n> Charles Dickens\u2019s Bleak House in the following way:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Equity sends questions to Law, Law sends questions back to Equity; Law finds it can\u2019t do this, Equity finds it can\u2019t do that; neither can\n> > so much as say it can\u2019t do anything, without this solicitor\n> > instructing and this counsel appearing.\n> \n> \n> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 So it was that the litigant trudged\n> disconsolately between the various courts seeking someone who could\n> deliver judgment on her claim. Judges like Lord Eldon and Lord\n> Cottenham were well\\-known for the delays in reaching their judgments\n> which could take several years. This was a part of the \u2018groping and\n> floundering condition\u2019 which Dickens observed in the High Court of\n> Chancery. It should also be recalled, as outlined above, that Lord\n> Macclesfield was convicted of embezzlement while acting as Lord\n> Chancellor and Lord Bacon was also found to have accepted \u2018presents\u2019\n> (which today we would consider to be bribes) in office. 74\n> Consequently, the reputation of the chancery courts was very low by\n> the late 19th century. The popular conception of equity \u2013 and one\n> which accords with the reality \u2013 was that the chancery courts were\n> expensive and caused extraordinary delays.  \n> \n> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 By 1873 pressure had built for reform, and Dickens played an important\n> part in that.75 This led to the enactment of the Judicature Act 1873\\.\n> There were two particular objectives: one to fuse equity and common\n> law, and the second to reorganise the courts. The fusion of common law\n> and equity took the shape of permitting any court to award common law\n> remedies or equitable remedies without the need to petition one\n> particular court or another. 76 Instead proceedings were simply begun\n> in the High Court, which was divided into the divisions we recognise\n> today. Lord Watson explained that the purpose of the Judicature Act as\n> being \u2018to enable the parties to a suit to obtain in that suit and\n> without the necessity of resorting to another court, all remedies to\n> which they are entitled in respect of any legal or equitable claim or\n> defence properly advanced by them, so as to avoid a multiplicity of\n> legal proceedings\u2019.77  \n> \n> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The result of the Judicature Act 1873 was that the practical distinction between common\n> law and equity disappeared. However, it is vitally important to\n> understand that the intellectual distinction remains. Significantly s\n> 25 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 provided:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Generally, in all matters not hereinbefore particularly mentioned in which there is any conflict or variance between the rules of equity\n> > and the rules of common law with reference to the same matter, the\n> > rules of equity shall prevail.\n> \n> \n> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Thus the principles of equity prevail over the\n> principles of common law. The decision in the Earl of Oxford\u2019s Case\n> thus received a statutory form. So, in cases like Walsh v Lonsdale78\n> where there was a clash between a failure to comply with a common law\n> rule as to the proper creation of a lease (which would have held the\n> lease to be unenforceable) and the equitable doctrine of specific\n> performance of contracts, it was held that the equitable principle of\n> specific performance would give effect to the agreement to provide a\n> lease.  \n> \n> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The passage of this legislation was not\n> without its own perturbations.

However, it preserved the intellectual distinction between the two systems. Importantly, Section 25 of the Act stipulated that in cases of conflict between equity and common law rules, the rules of equity shall prevail. This reform addressed the previous issues of litigants having to choose the correct court for their claims and the delays associated with the separate systems, while maintaining the unique principles and remedies associated with each legal tradition."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Does the popular media cliche **Stop, in the name of the law** have any founding in actual law or policing practice, either current or historical? Did police ever say this as a matter of course? If so why? If not where did this expression enter the popular consciousness?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In long ago English practice, the phrase used was \"**Stop in the name of the King**\". At one time this was, if I am not mistaken, required for a valid arrest. I am talking about a time hundreds of years ago, by the way.\n\nThat phrase, in turn, goes back to a still older concept. At one time, in Germanic customary law, each important leader had a \"peace\" \\-\\- an area in and around his dwelling, domain, and presence \\-\\- in which any violation of law and custom was an offense against the leader, not just against a victim. Inside his \"peace\" a leader was allowed to enforce rules without any complaint from a victim. Later the peace of all lesser leaders was subsumed in the Kings Peace, which came to cover the entire kingdom, the area of the king's authority and rule. This concept came over with the Normans, although a version of it had come over with the Anglo\\-Saxons centuries before.\n\nThat is why indictments in England (later England and Wales) long included such language as \"... That on or about {date} the said {accused} did, **against the peace of our Lord the King, his crown and dignity**, commit {offense} by {details}...\"\n\nI will need to do some searching to find the exact citations to support this, although Charles Rembar's *The Law of the Land* includes the part about the king's peace.\n\nSpecifically, in a footnote on page 192 of my (trade paper) edition (and at location 3345 0f my kindel edition) Rembar writes:\n\n> The concept of a \u201cpeace\u201d that is a ruler\u2019s right goes back to Germanic law. It belonged not only to a king but to each leader in the social structure. Every ruler, naturally enough, wanted order in his group, as do modern governments. The difference is that freedom from disturbance was considered the chieftain\u2019s personal privilege, and disorder among those he led was a personal affront. With the strengthening of central rule, the king\u2019s peace overrode all others.\n\nI will need to search further to learn just when the phrase \"in the name of the law\" became common, and when either phrase ceased to be legally required. I believe that the phrase persisted in common use long after it was no longer legally required, but I will need citations for that also. I will update this answer with all of that when I can.",

This concept held that each important leader had a \"peace\" - an area of authority where any violation was considered an offense against the leader. Over time, the peace of lesser leaders was subsumed into the King's Peace, covering the entire kingdom. This concept was brought to England by the Normans and influenced legal language, as seen in the traditional phrasing of indictments that referenced acts against \"the peace of our Lord the King, his crown and dignity.\" The modern phrase \"in the name of the law\" likely developed as a secular evolution of this concept, replacing the reference to the king with a reference to the law itself."

For example, the impoverished (and war\\-torn) Ukraine has about 120 such channels with IPTV streams accessible to the anonymous public.\n\nThe viewing experience, however, is often subpar \\-\\- because of the Internet latency and other connectivity problems. So one could offer a useful service by continuously recording such broadcasts (keeping, say 1\\-2 weeks worth) and allowing people to access the (unaltered) recordings from *his* servers, which could be located closer to the particular viewer and have better bandwidth.\n\nWould such a thing be legal, or will one need to obtain and maintain tedious *prior approvals* from each channel?\n\nNote, I'm not talking about \"premium\" channels \\-\\- which wish to be paid for content and aren't available as IPTV (without encryption) anyway. Only the ones, that are already available for free to anyone, who lives close enough for their signal to arrive on his antenna, or has a decent Internet link to their server.\n\nNote also, that I'd be perfectly willing to stop recording and \"rebroadcasting\" a channel, that decides to ask me to stop *going forward*. But I'm worried about suddenly becoming liable for *retroactive* damages...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [*ABC v Aereo*](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-461_l537.pdf) 573 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2014\\), the US Supreme Court held that activity almost identical to what you describe is copyright infringement.\n\n> Respondent Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air. When a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a menu on Aereo\u2019s website. Aereo\u2019s system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna, which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet. A server saves the data in a subscriber\\-specific folder on Aereo\u2019s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber\u2019s screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over\\-the\\-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.\n> \n> \n> We must decide whether respondent Aereo, Inc., infringes \\[copyright] by selling its subscribers a technologically complex service that allows them to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air. We conclude that it does.\n\nA nicer summary, oral argument transcript and audio are available from the [Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/13-461).\n\nIn my opinion, your example is more clearly an infringement of copyright than Aereo's. Aereo dedicated separate antennae to receive a signals for each subscriber at the subscriber's direction, and rebroadcast the signal over the internet in near real\\-time. This let them argue two things: 1\\) that they were not *performing* the work, only letting other people perform it, and 2\\) that the performance was not \"to the public\". In your example, the server is receiving and saving the broadcast, and then later, that single copy is being reproduced and transmitted to whomever requests it. That would certainly be considered both reproduction and performance to the public.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in ABC v. Aereo, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered copyright infringement?\n\nA) A service that allows users to connect their own personal antennas to a central server, which then streams the received content to the user's devices in real-time.\n\nB) A platform that records freely available IPTV broadcasts and stores them for 1-2 weeks, allowing users to access these recordings from servers closer to their location for improved viewing experience.\n\nC) A system that uses a single antenna to capture over-the-air broadcasts and immediately streams them to multiple subscribers without recording.\n\nD) A service that provides users with individual remote antennas, allowing them to access and control their own antenna to watch live TV broadcasts over the internet.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B most closely resembles the scenario described in the question and is most likely to be considered copyright infringement based on the ABC v. Aereo ruling. The Supreme Court found that Aereo's service, which involved capturing and retransmitting broadcasts, constituted copyright infringement. The scenario in B goes even further by recording and storing content for later distribution, which more clearly involves reproduction and public performance of copyrighted material.\n\nOption A is similar to Aereo's model but with user-owned antennas, which might offer a slightly stronger argument against infringement, though it could still be challenged.\n\nOption C, while problematic, doesn't involve recording and might be viewed slightly differently in terms of reproduction rights.\n\nOption D is very close to Aereo's actual model, which was found to be infringing, but it doesn't involve the additional step of recording and storing content for later distribution."

The mortgage is for \u00a3300,000, which is equivalent to $300,000 at the time of purchase. However by the time the house is sold, 20 years later, the house is worth \u00a3900,000 and is equivalent to $1,200,000\\. The owner must now calculate exactly how much money he earned \\- taking into account the GBP/USD exchange rate every time there was a mortgage payment. This would require many dozens or possibly hundreds of hours to do, at massive cost (if performed by a tax professional). \n\nIn the example above, should the owner not properly follow these rules, and perhaps just make some rough estimate, could he be held criminally responsible for filing an incorrect tax return? \n\n**Or** does there exist some kind of defense that complying with the law would simply have been completely unreasonable or impractical?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sometimes laws contain exceptions when they are \"unreasonably\" burdensome. For example the US \"Americans with Disabilities Act\" does not require providing wheelchair access when this would require tearing down a building, or even major structural changes, and only requires that employers provide \"reasonable\" accommodations.\n\nBut the clerical cost of compliance is not usually a reason for an exception.\n\nIn the case in the question, since the owner does not actually make a profit until the house is sold. it might be sufficient to compute the profit in local currency, and then apply the conversion factor once to the total profit. But even if a separate conversion had to be applied to each separate payment, that is exactly the kind of thing that an app or computer program could do quickly and easily.

The statute grants authority to HHS to interpret the law and create regulatory provisions related to how these records are disclosed. This is codified in 42 CFR Part II. The statute itself establishes a penalty for violations:\n\n42 USC 290\\-dd2(f) Penalties:\n\nAny person who violates any provision of this section or any regulation issued pursuant to this section shall be fined in accordance with title 18\\.\n\nIt is reiterated in the regulations, furthermore being labeled as \"criminal\"\n\n42 CFR 2\\.63: Criminal Penalty for Violations\n\nUnder 42 U.S.C. 290dd\\-2(f), any person who violates any provision of this section or any regulation issued pursuant to this section shall be fined in accordance with Title 18 of the U.S. Code. \\[See also 2\\.62(b)(3\\) \\-\\- because penalty is criminal the regulations should be strictly construed in favor of defendant]\n\nHere is my question.

The proceeding may include an examination by the judge of the patient records referred to in the application. \n\nIf a judge held a hearing to discuss issuing an order for disclosure and did so in an extremely public fashion and in a manner that didn't conform to the above regulation would they be criminally liable under the above statute?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A judge cannot be held liable for acts conducted as a judge, barring fraud or malfeasance.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A federal judge, during a hearing to discuss issuing an order for disclosure of substance abuse treatment records protected under 42 USC 290-dd2, conducts the hearing in an open courtroom without taking measures to protect patient identifying information. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential consequences for the judge?\n\nA) The judge could be criminally fined under 42 USC 290-dd2(f) for violating the confidentiality requirements.\n\nB) The judge has absolute immunity and cannot face any legal consequences for this action.\n\nC) The judge could face administrative sanctions from the judicial ethics committee but not criminal penalties.\n\nD) The judge could only be held liable if there's evidence of fraud or intentional misconduct in conducting the hearing.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Judges generally have judicial immunity for actions taken in their official capacity. This immunity protects them from civil liability and criminal prosecution for their judicial acts, even if those acts were in error or exceeded their authority. However, this immunity is not absolute. In rare cases where a judge acts with clear absence of jurisdiction or engages in non-judicial acts, they may be held liable. \n\nOption A is incorrect because judges are typically immune from criminal liability for their judicial decisions, even if they violate specific statutes or regulations.\n\nOption B is too broad, as judicial immunity is strong but not absolute in all circumstances.\n\nOption C is partially correct in that the judge might face administrative consequences, but it doesn't account for the possibility of liability in cases of intentional misconduct.\n\nOption D is the most accurate. While judges have broad immunity, they can potentially be held liable in extreme cases involving fraud, corruption, or intentional misconduct that clearly falls outside their judicial role. This aligns with the principle that judicial immunity protects judges acting in their judicial capacity, but not in cases of clear and intentional abuse of that authority."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: One of the most famous images from the end of World War II was of a sailor kissing someone who looked like a nurse in Times Square, celebrating the victory. \n\nAs described in a [featured article](https://www.usni.org/magazines/naval-history-magazine/2012/july/story-behind-famous-kiss) in Naval History Magazine, based on a book\\-length version, notes that \"The two participants in the world\u2019s most famous kiss didn\u2019t even know each other, nor was their photograph staged.\" \n\nHe was drunk, and the photographer thought he'd done something similar with another woman before the picture (neither of whom were his new girlfriend, several steps behind).\n\n> The liquor running through his veins transfixed his glassy stare. ...He focused on Greta, the \u201cnurse.\u201d She remained unaware of his advance. That served his purpose well. He sought no permission for what he was about to do. ...With background noises barely registering, he rushed toward her as if in a vacuum.\n> \n> \n> Though George halted his steps just before running into Greta, his upper torso\u2019s momentum swept over her. The motion\u2019s force bent Greta backward and to her right. As he overtook Greta\u2019s slender frame, his right hand cupped her slim waist. He pulled her inward toward his lean and muscular body. Her initial attempt to physically separate her person from the intruder proved a futile exertion against the dark\\-uniformed man\u2019s strong hold. With her right arm pinned between their two bodies, she instinctively brought her left arm and clenched fist upward in defense. The effort was unnecessary. He never intended to hurt her.\n> \n> \n> As their lips locked, his left arm supported her neck. His left hand, turned backward and away from her face, offered the singular gesture of restraint, caution or doubt. The struck pose created an oddly appealing mixture of brutish force, caring embrace, and awkward hesitation. He didn\u2019t let go. As he continued to lean forward, she lowered her right arm and gave over to her pursuer\u2014but only for three or four seconds. He tried to hold her closer, wanting the moment to last longer. And longer still. But they parted...He just had to kiss her. He didn\u2019t know why.\n\nThe photo was taken August 14, 1945\\. Though the participants didn't learn of it until 1980, this was \"*Life magazine\u2019s most reproduced photograph, and one of history\u2019s most popular.*\" It very likely came to the attention of people who happened to be in the law enforcement system.\n\nThe sailor later died at age 95, having not faced negative consequences, and even sued the magazine seeking stronger recognition for being the guy in the photo. The woman has also passed away.\n\nThe question here is, does that photograph depict sexual assault? Why or why not? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In 1945?\n--------\n\nNot a chance. Basically, the only sexual crime that existed then was rape.\n\nIn 2019?\n--------\n\nIn New York, it appears the answer is still no.\n\nAll sexual crimes require \u201c[sexual contact](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-130-00.html)\u201d:\n\n> 3\\.\u2003\u201cSexual contact\u201d means any touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person for the purpose of gratifying sexual desire of either party. \u2002It includes the touching of the actor by the victim, as well as the touching of the victim by the actor, whether directly or through clothing, as well as the emission of ejaculate by the actor upon any part of the victim, clothed or unclothed.\n\nWhile lips may be considered \u201cintimate parts\u201d, there would appear to be no intention \u201cof gratifying sexual desire\u201d.",

According to the legal analysis provided, the kiss depicted in the photograph would not be considered sexual assault under New York law, even by today's standards. The key reason is that sexual crimes in New York require \"sexual contact\" with the intent of gratifying sexual desire.

Option D is incorrect because the analysis suggests the act wouldn't be classified as sexual assault today, regardless of when it occurred."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer disputes inaccurate information on their credit report with a Credit Reporting Agency (CRA). After the CRA's investigation, the consumer sues the creditor for violating 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b)(1)(A) but loses the case. The consumer then disputes the inaccuracy again with new information, leading to a reinvestigation by the CRA. What is the likely outcome if the consumer attempts to sue the creditor again for the same violation?\n\nA) The consumer can proceed with the second lawsuit and has a high chance of winning due to the new information provided.\nB) The consumer can file the second lawsuit, but the court will dismiss it based on the principle of res judicata.\nC) The consumer can only sue the CRA for failing to conduct a proper reinvestigation, not the creditor.\nD) The consumer must wait for a specified period before filing another lawsuit against the creditor for the same violation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The principle of res judicata prevents the consumer from filing a second lawsuit against the creditor for the same violation, even if new information is provided. Res judicata applies when there are the same parties, same facts, and same legislation involved. The court's previous decision on the \"reasonable investigation\" is considered final and not subject to reexamination. This concept, known as issue estoppel, would likely result in the dismissal of the second lawsuit. Option A is incorrect because the new information doesn't override res judicata. Option C is incorrect because the question focuses on suing the creditor, not the CRA. Option D is incorrect because there is no specified waiting period that would allow refiling the same claim against the same party."

I wonder how many of these were criminal charges against Mr. Trump *personally* (as opposed to his business entities), and how many among them resulted in arraignment?\n\nI came across this *Huffpost* blog article written before the 2016 election: [*Trump's Criminal History Should Be Front and Center*](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trumps-criminal-history-s_b_11983400). Although on quick reading it seems most of these charges were against Trump's business / non\\-profit entities, might there be among them criminal charges filed against him *personally*? There is also a CREW report [listing 56 \"credible\" criminal offenses](https://www.citizensforethics.org/reports-investigations/crew-reports/president-trumps-staggering-record-of-uncharged-crimes/) since Trump launched his campaign in 2015\\.\n\nMy question is:\n\n* If there *were* criminal charges against him personally but zero (0\\) arraignment, then these 2 arraignments ([with a few in the works](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacheverson/article/tracking-trump-investigations-and-lawsuits/?sh=67fd256272fc)) will be new territory for him. It's a testament to his lawyers that he could have those previous cases settled / dismissed. It would be nice if the answer can list them.\n* If he has been arraigned before, what were the charges and when?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Arraignments are only used for criminal matters. While Trump has been involved in many lawsuits, as have his businesses, only one prior case to his Presidency was criminal or quasi\\-criminal and might have involved an arraignment (although not necessarily):\n\n> In 2006, the Town of Palm Beach began fining Trump $250 per day for\n> ordinance violations related to his erection of an 80\\-foot\\-tall (24 m)\n> flagpole flying a 15\\-by\\-25\\-foot (4\\.6 by 7\\.6 m) American flag on his\n> property. Trump sued the town for $25 million, saying that they\n> abridged his free speech, also disputing an ordinance that local\n> businesses be \"town\\-serving\". The two parties settled as part of a\n> court\\-ordered mediation, in which Trump was required to donate\n> $100,000 to veterans' charities. At the same time, the town ordinance\n> was modified allowing Trump to enroll out\\-of\\-town members in his\n> Mar\\-a\\-Lago social club.\n\nSome municipal ordinance violations are treated procedurally like traffic tickets, and some are treated more like misdemeanor criminal offenses (which do generally involve arraignments).\n\nAfter his Presidency, one of his business entities [was convicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_and_business_legal_affairs_of_Donald_Trump) of rare criminal charges against an organization:\n\n> On December 6, 2022, Trump's company The Trump Organization was\n> convicted on 17 criminal charges.\n\nLawsuits do not give rise to arraignments. This isn't part of the civil lawsuit process.\n\nIt is estimated that [70 to 100 million Americans](https://www.sentencingproject.org/app/uploads/2022/08/Americans-with-Criminal-Records-Poverty-and-Opportunity-Profile.pdf) have criminal records because they have been convicted of at least one criminal offense. This is about one in three or one in four American adults. The number of Americans who have even been arraigned for a crime, in a case that is not currently pending, who have never been convicted of a crime, is probably on the order of 1 million to 10 million. Probably tens of millions of Americans who have never been arraigned, however, have been arrested but never charged with any crime, in addition to those who have been arraigned and not convicted with no charges pending, those who have been arraigned only in cases that are still pending, and those who have been convicted of crimes.\n\n**Lots Of Crimes That Are Committed Are Never Prosecuted**\n\n> There is also a CREW report listing 56 \"credible\" criminal offenses\n> since Trump launched his campaign in 2015\\.\n\nThese are cases in which there is there are credible allegations that Trump acted in ways that could have been the basis for committing a crime. But, CREW is not alleging that any of these circumstances (other than the 2022 Trump Organization conviction and the two felony cases upon which Trump has been arraigned in 2023\\) have resulted in any court action being taken to press criminal charges.\n\nIt is possible that Trump or one of his businesses was the subject of criminal investigations that did not result in charges being brought, but there is really no way to know that this is the case. And, there is nothing terribly dishonorable about being investigated for a crime but not ultimately charged with any criminal offense.\n\nBy analogy, if you are speeding, you are committing a traffic offense. The vast majority of the time, you are not ticketed for speeding even if a law enforcement office's radar gun tells the law enforcement officer that you were going slightly over the speed limit. Eventually, after the statute of limitations for traffic offenses (which is quite short) runs, you can't even be charged with those offenses.\n\nIn the same way, while unlawful sexual contact or sexual assault is a crime, if charges are not brought within the statute of limitations (something we know empirically to be quite common) then it doesn't result in criminal charges even though the offender committed a crime.\n\nLikewise, most civil fraud lawsuits allege conduct that could have been prosecuted as a crime if authorities sought to do so. But, in practice, criminal prosecutors with limited resources most often chose not to bring criminal fraud prosecutions in cases where a civil fraud lawsuit could bring complete relief to the party who was harmed by it.\n\n**Not All Illegal Conduct Is Criminal**\n\nMany kinds of conduct that can give rise to civil lawsuits cannot generally give rise to criminal charges at all. These include breaches of contract, negligently but unintentionally causing a personal injury, disagreeing over the interpretation of the tax laws in a way that cause the government to allege that you failed to pay the full amount of the taxes that you owe, employment discrimination, and many kinds of housing discrimination.\n\n**Big Businesses Are Usually Parties To Many Lawsuits**\n\nBusiness entities, large and small, are routinely involved in lots of civil lawsuits, sometimes as plaintiffs and sometimes as defendants, and the number of lawsuits is, more or less, usually roughly proportional to the economic scale of the enterprise.\n\nFor example, almost every landlord brings eviction and rent collection lawsuits from time to time, and sometimes is sued by tenants over security deposit issues and alleged defects in the maintenance of the rental property. Almost every significant property owner will sooner or later become involved in litigation over boundary discrepancies or easements or in eminent domain cases. Almost every developer will sooner or later be involved in construction defect and/or mechanic's lien litigation.\n\nAlmost every bank brings foreclosure lawsuits and collection lawsuits when loans are allegedly not paid as agreed or loan covenants are not met.\n\nAlmost every business with a great many employees with eventually be involved in some sort of lawsuit with an employee.\n\nA large business will typically litigate a significant tax dispute at least every few years.\n\nMost of the lawsuits filed in the United States are brought by banks alleging defaults on loans, landlords alleging unpaid rent, and governments collecting unpaid taxes.\n\nFor example, [in Colorado, in 2022](https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Administration/Planning_and_Analysis/Annual_Statistical_Reports/2022/FY2022%20Annual%20Report.pdf), there were 62,996 tax collection cases, 29,836 evictions, 1,971 simple mortgage foreclosures, 66,875 debt collection cases, and 306 personal property repossession cases, for a total of 161,984 civil lawsuits out of 199,293 civil lawsuits in the state (about 81%), the lion's share of which are brought by financial institution lenders, landlords, and government tax collectors.\n\nWhether 4,000 lawsuits over several decades is a lot or a little for a large business enterprise, or is just par for the course, really comes down to the nature of, and scope of, the businesses involved. The character of the allegations in the lawsuit, and whether the allegations are atypical of lawsuit involving large business enterprises, is really more telling than the number of lawsuits.",

There is only one mentioned instance of a potentially criminal or quasi-criminal case (the flagpole dispute in Palm Beach), which may or may not have involved an arraignment. The vast majority of cases involving Trump and his businesses were civil matters, which do not involve arraignments. There is no evidence presented of Trump being personally arraigned on criminal charges before his presidency, and certainly no indication of multiple convictions.

On the underside, I noticed there are stickers with Windows Vista and Windows 7 license keys listed, which I assume were there from the factory (I have one that was a new old stock in original packaging, so can confirm that is how they shipped from the factory).\n\nMany of the sellers sold these devices without any hard drive, so Windows was not present on them.\n\nI own the devices, but does that mean I also own these license keys now? Can I use this to legally download and install Windows 10 from Microsoft's Web site and install it on these devices?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming they are OEM licenses then yes they are tied to the machine (specifically the motherboard), so if you bought the machine you can install that licensed version of Windows on to the machine itself. (see [here](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/7433aced-046f-43ce-97f0-c403f2262618/windows-oem-license-on-used-pc?forum=win10itprosetup)).\n\nWhether you can *choose* to transfer an OEM license depends on whether it was pre\\-installed or bought stand alone:\n\n> **4\\. Transfer.** The provisions of this section do not apply if you acquired the software in Germany or in any of the countries listed on this site (aka.ms/transfer), in which case any transfer of the software to a third party, and the right to use it, must comply with applicable law.\n> \n> \n> **a. Software preinstalled on device.** If you acquired the software preinstalled on a device (and also if you upgraded from software preinstalled on a device), you may transfer the license to use the software directly to another user, only with the licensed device. The transfer must include the software and, if provided with the device, an authentic Windows label including the product key. Before any permitted transfer, the other party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software.\n> \n> \n> **b. Stand\\-alone software.** If you acquired the software as stand\\-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand\\-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.\n\nSo, (for everywhere other than Germany) pre\\-installed copies can't be transferred \\- if this is what came with those machines then you're good to go, slap a new hard drive in there and you can install the same version it came with originally, or use the keys to get an upgrade to Win10 as desired (any upgraded\\-to\\-Win10 license remains an OEM license tied to that machine).\n\nWhile that explains the case for your laptops, if it *wasn't* a preinstalled (which is only really likely in the event of a machine privately home\\-built by the original owner) then there's a possibility that they could have transferred the license to another machine.\n\nAs @user253751 says in a comment:\n\n> What if it's the motherboard of Theseus?\n\nWhile people are unlikely to have a *motherboard* of Theseus (it's more common for the motherboard itself to be treated as a discrete component) people do change/upgrade components in PCs all the time. The actual [license text](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/OEM/Windows/10/UseTerms_OEM_Windows_10_English.htm) doesn't make a distinction for this, saying:\n\n> we grant you the right to install and run one instance of the software on your device (the licensed device)\n\nand defines a \"Device\" as:\n\n> In this agreement, \u201cdevice\u201d means a hardware system (whether physical or virtual) with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a device.\n\nThe earlier link appears suggest that the motherboard is the line in the sand where Microsoft no longer consider it to be the proverbial \"original ship\".",

US](https://ecf.cofc.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?2013cv0942-136-0) is whether the statue is a building or a sculpture. The government sought dismissal of the case because\n\n> The copyright in an architectural work that has been constructed does\n>  not include the right to prevent the making, distributing, or public\n>  display of pictures ... of the work, if the building in which the work\n>  is embodied is located in or ordinarily visible from a public place.\n\ncontending \"that the sculpture is part of a much larger, unitary architectural work, namely the New York, New York Hotel \\& Casino\". The court found that the government had misconstrued the intent of that section of copyright law:\n\n> The addition of Section 120 was intended to *extend* copyright\n>  protections, however, not truncate them. Previously, architectural\n>  works had little protection because they were considered utilitarian\n>  and not subject to copyright protection. See Leischester v. Warner\n>  Bros., 232 F.3d 1212, 1216 (9th Cir. 2000\\). That changed in 1990 when\n>  congress passed the Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act\n>  (\"AWCPA\"), which added specific protection for architectural works but\n>  with the limiting proviso, on which the government relies, that\n>  photographs of public architectural works are exempted from\n>  protection.

No. 101\\-650, \u00a7\u00a7 702\\-703, 104 Stat. 5133 (1990\\).\n>  The AWCPA is silent as to its effect on any other section of the\n>  Copyright Act.\n\nThus, Congress didn't intend with that clause to withdraw copyright protection from statues in proximity to a building. Moreover, the regulatory definition of building is given [37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202\\.11(b)(2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/37/202.11):\n\n> The term \"building\" is defined in the applicable regulations as a\n>  \"humanly habitable structure.\"\n\nand there is no dispute that the sculpture is not a building in that sense.

The court noted that the addition of Section 120 (which includes the freedom of panorama provision) was meant to expand copyright protections for architectural works, which previously had little protection due to their utilitarian nature.

Is there anything I can do to stop the government charging me money I do not have for tax returns it would have made no sense to file and the forms for which I don't understand anyway?\n\nI already paid them \u00a315 to register the company with Companies House and they have done literally nothing for me in return, so I really don't see how they can be wanting \u00a31300 as a result of my not trading whatsoever.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \u00a31,300 demand is *to get you moving* to do something. You started a company. You are a company director. You get letters. You need to read the letters and do what you are asked to do. Go through the letters that you received, find a phone number, and call HMRC and talk to a living person there. \n\nAs long as they don't hear from you they assume and must assume that you are running a company that makes lots of money and doesn't pay its taxes. What else are they supposed to think? Call them, talk to them, and they will sort it out. \n\nHere's an important thing: Whoever you talk to, they can be as helpful or as unhelpful as they want, so you must make them want to help you. Shouting and threatening will make them very unhelpful. Acting as the poor man who has no idea what he is doing will make them want to get you out of the system in the cheapest possible way. \n\nBTW. You are saying they have done literally nothing for you in return of your \u00a315 registration? They did a lot. They gave you an entry in the Company House database, protecting your name, and letting anyone find your business. They sent you reminder letters to do your taxes etc. and apparently more than one. They gave you the information that you need to open a business bank account, and so on.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A new business owner registered a limited company in the UK but hasn't conducted any business activities. They're now receiving escalating bills from the government for unfiled taxes. What is the most appropriate course of action for this individual?\n\nA) Ignore the letters and wait for the government to realize their mistake\nB) Contact HMRC immediately, explain the situation, and seek guidance on how to proceed\nC) Pay the \u00a31300 fine to avoid further complications\nD) Dissolve the company without contacting HMRC\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct course of action is to contact HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) immediately. Even if a company hasn't traded, it still has legal obligations as a registered entity. Ignoring the letters (option A) will only lead to more severe consequences. Paying the fine (option C) without explanation is unnecessary if no business has been conducted. Dissolving the company without addressing the issue (option D) doesn't resolve the outstanding demands.\n\nBy contacting HMRC, the individual can explain their situation, potentially avoiding unnecessary fines, and receive guidance on how to properly handle their company's status. This approach aligns with the advice given in the original answer, which emphasizes the importance of communication with tax authorities to resolve misunderstandings and fulfill legal obligations."

If payment is made, and the paid party doesn't move out of the state, or moves back, does the paying party have a good case to get back the payment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A divorce settlement must be approved by the court. A Judge might well refuse to approve a settlement with such a provision in it, although I do not know of any law specifically barring such a term.\n\nBut once the settlement is final, one party could certainly offer a separate contract to the other, under which one party would agree to remain outside the state (or metropolitan region, or county, or wherever) in return for an agreed recurring payment. There would be no compulsion to accept such a contract, but if the payment offered was large enough, it might be accepted voluntarily.\n\nHowever, if there was a child involved, and such a move would significantly hinder that child's contact with both parents, and this were not in the child's best interest, such a contract might be attacked as against public policy.",

While it's possible for divorced parties to enter into separate contracts after their divorce is finalized, this particular contract could be problematic due to the presence of a child.\n\nThe contract itself isn't automatically void (ruling out option A) and doesn't necessarily require court approval (ruling out option D). It could potentially be a valid agreement between two consenting adults (which is why B isn't entirely wrong).\n\nHowever, the key issue here is the impact on the child. As mentioned in the original answer, if such a move would significantly hinder the child's contact with both parents and isn't in the child's best interest, the contract could be challenged as being against public policy. Courts generally prioritize the well-being of children in divorce-related matters.\n\nTherefore, while the contract might be enforceable on its face, it's vulnerable to being challenged and potentially invalidated due to its impact on the child's relationship with both parents. This makes option C the most comprehensive and accurate answer."

In general, all these kinds of actions are [First Ammendment violations, at least according to the ACLU](https://www.aclu-wa.org/file/103133/download?token=3790YyK2#:%7E:text=Can%20a%20local%20government%20body%20allow%20some%20members%20of%20the,manner%20of%20the%20challenged%20speech.). (You can do a web search to find news of various lawsuits the ACLU has filed against town councils for doing such things.)\n\nHowever, it is not clear to me what the remedy is in the cases. The news articles just say things like \"last week the ACLU sued the City Council of Podunkville for restricting public speech blah blah\" without explaining what the outcome sought was.\n\nIn such lawsuits what is the typical remedy the petitioner seeks? A court order enjoining the City Council from \"doing that again\"? Does not seem practical. Money? What exactly do they ask of the judge?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Here](https://mysouthborough.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2020-7-28-Barron-First-Amended-Complaint.pdf) is a concrete example of such a petition. The demands, at the bottom of the petition, are\n\n> a) Find that the Defendants deprived Ms. Barron of her state\n> constitutional rights; b) Enter an award against the Town and the\n> Board for compensatory damages for the injuries Ms. Barron suffered as\n> the result of those deprivations; c) Find that Mr. Kolenda defamed Ms.\n> Barron and inflicted emotional distress upon her, either intentionally\n> or negligently and award Ms. Barron compensatory and punitive damages;\n> d) Find that the Board violated the Open Meeting Law; e) Enter\n> injunctive relief requiring the Board to amend its meeting minutes to\n> reflect Mr. Kolenda\u2019s abusive comments and the Board\u2019s failure to\n> properly adjourn the meeting; f) Enter a Declaration that the Board\u2019s\n> public participation policy is unconstitutional to the extent that it\n> disallows the criticism of Board members or decisions; g) Award Ms.\n> Barron her reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for violation of her\n> constitutional rights; and h) Grant such further and other relief as\n> this Honorable Court deems just and proper.\n\nIn other words, money, injunction, and a finding of having violated the law. This kind of information is not generally contained in published appeals, so it is difficult to provide any meaningful statistics beyond these three general categories.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a lawsuit against a city council for violating First Amendment rights by restricting public speech, which of the following is NOT typically sought as a remedy by the petitioner?\n\nA) Monetary compensation for damages\nB) A court order enjoining the council from future similar actions\nC) A declaration that the council's policy is unconstitutional\nD) Immediate removal of all council members involved in the violation\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Based on the example provided, typical remedies sought in such lawsuits include monetary compensation (damages), injunctive relief to prevent future violations, and declarations of unconstitutionality. The immediate removal of council members is not mentioned as a typical remedy and would be an extreme measure not commonly sought in these types of cases. \n\nOptions A, B, and C are all mentioned in the example petition, while option D is not a standard remedy in First Amendment violation cases against city councils. This makes D the correct answer as it is NOT typically sought as a remedy."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, after a fixed-term assured shorthold tenancy expires without being renewed, what typically happens to the tenancy status?\n\nA) The tenancy automatically terminates, and the tenant must vacate the property immediately.\nB) A new fixed-term tenancy is automatically created with the same terms as the previous one.\nC) A periodic tenancy arises by operation of law, subject to certain conditions.\nD) The landlord must apply to the court for a new tenancy agreement to be imposed.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Housing Act 1988, if an assured shorthold tenancy (which is a type of fixed-term assured tenancy) comes to an end without being terminated by a court order, surrendered, or otherwise ended by the tenant's action, the tenant is entitled to remain in possession of the property. The tenancy then converts to a periodic tenancy arising by virtue of the Act, subject to certain conditions. This means that option C is correct.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the tenancy does not automatically terminate; the tenant has a right to remain in possession.\n\nOption B is incorrect because a new fixed-term tenancy is not automatically created; instead, it becomes a periodic tenancy.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the landlord does not need to apply to the court for a new tenancy agreement. The periodic tenancy arises by operation of law, not by court order.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's understanding of UK tenancy law, specifically the transition from fixed-term to periodic tenancies, which is a crucial concept in property management and tenant rights."

In criminal law, \"should know\" is important because many crimes have a scienter requirement, but you will usually have a hard time proving beyond reasonable doubt that a person had actual knowledge of some fact. It is almost commonplace that people who are not fluent speakers of English \"know\" things that are untrue and that a \"reasonable\" person would know to be wrong, such as being confused about the referent of \"eye\" versus \"ear\" (tragic, in the context of \"\\_\\_\\_drops\"). A reasonable person would not judge a factual mistake as being dishonest, and in general would never impute evil motives (dishonesty) to what appears to be an incomprehensible response (e.g. saying \"Yes\" to the question whether the sky is green). Lawyers are reasonable people, so they don't actually impute dishonesty to people at a surprisingly higher rate that other reasonable rate.",

According to the documentation, honesty is about actual knowledge, not what someone \"should have known.\" Lawyers, being reasonable people, would not impute dishonesty to what appears to be a misunderstanding or limited perspective. The statement likely stems from the speaker's recent experiences in an overcast environment and potential language barriers, rather than an intent to deceive. The \"reasonably ought to have known\" standard is more relevant to legal obligations than to determining honesty. Additionally, lawyers generally don't impute dishonesty at a higher rate than other reasonable people would.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it conflates the \"reasonably ought to have known\" standard with dishonesty, which the passage explicitly separates.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the \"reasonably ought to have known\" standard exists in law, it's not typically applied to determine honesty in this context.\n\nOption D, while potentially true in some contexts, is not the best answer because the passage suggests that reasonable people (including lawyers) would not judge such a factual mistake as dishonest or use it to broadly challenge credibility."
