            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was arrested on charges in North Carolina. During the ongoing investigation, but prior to trial, the local news ran a piece showing my mug shot. They didn't say my name, but did say some bad things about me, and what was allegedly found on my property. \n\nThis was done a few weeks before jury selection, and I am worried that my potential jury has already judged me before the trial. \n\nIs it legal and/or proper for the news station to do this? Does this impact my ability to get a fair trial? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There's nothing illegal about the media discussing your case. In fact most media outlets don't hold back many details about the accused, because it's all public information that anyone curious about it can get from the court clerk's office for free and with no reason specified.\n\nIf jury selection hasn't started yet, then asking each juror about what they might know about the case is a pretty standard question that any competent defense attorney would be asking, even without knowledge of media coverage. If they already know about the case and say they can't put that knowledge aside when rendering a verdict, they are almost always dismissed. If you're concerned your defense attorney isn't aware of the media coverage, that's something you need to bring up with them.\n\nIf jury selection already took place, and nobody bothered to ask them if they had prior knowledge of the case, then there's pretty much nothing you can do. A judge *might* ask the jury if anyone's seen the coverage, but it usually results in nothing happening. The media talking about your case is not grounds for a mistrial; it's rarely even grounds for a change of venue. Getting a mistrial would require you to prove a specific juror engaged in misconduct somehow.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal case where local media has reported on the defendant's arrest and alleged evidence prior to jury selection, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the impact on a fair trial?\n\nA) The media coverage automatically results in a mistrial, as it prejudices potential jurors.\n\nB) The defendant can easily obtain a change of venue based solely on the media coverage.\n\nC) During jury selection, potential jurors who have seen the media coverage are always dismissed, regardless of their ability to remain impartial.\n\nD) Media coverage prior to trial is generally not grounds for a mistrial, but defense attorneys typically question potential jurors about their exposure to such information during jury selection.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. Media coverage of a criminal case prior to trial is generally not illegal or improper, and it doesn't automatically result in a mistrial or change of venue. However, competent defense attorneys typically ask potential jurors about their exposure to such information during the jury selection process. Jurors who have prior knowledge of the case but state they can set it aside and render an impartial verdict are not always dismissed. Only those who admit they cannot be impartial due to the media coverage are typically excused. Options A and B are incorrect because media coverage alone doesn't guarantee a mistrial or change of venue. Option C is too absolute, as not all jurors with prior knowledge are automatically dismissed."

It might be [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) or allowed similar exceptions in other countries or could be a copyright infringement.\n\nFor example, using book covers images in a [blog entry doing a critical analysis of those books covers](http://listocomics.com/el-misterio-de-los-detectives-mellizos/) is OK under [right to quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_quote) (as covered by Spanish law) and it would be OK under fair use. Displaying book covers in relation to news coverage (of news related to the books) or to advertise the books [seems to be OK under US law](http://blog.librarylaw.com/librarylaw/2008/08/book-jackets--.html).\n\nAnyway, some other uses aren't covered.

Using book covers as part of a critical analysis or review falls under the right to quote and is typically protected under fair use doctrine. This use serves an educational or critical purpose and is transformative.\n\nOption A is likely not fair use as it lacks context and doesn't serve a clear purpose beyond decoration. \n\nOption B could be seen as using the covers as a substitute for game elements, which may not be protected.\n\nOption D, while closer to a legitimate use, might still be questioned if it's seen as merely reproducing covers without adding significant commentary or transformation.\n\nIt's important to note that fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering factors such as the purpose of use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the market for the original work."

One Canadian dollars \\= 0\\.77 U.S. dollars. The monetary claim limits in U.S. dollars in Canadian courts (at this rate) are as follows:\n\nThe Civil Division of the Provincial Court of Alberta hears claims up to $50,000\\. ($38,500 USD)\n\nThe Civil Resolution Tribunal hears claims up to $5,000 ($3,850 USD) The Provincial Court of British Columbia\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims from $5,001 to $35,000 ($26,950 USD)\n\nThe Manitoba Court of Queen\u2019s Bench\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $15,000\\. ($11,550 USD)\n\nThe Small Claims Court of New Brunswick hears claims up to $20,000\\. ($15,400 USD)\n\nThe Provincial Court of Newfoundland and Labrador\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $25,000\\. ($18,250 USD)\n\nThe Territorial Court of the Northwest Territories hears claims up to $35,000 ($26,950 USD)\n\nThe Nova Scotia Small Claims Court hears claims up to $25,000\\. ($18,250 USD)\n\nThe Nunavut Court of Justice\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $20,000\\. ($15,400 USD)\n\nThe Ontario Superior Court of Justice\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $35,000\\. ($26,950 USD)\n\nThe Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $16,000\\. ($12,320 USD)\n\nThe Small Claims Division at the Court of Qu\u00e9bec hears claims up to $15,000\\. ($11,550 USD)\n\nThe Provincial Court of Saskatchewan\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $30,000\\. ($23,100 USD)\n\nYukon\u2019s Small Claims Court hears claims up to $25,000\\. ($18,250 USD)\n\n**The Term \"Small Claims Court\" Is Used Differently**\n\nSecond, this isn't an apples to apples comparison. The Canadian limits are for what would be called limited jurisdiction civil courts in the U.S., (except perhaps, British Columbia's Civil Resolution Tribunal) and aren't strictly equivalent to U.S. small claims courts which are a bit like the \"[Judge Judy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Judy)\" show or \"[The People's Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People%27s_Court)\" on U.S. television\n\nBut, most U.S. jurisdictions distinguish between small claims cases, which have a lower dollar limit and in which plaintiffs cannot commence cases with lawyers, and have an extremely simplified process, and ordinary civil cases in limited jurisdiction courts, which still have lots of parties without lawyers, and have greatly simplified and shortened pretrial civil procedure, but have higher dollar limits and allow either party to be represented by lawyers without limitations.\n\nMost adversarial U.S. limited jurisdiction court cases that are not small claims court cases are filed by professional debt collection firms on behalf of businesses, *en masse* with many cases resolved by default judgment, or involve protective orders (e.g. in domestic violence situations).\n\nThe charts below for U.S. Courts (from [here](https://www.ncsc.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/13376/civiljusticereport-2015.pdf) as of 2015 and hence seven years out of date) illustrate the difference. As of 2022, Colorado's limits are $7,500 USD for small claims court and $25,000 for its limited jurisdiction court. Some states, like New York State, have different jurisdictional limits in limited jurisdiction courts in different parts of the state.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHvJ9.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mHvJ9.png)\n\nAccording to the body text, some limited jurisdiction courts in the U.S. can entertain claims up to $200,000 USD (i.e. Mississippi and Texas).\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ultTV.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ultTV.png)\n\n**Intrastate Federalism**\n\nMany courts of limited jurisdiction in the U.S. are part of local governments (e.g. a city or municipal court) rather than part of the state court system. State governments have often been reluctant to grant much authority to civil courts which are outside the state court system (that state legislatures can regulate directly) to local governments.\n\nIn contrast, all of the limited jurisdiction courts in Canada are part of either a provincial level court system, or the courts of a self\\-governing territory (also, while not precisely on point, while Canada has federal courts, the jurisdiction of Canada's federal courts is very limited and the federal court dockets make up only a tiny part of the total judicial system case load in Canada).",

The passage explains that the term \"small claims court\" is used differently in Canada compared to the U.S. In Canada, what they call \"small claims courts\" are more equivalent to what the U.S. would term \"limited jurisdiction civil courts.\" These Canadian courts generally handle higher claim amounts than U.S. small claims courts. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while some Canadian courts do have higher limits, this isn't universally true and doesn't capture the key difference in terminology.\n\nOption B is incorrect. While U.S. small claims courts often prohibit lawyer representation for plaintiffs, this isn't always the case, and the passage doesn't provide enough information about lawyer representation in Canadian courts to make this comparison.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The passage states that Canadian courts are part of provincial or territorial systems, not the federal system. It also mentions that some, but not all, U.S. limited jurisdiction courts are part of local governments."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have for several years operated a website on which enthusiasts can play a niche boardgame against one another. The boardgame in question has recently been the subject of a Kickstarter campaign for a reprint with various bells and whistles; the company running the Kickstarter campaign, and marketing the new edition of the game, has got in touch with me asking me whether I would be willing to collaborate in promotional activities for the launch, to raise the profile of the new edition of the game among the site's userbase.\n\nOne of the proposed activities is a knockout tournament, the winner (or winner and some runners\\-up) of the tournament to receive prizes in the form of a copy of the Kickstarted product. There has been discussion of also giving a cash prize to the winner of the tournament, in addition to the copy of the game. I am unsure whether in order to run this activity I would require a UK \"casino operating licence\". I consulted [this page](https://www.out-law.com/page-6780) and my concerns are primarily with the paragraph about halfway down the page, headed \"Is the competition gaming?\":\n\n> If a skill competition involves \"playing a game of chance\", it will be\n>  gaming \u2013 and so require the appropriate licence, usually a casino\n>  operating licence \u2013 whether or not any payment is involved. A game of\n>  chance includes a game involving elements of both chance and skill\n>  (and even if the chance element can be eliminated by superlative\n>  skill) other than a sport; it no longer matters whether there are any\n>  other participants. The key questions here are probably whether the\n>  competition involves \"playing\" a \"game\"; the pre\\-Gambling Act 2005\n>  case law is likely to be relevant in deciding this.\n\nDetails which may or may not be relevant:\n\n* The board game in question is primarily a game of skill, but does have elements of chance, in that (for example) card draws can affect a player's available moves. As such, it appears to fall under the definition of \"playing a game of chance\" as given in the quoted paragraph.\n* There is no charge for registering on the website or for playing games. There would be no charge for entering the tournament, if it were to go ahead.\n* I am the owner and operator of the website. I live and work in the UK and am a British citizen.\n* The website is a .com domain. It is registered through a US hosting provider, and hosted by the same company. I understand that the server is located in a US data centre.\n* The company that is running the Kickstarter campaign, and is paying for my time and would be paying for the tournament prizes were it to go ahead, is based in Canada.\n* The website is not a profit\\-making operation, but I am receiving compensation (on an informal basis) from the company for running promotional activities.\n* If a \"casino operating licence\" is indeed required, then the contest cannot go ahead, as even the lowest \"fee category\" detailed on [this page](http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/for-gambling-businesses/Do-I-need-a-licence/Operating-licences/Remote-casino-operating-licence.aspx) is prohibitively expensive.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To begin with, if any part of the operation is to occur in the UK, it must comply with UK law, including each individual jurisdiction of it. That will include a gaming license *if one is actually required*.\n\nHaving said that, board and card games are not usually considered casino games unless typically played in a casino, and playing them is not usually considered gambling.\n\nParts of the website linked explain this further. In particular, you have an apparent expectation that \"the skill requirement will either deter a significant proportion of potential participants from entering or prevent a significant proportion of entrants from receiving a prize\".\n\nThere is some ambiguity over the inclusion of random elements, and therefore whether this game amounts to a game of chance per the definition and descriptions given.\n\nHowever, it would be very surprising if this competition did require a license, but to avoid doubt, you should consult a lawyer licensed in that jurisdiction, preferably with some specialty in gambling law.",

The tournament will be free to enter and prizes will be provided by a Canadian company. Under which circumstances would the website owner most likely need to obtain a UK casino operating license?\n\nA) If the board game is primarily skill-based but includes some elements of chance, such as card draws\nB) If the website is hosted on servers located in the United States\nC) If the tournament offers both game products and cash prizes to winners\nD) If the website owner receives compensation from the Canadian company for running promotional activities\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The need for a UK casino operating license in this scenario is most likely if the tournament offers both game products and cash prizes to winners. This combination of prizes, especially the inclusion of cash, could potentially push the activity closer to gambling territory in the eyes of regulators. While the game's mix of skill and chance is relevant, it's not the deciding factor if no money is involved. The website's hosting location and the owner's compensation for promotions are less relevant to the licensing requirement. However, the inclusion of cash prizes alongside product prizes increases the likelihood that the activity might be viewed as gambling, potentially necessitating a license. It's important to note that this is a complex area of law, and consulting with a legal professional specializing in UK gambling regulations would be advisable for a definitive answer."

If a customer is aware of a crime and hires a lawyer to go to the company to request money in exchange for not reporting them to the authorities. Is this extortion? If not extortion is it legal, assuming their are no threats of media outing just legal jeopardy?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Absent a specified jurisdiction, I'm going to assume the US state of New York. This conduct falls squarely within the definition of extortion under New York Penal Law section 155\\.05(2\\)(e):\n\n> A person obtains property by extortion when he compels or induces\n>  another person to deliver such property to himself or to a third person\n>  by means of instilling in him a fear that, if the property is not so\n>  delivered, the actor or another will: \\[...] (iv) Accuse some person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be\n>  instituted against him;\n\nThere is a defense under section 155\\.15(2\\):\n\n> In any prosecution for larceny by extortion committed by instilling\n>  in the victim a fear that he or another person would be charged with a\n>  crime, it is an affirmative defense that the defendant reasonably\n>  believed the threatened charge to be true and that his sole purpose was\n>  to compel or induce the victim to take reasonable action to make good\n>  the wrong which was the subject of such threatened charge.\n\nHowever, in your hypothetical, the customer is just seeking a payout. This defense is meant for situations like a theft victim telling the thief \"give me back my property or I'll call the cops;\" unless paying the customer is actually a reasonable action to make up for the crime, the customer can't use this defense.\n\nIf the crime is a federal one, this is also blackmail under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 873:\n\n> Whoever, under a threat of informing, or as a consideration for not informing, against any violation of any law of the United States, demands or receives any money or other valuable thing, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\n\nIf interstate communications are involved, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 875(d) can also apply:\n\n> Whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other thing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation of the addressee or of another or the reputation of a deceased person **or any threat to accuse the addressee or any other person of a crime,** shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.",

The customer hires a lawyer to approach the company and request a substantial payment in exchange for not reporting the crime to authorities. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) This action is legal as long as the lawyer doesn't explicitly threaten to report the crime.\nB) This action is legal if the customer genuinely believes the payment would make up for the crime committed.\nC) This action constitutes extortion under both state and federal law, regardless of how the request is phrased.\nD) This action is legal if the lawyer only mentions potential civil litigation, not criminal charges.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario clearly falls under the definition of extortion or blackmail under both state and federal law. In New York, for example, it meets the criteria for extortion under Penal Law section 155.05(2)(e), which includes compelling someone to deliver property by instilling fear of being accused of a crime. Federally, it constitutes blackmail under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 873, which prohibits demanding money in exchange for not informing against a violation of U.S. law. The action remains illegal even if:\n\n- The threat is implied rather than explicit (A is incorrect)\n- The customer believes the payment is justified (B is incorrect; the affirmative defense in NY law doesn't apply here as the sole purpose is seeking a payout, not making good on a wrong)\n- The lawyer avoids mentioning criminal charges (D is incorrect; the underlying nature of the threat remains the same)\n\nThe correct answer is C because the action fundamentally involves demanding payment in exchange for not reporting a crime, which is illegal regardless of how it's phrased or justified."

After getting some strange answers from the n.l.y.s. when I tried discussing with him the paperwork that needs to be signed, I expressed my concern to my landlord, who sent us both an email explaining to the n.l.y.s. that he is to sublet the room from me, that he is returning payment to the n.l.y.s. (which already happened) and that I'm to present a sublease agreement for him to sign, so that it can all be done properly.\n\nI wrote up a very reasonable sublease, waiving deposit and including some rent prorating, but the n.l.y.s. is ignoring it completely, and won't return any phone calls or text messages. So, on paper, what we have is that the n.l.y.s. has made no net payment, and that I'm still the tenant of the property. But it looks like the n.l.y.s is intending to stay on in the property.\n\nEDIT: he has been in the property for two days (at the time of this edit, 05\\-07\\-2017\\).\n\nEDIT 2: the property is in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nWhat can be done in this case?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The local country sheriff's department \\- not the police \\- handle lease and tenant issues. You can call the police, and they would look into the paperwork, but more than likely they would defer to the county. In your case, it is probably Fulton County you should talk to; see [fultoncountyga.gov: Evictions](http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/fcmd-divisions/fcmd-evictions) \n\nOne possibility is you can talk to the landlord about mentioning to the NLYS you are looking into starting the eviction process with Fulton Country. That whole eviction process can take time; tenants \\- even illegal ones \\- have some rights established by their payments, your verbal agreements, they were given a key, etc. But the mention of eviction might scare them into leaving. Or signing a real lease. But do this in conjunction with the landlord; you are still a tenant yourself.\n\nYour landlord deals with the eviction process, not you. He doesn't need a lawyer to send a text/letter to the NLYS saying that they need to sign a lease or he may start eviction proceedings. Your landlord doesn't need a lawyer to start the eviction process, if it is needed in the end.\n\nYour landlord may want to look at\n\n[fultoncountyga.gov \\- steps in the eviction process fact sheet.pdf](http://www.fultoncountyga.gov/images/stories/Marshal/marshal_documents/steps%20in%20the%20eviction%20process%20fact%20sheet.pdf)\n\nand possibly\n\n[GeorgiaLegalAid.org \\| A guide to free and low\\-cost legal aid, assistance and services in Georgia](http://www.georgialegalaid.org/)",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Atlanta, Georgia, a tenant allowed a not-yet-legal subtenant (NYLS) to move in without a formal agreement. The NYLS is now refusing to sign a sublease or communicate. What is the most appropriate first step for the tenant to take in this situation?\n\nA) Call the local police department to have the NYLS removed immediately\nB) Contact the Fulton County Sheriff's Department to begin eviction proceedings\nC) Consult with the landlord about mentioning potential eviction to the NYLS\nD) Directly threaten the NYLS with legal action to force them to sign the sublease\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate first step is to consult with the landlord about mentioning potential eviction to the NYLS. This approach is recommended because:\n\n1. The police typically defer tenant issues to the county sheriff's department.\n2. The tenant cannot initiate eviction proceedings themselves; this must be done by the landlord.\n3. Mentioning the possibility of eviction might motivate the NYLS to either sign a lease or leave voluntarily.\n4. Working in conjunction with the landlord is crucial, as the tenant is still a tenant themselves.\n5. This approach allows for a potential resolution without immediately escalating to legal action.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the police are not the appropriate authority for this situation. Option B is incorrect because the tenant cannot initiate eviction proceedings directly. Option D is inappropriate and potentially illegal without proper authority."

There are no laws or regulations mentioned that prohibit this practice. The example of specialty insurance companies like Haggerty, which insure classic cars separately from daily drivers, further supports the legality of using multiple insurance providers. The correct answer, C, accurately reflects that an individual can legally insure different vehicles with different companies, especially if it results in cost savings.

I took a screenshot and then used it as inspiration as I created my own version. To not have any problems regarding copyright I contacted the company, whose image I hade used as inspiration. The person who created it had passed away many years ago but the company said that I was welcome to \"use it as much as I wanted\". So my question is, what type of information should I make sure is in this \"permission of use\", to not get into troubled later on, when I put in on my company's website?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The skyline of a city is a fact. One may always create a new image of a skyline on one's own. No permission is needed from others who have created such images.\n\nHowever, an existing image is quite likely to be protected by copyright. In that case permission must usually be obtained, unless an ***exception to copyright*** applies. That is true whether the desired use is for profit or not.\n\nHere it seems that the OP has asked for and received permission to use the image, or a modified version of it. The beast practice is for the owner to specify under what conditions use is permitted, and what acknowledgement or credit must be provided, and what fee if any will be charged. But it seems that in this instance the copyright owner left that vague.\n\nIn that case some acknowledgement is probably a good idea. A note such as \"Skyline image based on image created by {author}. Used by permission of {copyright owner}.\" could be displayed along with the image, or in some other appropriate place. One could also ask the owner whether a proposed credit line would be acceptable.",

Used by permission of [copyright owner].\"\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While city skylines themselves are facts and not copyrightable, specific artistic representations of skylines can be protected by copyright. In this case, permission was granted, but it's best practice to provide attribution. Option D suggests an appropriate acknowledgment that credits the original creator and company, which helps avoid potential issues and shows good faith. Option A is incorrect because while skylines are facts, specific images can be copyrighted. Option B is unnecessary given the permission already granted. Option C ignores the best practice of providing attribution when using others' work, even with permission."

There was nothing in the letter about contesting the citation, so I called the phone number and was told that the letter I received yesterday was the second of its kind and that I had missed my opportunity to contest. I explained that I had not received any other letter and wanted to contest but was not given the opportunity to do so. A supervisor who had not watched the video advised me to work directly with the police department which is out of state but only about an hour from me. She also said if I don't pay, then the $200 fine (which supposedly was $100 when the first letter was sent) then an additional $70 gets tacked on for the collection agency. Is there a way to contest such a citation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The procedure for contesting such tickets varies by the municipality where the alleged violation occurred. Chicago, in particular, has its own specific procedures. There is often a strict deadline for the challenge process, and fines do escalate significantly if they go unpaid for even a short time.\n\nOne who wants to challenge such a ticket would do well to find the name and address of the court where the ticket is returnable. This may be on the ticket, or a google or other online search may reveal it. Having found the address, send a letter explaining why you think the ticket is in error. Be clear and polite but concise, and include the ticket number and other inditing details. Include copies of the letter and anything that came with it. Send this by certified mail, return receipt. (One may wish to send a second copy, clearly marked \"second copy\" by regular mail.) The letter should specifically request an in\\-person hearing if the count does not drop the ticket.\n\nOne may wish to engage a lawyer, preferably one who has has some experience with traffic camera tickets, and who has an office somewhat near the relevant court.. Whether this is worth while depends on the situation, including the possible fine or other penalty involved.\n\nA telephone call to the police station may help, but the police usually do not have authority to cancel tickets once they have been subm,itted for central processing. The court does.\n\n\\[*I intend to add to this answer, including addign sourcves, in a few hours.*]",

This approach aligns with the advice given in the documentation, which suggests finding the court's address and sending a letter that explains why the ticket is in error, includes all relevant details, and specifically requests an in-person hearing. This method provides a formal, documented attempt to contest the citation, even if the initial deadline has passed. It's also recommended to send this by certified mail with a return receipt for proof of communication. Options A and D are less likely to be effective, as phone calls and working with the police department directly are noted as having limited impact once the ticket has been centrally processed.

US dollar bills can be traced in specific situations, such as when used for ransoms or when processed through certain money counting machines that scan serial numbers. However, for regular transactions and border crossings, serial numbers are not routinely tracked or registered. While it's possible to obtain some limited information about a bill's history (like its printing date), comprehensive tracking of every bill's movement would be impractical and time-consuming for authorities. Options A and D are incorrect because they represent extreme positions that don't align with the actual capabilities and practices of tracking US currency.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not explicitly prohibit private businesses from asking customers about disabilities that may prevent them from wearing masks. The ADA's restrictions on medical inquiries primarily apply to employment situations (Title I, Section 102(c)), which limits what employers can ask potential employees.

Option D is incorrect because the consumer has additional options beyond accepting the refund, such as reporting the company to relevant authorities."

The husband is suppose to pay until college graduation. Child is being supported by significant other and they work part time job.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a matter of state law, so the answer is not precisely the same in all jurisdictions.\n\nMany states have laws that prohibit child support orders from being modified retroactively. In those states, they can only be modified back to the date of the motion seeking to modify them.\n\nIn the case of an adult child in college, where an agreement ends child support at a given date, simply not living in the home while in college or on vacations during college is not likely to be a valid basis for discontinuing child support or modifying it, because this was a circumstance that was foreseeable when the order was entered.\n\nThe fact that a child has some support from others or from a part\\-time job does not necessarily discontinue the obligation.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John and Mary divorced when their daughter Sarah was 15. Their divorce agreement stipulated that John would pay child support until Sarah's college graduation. Now, at age 20, Sarah has moved in with her boyfriend and works part-time while attending college. John wants to stop paying child support. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's obligations and options?\n\nA) John can immediately stop paying child support since Sarah no longer lives with Mary and has her own income.\n\nB) John must continue paying the full amount of child support until Sarah graduates, regardless of her living situation or part-time job.\n\nC) John can unilaterally reduce his child support payments to account for Sarah's changed circumstances without going to court.\n\nD) John should file a motion with the court to modify the child support order, but may still be required to pay some support until Sarah graduates.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate response based on the information provided. While John cannot unilaterally stop or reduce payments (eliminating options A and C), he does have the right to seek modification through the court. However, the fact that Sarah has moved out and has a part-time job does not automatically terminate the support obligation, especially if the original agreement specified support until college graduation. The court will consider various factors, including state laws, the original agreement, and Sarah's current circumstances. John may still be required to pay some support, but filing a motion for modification is the proper legal procedure to potentially adjust the amount based on the changed situation."

It does not absolutely forbid owning a possum, but it is required that you have a license to take or keep a wild fur\\-bearing animal including a possum. There is no existing \"license to take and possess as a pet\", but you could try under [trapping licenses](https://tpwd.texas.gov/regulations/outdoor-annual/hunting/fur-bearing-animal-regulations/license-requirements). However, [they warn](https://tpwd.texas.gov/publications/pwdpubs/media/pwd_lf_w7000_0479_packet.pdf) that the\n\n> Fur\\-bearing Propagation Permit does not authorize individuals to\n>  possess live fur\\-bearing animals as pets.This IS NOT a \u201cpet permit.\u201d\n\nUltimately, what would happen is you apply for a license, but they would deny the application because you don't plan to propagate the animal, or skin it. Although the statute does not specifically prohibit keeping a fur\\-bearing animal as a pet, it does authorize Parks and Wildlife to promulgate and enforce regulations.\n\nAnother approach would be to seek a [wild animal rehabilitation permit](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PW/htm/PW.43.htm), pursuant to PWD regulations ([here](https://tpwd.texas.gov/huntwild/wild/rehab/regs/)). This is also not a general pet permit, but in case your program of possum rehabilitation fails, you are not required to kill it or release it into the wild to die. There is a test required, to be sure you know how to rehabilitate wild animals, plus a requirement for letters of support from conservationists, veterinarians or rehabilitators.",

Texas does not offer a standard pet ownership license for wild animals like possums.\nB) Incorrect. The Fur-bearing Propagation Permit explicitly states it is not a \"pet permit\" and does not authorize keeping fur-bearing animals as pets.\nC) Correct. Seeking a wild animal rehabilitation permit is the most appropriate legal approach in this situation. It requires passing a test to demonstrate knowledge of animal rehabilitation, obtaining support letters from professionals, and allows for continued care if the animal cannot be released.\nD) Incorrect.

Alice attempts to avoid Bob by alighting, but Bob alights as well and keeps talking. Can Alice call the police? What about an uninvolved third party? If it matters, Bob is unarmed and the country is Singapore.\n\nMy original inclination is \"yes\". However it looks like calling the police worldwide should only be done in emergency situations, e.g. [the Singapore police website](https://www.police.gov.sg/police-emergency-999) says one should only dial 999 when a crime is in progress, someone is hurt or in danger, and so on. Bob in this situation hasn't actually become violent, and while Alice is understandably frightened, she isn't actually in danger.\n\nIf the answer is \"no\", how should Alice shake off Bob? \"Walk to a police station\" seems like the obvious answer, but there might not be one nearby.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In my home jurisdiction, this would be considered more than enough reason to call the emergency response number.\n\nThis does not guarantee that a unit would be dispatched (quickly; of the desired type; at all).

Bob's behavior, while concerning, may not meet this threshold initially.\n\nB) Ignoring the situation could potentially allow it to escalate and does not address Alice's safety concerns.\n\nC) Confronting Bob aggressively could potentially escalate the situation and put Alice at greater risk.\n\nD) This is the most appropriate response. Seeking help from others nearby can provide immediate assistance and witnesses. If Bob persists or the situation worsens, contacting the non-emergency police line is a measured response that alerts authorities without misusing emergency services. This approach allows for escalation to emergency services if needed while initially handling the situation in a manner proportionate to the current threat level."

But I imagine myself walking into such a mall, and an employee comes over and asks \"Stop playing Pokemon Go or leave.\" \n\nMy response is perhaps\n\n> \"No.\"\n\nor maybe alternatively\n\n> \"Can you prove I'm playing Pokemon Go?

The shopping mall, as a private property, has the right to set rules for behavior on its premises. They can ask Pok\u00e9mon Go players to leave, and if the players refuse, the mall can issue a trespass notice. This is not considered discrimination, as Pok\u00e9mon Go players are not a legally protected class. The mall cannot arrest players themselves, as that's a job for law enforcement. Options A and B are incorrect because they misunderstand the rights of private property owners and the legal status of Pok\u00e9mon Go players.

Of course they're not really going to be holding one, but that's immaterial. **Assuming the following, what would I be charged with once the police find out?**\n\n* This person is out of town and won't be home until the day after the \"yard sale\", so they won't physically notice the fake yard sale posters until it's too late.\n* This person was not planning on holding a yard sale that day.\n* This person lives alone, or the people they live with are also out of town (e.g. a family vacation).\n* It is possible that someone told this person via social media about my little plot while they're away, but not in a way that interferes with these other assumptions (e.g. calling the police before the day of the \"sale\").\n* I don't actually set foot on, steal, vandalize, or otherwise disturb this person's property.\n* At least one would\\-be customer actually *does* show up, but I don't know how long they were there for or what they did there. They might have even done something illegal like steal their porch furniture, but I just don't know for sure.\n* I don't take down the fliers after the day of the \"sale\".\n* The fliers themselves are simple and contain no inflammatory content, but they *do* explicitly advertise a yard sale at a particular place and time.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The potential criminal charges might easily include: \n\n(1\\) some form of harassment or stalking (statutory definitions vary a great deal), \n\n(2\\) littering, \n\n(3\\) violation of a municipal signage ordinance, \n\n(4\\) vandalism (of the structures upon which the signs were affixed), \n\n(5\\) deceptive trade practices/consumer protection law violation (which ban false statements made to prospective consumers without regard to harm), and \n\n(6\\) conspiracy of whatever crimes are committed by someone who does show up (e.g. trespass, larceny, vandalism). The lack of knowledge regarding exactly whom would commit exactly which charge probably wouldn't bar a conspiracy conviction although this would vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based upon statutory language and case law.\n\nMail and wire fraud would not seem to apply since only old school fliers were used by the perpetrator.\n\nIf there were factual indications of certain kinds of motivations or expected consequences of the prank, state hate crime violations might also be implicated. Motives could also implicate certain statutes barring retaliation (e.g. for labor union organization or petitioning a public body).\n\nThe exact specifics of the charges would depend upon the exact state, county, city, etc. in which the property was located as these kinds of laws vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction compared with offenses which were crimes at common law.",

The documentation emphasizes that financial transactions, regardless of the method used, are subject to regulations for various important reasons such as fraud protection and prevention of money laundering. It strongly advises seeking professional legal counsel before proceeding with any financial startup idea. Using cryptocurrency or stablecoins does not automatically bypass these regulations or eliminate the need for legal compliance. The answer warns against trusting informal advice for such critical legal matters and stresses the importance of being prepared for significant legal expenses to ensure regulatory approval.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) This practice is legal in Canada as long as TechGear Inc. informs the customer about the warranty in their terms of service.\n\nB) The customer has no recourse as online purchases are not protected under Canadian consumer protection laws.\n\nC) This practice is illegal, and the customer's only option is to file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.\n\nD) This practice is illegal, and the customer can request a refund or pursue the matter in small claims court if the refund is refused.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Adding a charge for an optional warranty without the customer's consent is illegal in Canada. The customer has the right to request a refund for the unauthorized charge. If the company refuses to provide a refund, the customer can take the matter to small claims court. This aligns with the information provided in the documentation, which states that it is \"clearly not legal to charge for an optional warranty without ever having gotten approval for it.\" The documentation also mentions small claims court as an appropriate venue for resolving such disputes.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the practice is illegal regardless of what's in the terms of service. Option B is false as online purchases are indeed protected under Canadian consumer protection laws. Option C is partially correct in identifying the practice as illegal, but it's incorrect in stating that filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau is the only option, as legal recourse through small claims court is available."

If the company wanted to sue someone but the lawyers didn't think they had a good chance to win, must the lawyers still work to accomplish this?\n\nI am part of a union where many members' work has been heavily affected by COVID. The members' views and opinions are very divided. Where I live there certainly has been talk that some unions may be sued for failing to protect their members against employer COVID policies. My union hired a team of lawyers who they have a long standing relationship with. They were tasked to review legalities of employer COVID policies. I think they called these lawyers \"outside counsel\", does this mean they are not part of the same organization so (in theory) their advice and position is objective and neutral?\n\nThe principal lawyer said that members are free to consult legal council of their own choosing and no retribution would happen for it. A member had hired a lawyer with an opposing view to the union's lawyers. Would this other lawyer necessarily have to agree with this view or believe there is a chance at success (e.g. proving it's illegal discrimination to have a COVID policy in the workplace)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I think they called these lawyers \"outside counsel\", does this mean\n> they are not part of the same organization so (in theory) their advice\n> and position is objective and neutral?\n\nNot really. The economics of the arrangement are different, but outside counsel is not more or less objective and neutral, in theory at least, than in house counsel.\n\nOutside counsel and in house counsel owe essentially the same duties in the context of a lawyer\\-client relationship to the client (in this case, the union), although, in practice, outside counsel with evaluate those duties and that relationship in the context of a single one off assignment, while in house counsel will evaluate those duties with a much richer understanding of the underlying facts of a matter and the larger context in which it is playing out.\n\nA lawyer's duty is to advance the objectives of the client, and those objective are largely within the province of the client and not the lawyer, although a lawyer has greater latitude in exercise discretion regarding the means by which this objective is achieved.\n\nFor example, a client could legitimately say that it wants to bring a lawsuit arising out of an incident it was involved in, but the lawyer would usually decide which court it was filed in, what specific legal claims were asserted, and so on.\n\n> \\[If] the lawyers didn't think they had a good chance to win, must the\n> lawyers still work to accomplish this?\n\nThere are a few boundary lines, short of resigning or withdrawing from representation when not legally or ethically required to do so, because the lawyer simply doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, the lawyer isn't allowed to bring groundless, frivolous, or vexatious litigation, or otherwise engage in unethical conduct (e.g. fraud), even if the client wants to do so.\n\nSecond, if a lawyer with an organization as a client (like a union) believes that someone within the organization, possibly with some authority, is about to engage in illegal activity that will hurt the organization, the lawyer has a duty to speak up (internally) about this conduct and urge the client representative not to break the law, if necessary, going up as high in the management or governance of the company as necessary (e.g. up to the highest governing board or CEO) to blow the whistle on this conduct internally within the organization, and to resign if the lawyer can't otherwise avoid being involved in illegal conduct by representatives of the organization.\n\nThird, the lawyer must counsel the client representative in a manner sufficient to make the client's decision to pursue a court of action that is unlikely to win, but is not groundless, frivolous, vexatious, or illegal, an informed decision.\n\nBut, if the client decides to go forward with a course of action or objective after making an informed decision to do so with information provided by the lawyer, the lawyer has to do his or her best to carry out the decision of the client even if it would not have been the decision that the lawyer would have made. The lawyer is still an agent of the client, carrying out the client's wishes, not an entirely independent free actor.\n\n> A member had hired a lawyer with an opposing view to the union's\n> lawyers. Would this other lawyer necessarily have to agree with this\n> view or believe there is a chance at success (e.g. proving it's\n> illegal discrimination to have a COVID policy in the workplace)?\n\nAgain, no. Lawyers don't have to agree personally with the positions that they take on behalf of their clients, so long as those positions are not groundless, frivolous, or vexatious litigation, and the lawyer's work does not otherwise engage in unethical conduct (e.g. fraud), it isn't improper for the lawyer to do that.\n\nTo provide some context for why these rules are the case, keep in mind that lawyers are in the business, primarily, of dealing with situations in which there are potential ambiguities or uncertainties in the law. Lawyers, judges, and courts recognize that the law and language are pliable and subject to interpretation and application to a set of facts and that it is very frequently (although not always) possible to make legitimate arguments for different interpretations of it. And, it is hard, in advance, to know which of multiple different interpretations will wind up being found to be correct (with many legal issues in a case often never having those ambiguities resolved in that case because some other factor ends up making the ambiguous issues irrelevant).\n\nLawyers exist to make sure that every legitimate interpretation that benefits a represented party involved in an interaction to which the law applies is given fair consideration, with someone else generally making the final decision about what to do.",

Lawyers have a duty to advance their client's objectives, even if they personally disagree, as long as the action is not groundless, frivolous, vexatious, or illegal. They must provide sufficient counsel to ensure the client makes an informed decision, but ultimately must carry out the client's wishes if the client decides to proceed.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because outside counsel is not inherently more objective or neutral than in-house counsel.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in New York City. Brooklyn to be exact. And while this city is far from bike friendly, there are still a lot of bikes here. Including many bikes that are clearly abandoned and utter garbage in many cases.\n\nWhile the city often will go to abandoned bikes and remove them if you call in a complaint, this process is far from consistent or perfect.\n\nSo as a citizen who sees more than a few bike racks clogged with rusting bikes chained to them, what is the legality of me \u2014 as a private citizen \u2014\u00a0going up to these bikes with a few simple tools and stripping the bikes down to the bare frame?\n\nTo be clear, the bikes I am talking about are just junk at this point: Rusting drive chains and decrepit wheels with tires that are disintegrating and such. In many cases, small items such as the seat post and the stuff attached to the handle bars are gone. To any objective observer, these bikes are junk.\n\nBut my personal goal would be to dismantle them further \u2014 such as removing wheels and front forks and such \u2014 so they take up less space and thus freeing space up for people who want to legitimately lock their own bikes up?\n\nI realize in many localities, garbage is considered municipal property and you can\u2019t just legally pick someone\u2019s garbage \u2014 even though people indeed do this \u2014 but in the case of an abandoned bike, does where and what the bike is locked to matter? I assume if it were private property I own, I can just snip off the chains of anything locked to my fence without issue. But I have a feeling that bikes locked to public bike racks and sign posts fall under another legal umbrella.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is [an ordinance about abandoned bicycles](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYCrules/0-0-0-31052) which defines a derelict bicycle as well as a ghost bike (also \"public property\"). The key to removing the bicycle is that\n\n> In the event that a derelict bicycle is affixed to public property, a\n> notice shall be affixed to the derelict bicycle advising the owner\n> that such derelict bicycle must be removed within seven days from the\n> date of the notice. This notice shall also state that the failure to\n> remove such derelict bicycle within the designated time period will\n> result in the removal and disposal of the derelict bicycle by the\n> department of sanitation.\n\nThis ordinance is specifically addressed at the sanitation department. It does include a quasi\\-exception for ordinary citizens\n\n> Nothing in this section shall preclude the immediate removal of any\n> bicycle, including, but not limited to, a derelict bicycle or ghost\n> bike, or the taking of any other action by any city agency if the\n> presence of such bicycle which creates a dangerous condition by\n> restricting vehicular or pedestrian traffic, or otherwise violates the\n> law.\n\nWhat you should take away from the ordinances is that you are not legally authorized to remove a non\\-dangerous derelict bicycle.\n\nSupposing that you do take the law into your own hands, [this page](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/services/vehicles-property/property-clerk.page) would be useful to you, because you have to turn in any abandoned property to the proper authorities. The \"have to\" part comes from [this state law](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/personal-property-law/pep-sect-252.html): please note that non\\-compliance is a crime. There is a $20 threshold for the requirement to turn in the property. An abandoned bike may be lost property under the [statutory definition of lost property](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/personal-property-law/pep-sect-251.html):\n\n> Abandoned property, waifs and treasure trove, and other property which\n> is found, shall be presumed to be lost property and such presumption\n> shall be conclusive unless it is established in an action or\n> proceeding commenced within six months after the date of the finding\n> that the property is not lost property\n\nIt is thus legally risky to not turn an abandoned bike in to the police. The police would have the discretion to arrest you for theft for vigilante bike\\-cleanup, although I suspect they have other priorities. [Larceny](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-155-05.html) is defined thus:\n\n> A person steals property and commits larceny when, with intent to\n> deprive another of property or to appropriate the same to himself or\n> to a third person, he wrongfully takes, obtains or withholds such\n> property from an owner thereof.\n\nThis specifically includes \"acquiring lost property\". So it's not risk\\-free.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In New York City, a resident notices several abandoned, rusty bicycles locked to public bike racks. The resident wants to remove parts from these bikes to free up space. According to NYC ordinances and state laws, which of the following actions would be legally permissible for the resident to take?\n\nA) Immediately remove any bicycle parts that appear to be creating a dangerous condition for pedestrians or traffic.\nB) Remove bike parts after waiting 7 days from when they personally place a removal notice on the bicycle.\nC) Dismantle the bikes and keep any parts valued under $20, turning in only more valuable components to the police.\nD) Take no action to remove or dismantle the bicycles, instead reporting them to the Department of Sanitation for official removal.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the NYC ordinance, private citizens are not legally authorized to remove non-dangerous derelict bicycles. Only the Department of Sanitation has the authority to remove such bikes after proper notice has been given. The ordinance does allow for immediate removal if a bike creates a dangerous condition, but this must be done by a city agency, not a private citizen. Additionally, NY state law requires found property (which could include abandoned bikes) to be turned over to the police, with failure to do so potentially constituting larceny. Therefore, the legally permissible action for a resident is to report the abandoned bikes to the proper authorities and not take any removal actions themselves."

Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Miller), the Supreme Court found that the NFA was constitutional because short\\-barreled shotguns have no military uses. Assuming for the sake of argument that's true ([it's not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Model_1897#Military_use)), how can the machine gun clauses of the NFA be constitutional? Nobody would say machine guns have no military uses; in fact I'd guess weapons meeting the legal definition of machine guns are more common in the military than other weapons. So what gives?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because that\u2019s not what Miller says\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe court evaluated and expanded Miller in *[District of Columbia v. Heller](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/07-290.pdf)*, 554 U.S. 570 (2008\\) at p.52:\n\n> Read in isolation, Miller\u2019s phrase \u201cpart of ordi\u00ad nary military equipment\u201d could mean that only those weapons useful in warfare are protected. That would be a startling reading of the opinion, since it would mean that the National Firearms Act\u2019s restrictions on machineguns (not challenged in Miller) might be unconstitutional, machineguns being useful in warfare in 1939\\. We think that Miller\u2019s \u201cordinary military equipment\u201d language must be read in tandem with what comes after: \u201c\\[O]rdinarily when called for \\[militia] service \\[able\\-bodied] men were expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.\u201d 307 U. S., at 179\\. \u2026 We therefore read Miller to say only that the Second Amendment does not protect those weapons not typically possessed by law\\-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, such as short\\-barreled shotguns.\n\nAnd at p.54:\n\n> Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. From Blackstone through the 19th\\-century cases, commentators and courts rou\u00adtinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. \u2026Although we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws impos\u00ading conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n> \n> \n> We also recognize another important limitation on the\n> right to keep and carry arms. Miller said, as we have explained, that the sorts of weapons protected were those \u201cin common use at the time.\u201d \u2026\n> \n> \n> It may be objected that if weapons that are most useful in military service\u2014M\\-16 rifles and the like\u2014may be banned, then the Second Amendment right is completely detached from the prefatory clause. But as we have said, the conception of the militia at the time of the Second Amendment\u2019s ratification was the body of all citizens capable of military service, who would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty. It may well be true today that a militia, to be as effective as militias in the 18th century, would require sophisticated arms that are highly unusual in society at large. Indeed, it may be true that no amount of small arms could be useful against modern\\-day bombers and tanks. But the fact that modern developments have lim\u00adited the degree of fit between the prefatory clause and the protected right cannot change our interpretation of the right.\n\n\u201cNobody would say machine guns have no military uses\u201d \\- indubitably. However, nobody would say that they had a military use in the seventeenth century or that they are \u201ctypically possessed by law\\-abiding citizens for lawful purposes\u201d in the twenty\\-first. Either of these make the prohibition of machine guns constitutional.",

This is the likely outcome despite their often long years of patient waiting (unless the newly enacted law provides otherwise).\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### Background On The RAISE Act\n\n> The bill is co\\-sponsored by Republican senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas\n> and David Perdue of Georgia, who introduced the bill to the Senate on\n> February 13, 2017, as S. 354\\. The bill was referred to the Senate\n> Committee on the Judiciary.\n> \n> \n> On August 2, 2017, Cotton introduced a revised version of the bill,\n> designated S. 1720; this bill was also referred to the Senate\n> Committee on the Judiciary. President Donald Trump, along with Cotton\n> and Perdue, announced it at the White House. Within the Trump White\n> House, Trump advisers Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon promoted and\n> helped shape the bill. The bill has not attracted any additional\n> co\\-sponsors.\n> \n> \n> The 2017 bill did not receive a vote in the Senate. A separate bill to\n> restrict legal immigration, supported by Trump, Cotton, and Purdue,\n> was defeated in the Senate by a 39\u201360 vote. In 2019, Cotton, Perdue,\n> and other Republicans re\\-introduced the RAISE Act legislation.\n> \n> \n> Provisions and analysis\n> \n> \n> The bill would cut legal immigration by half, reducing the number of\n> green cards from more than 1 million to about 500,000\\. **The bill would\n> also remove pathways for siblings and adult children of U.S. citizens\n> and legal permanent residents to apply for permanent lawful residency\n> status in the U.S., limiting the family path to spouses and minor\n> children.** The bill would also impose a cap of 50,000 refugee\n> admissions a year and would end the visa diversity lottery.\n\nFrom [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAISE_Act) (citation omitted).\n\n### It Is Hard To Know\n\nUsually, the transition rules between one law and another are one of the final things dealt with in drafting legislation, they are often changed late in the legislative process (e.g. in a reconciliation between and U.S. House passed bill and a U.S. Senate passed bill in Conference Committee), are often drafted, in substance, by committee staff, in an inconsistent way from bill to bill, with little supervision from the responsible elected officials. Often transition provisions are omitted entirely from a bill.\n\nEven if the draft bill says one thing now, it is unlikely that it will be enacted in precisely that form with respect to the transition provisions (if any).\n\nWhen transition rules are omitted entirely, the agency charged with implementing the new law, the Justice Department, and the judiciary have to figure out what to do. Under a legal case called *[Chevron](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1983/82-1005)* an agency that administers a law has considerable discretion in how that law is implemented, to which the courts will defer, so long as the implementation is not contrary to any clear statutory direction.\n\n### General Concepts\n\nA core issue is whether someone has a vested right that cannot be taken from them without due process and compensation, or merely an expectancy that does not amount to a vested right. This distinction is rooted mostly in the 5th Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution to due process and to not have property taken without justice compensation, and, even though it is not directly applicable by its terms to Congress, in the contracts clause in Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution which provides that:\n\n> **No State shall** enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of\n> Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of\n> Debts; **pass any** Bill of Attainder, **ex post facto Law, or Law\n> impairing the Obligation of Contracts,** or grant any Title of\n> Nobility.\n\nThe 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states in the pertinent part:\n\n> No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property,\n> without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for\n> public use, without just compensation.\n\nTypically, someone who had a current visa in force might have some sort of vested right, while someone who merely had an application for a visa (or which what is colloquially called a \"green card\" is one type of many) that was pending would not. Even a visa in force, however, would not always include a right to convert that visa into citizenship.",

The passage indicates that pending applications that are not authorized under a new law would probably be summarily denied, even if applicants have been waiting for years. This aligns with the general concept that having a pending application typically does not create a vested right.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no indication that automatic conversion would occur. Option B is unlikely because the contracts clause explicitly applies to states, not the federal government, and pending applications generally don't create contractual rights.

Which of the following statements is correct regarding the child's eligibility for UK citizenship?\n\nA) The child can be registered as a British citizen immediately because Bob is becoming a British citizen.\n\nB) The child must move to the UK and reside there for at least 2 years before being eligible for registration as a British citizen.\n\nC) The child is not eligible for registration as a British citizen unless they cut ties with Bob's ex-wife and move to the UK.\n\nD) The child can apply for naturalization as a British citizen after turning 18, provided they move to the UK as Bob's dependent under the EU settlement scheme.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the child's other parent (Bob's ex-wife) is not British or settled in the UK, which is a requirement for immediate registration.\n\nB is incorrect because while residing in the UK for 2 years is a requirement for children over 13, this alone is not sufficient if the other parent is not British or settled in the UK.\n\nC is partially correct but overly restrictive. Cutting ties with the ex-wife would remove the ineligibility, but it's not the only or recommended path.\n\nD is correct because it provides a viable path to citizenship that takes into account the current situation. The child can move to the UK as Bob's dependent under the EU settlement scheme and then apply for naturalization after turning 18, which is the most realistic option given the circumstances."

Assume a car is the only asset anyone has in this scenario. \n\nPerson B steals a car from person A by forging the registration in a fraudulent manner.\n\nThen Person C steals the car.\n\nWhat happens to the car once everyone is caught? Does person A get the car back, or are they only able to collect damages from person B, who is broke? Does person C keep ownership of the car since they didn't steal from the legitimate owner, or do they give it back to A?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You cannot pass on [better title](https://saylordotorg.github.io/text_advanced-business-law-and-the-legal-environment/s12-02-title-from-nonowners.html) than you have\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe fraudster (B) in this scenario does not have good title in the car and so the thief (C) doesn't either: 1\\) because they are a thief and 2\\) because the person they stole it from didn't own it. If C had paid B for the car then C would still not own it because while they are no longer a thief, B still doesn't have good title. This is the case even if C didn't know that B didn't own the car. A is entitled to recover the car from whoever has it.\n\nThere are 3 exceptions to this rule:\n\n1. **Voidable title**: If B acquires title through a contract that is voidable (e.g. A is a minor) and then sells it to C. C as an owner in good faith owns the goods even if A voids the contract with B.\n2. **Entrustment**: If B has been entrusted the goods by A and sells them (perhaps by mistake) to C in the ordinary course of B's business. C as a good\\-faith buyer owns the goods. A can seek recompense from B but cannot get the goods from C. This probably needs an example, I take antique jewellery to an antique jeweller for cleaning, the jeweller's assistant mistakenly sells them, I lose the goods and the jeweller must compensate me.\n3. **Negotiable instruments**: Certain things, notably cash, cheques, shares and bearer bonds are subject to different rules. If B steals, say cash, from A and then uses that cash to buy something from C, A cannot demand the return of the cash from C unless they can prove that C knew that B had stolen it. Negotiable interests belong to anyone who acquired them in good faith.\n\nIn all cases, a good\\-faith actor who is out of pocket is owed compensation from the bad faith actor \\- whether it\u2019s possible to collect this is a practical rather than a legal issue.",

The principle of \"you cannot pass on better title than you have\" applies here. Person B acquired the car fraudulently and thus never had good title to pass to Person C. Even though Person C was a good-faith purchaser, they did not acquire valid ownership due to B's fraud. Person D's theft does not grant any rights.\n\nB is incorrect because although Person C was a good-faith purchaser, they bought from someone (Person B) who did not have valid title to sell. This scenario does not fall under the exceptions of voidable title, entrustment, or negotiable instruments.\n\nC is incorrect because theft never confers ownership rights, regardless of who was stolen from.\n\nD is incorrect because while the government might temporarily hold the car as evidence, they do not gain ownership rights in this scenario.\n\nThis question tests understanding of property law concepts, particularly the transfer of title and exceptions to the general rule."

While game mods are often considered derivative works and thus potentially infringing on copyright, Chrome extensions operate within a framework where Google has expressly allowed their use, even when they modify copyrighted websites. This permission from Google creates a legal environment where extensions are generally accepted, despite potentially altering the user experience of copyrighted sites.

Whether that is true or not depends on the law in your jurisdiction.\n\nFor example, in [australia](/questions/tagged/australia \"show questions tagged 'australia'\") there is no Goods and Services Tax (GST) payable on a gift because a gift is not a \"supply\" under the law. Technically, a value\\-added tax like the GST is not a sales tax but close enough.\n\nHowever, exchanging a \"gift\" for something of value (airline points, for example) is not a gift.\n\nOf course, Australian States and Territories levy Stamp Duty on the transfer of a vehicle's registration, and this is calculated on the sale price or the market price *whichever is the greater*. Also, technically, that's not a sales tax either.\n\nIf it's a tax avoidance scheme, then no *and* it's a crime\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nAssuming that there is no sales tax payable on a gift; if John and David entered into this arrangement (not a contract because of its illegal purpose) to avoid tax, then tax is payable *and* they are now criminals.\n\nIf the relevant tax authority learns what happened and decides to investigate, then John and David might have some explaining to do. If David can show that he has routinely given John large cash gifts on John's birthday, then they may convince the authority not to prosecute. If they can't, then they get to try to convince a judge.\n\nIt is not atypical for tax law to reverse the onus of proof: the government doesn't have to prove tax is payable, John and Dave have to prove it isn't.",

The close timing and equal value of the vehicle transfer and cash gift suggest they may be part of a structured transaction rather than independent events. Tax authorities often have the power to look beyond the form of a transaction to its substance. If investigated, John and David would bear the burden of proving these were genuine gifts rather than an attempt to avoid sales tax. If they cannot do so convincingly, they could face not only tax liability but also potential criminal charges for tax evasion.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Over the weekend, I was asked to be part of a photo shoot for a political candidate. I was wearing a t\\-shirt that featured a Star Wars character and the photographer stated that he wanted to position me in a fashion so it wasn't visible to avoid a, 'copyright issue'. (For those who are curious, the request was made last minute and I wasn't advised on clothing restrictions)\n\nAfter a certain point, it was determined that the ideal angle still was showing the Star Wars character, so they gave me a t\\-shirt featuring logos and imagery associated with a Major League Baseball (MLB) team.\n\nI'm trying to figure out why the MLB shirt wouldn't create a copyright issue for the photographer, while the Star Wars character would. Is it relating to the litigious nature of Disney (I really doubt this MLB team would sue) or is there something about MLB logos that are inherently fair use?\n\n---\n\nRegarding this potential [duplicate](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56173/11906) which questions whether a trademark can be used by a political campaign without permission and the most upvoted answer is of course, \"it depends,\" but for the equivalent scenario in my question it seems like it would not be allowed because of the logo's prominence in the photo. Thus it begs the question why is this copyrightable material acceptable and this one is not?\n\nTo clarify the issue, the MLB logo in particular is for the Philadelphia Phillies. As a team, they've had a variety of logos over the years and based on the answers provided thus far, it seems some may be subject to copyright and others would be subject to trademark depending upon the complexity of the art. In this specific case, it's this version of their logo:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4zhH5.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4zhH5.png)\n\nAs this is more than just stylized lettering, it seems this would presumably be subject to copyright.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the mention of a MLB shirt, I am going to assume the OP is located in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\").\n\nLogos are (in general) copyrightable\n------------------------------------\n\nAnything with a modicum of creative input is by default copyrighted. This includes both film shots from movies and logos of sports organizations.\n\n\"Modicum of creative input\" is known as the [threshold of originality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality). That legal doctrine is in force in the US, but not in other jurisdictions \\- for instance, the UK uses \"[sweat of the brow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_of_the_brow)\" where creativity is not needed to obtain copyright protection.\n\nA still shot from a film set almost surely passes the threshold of originality. However, some logos do not.\n\nFor instance, the Pittsburgh Pirates logo is a two\\-dimensional letter P \\- somewhat stylized, but not that much. It is arguably below the threshold of copyright protection. On the other hand, the Red Socks logos (which is, well, two red socks) is almost surely copyrighted.\n\nLet us assume that the logo or imagery present on the OP's photo shirt was indeed copyrighted. Does that make the photo a copyright violation?\n\nIncidental use\n--------------\n\nIt *might* be the case that having the artwork on the shirt as an incidental part of the photograph makes it OK. In the US, such incidental use could be covered by fair use, but as always, it\u2019s a delicate balancing act. A professional photograph taken for political advertisement is going to be held to a higher standard than a blurry photo from your aunt\u2019s Facebook gallery.\n\nDmitry Grigoryev says in comments that walking around with a Star Wars shirt could be construed as distributing (via public display) a copyrighted work. However, \"putting it on and walking around\" is an essential function of a shirt. Absent terms to the contrary, whoever sells a shirt with a copyrighted design grants an implied license to the shirt\\-wearer to move about with that shirt. \\[EDIT: see Mayken\u2019s comment, that\u2019s a statutory exception to copyright.] The scope of such implied licenses can be unclear, though, and it could arguably not extend to promotional photographs for political advertisements.\n\nNote [a recent case in Germany](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/urheberrechtsverletzung-durch-aufnahmen-von-hotelzimmern-mit-fototapete) [(link to judgement, in German)](https://www.justiz.nrw.de/nrwe/lgs/koeln/lg_koeln/j2022/14_O_350_21_Urteil_20220818.html) where it was held that a hotel posting online pictures of its rooms, including a wallpaper design, violated the copyright of the designer. I am not familiar enough with German copyright law to determine if an appeal of that lower\\-court decision would have any chance of success, but I think that ruling is reasonable within the general principles of EU copyright law. (Whether it is *morally* acceptable is of course another thing entirely.)\n\nNon\\-legal explanations\n-----------------------\n\nIt is also possible that the photographer or another PR staff member would rather have the politician associated with baseball than with Star Wars for image reasons, and copyright is only a pretext for that. Or that they (mistakenly) thought that the baseball shirt design was not copyrighted.",

The question highlights a common misconception about copyright law. Many logos, including those of MLB teams, can be subject to copyright protection if they meet the threshold of originality. The photographer's assumption that replacing one logo with another would avoid copyright issues may not be accurate.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because MLB logos are not automatically in the public domain; many are protected by copyright and/or trademark law.\n\nAnswer B is overly broad. While some uses might fall under fair use, not all uses of copyrighted logos in political photographs would automatically qualify as fair use.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because copyright protection doesn't inherently favor one type of logo over another. The level of protection depends on factors like originality and registration, not the industry or company size.\n\nThe question tests understanding of copyright principles, particularly as they apply to logos and incidental use in photographs, which are key concepts discussed in the provided information."

However, mail slots are different from mailboxes and are not subject to the same restrictions. Therefore, while only the USPS can legally use mailboxes, anyone can use a mail slot for various purposes, such as delivering personal notes or dropping off keys. This makes option C the correct answer. Options A and B are incorrect because they misstate the law regarding mailboxes and mail slots respectively. Option D is incorrect because it wrongly equates mail slots with mailboxes in terms of legal restrictions."

Recently I've written some [questions](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27391/question-about-using-wikipedia-content-about-cc-by-sa-license-about-its-cop) on law.stackexchange. People wrote answers to those questions, and also wrote some comments. I read these things and got some new thoughts from them. I'll refer to these as *stack\\_thoughts*. This is the **first source** of some new thoughts about my question.\n2. Also I wrote partly similar question to some other places through email, and received responses. I read those responses and got ideas which I'll refer to as *email\\_thoughts*. This is the **second source**.\n3. I also asked some questions on a talk page in my profile in Wikipedia. There, one can ask for some help, which I did. And I also received answers, from which I got *wiki\\_personal\\_thoughts*. This is the **Third source**.\n\nTo normally prolong my working on [this same problem](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27391/question-about-using-wikipedia-content-about-cc-by-sa-license-about-its-cop), I need to collect, join, analyze, and use thoughts from all three sources. I need to have possibility, to \"formulate\" this all thoughts, in all mentioned places. I can do this, in particular by two ways:\n\n* First. I can just blindly use them, write about them without mention of the sources where I got them.\n* Second. Before use all these thoughts I can ask for permission from the authors that are my sources. E.g. I can write a message, to each person who replied on my talk page in Wikipedia, about \\- can I use what they told me, in some other place, maybe on *stackexchange*. They might reply with a yes or a no.\n\n**So question is next:**  \n\nHow can I utilize normally, ethically, and legally information from these three resources (sources)?\n\nI know that there a lot on the internet about using copyrighted text resources \\- but what about personal email letters, and personal messages?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As per GDPR, we need to pseudonymize the name and email address. How can we pseudonymize name and email address? For example, is the below is correct way to pseudonymize?\n\n> Steve Anderson\n> Stxxx Axxdxrxn\n> \n> \n> test@testdomain.com\n> txxx@xxxxxxxxxx.com\n\nIs the above definition of pseudonymize is correct? Or we can reduce or increase the number of characters like,\n\n> Steve Anderson\n> Sxxx xxxrxn\n\nI want to implement this in my code but don't now how can I implement pseudonymized Name and Email properly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR does not prescribe how information should be pseudonymized and does not even define the term properly. Yet, pseudonymization is suggested as an safety measure in various places, so that pseudonymization should be implemented wherever appropriate.\n\nThe most useful guidance the GDPR gives is by contrasting pseudonymization with anonymization, where it says that pseudonymized data is still personal data because the data subjects can be identified using additional information (see [Recital 26 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-26/)). In contrast, re\\-identification is not reasonably likely for truly anonymized data.\n\nA common technique for pseudonymization is to replace identifying information with a pseudonym, for example replacing a name with a random numeric ID. However, this can only be considered pseudonymous if the mapping between the ID and the real value is not available to whoever uses this data.\n\nReplacing individual fields in a data set might not be sufficient for pseudonymization because apparently non\\-sensitive fields could still enable indirect identification. This requires careful analysis taking into account the entire context of the data, so it isn't possible to say whether merely removing names \\+ email addresses achieves pseudonymization or anonymization.\n\nWhat you are doing is redacting *parts* of sensitive data. I think this is a pretty weak pseudonymization method since it still leaks partial information about the true value, and leaks information about the length of the redacted value. It is possible to argue that this is OK (e.g. if you can show that you have multiple similar redactions so that you achieve a level of k\\-anonymity). But by default, such partial redactions are likely to be unsafe. Completely removing the sensitive data is much safer.\n\nThe \u201cArticle 29 Working Party\u201d, a pre\\-GDPR EU body, has published an [opinion on anonymization techniques in 2014 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp216_en.pdf). It does not account for the GDPR's specific phrasing, but provides an overview of pseudonymization and anonymization techniques and puts them into context of European data protection law. It considers how such guarantees guard against attacks such as singling out data subjects, linking multiple records of the same individual, and making inferences about the data subject.\n\nIn this guidance, pseudonymization techniques that are suggested include encrypting or hashing the sensitive data. However, the guidance warns that such techniques do not provide strong protection against singling out or linking records of the data subject.\n\nA bit earlier, the [UK ICO had published guidance on personal data, including on the matter of anonymization and pseudonymization (PDF)](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1061/anonymisation-code.pdf) with some good examples. For determining whether a data set has been successfully anonymized (or pseudonymized), they suggest a motivated intruder test: could someone without specialist knowledge or skills re\\-identify the data subject? In your example, such a person should not be able to infer that a record about `Stxxx Axxdxrxn` is about a `Steve Anderson`. In my opinion, your pseudonymization approach would fail the motivated intruder test unless you have multiple records that could all be about Steve Anderson (compare k\\-anonymity).",

The GDPR does not provide specific prescriptive guidelines for pseudonymization (eliminating option D), nor does it require the use of random numeric IDs in all cases (eliminating option A). Partial redaction of sensitive data, as described in option B, is considered a weak form of pseudonymization that may not be sufficient in many cases. \n\nThe most accurate statement is C, which aligns with the guidance provided by data protection authorities. The \"motivated intruder test,\" suggested by the UK ICO, is a method to evaluate whether pseudonymization techniques are effective. This test asks whether someone without specialist knowledge could re-identify individuals from the pseudonymized data. This approach takes into account the context of the data and the potential risks of re-identification, which is crucial for effective pseudonymization under the GDPR."

But if the truthful answer uncovers a criminal matter that would incriminate the witness, can she refuse to answer on grounds of Fifth Amendment, even if it is civil case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [McCarthy v. Arndstein](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/266/34/), 266 U.S. 34, the Supreme Court declared that\n\n> The privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of the\n> proceeding in which the testimony is sought or is to be used.

S. 445 likewise finds that the privilege\n\n> can be asserted in any proceeding, civil or criminal, administrative\n> or judicial, investigatory or adjudicatory, and it\n> protects against any disclosures that the witness reasonably believes\n> could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other\n> evidence that might be so used.\n\nThere may be some confusion over criminal vs. civil cases, so first we should restate the self\\-incrimination clause:\n\n> nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against\n> himself\n\nThere are many ways that this language can be interpreted, for example it could mean that a person who is a criminal defendant cannot be compelled to testify against themselves in that case; or that the protection applies to a *possible, future* criminal case against them (when they are the defendant in a criminal trial); or when they are a non\\-defendant witness in some criminal trial. Instead, the courts interpret the privilege as protection against *any* being compelled to testify, when that testimony has a tendency to incriminate.\n\nThe line that exists, w.r.t. civil cases, is that you can be compelled to testify against your civil case interest \u2013 you can be compelled to testify that you breached a contract, for example. When testifying in a criminal case, you can be compelled to testify to a breach of contract.

As established by the Supreme Court in cases like McCarthy v. Arndstein and Kastigar v. United States, the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination applies in both civil and criminal proceedings. The key factor is not the nature of the current case, but whether the testimony could potentially be used in a future criminal prosecution or lead to evidence that could be so used. The witness can invoke this privilege if they reasonably believe their answers could incriminate them in a potential criminal matter, even if they are testifying in a civil case and are not currently under investigation. Options A and B are incorrect because they misstate the scope of Fifth Amendment protections. Option D is incorrect because the standard is the witness's reasonable belief, not the judge's determination of definite prosecution."

There are approved devices and procedures, and there is the other stuff. In an emergency that is life\\-threatening or threatens severe debilitation, it is permitted for a physician to try an extreme measure \u2013 if the state has a \"Right to Try\" law. Otherwise, a review and official approval by the relevant IRB is required. The devices are regulated by the FDA, but the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine, so the feds don't have a say in whether a procedure is allowed. Nevertheless, use of unapproved devices can be taken to be evidence of failing to meet the required standard of care, in the case of a malpractice suit or punitive action by the state regulatory board.\n\nThere is no specific law prohibiting removing lots of organs and replacing them with prostheses, though arguable what happened was that the brain was removed (it's not that a replacement shell was built around the person). Ordinarily, intentionally \"killing\" a person is illegal (except in case of sanctioned execution or self\\-defense). There is zero case law that would tell us whether removing a brain from a body \"kills\" the person.

The restaurant reluctantly accepted it but told me that this card incurs a higher fee to them. The next day after my meal, they refused to accept this same credit card. I happened to carry enough cash with me and paid with cash instead.\n\nMy question: Do I have the legal right to insist on making the payment with my Discover credit card? If not, what if I only carry one Discover credit card with me? That is, what if this is the only payment method that I can offer?\n\nJust a side note: [Discover's website](https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/help-center/faqs/acceptance.html) says that \"Discover is accepted nationwide by 99% of the places that take credit cards.\" But practically many places have the ability to charge a Discover card but prefer not accept it. Not a legal issue but a frustrating observation.\n\n**Edit** I called Discover customer service and here is their response:\n\n> Just go to places where Discover Credit Cards are accepted.\n\nDoesn't sound very helpful.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have the legal (contractual) obligation to pay the amount that you owe for your meal. The restaurant can refuse to accept a particular kind of payment, such as check, cash, credit cards (generally or brand\\-specific), various cash\\-transfer programs, foreign currency, bitcoin or ridiculous numbers of pennies. There is no requirement that they do today what they did yesterday.\n\nIf you have in your possession only a Discover card, and if they are unwilling to accept service barter as payment (washing dishes is classical), then you would have a debt to the restaurant which you must pay in a reasonable time, using an acceptable medium (such as cash, unless they don't accept cash). They cannot make it impossible or highly burdensome for you to discharge your obligation (e.g. they cannot demand Krugerrands or [Mongolian \u1832\u1825\u182d\u1826\u1837\u1822\u182d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_t%C3%B6gr%C3%B6g) as the alternative payment, unless you are in Mongolia).\n\nYou were given advance notice of this possibility of non\\-acceptance, yet you willfully proffered a card that you knew that they were not likely to accept a second time. Your hands were not clean, and if this had gone to court, you could not expect mercy from the court on the grounds that you were surprised that they didn't accept your card.",

The customer only has their Discover card with them. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal obligations of both parties?\n\nA) The restaurant is legally required to accept the Discover card since they accepted it previously.\nB) The customer has the right to insist on using their Discover card as it's their only form of payment.\nC) The restaurant can refuse the Discover card, but must provide an alternative payment method for the customer.\nD) The restaurant can refuse the Discover card, and the customer is obligated to find an acceptable payment method within a reasonable time frame.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The restaurant has the right to refuse specific forms of payment, even if they accepted them previously. They are not obligated to accept credit cards or any particular brand of credit card. The customer has a legal obligation to pay for the meal they received, but the restaurant can determine which payment methods they will accept. If the customer cannot pay immediately with an acceptable method, they still owe the debt and must arrange to pay it within a reasonable time using a method the restaurant will accept. The customer does not have the right to insist on a particular payment method, and the restaurant is not required to provide alternative payment options on the spot."

If so, is it also legal if I download illegally redistributed model files and use them for the same purpose? Obviously redistributing is illegal, but is consuming?\n\nI also want to state that I have always assumed distributing fan art is legal, even if I did use copyrighted assets as references and even if they are trademarked (I see it everywhere in drawings, etc., so long as I don't use it for profit or any other personal gain...?) If someone could definitively clear that up for me, that'd be great.\n\n(Also a possibly related question, though I understand if it should be separate, but would uploading full renders of ripped models to a website be legal, as long as it's not the model itself?)\n\nThanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Creating copies of a work is generally illegal, since the right \"to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies\" and the right \"to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work\" are both exclusive rights of the copyright holder. If you don't distribute those copies, though, it could be quite difficult for the copyright holder to know anything about it. Whether you acquired the original work legally or illegally has no bearing on the legality of making copies and derivatives.\n\nFan art is generally [*prima facie*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/prima_facie) copyright infringement, since it creates a derivative work without permission from the copyright holder. However, it may be permissible under fair use \\-\\- but remember that \"permissible under fair use\" means that when you *are being sued*, you may be able to convince a judge that your use is fair, despite being *prima facie* copyright infringement. It is possible that a particular fan work could be sufficiently transformative and well\\-aligned with the [four fair use factors](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/) to qualify as fair use, but there's no way to know until it is the subject of legal action and a judge assesses the case. \n\nYou see fan art everywhere, despite its unfavorable legal status, because in general, it is not worth the trouble for artists, authors, and corporations to pursue legal action. They will probably see no tangible benefit to justify their legal expenses, since, unlike verbatim copying of their works, fan art does not typically impact their profits. Furthermore it could be harmful to their reputation to be aggressively litigious against their own fans.\n\nTrademark is only relevant if you are using the mark in commerce to identify the source of goods or services. I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not well equipped to discuss whether your use of a well\\-known trademarked character would automatically constitute trademark infringement because a reasonable person would assume that your fan art's use of the trademarked character was licensed and approved by the trademark holder.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A video game enthusiast creates high-poly 3D models of characters from a popular game series, using ripped assets from the original game as reference. They post renders of these models on their personal blog without monetization. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) This is completely legal as long as the original game was legally obtained and the models are not redistributed.\n\nB) This action is protected under fair use since it's transformative and non-commercial.\n\nC) This is prima facie copyright infringement, but the copyright holder is unlikely to pursue legal action.\n\nD) This is legal because fan art is always permitted under copyright law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. Creating derivative works without permission, such as 3D models based on copyrighted game characters, is prima facie copyright infringement. This is true even if the original game was legally obtained and the new works are not monetized. While fan art is widespread, it's not automatically legal or protected under fair use. Fair use is a defense that can only be definitively determined by a judge in the event of a lawsuit. \n\nHowever, copyright holders often choose not to pursue legal action against fan artists for several reasons:\n1. It may not be financially beneficial to do so.\n2. It could harm their reputation among fans.\n3. Fan art often doesn't significantly impact their profits.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the legality of the action doesn't depend on whether the original game was legally obtained. \nAnswer B is incorrect because fair use is not automatically granted for non-commercial or transformative works; it's a complex legal defense.\nAnswer D is incorrect because fan art is not always permitted under copyright law; it's often technically infringing but tolerated."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can you seize a company's intellectual property if it was created using your platform? Can you put something in the user agreement that allows you to seize any intellectual property created using your platform? Let's say you have a game called Warcraft, and the Real Time Strategy game allows people to create other games out of it. Can you forbid companies or people to take their games out of your game or platform and make their own game using their own platform or someone's else platform, or take ownership of the intellectual property? I am thinking such an abusive user agreement would not be upheld in a court of law, but I could be wrong. Let's assume this is in the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, *you* cannot seize anything. The courts can, and you can ask the courts to do so for you. So the logic of this is that you operate a website that hosts software that creates something for a user. You could just unconditionally let people use it, you could require a subscription, or you could be like SE and put up a TOS with some conditions, like \"you grant us a perpetual license to use your stuff\". Users then have to agree to this in order to get access to your software.\n\nSo the answer to your question depends on whether you can write a legally\\-enforceable contract where you provide something of value in exchange for a user giving you something of value. Then if you hold up your end of the deal and the customer does not, you sue them in court for damages. The main questions are, is such a contract enforceable, and what would be the remedy that the court might order?\n\nYour description of your scheme is a bit sketchy, so I'll fill in some details. The user must submit a functioning software package, which your service plugs into some slot on a platform and makes accessible to others. That's it. In exchange, the customer transfers copyright to your company. This is unenforceable (in the US), because a copyright transfer is governed by [17 USC 204](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/204), which required a written instrument of conveyance signed by the rights owner. This precludes Human Centipad trick\\-transfers \u2013 the rights holder has to actually know and agree.\n\nNext pass, your TOS requires the rights holder to grant a perpetual, unpaid exclusive license to use the stuff. That means you still hold copyright, but you can't do much with it. There's a [revocation window](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/203) open for 5 years, 35 years later, a bit late in the software game. Well, the courts [treat this as a copyright transfer](https://casetext.com/case/fathers-daughters-nev-llc-v-lingfu-zhang). The similarity between your (modified) idea and Fathers \\& Daughters is that the original copyright owner is not a \"beneficial owner\" because they do not receive royalties. Again, I take it your goal is to sneak in the effect of a copyright transfer without alerting the user.\n\nFinally, you include a royalties clause: we've got a contract. But now we've strayed from the notion of \"seizing\". Perpetual licenses are legal, exclusive licenses are legal. You would have to sue the copyright owner for damages if you grant a perpetual exclusive license (for money) and then they grant someone else a license to use. You as platform operator be awarded whatever you had arguable lost from their breach of contract. The courts would not \"seize\" anything other than, perhaps, the other party's assets.",

CreativeSoft wants to maximize its control over user-created content. Which of the following approaches would be most likely to give CreativeSoft enforceable rights over user-created mods in the United States?\n\nA) Include a clause in the Terms of Service stating that CreativeSoft automatically gains ownership of all intellectual property created using their platform.\n\nB) Require users to grant CreativeSoft a perpetual, unpaid exclusive license to use any content created on the platform.\n\nC) Include a clause in the Terms of Service allowing CreativeSoft to seize any intellectual property created using their platform at will.\n\nD) Offer users a contract granting them access to the platform in exchange for a perpetual, paid license to use their created content, with specific royalty terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is not enforceable because copyright transfers require a written instrument signed by the rights owner, as per 17 USC 204. \nOption B would likely be treated as a copyright transfer by courts, which again requires explicit agreement from the rights holder. \nOption C is not legally possible, as only courts can seize property, not private companies. \nOption D is the most legally sound approach. It creates a valid contract with consideration on both sides (platform access for license rights), includes payment (addressing the \"beneficial owner\" issue), and doesn't attempt to sneakily transfer copyright. While it doesn't give CreativeSoft full ownership, it provides the strongest enforceable rights among the options presented."

I grant it might, yet this could only be to make place for another nomination by himself. The person ultimately appointed must be the object of his preference, though perhaps not in the first degree. **It is also not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled.** The Senate could not be tempted, by the preference they might feel to another, to reject the one proposed; because they could not assure themselves, that the person they might wish would be brought forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination. They could not even be certain, that a future nomination would present a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them; and as their dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected, and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of the chief magistrate, it is not likely that their sanction would often be refused, where there were not special and strong reasons for the refusal.\n\nand in [No 78](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed78.asp):\n\n> It equally proves, that though individual oppression may now and then proceed from the courts of justice, the general liberty of the people can never be endangered from that quarter; I mean so long as the judiciary remains truly distinct from both the legislature and the Executive. For I agree, that **\"there is no liberty, if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.\"**\n\nHe was wrong about the first but right about the second.\n\nNow, this is only the way he saw it and others no doubt had other views but he was focused solely on balancing the powers of the executive and the legislature. There is no consideration of what would happen if, for whatever reason, including partisanship, the executive and the legislature were tightly aligned or hopelessly opposed.\n\nEven for the time, this view seems overly idealistic and hopelessly naive. However, these are the same people who thought it would be a good idea for the runner\\-up in the Presidential race to be the vice\\-President.\n\nIndeed, Hamilton saw and was an integral part of the intense partisanship that arose in the 1790s between the Federalists and the Republicans and the first rejection of a Supreme Court nominee happened during George Washington's Presidency.\n\nThis [analysis](https://theconversation.com/partisan-supreme-court-battles-are-as-old-as-the-united-states-itself-146657) shows that the confirmation rate when the White House and Senate are politically aligned is 87\\.2% but only 47\\.2% when they are different. That said, most (78%) nominees have been confirmed with the last decade being about average.\n\n**[The US Supreme Court has always been partisan.](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/04/03/the-supreme-court-has-never-been-apolitical-00022482)**\n\nIndeed, it's only since the Second World War that the idea that it shouldn't be has taken root.

The LHD responds, \"we had implied consent\", and the patient begrudgingly accepts. \n\nHowever, let us now suppose that the patient realises, \"hey, express refusals always override claims of implied consent.\" So he prepares an express refusal to consent to the use of his health records for training purposes and delivers it to the LHD. \n\nThe express refusal notice is lawful.

They have violated the patient's privacy right when consent was expressly withdrawn, and they discovered that they cannot easily comply and therefore did not comply.\n\nThe fact that they have made it expensive for themselves to comply with their legal obligations going forward does not imply that they lacked implied consent at the outset, so they should have no liability for the time period from when the training materials started to be used until the time when implied consent ended. They are only responsible going forward for their failure to honor the patient's wishes.\n\nIt is not at all exceptional for a legal obligation to turn out to be more difficult to comply with when it arises than was anticipated when the systems that make the legal obligation difficult to comply with were implemented. \n\nHealth care companies aren't expected to be prophets who can foresee the complex confluence of factors that has painted them in a corner, particularly when a situation has never come up before the current one. It is likely that no one person was ever even simultaneously aware of all the facts necessary to know that this could happen. Someone in the IT department will often not be intimately familiar with what is going on in the training part of the operation and what the privacy rules that apply are and even if someone was, that someone may have been in no position to do anything about it at the time.\n\nHealth care providers aren't supposed to be evaluated with 20\\-20 hindsight.

I'm thinking \"due process\" with a line through it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sending a letter to the red light camera company or police department may or may not get the charge dropped before trial. But whether the charge gets dropped before trial isn't the important question \\-\\- after all, people sometimes do get charged wrongly \\-\\- rather, the question is, if it goes to trial, whether you will win.\n\nSince this question is about California, all traffic tickets in California, including red light camera tickets, are criminal cases (that's why the case will be named \"People of the State of California v. \\[your name]\" in court documents). The burden of proof is on the prosecution, and the standard of evidence is \"beyond a reasonable doubt\". There is no provision in California law to fine or otherwise punish the owner of a vehicle for a moving violation, except through a conviction as the driver who committed the violation.\n\nIf you plead not guilty and it goes to trial, the burden will be on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the driver was you. If the driver in the picture does not look like you, there is no way they can meet that burden, and the court must find you not guilty. (In most cases the prosecution will immediately drop the case when they discover that the picture does not look like you.) Note that you have an absolute right to not testify in your own criminal trial where you are the defendant, so there is no way they can force you to testify at the trial about who the driver was if it was not you (which would be irrelevant to the case against you anyhow).\n\nIf you do not say who the driver was, and the police department fail to guess who it was (e.g. by searching for drivers whose licenses share the same address as you for someone who looks like the one in the picture), then nobody gets fined or punished for the violation. This is true even if you know full well who the driver was, or even if you were pictured sitting right next to them. You don't need to claim not to know who the driver was, because whether you know or not doesn't matter \\-\\- you have no legal obligation to tell the identity of the driver even if you know, and you cannot be fined or otherwise punished for the violation if you intentionally refuse to tell.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the owner's legal situation?\n\nA) The owner is legally obligated to identify the driver to avoid being held responsible for the violation.\n\nB) The owner can be fined or punished for the violation if they refuse to identify the driver.\n\nC) If the owner pleads not guilty and goes to trial, the burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the owner was the driver.\n\nD) The owner must testify in court about who was driving the vehicle if the case goes to trial.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In California, red light camera tickets are treated as criminal cases. The burden of proof is on the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant (in this case, the vehicle owner) was the driver who committed the violation. The owner has no legal obligation to identify the driver, cannot be punished for refusing to do so, and has the right not to testify in their own criminal trial. Options A and B are incorrect because the owner is not legally required to identify the driver or face punishment. Option D is incorrect because the owner has the right to remain silent and cannot be forced to testify about who was driving."

The legality of the drone operation depends on the specific power plant and any applicable federal flight restrictions. As mentioned in the documentation, in the United States, airspace is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Some larger power plants, like Hoover Dam, have specific flight restrictions, while smaller plants, like local natural-gas peaking plants, may not. The operator must check current NOTAMs (Notices to Airmen) and FAA restrictions for the specific area before flying.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand it, the 2019 general election in the UK was held because of the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019\\.\n\nIn this hypothetical, Parliament has passed a statute that imposes a requirement on any future legislation written to trigger a general election: it can only pass the Commons with a 3/5 majority of a quorum. We'll call this Act A.\n\nA few years down the line, a bill to initiate a general election is proposed in the Commons which includes a provision that it can pass the Commons with a simple majority vote while a quorum is present, contrary to Act A. Nevertheless, the bill passes both chambers of Parliament with a simple majority, in accordance with the wording of the aforementioned provision (which does not expressly repeal Act A or make any explicit reference to it, but does state that it only applies to this bill), and it receives Royal Assent to become Act B.\n\nAct B is challenged in court on the basis that it is an unconstitutional act of Parliament, because the requirement of Act A was not met, and the provision that allowed Act B to come into law with a simple majority vote was not law at the time Act B received Royal Assent. Therefore, it should be nullified. But if any court were to strike down Act B, wouldn't that go against parliamentary sovereignty?\n\nDo the dicta in R. (Jackson) v. Attorney General come into the discussion at all? Or would this bill never even be able to get to the stage of Royal Assent?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Bill** B is not an Act until it proceeds through Parliament and receives Royal Assent. Therefore it doesn't matter what its provisions say; it must follow the rules described in **Act** A. If it doesn't, there is no Act B.\n\nIt's not a matter of constitutionality, as that has limited meaning when we're talking about Acts of Parliament. It's more that Parliament itself can determine its own processes through Acts, which apply to future Bills before they can become Acts.\n\nThere is precedent for this. The [Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Acts_1911_and_1949) allow the Commons to pass a Bill without the agreement of the Lords, subject to certain conditions and delays. A number of Acts have been passed in this way (including the Parliament Act 1949, which amended the 1911 Act), and their validity [has been challenged in court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Acts_1911_and_1949#Validity_of_the_1949_Act). So far, all the relevant Acts have been found to be valid.\n\nIf a court can find that an Act of Parliament is valid, it implies that it could find one invalid. While this could be seen as a court \"striking down\" an Act, the argument would (I imagine) be made that there was no Act in the first place.",

I had this same job for the past two years, and I was paid for 8 hours while only working 5 hours each week, and the department was fully aware of this. They hired me again without indicating things had changed until after I signed the form.\n\nI spoke with the person who sent the email, and she said that she was sorry I misinterpreted the statement \"ALL TUTORS ARE PAID 8 HOURS, unless told otherwise,\" and that it actually means that it is expected that people with my position will work at most 8 hours. I expected she would say that I am now being \"told otherwise,\" so the contract had not been violated, but that was not the case.\n\nIt seems like my university may have done something wrong, but I'm not sure. In particular:\n\n* The sheet I signed seems pretty informal, and it was clearly made by someone in the department just for this position. It's not some government form with a name. Does that mean it isn't legally binding?\n* If it is legally binding, does the phrase \"unless told otherwise\" mean that it has not been violated? It seems like the moral thing to do would probably be to tell me before starting to work, but maybe its still legal to do it afterwards. The department totally thinks that the sheet is being violated, but it's possible they're in the clear without realizing it.\n* Even if it is a binding contract and it has been violated, does that mean anything? Am I supposed to just quit and look for a job elsewhere, or is there something else I ought to do?\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not necessary for an agreement to be verbose and written by a lawyer, for it to be binding. There is some danger in having untrained people writing up agreements (they don't know the distinction between \"what the law says\" versus \"what we had in mind\"). The agreement is binding, but their interpretation of the contract language does not automatically prevail.\n\nThe statement \"ALL TUTORS ARE PAID 8 HOURS, unless told otherwise\" is slightly problematic since it is not true (you can't pay time, you pay money *for* time spend). With no other statements about time and payment, and just looking at the words, this says that an employee will be paid for 8 hours work, period. Unless they say something different. That could mean \"even if you work 20 hours, you only get paid for 8\" (illegal under various labor laws), or it could be \"even if you only work 2 hours, you get paid for 8\" (the most reasonable interpretation). The interpretation \"You are limited to 8 hours of work per pay period / contract\" is not a reasonable interpretation: that isn't what the clause says. Such a limit could be clearly expressed (\"can work up to 8 hours\" is a clear way to state the limit), and since they didn't say anything like that, that is not how the courts will read the clause. They can, however, inform you otherwise, e.g. say \"your minimum automatic pay is now 2 hours\", or \"we will only guarantee 2 hours work\", and at that point that's what the number is. Since this is (presumably) a take\\-it or leave it contract which they wrote up and you didn't actually negotiate, any unclarities are legally interpreted in your favor.\n\nIf you have worked more than 8 hours and they are using the contract language to argue that you won't be paid for the overage, that is not at all likely to hold up in court. Under terms of the contract (interpreted as stating a minimum guarantee of hours), they *can* inform you that your new minimum is 0 hours. Also, unless there is some kind of tenure clause, they can terminate the contract at will, and maybe they'll hire you under a different contract.\n\nWhat the terms of employment were for you in the past does not matter, what matters is what the current terms are. If you did not pay attention to the fact that they changed the terms of the agreement as of this quarter, that is not their problem. If they decided to change to \"actual hours worked\" after the current contract was formed, and they informed you of that fact later, then thereafter that is what the agreement is. Until you are notified of that change, the guaranteed minimum is what it says in the contract.\n\nIn case their argument is \"The university sets this policy, the department made a mistake in not informing you\", the university has to take responsibility for the errors of their inferiors.",

A failure to hold any hearing after *ex parte* relief has been granted, or a ruling either way on a preliminary injunction following a hearing, however, is subject to appellate review, so there is much more case law on these issues.\n\nIf you ask for an *ex parte* order, the court could decide to instead hold a hearing first if the request doesn't seem sufficiently urgent to the judge.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, two or three weeks is almost never urgent enough to justify an *ex parte* order, and judges like to hold hearings if they can if the other side's lawyer can be identified and scheduled in for a hearing promptly enough to prevent the issue from becoming moot.\n\nWhen there is a government defendant, that already has a lawyer who is usually available for emergency matters on short notice, a judge will be more reluctant to grant an *ex parte* order than in a case with a private defendant with no counsel retained already in relation to the case.\n\nAnother factor is the amount of time that would be required to comply with an order if one was issued.
