Would it possibly be ineligible for copyright?\n\nFor instance, let's say that I go to Stack Overflow because a Python math function like math.modf is not working. I then see a Stack Overflow post explaining that to make math functions work, you need to enter this line:\n\n`import math`\n\nIf I copy and paste the `import math` code into my own program, then release it under a non\\-Creative Commons license, does that mean that I am violating copyright? I'm doubtful that this would be the case due to the originality requirement within U.S. copyright law:\n\n> **The Originality Requirement**\n\n> Originality is \u201cthe bedrock principle of copyright\u201d and \u201cthe very premise of copyright law.\u201d Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340, 347 (1991\\) (citation omitted).\n\n> \u201cTo qualify for copyright protection, a work must be original to the author,\u201d which means that the work must be \u201cindependently created by the author\u201d and it must possess \u201cat least some minimal degree of creativity.\u201d Id. at 345 (citations omitted)\n> \n> \n> [Source](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf)\n\nThe above chapter goes on to say that:\n\n> \u201c\\[T]here is nothing remotely creative\u201d about a work that merely reflects \u201can age\\-old practice, firmly rooted in tradition and so commonplace that it has come to be expected as a matter of course.\u201d\n\nA line like `import math` does not strike me as very creative; rather, it is simply a required bit of code for getting Python's math library to run within a program. I doubt it would be necessary to rewrite the code as `import math as m` when `import math` works just fine.\n\nIn other words, I am wondering if the originality requirement implies that some code snippets on Stack Overflow may not be original enough to be copyrightable in the U.S. Please let me know your thoughts.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n1. I do not believe that [this FAQ post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12527/do-i-have-to-worry-about-copyright-issues-for-code-posted-on-stack-overflow), while informative, addresses this specific question, since that post does not make any reference to the originality requirement for U.S. copyright. The answer to that post states, in part, that \"Anything that you post to Stack Overflow will be under the terms of the Creative Commons license.\" However, I believe there are cases (such as the one in my example above) where a code snippet may not qualify for a Creative Commons copyright because it fails to meet the originality requirement. In fact, such cases may be substantial, especially for beginner\\-level questions that address general programming conventions.\n2. tpg2114 pointed out in the Meta forum (where this question had originally been posted) that a detailed explanation \\+ import math or similarly non\\-original code block \\+ detailed explanation as a whole would qualify for a CC license. I think my main concern is about situations where the code provided is the widely accepted best practice for a particular language, rather than someone's original creative work. In other words, if the line of code reflects how thousands of programmers around the world would accomplish a task because it's the best way to do so, I'm just doubtful whether a copyright license would apply.\n3. tpg2114 also helped me realize that a relevant question here is: if something can't be copyrighted, does it qualify for a Creative Commons license? The following quotes from the Creative Commons website indicate that material that can't be copyrighted also can't have a Creative Commons license applied to it:\n\n> 1. \"CC licenses do not contractually impose restrictions on uses of a work where there is no underlying copyright.\"\n\n> 2. \"CC licenses are operative only when applied to material in which a copyright exists, and even then only when a particular use would otherwise not be permitted by copyright.\"\n\n> 3. \"You should also not apply Creative Commons licenses to works that are no longer protected by copyright or are otherwise in the public domain.\"  \n> \n> Source for all 3 quotes\n\n4. This raises a new question: even if a post \\+ code snippet as a whole are eligible for Creative Commons (due to the originality expressed in the text, for instance), if the code snippet by itself does not qualify for copyright because it's similar to import math, would I be able to use that without releasing my own program under Creative Commons?\n\nI believe the following quote may help answer this question:\n\n> \"To constitute an adaptation \\[which would need to be licensed under CC\\-BY\\-SA as well if the source was CC\\-BY\\-SA], the resulting work itself must be considered based on or derived from the original. This means that if you use a few lines from a poem to illustrate a poetry technique in an article you\u2019re writing, your article is not an adaptation because your article is not derived from or based on the poem from which you took a few lines.\" [Source](https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/4-4-remixing-cc-licensed-work/)\n\nSo in other words, if I take an excerpt like import math from a CC\\-BY\\-SA post on Stack Overflow and incorporate it into a larger project, my project may not be an adaptation of the Stack Overflow post, and therefore I may not need to release my project under CC\\-BY\\-SA as well. I say \"may not\" because (1\\) I'm not a lawyer, and (2\\) the code snippet isn't just an illustration or an example, but rather plays an important role in the functioning of my actual program.\n\n5. I also found [this helpful article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-code-snippets-violate-copyright-law-russ-pearlman/) from an attorney that addresses whether simple code snippets can be copyrighted: However, this article states that Stack Overflow posts are covered by CC\\-BY, when in fact they're covered under CC\\-BY\\-SA.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are in general correct, KBurchfiel. A code snippet such as\n\n```\nimport math;\n\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nFor i := 1 to 10  \n  print i;\n\n```\n\nhas no originality, and is not protected by copyright. A post eplaining the meaning an usage of such a snippet might well be original enough to be protected by US copyright, indeed it probably would. But the code on its own would not be. Anyone could read such a post, and if s/he understood it, use the code snippet and not be in violation of copyright, not compelled to place the entire program in which such a snippet was used under a CC\\-\\=BY\\-SA license.\n\nThe creative commons people would prefer that a CC license not be applied to a publication that is not protected by copyright, and if it is so applied it is legally meaningless. But they have no legal way to enforce such a preference.\n\nA stack exchange post that consisted of **nothing** but such an uncopyrightable code snippet, with no explanation r discussion, might well be downvoted or even deleted. But that is a matter of site policy on what is a useful answer, not a matter of copyright.\n\nUsing an excerpt from a copyrighted work so small that the excerpt alone would be uncopyrightable, would probably be fair use under US law, and might well be fair dealing in UK law.\n\nSomething that is fair use does not compel the reuser to abide by the terms of a CC license, because those terms apply **only** when the content could not be reused without the CC license's permission.\n\nHowever, a code snippet does not need to be very much more original than the above examples before it becomes copyrightable. Whether it can be used via fair use rather than via the CC\\-BY\\-SA license is a very fact\\-based decision (the usual four\\-factor analysis is spelled out in 17 USC 107\\).. But if the snippet can be rewritten to express the same concepts but in a different expression, then there is no copyright issue, and again the CC license will not apply.\n\nIf the snippet is complex and original enough to be copyrightable (a fairly low bar) and it is re\\-used unchanged, under conditions where fair use does not apply, then the CC\\-BY\\-SA license's terms must be complied with for the use to be legal. That is several \"IFs\" however.

Instead, it is done mostly piecemeal. Some of the more important laws in Massachusetts are:\n\n* In Massachusetts, the age of majority is eighteen. (Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 231, section 85P)\n* In most circumstances, a contract will be invalid if one party to the contract is a minor. Massachusetts recognizes a few exceptions for necessaries and education, motor vehicle liability insurance (if age sixteen or older), and life insurance (for age 15 or older). (Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 175 sections 113K and 128 and court decisions).\n* A minor may file a lawsuit against another party though a \u201cnext friend,\u201d representative, or guardian ad litem (Rules of Civil Procedure 17(b)).\n\nOther state statutes govern the voting age, tobacco purchasing age, the age at which one can work at particular kinds of jobs, consent to medical treatment, the age of consent for purposes of statutory rape laws (which are generally below age eighteen), the ages for which marriage is possible (without parental or court consent, with court consent, and with parental consent), status as a child for purposes of child support and custody cases, status as a child for purposes of tolling statutes of limitations during minority, statutes of limitations in paternity cases, and ages at which school attendance is mandatory.\n\nFederal law sets an age limit of eighteen years old to act in pornographic material and for moving someone across state lines for the purpose of having sex with them, even though the age of consent in a non\\-commercial, private context is lower.\n\nAlso, for some purposes, an eighteen year old is not an adult.

These are the rights that a software developer may grant for software they have developed.

Software isn't an audiovisual work so the second half of the definition of \"perform\" is inapplicable. You also can't recite, render, play, dance, or act software \\-\\- you can run / execute it, and that isn't part of what \"perform\" means. Likewise you don't display software when you execute it \u2013 you might display a thing created by software, but you don't (usually) display the software itself.\n\nThere are competing legal theories (held by judges) about how to interpret laws. One approach pays attention to the literal meaning of words, and in that approach one cannot say that running software constitutes \"performance\" or \"display\". Another approach is to decide what the outcome is supposed to be in a given case, and then stretch the meaning of words (or not) to fit that end. You might guess I don't like the latter approach: I mention this because it's not inconceivable that the meaning of \"perform\" could be stretched to mean \"execute\", given a bit more shift in judicial philosophy.\n\nBut notice that [section 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) (4\\)\\-(6\\) specifically ties \"performance\" to literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works\" as well as sound recordings, and ties \"display\" to \"literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work\". In other words, we don't need to care about \"perform\" and \"display\" because performing softward and displaying software is not a protected right anyhow, at least by the letter of the law.\n\nUsing software at all without permission is prohibited, even in the privacy of your own home. To use software, it has to be copied (which you can't legally do without permission). Copyright law is mostly irrelevant to questions of software, and what really controls what you can and cannot do is the license agreement. Because of copyright law, you can't say \"But this was an unlicensed usage so I'm not bound by those terms\", so copyright law provides the Scylla and the license provides the Charybdis.\n\n[17 USC 117](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/117) says:\n\n> it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer\n>  program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation\n>  of that computer program provided:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) that *such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step\n>  in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a\n>  machine and that it is used in no other manner*\n\nInstalling (copying) sure enough is an essential step in utilization. This slice of code suggests that you can use the software, given copyright law. But that would be so only if you are the *owner* of a copy of the program, and one often does not buy a copy of the program, one buys a license, if you are to believe what the license says.\n\nIn [Vernor v. Autodesk](http://www.citizen.org/documents/Vernor_Autodesk_Ninth_Circuit_Opinion.pdf), the court held that customers are \"licensees of their copies of the software rather than owners\" (so Vernor did not buy his copy from an owner). One reason why Autodesk ultimately prevailed is that they asserted in the license that they retain title (they lost in the lower court, [Vernor v. Autodesk, 555 F. Supp. 2d 1164](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1457201/vernor-v-autodesk-inc/)).

The passage emphasizes that copyright law is often less relevant to software usage than the specific terms of the license agreement. The concepts of \"public performance\" and \"public display\" in copyright law were not originally designed for software and don't directly apply to typical software use. Instead, the license agreement, backed by copyright law, defines what users can and cannot do with the software.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because \"public performance\" in copyright law doesn't directly apply to executing software.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while copyright law protects source code, it doesn't explicitly prohibit its public display. Such restrictions would typically come from the license agreement.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because owning a copy doesn't automatically grant unrestricted rights, especially if the software is licensed rather than sold, as is often the case with modern software distribution."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56622/changing-nys-llc-mailing-address", "docs_id": 56622, "title": "Changing NYS LLC mailing address", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: United State, NY state here.\n\nI'd like to change my 1\\-man LLC's official mailing address with the state.

I don't know about America but I am pretty sure that most/all Western European courts would ignore such a clause and apply the local labour laws in case of a dispute because it would be considered unreasonable that a strong part (the employer) could force a weak part (the employee) to enter a contract that favoured the strong part (it is usually very expensive and difficult to engage a arbitration panel in a foreign country).\n\nAnother similar situation would be that a big company, like Apple or Google, in their terms and conditions for a consumer service prescribed that all disputes should be resolved as in the previous example. Again, I think most courts would ignore such a clause and instead apply the local consumer laws for the same reasons as in the previous example.\n\nA third example could be parents and their minor children. I have some difficulties coming up with a good example but say that a grandparent willed a large amount of money to a minor grand child and that in the current jurisdiction A, the parent's aren't allowed to access this money. The parents therefore decide to move to another country B that allows them free access to their children's money (and waste it while the child still is a minor).\n\nFinally the child returns to A and seeks compensation. I reckon a court in A would apply A's laws to the situation and conclude that the move to B benefited the parents in an extremely one\\-sided and unfair way since the child had no means to object to the decision to move, and as a consequnce was robbed on her/his money.\n\nIf the situation had been a married couple (or soon\\-to\\-be married couple) where one party X had a lot of money that the other party Y had no access to in A but free access to in B and the couple voluntarily and consensually moved from A to B, I doubt that X could seek compensation from Y for spending the money because they are both adults with full legal rights and responsibilities and if they decide to marry and live in B rather than A, X can't afterwards return to A and demand that the courts in A should overrule the laws in B.\n\nThe third example(s) is quite artificial so no need to nitpick on details...\n\nBut back to the question. If I generalize the examples above there is one strong party and one weak party. The strong party, more or less, forces the weak party to enter an agreement that heavily benefits the strong party.

This could include situations where a party was acting under duress, had a diminished mental capacity, or unequal experience in the .\n\nA provision may be considered substantively unfair if it imposes disproportinately unfavorable terms on one party, perhaps by imposing costs far out of line with market prices, or by allocating all risk to that party.\n\nIf the agreement is not both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, it won't be voided. So the Google TOS may be procedurally unfair because Google's market position gives it disproportionate bargaining power, but because they don't really impose any serious costs on you, they aren't unconscionable.

This legal principle is used to void contract provisions that are deemed excessively unfair to one party, often involving a significant imbalance in bargaining power between the parties.\n\nA) Unilateral unconscionability is incorrect. While it contains the word \"unconscionability,\" there's no such specific legal term. Unconscionability must be both procedural and substantive to be valid.\n\nB) Bilateral unconscionability is also incorrect. Like option A, this is not a recognized legal term.

Although unconscionability does require both procedural and substantive unfairness (which could be considered \"dual\" aspects), this is not the correct legal term.\n\nD) Unconscionability is the correct answer. This is the established legal principle that addresses situations where contract terms are so one-sided as to be considered unfair or oppressive, typically involving a stronger party taking advantage of a weaker one.

This means that even if a developer independently creates code without directly copying, they could still potentially be held liable for copyright infringement if the resulting program is substantially similar in structure and organization to an existing copyrighted work. While independent creation can be a defense, it's not an automatic protection, especially if the similarities are significant. Patents are a separate issue and not all software is patented, so option C is not the most accurate. Proving that one never saw the original code (option D) may help but doesn't guarantee protection.

The K\\-1 visa permits the foreign\\-citizen fianc\u00e9(e) to travel to the United States and marry his or her U.S. citizen sponsor within 90 days of arrival. The foreign\\-citizen will then apply for adjustment of status to a permanent resident (LPR) with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Because a fianc\u00e9(e) visa permits the holder to immigrate to the U.S. and marry a U.S. citizen shortly after arrival in the United States, the fianc\u00e9(e) must meet some of the requirements of an immigrant visa.

California has both. Cross\\-jurisdictional generalizations are thus highly perilous.\n\nThat said, I am aware of no jurisdiction that treats still photographs different from moving pictures. The right centers around \"identifiable characteristics\" of an individual. Under the \"incidental use\" doctrine, permission may not be required. Hence in Washington, under [RCW 63\\.60\\.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=63.60.070), consent is not required if the use \"is an insignificant, de minimis, or incidental use\".\n\nUnder Washington's scheme, the conversation about your example ends before it starts because the right of publicity doe not exist for corporations, see [RCW 63\\.60\\.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.010), [63\\.60\\.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.040) (individuals and personalities, not corporations). \"Commercial use\" is irrelevant, see [\u00a750](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.050) \"An infringement may occur under this section without regard to whether the use or activity is for profit or not for profit\".

The legislature did not draw a bright line, leaving that to the courts.

California has both statutory and common law rights of publicity, and the interpretation of \"commercial use\" can be subjective. While the company's post might be seen as congratulatory and potentially fall under \"incidental use,\" the fact that it's a company posting could lean towards commercial use. Courts would need to consider factors such as the prominence of individuals in the video, the nature of the company's business, and whether the post provides any commercial benefit to the company.

Publicly disclosed inventions, even if protected by copyright, are part of the \"prior art\" and can't be protected by patents.\n\nSecond, you have to disclose the material ideas in an invention in order to patent it, in your patent application. The bargain of a patent is that you get protection for about two decades in exchange for contributing your idea to the public domain when it expires.\n\nThird, usually people protect software with copyright rather than patent, although there are pros and cons to each approach.\n\nFourth, if someone knows enough about your invention to subpoena the place where you store it, you have probably disclosed too much information pre\\-application to patent it.\n\nFifth, usually the \"real\" target of a subpoena gets notice of it and an opportunity to defend against the subpoena (e.g. for improperly disclosing a trade secret) before it is carried out, but the same does not apply, for example, to National Security Letters under the Patriot Act (which are supposed to be used only in national security investigations or counter\\-terrrorism operations, but might be abused). Certainly, an ordinary person can't issue a National Security Letter for private commercial gain without corrupt government assistance.\n\nSixth, to issue a subpoena, there must be some pending case to which someone can claim the subpoena is relevant. A random person can't just subpoena information because they want to.\n\nSeventh, even if a server host isn't based in the United States, that doesn't mean that there isn't some means by which a court might assert subpoena power over information on server host. There are many legal \"hooks\" that could apply.\n\nEighth, defending an isolated subpoena isn't terribly expensive. Typically, you'd be looking at a legal fee in the $1000 to $5,000 (U.S.) range, which is much, much less than the dollar cost of patenting an invention in any country.\n\nIn short, while there are pros and cons of using a U.S. based server host, people in the IT industry routinely attach far too much importance to this fact which is only very rarely an important one legally. There are many other issues which are much more important in this fact pattern to your ultimate goal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A non-US company is developing hardware-related code and considering patenting their invention outside the US. They want to use GitHub (owned by Microsoft, a US-based company) to store their code. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal implications of this decision?\n\nA) Storing the code on GitHub automatically voids any patent rights and puts the invention into the public domain.\n\nB) The company can safely store their code on GitHub without risk, as long as they don't operate in the US.\n\nC) Using a US-based server host significantly increases the risk of expensive legal battles in US courts.\n\nD) Storing code on GitHub may have implications for patentability and could potentially be subject to subpoenas, but these risks are often overstated compared to other legal considerations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. While storing code on a US-based server like GitHub does introduce some potential risks, these are often exaggerated. The answer acknowledges that there may be implications for patentability (as public disclosure can affect patent rights) and the possibility of subpoenas. However, it also correctly notes that these risks are often overstated compared to other legal considerations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely storing code on GitHub doesn't automatically void patent rights or put the invention in the public domain, although public disclosure can affect patentability.\n\nOption B is false because even if the company doesn't operate in the US, using a US-based service could still potentially subject them to certain US legal processes.\n\nOption C overstates the risk.

While the employee can ask about the grounds for testing, the employer is not obligated to provide an explanation.

The court explores various *scienter* requirements, and concludes that there is a mens rea component to the crime (this is not a strict liability crime). The basis for the appeal is that defendant wanted an jury instruction read saying that \"the government must prove that he intended to communicate a true threat\", and what the jury was told was that\n\n> A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a\n> statement in a context or under such circumstances wherein a\n> reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be\n> interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a\n> serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take\n> the life of an individual\n\nThe court rejected importation of the negligence\\-law \"reasonable person\" standard, when the question for criminal law should be \"awareness\".

A EULA isn't a law. If we assume that the EULA is part of a contract, then you may not be understanding part of a contract, but that has nothing to do with not understanding the law. \n\nIf you are a consumer, there are plenty of laws in most countries that protect you from your own stupidity when entering a contract to some degree. So \"punishing\" you for doing something against the EULA will be difficult. It is a civil contract, things might go to a civil court. But terms that you cannot understand may very well be interpreted in your favour. If the court decides that someone created a 50 page EULA to trick you into violating it, there's a good chance it will be thrown out altogether. \n\nIf there are terms that only a lawyer can understand and not a normal consumer, they will likely be thrown out. If there are terms hidden in a 50 page EULA that nobody is every going to read, they will likely be thrown it. However, that's because you couldn't be expected to understand things. If the company in question explains relevant parts of the EULA to you, then after getting the explanation you'd be unlikely to be protected by your ignorance. \n\nAnd as a last measure: For software the situation is usually that you are asked to accept a EULA in order to be allowed to install and use the software. You can always claim that you didn't accept the EULA (and nobody can prove otherwise) and be guilty of copyright infringement, so that is the absolutely worst that can happen to you. \n\nIf you are a company, things are different.

The documentation states that \"terms that you cannot understand may very well be interpreted in your favour\" and that excessively complex or hidden terms may be thrown out by a court. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because EULAs are civil contracts, not criminal law.

Are\n> there examples of such behavior?\n\nIn the United States, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is frequently used as a way to cancel equity investments and to reduce or eliminate long term bond debt (especially subordinated bond investments) by senior management, in an effort to keep the business operating as a going concern and keep their elite senior executive jobs, and the jobs of many subordinate employees and contractors of the business.\n\nPretty much every single business bankruptcy reduces the amount of return that investors in the company can receive from it (although there are rare cases when investors can be compensated in full in an orderly disposition of a company's assets but bankruptcy is filed to prevent a fire sale of assets in a disorderly fashion that would hurt investors, or hurt them more than the alternative outcome).\n\nA key factor here is the segregation of ownership and management in most big businesses. A large equity owner in a company is in a poor position to defraud other equity owners in bankruptcy, however, and equity owners are behind debt investors in priority in bankruptcy, so it is also hard for the equity owner to use bankruptcy to defraud debt investors without hurting the large equity owner.\n\nIn some ways, this is a variant on a [leveraged buy\\-out by management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp), because usually, in a big business bankruptcy, a key step is for management to secure a third\\-party lender to the bankruptcy debtor (G.E. Capital was the dominant lender in this market for many years), to finance the continued operations of the business until a plan could be put in the place to reorganize the company with less debt and none of its old equity investors.\n\nThis is almost never a strategy of the company at the outset. It is one that is chosen once it becomes clear that its business model has ceased to be viable with the amount of leverage that the business has. Often, in such a plan, some long term debt that is not subordinated is converted to equity, although that equity is usually worth less than the original equity investment of the investors in the firm.\n\nTypically, this strategy is used when a company with a large initial capital investment is in a market where it can still make a profit relative to its variable operating costs from the revenues it can secure in current market conditions, but can no longer afford to service its long term debt that was used to make that large initial capital investment (e.g. in a building or factory) that has decreased in value because the products made with that investment are no longer as valuable as they used to be, or because, for example, patents expired but the long term debt wasn't paid off during the terms of the patents.\n\nFor example, many U.S. coal mining companies in the U.S. have recently had Chapter 11 bankruptcies. These companies made large investments in coal mining operations that were economically sensible when coal was worth more and alternatives to coal were not economically viable. But, when renewable energy became cheaper with changes in technology, and environmental requirements made coal fired power plants more expensive, the market price for coal collapsed and those companies could no longer support the debt that made it possible to conduct the mining operations that these companies had incurred. In a reorganized fashion, some of these companies could continue to be viable with lower sales volume and lower coal prices since they now only had to pay current operating costs and not obligations to investors in those companies.\n\n> What are the mechanisms in place in US law to prevent people from\n> creating a company to attract investors with the intent of filing for\n> bankruptcy as a strategy to not repay their debt?\n\nThis strategy doesn't really make sense as a plan from the issuing company's point of view, it only makes sense if the person promoting the scheme has some way to extract value from the investment made by the investors.\n\nThe company itself that issued the securities (typically stock or corporate bonds) in which the investor invested also isn't a suitable target of litigation because the company that issued the securities simply doesn't have the assets to pay damages to the investors.\n\nIf one can show that the company incurred debt with an intent not to repay it, and is followed by transfers out of the company without receiving substantially equivalent value in exchange to some third party behind the scheme, this can be regulated by [fraudulent transfer laws](https://www.uniformlaws.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=992ea8e4-9d59-a6f9-acf2-210781e76a14&forceDialog=0). *See* Section 4(a)(2\\) in the Uniform Act numbering although individual states adopting the act as state law invariably number the sections differently).\n\nThis conduct can also be used to seek securities fraud liability or common law fraud liability from the persons other than the company itself (such as its officers or brokers or promoters of some other kind) involved in promoting the company.\n\n**Footnote Re Importance Of A Formal Bankruptcy**\n\nThe bankruptcy code component of this analysis isn't a particularly important part of the strategy.\n\nA limited liability entity can dissolve itself, or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors of all of its assets, or be placed in a receivership, outside of bankruptcy, with similar effect, since the discharge of debts is not relief associated with a Chapter 7 liquidation of a limited liability entity (although debts can be reduced or eliminated as part of a Chapter 11 plan so long as the creditors are at least as well off as they would be in a Chapter 7 liquidation or otherwise consent to the plan).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company attracts investors with promises of high returns, but the management has a secret plan to file for bankruptcy to avoid repaying debts.

In that case, copying would destroy that persons earnings, so permission would be unlikely.\n\nYou definitely need to ask for permission and can't go forward without permission.

The impediment is the claim that you have a genuinely held religious belief. Changing the context a tiny bit, your employer is statutorily required to make an accommodation for the requirements of your religion, therefore they cannot fire you for refusing to work on the Sabbath, unless it would impose an unreasonable burden on them. If they fire you, you complain to the EOC and the EOC sanctions them. The employer's defense would be that you did not request a reasonable religion\\-based accommodation (you failed to explain that this was about Sabbath). The employer does not scrutinize the validity of your claim (does not demand proof of what your religion requires).\n\nIn your planned announcement, you are not requesting a statutory accommodation from the government, analogous to requesting an accommodation from an employer, you are offering a defense in the case the government takes action against you for violating the law. There is a statutory exception to the prohibition against employment discrimination based on religion, that (roughly speaking) a church is not required to hire a rabbi instead of a mullah to deliver sermons. There is no statutory exception w.r.t. public accommodations and religious discrimination.\nTherefore, to implement your plan, you would have to have the law or the EOC's interpretation of it overturned as unconstitutional.\n\nTo succeed in your argument, you would have to show that the law unconstitutionally restricts your free exercise of your religion. One part would be a demonstration that your religion prohibits... The least likely scenario is that your religion prohibits doing business with a person outside of your religion. I don't of any religion that maintains a requirement of absolute religious segregation, but that is hypothetically a path to argue \u2013 that you will burn in hell forever if you do business with a Christian, or a Muslim. I am maximally skeptical that the courts would ever take such a claim seriously.\n\nA more likely possibility would involve \"compelled speech\" as well, where you are forced under the law to express a viewpoint that contradicts your fundamental religious beliefs. You cannot be compelled by law to express a viewpoint.\nWhat is less clear is what constitutes expressing a viewpoint, see [this](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/compelledspeech.htm). For example, there is a federal law withholding federal funds from schools which discriminate against military recruiters. Some law schools argued in [Rumsfield v Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/547/47/) that allowing military recruiters amounts to forcing the schools to express a viewpoint, but the court held that \"the Solomon Amendment regulates conduct, not speech\".\n\nThe upshot of [303 Creative LLC v. Elenis](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf) is that\n\"The First Amendment prohibits Colorado from forcing a website designer to create expressive designs speaking messages with which the designer disagrees\". A proposal to refuse to service Christians plainly does not fall within the penumbra of that ruling. Nor does a refusal to print books containing religious material (which you already created). You have to cater to Christians, but you do not have to create Christian messages. You could draw a line between a simple ISP who you pay to make available your religious website (you create it), versus hiring a company to *design* the website, which clearly involves \"expression\".\n\nThe issue is simplified if you don't make a claim based on a specific belief system, instead rely on simple \"compelled speech\" doctrine. General beliefs do not enjoy the same \"Free Exercise\" protections that religions enjoy.

If so, what is the legal reason that this is the case and what policy does this serve?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The Distinction Is Probably Between Criminal And Civil Enforcement**\n\nMy suspicion is that the distinction that you are picking up upon reflects of division of labor in which civil enforcement actions are mostly handled by lawyers assigned to the Securities and Exchange Commission (an independent federal government agency), while criminal securities fraud enforcement actions are mostly handled by lawyers assigned to the United States Department of Justice. \n\nBut, I strongly suspect that the fundamental source of the distinction is the kind of case handled by each agency and not agency of employment per se, because constitutionally and for most purposes, SEC employees and Justice Department employees are both employees of the same entity, the federal government of the United States of America.\n\nIf an SEC lawyer were loaned to the Department of Justice to work on a criminal securities fraud prosecution that the DOJ didn't have anyone qualified to prosecute due to lack of financial industry knowledge, I do not believe that the limitation that you assert exists would apply.\n\n**Search Warrants, Wiretaps and Arrest Warrants Are Generally Only Available In Criminal Cases**\n\nGenerally speaking, search warrants, wiretaps, and arrest warrants are investigative tools available only in criminal investigations, and in the absence of exigent circumstances, may only be issued upon a showing to a neutral magistrate or judge, supported by a sworn statement showing that probable cause exists that a crime has been committed and (1\\) in the case of an arrest warrant, that the person named committed that crime, and (2\\) in the case of a search warrant or wiretap, that the search or wiretap will reveal evidence of that crime. \n\n*Exceptions To The General Rule*\n\nThe main exceptions to this general rule is that arrest warrants may issue in a civil case (i) to compel the attendance of a witness who fails to make a timely response or appearance to a subpoena after being personally served in a timely manner with that subpoena, (ii) to compel someone to attend a quasi\\-criminal contempt of court hearing, and (iii) to arrest someone who have been held in contempt of court. In criminal contempt proceedings, contempt of court is a crime that is just prosecuted using an unusual procedure. In the case of subpoena enforcement and civil contempt enforcement the infringement on an arrestee's right is limited in that compliance with the court's order will promptly result in the person arrested being freed. Also in subpoena and civil contempt cases the person arrested does not get a criminal record as a result (although they may get an arrest record), so there are no collateral consequences to the proceeding as there would be a criminal case.\n\n*The Legal Basis For This Rule*\n\nThese limitations are a function of the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution which states:\n\n> The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,\n>  and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be\n>  violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,\n>  supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the\n>  place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n\nThe implied term that \"probable cause\" means probable cause that a crime has committed and that the object of the search or seizure is connected to that crime is a long standing interpretation of the 4th Amendment through case law. \n\nThis interpretation has been applied and has been enforced via the exclusionary rule in federal criminal prosecutions since *Weeks v. United States*, 232 U.S. 383 (1914\\) (the U.S. Supreme Court definitively applied the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule to state criminal prosecutions under the selective incorporation doctrine via the 14th Amendment in *Mapp v. Ohio*, 367 U.S. 643 (1961\\)). \n\nThe meaning of probable cause, however, is even older than the exclusionary rule (before which, a civil rights action would have been the primary remedy for a violation). But, federal criminal prosecutions were extremely rare in the first 90\\-150 or so years of the existence of the federal government because the scope of federal government activity relative to state government activity was much smaller, and because the combined scope of all government was smaller in a less complex economy.\n\n*Wire Taps Are 4th Amendment Searches*\n\nThe determination that a wiretap was a search for 4th Amendment purposes was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in *Katz v. United States*, 389 U.S. 347 (1967\\).\n\n*Policy Considerations*\n\nThe investigatory tools of search warrants, wire taps and arrest warrants, are frequently obtained *ex parte* and secretly (until the search, wiretap or arrest is complete), because the law considers it likely that defendants facing potentially lengthy incarceration will risk disobeying court orders and destroy evidence to avoid those consequences. \n\nIn a criminal case, the assumption that the defendant is basically a law abiding person which applies in civil cases no longer holds true once probable cause has been demonstrated to an independent magistrate, even though the defendant is presumed innocent for the purpose of an ultimate trial.\n\nThe policy purpose of this rule is to allow \"people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects\" from government intrusions allowing them privacy, comfort and security as a basic human right. The 4th Amendment is the way that the law balances those privacy interests and the compelling interest of the state in punishing crime so as to deter people from committing crimes.\n\n**Securing Evidence In Civil Cases**\n\n*What Are Civil Cases?*\n\nCivil cases are case where only money judgments and injunctive awards which do not involve incarceration if obeyed are potential punishments, and are generally considered less serious than criminal charges for which incarceration and various other collateral consequences are available as punishments, for a variety of procedural purposes.\n\nMost civil cases are brought by private parties, but governmental officials, usually in regulatory agencies, can also bring civil cases.\n\nIn civil cases, it is generally assumed that defendants and their lawyers, facing the limited stakes that they do, will comply with court orders and will cooperate in providing testimony and documents rather than upping the stakes to criminal obstruction of justice charges and civil spoilation of evidence charges.\n\n*Obtaining Evidence In Civil Cases*\n\nIn civil cases, evidence must generally be obtained voluntarily from third parties, obtained involuntarily from the parties via the disclosure and discovery process of the rules of civil procedure (which were greatly expanded around the same time that the SEC was created in connection with a major overhaul of federal civil procedure that resulted in the federal rules of civil procedure in effect with amendments today), and via subpoenas. These discovery and subpoena tools are all basically derivative of the common law trial subpoena power, and certain other powers that were vested in courts of equity, which is constitutionally recognized in federal criminal trials in the 6th Amendment which includes a right \"to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor\" and applies in civil trials by tradition, court rule and statute. \n\nThe SEC has statutory pre\\-litigation subpoena power even in the absence of a pending lawsuit between the SEC and the parties subject to the subpoena as do almost all other administrative agencies that enforce non\\-criminal law.\n\nAlso, because of the way that the securities laws enforced by the SEC are structured, it is possible to bring civil cases and try them without any need to resort to discovery or investigatory tools, based upon complaints filed by members of the public. For example, placing a newspaper ad offering to sell shares of stock without a registration of the offering with the SEC is a civil violation which can often be pursued in a civil case with a copy of the newspaper and the documents provided to a complaining witness by the defendants. In contrast, criminal charges almost always require third party evidence of criminal intent which is rarely publicly available.\n\nAnother useful tool in civil cases is that the 5th Amendment privilege against self\\-incrimination does not apply, so if the defendant refused to testify (perhaps claiming the 5th Amendment for fear of criminal consequences of truthful testimony) that refusal to testify can be used to infer that his testimony would have hurt him and to find civil liability.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawyers typically cannot use surveillance evidence or wiretaps in their investigations, while Department of Justice (DOJ) lawyers can?\n\nA) SEC lawyers are not considered federal employees, while DOJ lawyers are.\nB) The SEC is prohibited by statute from using any form of electronic surveillance.\nC) SEC cases are typically civil enforcement actions, which have different evidentiary standards than criminal cases.\nD) DOJ lawyers have higher security clearances that allow them access to surveillance evidence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key distinction is between civil and criminal enforcement actions. SEC lawyers typically handle civil cases, while DOJ lawyers often prosecute criminal cases. In civil cases, invasive investigative techniques like wiretaps and surveillance are generally not permitted due to Fourth Amendment protections. These tools are usually only available in criminal investigations, where probable cause of a crime must be shown to a judge.

Maybe I simply had no idea that such a law existed (actually the case for me up until a few days ago), or I forgot, or I did know but actively wanted to avoid having to pay my money to an evil government. I doubt it matters why; let's just say that I never report it.\n\nBut then, one day, they find out. And they decide that I'm guilty of withholding $500 worth of BTC from them, of which I'm apparently supposed to pay 30% in taxes whenever I sell/spend them.\n\nI'm sure they will punish me somehow, and not care about any explanation I might have. But will the punishment be 40 years in federal maximum security prison, even though the amount of money is ridiculously small? Or will they just tell me to pay it and perhaps add a $20 fee on top of the 30% of $500 that they consider me to owe them?\n\nAgain, I'm talking \"in general\". In most countries. Feel free to use the USA as an example, but I'd be interested if it varies wildly.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\nThe dollar amount of a criminal tax offense is considered at the sentencing stage, but is only one of many factors and merely helps determine which of several possible sentencing guideline sentences that a U.S. judge uses as a starting point when determining the sentence.\n\nWhile the amount of money involved is a factor, the punishment isn't usually \"proportional\" to the tax liability in a criminal tax case.\n\nBut criminal tax offenses make up only a tiny fraction of all punishments imposed for violating tax laws. Most tax law violations are punished with civil penalties that are often proportional to the amount of tax not paid or not reported.\n\nThe U.S. pattern in this respect is typical of punishments for violating tax laws in the developed world more generally.\n\nUndeveloped and developing country economies tend to be less bureaucratic and to have a more criminal law oriented system for punishing violations of their revenue collection laws, and also tend to have narrower tax bases limited to more concrete transactions. Many resource rich countries, like oil rich monarchies, often don't impose taxes on the general public at all.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\n> I'm sure they will punish me somehow, and not care about any\n> explanation I might have.

Less frequently, the civil penalty involves the forfeiture of property of the offending taxpayer (e.g. currency received as lawful payments for goods or services that is not disclosed to tax officials), or the loss of some tax law related benefit or privilege (e.g. disallowing a tax credit when a tax return upon which it should be claimed isn't filed by the due date).\n\nStrict liability or negligence based penalties for tax law violations are usually civil rather than criminal. Criminal penalties for tax law violations are usually reserved for intentional misconduct.\n\n*How Severe Are Tax Crime Penalties?*\n\nCriminal tax crimes usually involve intentional fraud or willful conduct influencing the amount of taxes you owe (as opposed to good faith efforts to lawfully not pay higher taxes than necessary, or negligent or unintentional actions that have that effect), or intentional non\\-reporting or misreporting of information necessary for the government to determine how much tax someone else owes, or willfully failing to pay or collect taxes when the taxable is able to pay or collect the taxes, or for conduct that thwarts tax collection more generally (like sending fake inaccurate tax forms to random people causing them to pay the wrong amount of taxes or none at all). The maximum penalty for serious tax crimes of this type are typically similar in severity to the maximum penalty for non\\-violent theft, forgery or fraud offenses not involving taxes, which is typically at the low to medium end for felony criminal conduct and is typically far less than the maximum punishment for violent crimes.\n\nCrimes involving willful manipulation of how much tax is owed by someone usually has higher maximum criminal penalties than willful failure to pay or collect taxes.\n\nConduct such as lying to tax investigators, or disregarding legal process during tax audits and litigation, or other fraudulent conduct that doesn't change how much is owed or paid directly but makes it more cumbersome to collect taxes (like intentionally filing a false information tax return, when the taxpayer reports the income anyway, or filing a false information tax return to harass someone who doesn't owe any tax in the first place), are typically misdemeanors with only comparatively minor criminal penalties (perhaps a few days to a year in jail and a fine in the hundreds or single digit thousands of dollars).\n\nThe main driver of the maximum penalty for the narrow range of tax law violations are actually tax crimes is how clearly malicious and unruly the conduct is, rather than the amount in controversy. Negligently failing to pay $10,000,000, or recklessly taking a very dubious tax law position in a tax return, will usually result in a large civil tax penalty, but no criminal prosecution. Intentionally forging or doctoring a $700 information tax return, or intentionally paying a tax bill with counterfeit currency, will usually have criminal penalties.\n\nThere are also quite a few crimes that arguably count as tax crimes for conduct like murdering tax collectors, kidnapping tax collectors, assaulting tax collectors, bribing tax collectors, blackmailing tax collectors to act unlawfully, stealing or destroying tax collection agency property, etc. that would be crimes even if there was no tax component to the conduct, that I do not consider in this answer. These crimes are usually punished only modestly more severely than they are in the non\\-tax context when no government officials or offices are involved, and are usually punished with about the same severity as other crimes against non\\-tax government officials.\n\n*Determining The Sentence For A Tax Crime Under U.S. Law*\n\nIn the U.S., the maximum period of incarceration for a federal tax related crime is usually not related to the amount of money that the government was denied in tax revenues, although the civil penalties for violations of tax laws are usually capped at a percentage of the tax not paid. Criminal fines for tax offenses are sometimes related to the dollar amount of the offense, and sometimes aren't related directly to the dollar amount, although they may be determined with the dollar amount of the offense in mind.\n\nThe length of the sentence of incarceration and the amount of the fine actually imposed by a federal judge upon a conviction for a federal tax related crime between the maximum and minimum sentences authorized by law is governed by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines set by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Commission.\n\nThe guideline sentence is based upon the specific subsection of the federal tax crime for which you were convicted and then a lot of factors that add or deduct points. Some of the points are related to your prior criminal history. Some of the points are related to your conduct in the litigation (e.g. did you cooperate with prosecutors), and some of the points are based upon the nature of the offense itself, including the dollar amount of the tax loss caused by the crime. Typically, there are several dollar ranges for each crime, and the number of points added to the number used to determine the sentencing guideline range is stated for each of the possible range of dollar values of the money at issue in the crime.\n\nThe number of points you have after the judge evaluates all of these factors (based upon a preponderance of the evidence with lower evidentiary standards than those that apply at the guilt\\-innocence phase of the case) to produce a non\\-binding recommended sentencing range for the crime. The judge than imposes the sentence.\n\nA sentence within a correctly determined sentencing guideline range is always upheld on appeal. A judge can impose a sentence that is higher than the guideline range but lower than the maximum statutorily authorized sentence, or below the guideline range by higher than the minimum statutorily authorized sentence, if the judge articulates reasons for doing so that are on a list of reasons that a judge can impose a non\\-guideline sentence.\n\nIf a sentence for a federal tax crime conviction is appealed, the appellate court evaluates whether the sentencing guideline range was determined correctly, and whether if the judge imposed a sentence outside the sentencing guideline range, if the reasons articulated by the judge were insufficient to justify that decision and hence constituted an abuse of discretion by the judge. If the appellate court makes that determination, the case is remanded for re\\-sentencing in accordance with the appellate court opinion (assuming that the conviction itself was affirmed on appeal).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner intentionally fails to report $10,000 in Bitcoin transactions on their federal tax return. If convicted of tax evasion, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential punishment?\n\nA) The sentence will be directly proportional to the $10,000 tax loss, resulting in a short jail term of no more than 30 days.\n\nB) The maximum sentence will be determined solely by the $10,000 amount, without consideration of other factors.\n\nC) The sentence will be determined using the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which consider the tax loss amount as one of many factors.\n\nD) The business owner will only face civil penalties proportional to the $10,000 tax loss, with no possibility of criminal charges.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the U.S. federal system, sentences for tax crimes are determined using the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. These guidelines consider multiple factors, including but not limited to the dollar amount of the tax loss. The $10,000 tax loss would be one factor in determining the guideline range, but other factors such as the defendant's criminal history, cooperation with prosecutors, and specific conduct related to the offense would also be considered. The judge would use this guideline range as a starting point, but could potentially deviate from it if they provide sufficient reasons.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because sentences for tax crimes are not directly proportional to the tax loss amount, and a 30-day maximum for intentional tax evasion is unrealistically low.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the maximum sentence is set by statute and is not solely determined by the amount of tax loss. The amount is just one factor in sentencing considerations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because intentional tax evasion can indeed result in criminal charges and potential incarceration, not just civil penalties."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5364/can-a-person-block-access-to-a-public-space-if-so-how-much-public-space", "docs_id": 5364, "title": "Can a person block access to a public space?

Public parks are owned by local governments, and individual users don't have the authority to restrict others' access.

I recognise that these are three different (although overlapping) legal definitions carrying different liabilities. And while I would agree that the net ecosystem services of a river clearly outweight its costs even before you consider the social and religious significance, as far as I am aware the law on corporate personhood does not recognise this. If/when you cause harm, you can be sued.\n\nAssuming that a direct quote from the minister responsible for the law (Chris Finlayson) can be taken at face value:\n\n> Te Awa Tupua will have its own legal identity with all the\n>  corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person\n\n...

I assume it's implying that it's ludicrous, but that's not obvious to me from the information provided.\n\nI am interested to know whether this decision potentially creates significant legal liabilities for the river which may not be obvious to those who think this is a straightforward environmental 'win' for the Whanganui.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In context, the answer is *clearly not*. The precise reason that this is the case, requires a somewhat more sophisticated theory of what is going on than the *Economist* article cited seems to provide.\n\nThe most useful analogy to apply to a situation when a river or forest or some other non\\-sentient being is given legal personality would be the relationship of a [guardian and ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_guardian). A guardian for a ward can be appointed by a court or other person with a special relationship to the ward (e.g. a parent or deceased parent for a child, or a spouse for an older person, or an indigenous tribe for a river), to look out for the best interests of a ward (sometimes at public expense). A ward could be a minor, or a person with advanced dementia, or otherwise unable to personally take legal action on their own behalf. In this case, the ward is a river.\n\nYou couldn't prosecute a river criminally or for most civil obligations (e.g., breach of contract and torts) for its own actions for the same sorts of reasons that you couldn't prosecute a six months old, or an individual in a coma, on that basis. A person such as that could neither have capacity to contract nor form the intent necessary to commit a tort and be legally responsible for that tort.\n\nIn the same way, the river doesn't actually walk into court, or sign affidavits, or sign contracts, or anything like that. Instead, it acts through a fiduciary appointed to act on its behalf in its best interests (in the [environmental law context](http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3359&context=mlr) (also [here](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&context=wmelpr)), such a guardian is often called a \"[Lorax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lorax)\" after the character in the Dr. Seuss book, \"The Lorax\" who says \"I am the Lorax. I speak for the trees. I speak for the trees for the trees have no tongues.\"). It merely has the capacity to sue, much like a corporation or a trust or a probate estate or a guardianship estate, through a fiduciary appointed on its behalf, and is granted legal standing in cases related to it.\n\nIf the river enters into contracts through its guardian, however, for example, to provide irrigation water to a company in exchange for the company ceasing to pollute it, that contract would probably be enforceable by specific performance, at least (the river is probably judgment proof, so a suit for money damages would be futile anyway), in a suit to which the guardian would be made a party and have standing to raise defenses.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of New Zealand's law recognizing the Whanganui River as a legal person, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the river's legal liabilities?\n\nA) The river can be held criminally liable for deaths caused by drowning.\nB) The river can be sued for damages caused by flooding.\nC) The river can enter into contracts directly and be held liable for breaches.\nD) The river's legal status is similar to that of a ward with a guardian acting in its best interests.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The legal status granted to the Whanganui River is best understood as similar to that of a ward with a guardian. This means:\n\n1. The river cannot be held criminally liable (eliminating option A) or sued for damages (eliminating option B) in the same way that a minor or person in a coma would not be.\n\n2. The river does not directly enter into contracts or take legal actions on its own (eliminating option C). Instead, it acts through a appointed fiduciary or guardian who represents its interests.\n\n3. The guardian (often referred to as a \"Lorax\" in environmental law contexts) has the capacity to sue on behalf of the river and is granted legal standing in cases related to it.\n\n4.

Given that the city is home to a wide arrange of political actors from Congressmen/women to lobbyists for various causes, these laws were enacted so various industries may not refuse service to someone based on political affiliation or making money as a lobbyist for a cause they disagree with.

Dunkin' Donuts, one of the first chains to run 24/7 service in the U.S. needed some security (especially during the Graveyard shift, when robbers were more likely to cause trouble because of very few witnesses) and found that for the price of a donut and some coffee, they could have the city's finest sitting in their parking lot, sipping coffee and writing reports, for way cheaper than hiring a security service.

However, the amount has to be over $75,000\\. That probably leaves the matter to the California court: contracts often include clauses about where legal disputes will be settled (there might even be a binding arbitration clause). You would be allowed to file a suit, and the California courts nicely provide an outline of [what you need to do](http://www.courts.ca.gov/9616.htm). You will either need to appear, yourself, to plead your case, or hire an attorney to do so on your behalf.

This reflects the standards by which they will make a finding of forbidden religious discrimination.\n\nThe actual statutory law, [42 USC 2000e\\-2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e-2) does not prohibit asking questions about religion, instead it says\n\n> (a) It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer\u2014 (1\\)\n> to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise\n> to discriminate against any individual with respect to his\n> compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because\n> of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin;\n> or (2\\) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees or applicants\n> for employment in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any\n> individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect\n> his status as an employee, because of such individual\u2019s race, color,\n> religion, sex, or national origin.\n\n[29 CFR Part 38 Subpart A](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-29/subtitle-A/part-38/subpart-A) does not specifically prohibit asking questions. Although many labor\\-law web sites and HR advice firms state that asking questions is illegal, DoL and EEOC do not specifically declare categorical illegality. The fact of asking some question might constitute partial evidence for a finding of religious discrimination. So no court has held that it is flatly illegal for an employer to ask a question about religion.\n\nThe case of [EEOC v. Abercrombie \\& Fitch](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-86_p86b.pdf), which did find discrimination, gives you the required elements for a finding of religious discrimination. There is simply no \"don't ask\" cause of action. Asking might be evidence to support a claim of disparate treatment based on religion. The rule is: \"An employer may not  \n\nmake an applicant\u2019s religious practice, confirmed or otherwise, a factor in employment decisions\".\n\nI have found no cases where [EEOC found illegal discrimination](https://www.eeoc.gov/selected-list-pending-and-resolved-cases-alleging-religious-and-national-origin-discrimination) based exclusively on the fact of asking questions about religion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large tech company decides to conduct an anonymous survey among its employees, asking about their religious affiliations and practices.

The survey itself is not illegal, but if the company uses the information to make employment decisions or in any way that adversely affects employees based on their religion, it could be considered evidence of religious discrimination.

But that's why we have laws, right? So we can retaliate against people we feel are impeding our freedom in a peaceful manner. My question is simply of whether I have the ability to legally retaliate against the protesters who may have just made me an hour late for an important event by blocking a public freeway.\n\nEdit: Another way to look at it: If a police officer detained me without cause, and there were witnesses and video to verify this, I could sue the police department and win. Why then, can a group of citizens detain me without cause, without also facing legal repercussion?\n\n* I'm curious to know what legal grounds I would have in this situation to travel unobstructed.\n* Can I only call the police and hope they press charges?\n* Can I video the protesters and press charges against each of them, even sue each protester for damages?\n* In other words, is there any way for me to retaliate against the (unlawful) protesters legally and peacefully?\n\n**Note:** Many are responding with something along the lines of \"What if it were an accident? You couldn't press charges on the drivers in an accident for detaining you\". There's a huge difference between being detained by an accident, and a group of people intentionally and unlawfully detaining me on a public freeway. So I really don't understand these responses.\n\n---\n\nMy initial wording to the question seemed to confuse my intentions and lead to alot of \"no, you can't run them over\" rhetoric (which wasn't actually my question at all), so I've edited and simplified the question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **tl;dr**\n\nHitting the pedestrians is a separate crime, even if they shouldn't be there.\n\n**Background**\n\n*On a highway, you might have a legal right of way and therefore a claim against the pedestrians for failing to yield.*\n\nSince the states (and not the federal government) own and operate the interstate highway system, your specific answer depends on the state law. \n\nIn North Carolina, for example, pedestrians walking along or upon a highway have a [statutory duty](http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/trans/wolftrails/documents/wt-ped-laws.pdf) to yield the right of way to all vehicles. So you could probably videotape and press misdemeanor charges against them individually. That said, contacting the police and waiting (or taking an alternate route) is the best recourse.\n\n*Having the right of way (or feeling ethically justified) doesn't allow you to commit an offense like hitting a pedestrian.*\n\nThe fact that the pedestrians aren't supposed to be in your way is of little consolation in the charges you'll face if you injure or kill one. The court will see this as a legal/ethical problem, but one that won't go in your favor.\n\nIn particular, you deliberately directed your vehicle into the crowd with the knowledge that the action might cause harm. One doesn't have to imagine the [Austin Powers steamroller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PrZ-J7D3k) scenario to know that injuries are possible when cars go through crowds. That will pull all of the \"involuntary\"\\-flavored mitigations off the table.\n\nIn particular, driving a car into a crowd might be considered \"an inherently dangerous act or omission, done in such a reckless and wanton manner as to manifest a mind utterly without regard for human life and social duty.\" In the worst case scenario, where someone died as a result, a North Carolina prosecutor might push for [second\\-degree](http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_14/GS_14-17.html) murder (which operates on a \"recklessness\\-plus\" standard and might not be as crazy as it sounds since driving into the crowd is likely reckless, and driving in slowly with them yelling at you to stop could push a jury over the top). In that case, as a defendant, you'd hope your charge could be mitigated down to something like [death by vehicle](http://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/statutes/statutelookup.pl?statute=20-141.4) (which is similar to \"vehicular manslaughter\" in other states), and you'd shoot for the misdemeanor version of death by vehicle since you weren't driving under the influence. However, a key element of proving death by vehicle is that you *unintentionally* caused the death\\-\\-\\-and the fact that you deliberately drove into the crowd might ruin your defense. In the case where you just hurt someone, you'd likewise hope to mitigate intentional charges to unintentional ones.\n\n*A claim for false imprisonment is unlikely to succeed.*\n\nFalse imprisonment is called a variety of things\\-\\-\\-like felonious/misdemeanor restraint, unlawful detainment, etc.\\-\\-\\-depending on where you live. To prove it (and generalizing a bit since this varies by state), you typically have to show (1\\) detention or restraint against your will, and (2\\) unlawfulness of the detention or restraint. A big challenge here is that courts often interpret this to mean detention or restraint by exercise of force or threat of force, as in *Harris v. Stanioch*, 150 Wash. 380 (1928\\) for example. The protesters are just in the way, so it's unlikely this would hold up.\n\n*Self defense almost surely won't be a viable excuse.*\n\nThe idea of driving the car slowly through the crowd relies on the notion that you should be able to escape the alleged detention. The escape you're considering in driving through the crowd likely comes at the expense of making contact with members of the crowd. Making unprivileged contacts might be allowable in self defense. However, self defense probably hold up either. Setting aside notions of proportional defense, you have to be defending yourself against something: force or threats of it by the protesters. So if they don't use force, or threaten it, against you, then your defense is going to be really shaky.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A group of protesters are blocking an interstate highway, causing significant traffic delays.

However, what the shop is doing is not giving away free water \\- they are bundling a peanut and a bottle of water and selling that.

Obvious examples are prohibitions on attacking civilians, destroying civilian property and infrastructure, neglecting civilian public health, harming prisoners who are incapable of fighting, and so on. I wouldn't say these are about \"fairness\" or any other such abstract ethical principle; they are simply pragmatic. All other things equal, the world is better off if fewer civilians end up dead.\n\nAnd so just as the laws try to avoid collateral damage to *individuals* who are not fighting (civilians, prisoners, injured troops, etc), they likewise try to avoid collateral damage to *nations* who are not fighting (neutrals). Combat under a false flag carries a risk of harm to the nation whose flag is impersonated, as the belligerents may get the wrong idea about who is attacking them.\n\nHere are a couple of scenarios that could occur if false flag combat were considered acceptable:\n\n1. Potsylvania is at war with Grand Fenwick, while Freedonia remains neutral in the conflict. The Potsylvanian ship *Fearless* sights the Fenwickian ship *Goose*, and as a ruse, the *Fearless* runs up a Freedonian flag. The *Goose*, knowing that Freedonia is neutral, assumes the *Fearless* is harmless and lets it approach. When within range, the *Fearless* fires at the *Goose*, while still flying the Freedonian flag. The *Goose* reports back to its government that they have been attacked by a Freedonian vessel. The Fenwickian government considers this a hostile act, declares war on Freedonia, and launches an immediate retaliatory invasion of Freedonian territory. Now Freedonia has been brought into the war despite no party actually having anything against them. This is not desirable.\n2. Same scenario, but instead of raising a Freedonian flag, the *Fearless* runs up a Fenwickian flag. The *Goose* knows the flag must be fake, as no genuine Fenwickian vessel would attack them, but they don't know what nation the *Fearless* actually does belong to. They faintly hear the captain of the *Fearless* shouting orders in Potsylvanian, but he has a Freedonian accent and they think he's speaking in Freedonian. They report to their government that a Freedonian vessel has attacked them, and Grand Fenwick again declares war on Freedonia.\n\nNote that using a false flag when *not* attacking doesn't carry the same risks, which is why it is not included in the prohibition. Suppose that the *Fearless* doesn't plan to attack the *Goose*, but simply wants to avoid being attacked so they can get away. If their ruse of flying a Freedonian flag is successful, then the *Goose* simply thinks they saw a neutral Freedonian vessel going about its business, and Grand Fenwick does not get the idea that Freedonia is doing anything aggressive. And if it's unsuccessful, then the *Goose* must have figured out that the *Fearless* is not Freedonian at all, but instead Potsylvanian, and so likewise Freedonia does not come under suspicion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why combat under a false flag is prohibited by the customary laws of war?\n\nA) It gives the attacking force an unfair advantage in battle\nB) It violates the principle of military honor and chivalry\nC) It risks bringing uninvolved neutral nations into the conflict\nD) It makes it impossible to identify legitimate combatants\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe correct answer is C. The primary reason for prohibiting combat under a false flag is that it risks involving neutral nations in the conflict unintentionally. As explained in the passage, if a ship attacks while flying the flag of a neutral nation, it could lead to misunderstandings and potentially cause the attacked nation to declare war on the innocent neutral nation.\n\nA is incorrect because while using a false flag might provide a tactical advantage, this is not the main reason for its prohibition according to the passage.\n\nB is incorrect because the passage does not mention military honor or chivalry as a factor in this prohibition.\n\nD is incorrect because while identification of combatants is important in warfare, the passage does not present this as the primary reason for prohibiting false flag attacks.

And, the foreign has a strong incentive to do so, because even if the foreigner has no other U.S. assets, the unpaid taxes would become a first priority lien against the property and allow the property to be seized for non\\-payment of taxes even if the unpaid taxes are worth much less than the property.\n\nThere are many ways that this can be arranged.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A foreign national who is not a U.S. tax resident owns a house in New York City.

According to the information provided, a foreign owner of property in the U.S. can indeed receive property tax bills via mail and pay them through banking or home banking methods, even if they are not present in the U.S. This arrangement is possible and advisable, as unpaid taxes would become a first priority lien against the property, potentially leading to seizure for non-payment. The foreign owner's tax residency status does not exempt them from property taxes (ruling out option A), physical presence is not required for payment (ruling out option B), and property taxes apply regardless of whether the property generates income (ruling out option D)."}}
