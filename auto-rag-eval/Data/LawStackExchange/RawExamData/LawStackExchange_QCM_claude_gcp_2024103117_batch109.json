The Data Protection Act 1998 does not prescribe a specific level of security that all organizations must implement. Instead, it requires that the security measures be appropriate to \"the nature of the information in question\" and \"the harm that might result from its improper use, or from its accidental loss or destruction.\" The Act also states that an assessment of appropriate security measures should consider technological developments and the costs involved. This risk-based approach allows organizations to tailor their security measures to their specific circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Act explicitly states that it does not require state-of-the-art technology in all cases.\n\nOption C is incorrect as the documentation clearly states there is no \"one size fits all\" solution to information security.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Act does not specify a minimum set of technical measures.

We don't need to hire a lawyer for that small causes and I think they can help me to get my rights. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The avenues of recourse depend on what website you used to order the product, what shipping company delivered the package, and under what delivery class the shipment was made. You are potentially protected by one or more of the following:\n\n1. Insurance policy of payment method (credit card / Paypal);\n2. Shipping company ([DHL](https://www.logistics.dhl/br-en/home/contact-us.html), [TNT](https://www.tnt.com/express/pt_br/site/suporte/contato.html), [UPS](https://compass.ups.com/)) insurance policy;\n3. [Express or implied contract](https://www.bc-llp.com/express-and-implied-warranty/) with the seller;\n4. Manufacturer warranty\n\nIf you see the damage when the product is being delivered, you can either refuse the shipment as *damaged \u2013 return to sender*, or you can have the delivery company mark the tracking as *received damaged, subject to further inspection*. Please note, you have only a few days to report damage so if the delivery company drops off your package without your signature, call or contact them right away. Here are some links to contact major shipping companies in Brazil: [DHL](https://www.logistics.dhl/br-en/home/contact-us.html), [TNT](https://www.tnt.com/express/pt_br/site/suporte/contato.html), [UPS](https://compass.ups.com/). Find the contact information for the company who delivered your product to you. You also must keep all boxes and packing material. When you call you will need the tracking number off your box, a description of the damage and its value). All of the companies will log the call. Wait about 30 minutes and then run your tracking number online. It will show that you reported the damage. Once it shows, you then contact the seller. \n\nCarefully review the text of the following documents to determine who is responsible for the replacement or refund and under what conditions:\n\n1. The manufacturer warranty,\n2. The terms of service for the website on which you ordered your product\n3. The agency that controls the payment method you employed (if it's not cash).\n\nKeep your communications with the seller in writing so there is never any doubt as to when you contacted them or what was said by either party. A reasonable response time is a full business day for them to get back to you with an offer of resolution.\u00a0\n\nIf a seller claims the item was sold *[as is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_is)*, then that does not apply to freight damage. If the seller claims the item was sold *as is*, then they need to have stated it was damaged in the advertisement or the auction. If they failed to specify that it was damaged, then they cannot retroactively claim it was sold *as is*.\nIn the final case, you will need to rely on [small claims court to recover your costs.](https://www.dubbio.com.br/artigo/212-juizados-de-pequenas-causas-tudo-que-voce-precisa-saber) This requires, however, that you precisely determine [which party is at fault or otherwise liable](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/free-books/small-claims-book/chapter2-4.html) for the damaged product, since you will want to bring the claim on the party whom you think the court will find responsible.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A Brazilian consumer purchases an electronic product online, which arrives damaged.

Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step for the consumer to take, based on the information provided?\n\nA) Immediately file a lawsuit against the seller in a higher court\nB) Contact the shipping company to file an insurance claim for the damaged product\nC) Pursue the case through JEC (Juizado Especial C\u00edvel)\nD) Accept the loss and purchase a new product from a different seller\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C) Pursue the case through JEC (Juizado Especial C\u00edvel). This option is explicitly mentioned in the text as the consumer's next step, and it's described as appropriate for small causes without needing to hire a lawyer. It's a logical progression after exhausting other complaint channels like PROCON and Reclame Aqui.\n\nOption A is incorrect because filing a lawsuit in a higher court would be premature and likely more complex and costly than necessary at this stage.\n\nOption B could be a valid step, but it's not mentioned as the consumer's intended next action. Additionally, contacting the shipping company would be most effective immediately upon receiving the damaged item, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it suggests giving up on seeking a remedy, which goes against the consumer's rights and the information provided about available recourse options."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67368/impressumspflicht-outside-germany-for-individuals", "docs_id": 67368, "title": "&quot;Impressumspflicht&quot; outside Germany for individuals", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is another \"Do I need an Impressum\" question in a special case.\n\nI understand under German law, an impressum is required for all websites except strictly non\\-profit\\-oriented websites for private purposes.\n\nAssuming I'm a small musician of some kind from inside Europe but outside Germany. I've got a website in English and my native language where I offer bookings (for paid services). Would I need an impressum?

They would require an impressum if they're based in Germany. Would this also apply for bloggers outside Germany if they're using Google Ads (to finance their website)?\n\nAre there known cases where German executive go after private individuals (such as bloggers that are placing ads on their site) in another country? Wouldn't this be an enormous effort?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you operate from outside Germany but within the EU, it is generally sufficient to satisfy your own country's regulations. This is a foundational principle of the EU single market, though it's not quite realized yet and has exemptions for consumer protection purposes. However, the German TMG law which includes the Impressumspflicht explicitly enshrines this principle. So from the *German* Impressumspflicht perspective, you're good to go.\n\nHowever, you will not be able to operate anonymously, because of *your* country's laws.\n\n* GDPR requires you to clearly state your identity and contact details in your privacy notice.\n* If you engage in internet\\-based commerce, the EU eCommerce Directive will have caused your EU member state to pass legislation that requires you to disclose:\n\t+ your name\n\t+ the geographic address where you are established\n\t+ contact details incl an email address\n\t+ if applicable, registration numbers from trade registers or similar\n\t+ if applicable, your VAT ID\n\nNote that you must have a VAT ID for cross\\-border B2B sales within the EU.\n\nYou state that you are not selling anything via your website, and are instead collecting payments via another website. What the consequences of this are would depend on the laws and caselaw in your jurisdiction, but you will have to make these disclosures on at least one of the two websites.\n\nAbout Germany going after bloggers who show ads:\nincome from ads is taxable income,\nand operating a business requires registration.\nHowever, the German Impressumspflicht is rarely enforced by the state.\nInstead, other market participants (competitors) trawl the internet for potential violations and then send a cease\\-and\\-desist letter.\nThey can do this because skirting legal obligations distorts the level playing field, which harms those competitors.\nThere is a thriving cease\\-and\\-desist industry built around this, but it only affects businesses that operate within Germany.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A musician from an EU country outside Germany has a website in English and their native language, offering bookings for paid services.

According to the documentation, if you operate from outside Germany but within the EU, it is generally sufficient to satisfy your own country's regulations. This is based on the principle of the EU single market. The musician would need to comply with their own country's laws, which would likely include disclosing their identity and contact details due to GDPR requirements and the EU eCommerce Directive. They wouldn't need a German Impressum specifically, but they couldn't operate anonymously. The use of Google Ads doesn't necessarily require registration with German authorities for non-German EU residents. Option A is incorrect as a German Impressum isn't required for non-German EU businesses. C is wrong because anonymity isn't possible due to EU regulations.

That would be the case with an airline reservation, and one clear sign is that you have to pay for the ticket when you make the reservation; or, it you don't, then there is no contract, and they can cancel or change the price. You would look for clear signs of an agreement, such as a \"agree to terms\" button that you have to click. Paying a deposit is another clear sign. Then you would simply look at the terms of the contract to see what their obligation is, and what yours is. They may have strongly committed to providing service in which case you might have a cause for legal action if they break that commitment, or they might have made no specific promises about service in case of intervening events (such as if the chef has a heart attack, or the power goes out). If we do think of this as a contractual matter, you breached your duty as a customer, to be there by 7:30, so even if there is a contract, they didn't break it. The note that you added renegotiating the arrival time was insufficient \u2013 it is outside of the contract, and possibly something that they didn't see (they only look at the names and official time blocks reported by the web page).\n\nIn lieu of a contract, there could be some statutory obligation, i.e. a specific regulation in Sweden saying \"if a restaurant accepts a reservation, they absolutely must hold the space available for the entire reserved time\", which is an unreasonably onerous business practice that no nation requires.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A couple makes an online reservation at a restaurant for 7:30-9:00 PM.

Based on the information provided, making a reservation typically doesn't create a legally binding contract unless there are clear indications of such (e.g., payment, explicit terms agreement).

While they might have a customer service complaint, they likely don't have a strong legal case. However, local regulations could potentially affect this situation, which is why D is the most accurate answer.

Although the roots and cluster base are entirely on the neighbor's property, one of the trees in the cluster grows diagonally over the property line, such that all of the palm branches occur on our side of the property line.\n\nI am aware that I am allowed to trim vegetation that crosses the property boundary; however, I am not allowed to perform trimming that would kill the tree. In this case, trimming the portion of the tree over the line would definitely kill it.\n\nCan I compel my neighbor to have the tree removed (or relocated, at their discretion)? We are located in Florida, US, if that is pertinent to the answer.\n\nI don't have an image of the actual plantings in question, but below is a good approximation of the size of the plantings, and degree that the tree crosses the boundary line (yellow line). Our property would be to the left of the line, neighbor's to the right. (For clarification, the trees are planted in ground, and there is no concrete around the property line; this is just an example image I found that approximates the size of the trees)\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iYNkG.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iYNkG.jpg)\n\n---\n\nBackground: My neighbor has complained that our landscaping/lawn maintenance company has crossed the property line during their work. Our landscaper disputes the neighbor's claims, but allows that they may have inadvertently stepped over the property line. This is possible, but not likely, as the neighbor's plantings are low, and it would be difficult to trim their plantings that cross the line from slightly over the line. Not to mention, pointless, as it is easier to trim the encroaching plants entirely from our property, than it is to stand on or near the property line.\n\nNotwithstanding our neighbor's claim, he has crossed entirely to our property while trimming his plantings. When he attempted to confront us about our landscaper allegedly crossing over, he defended his own crossing over as allowed because he was maintaining his plantings.\n\nThe neighbor has sent a letter from his attorney stating that we are not allowed on his property without express written consent. Fine, we have no interest, nor need, to cross onto his property. However, we are incensed that he misrepresented the facts, and we feel he is essentially attempting to bully us into letting his plantings grow by vaguely claiming some of our trimmings have damaged the \"heart\" of the tree; and asserting our landscaper engaged in \"conversion\" (*sigh*).\n\nPrior to my neighbor's belligerence, we were content to simply trim the low trees that crossed over the line; it wasn't much of a big deal. But now battle lines have been drawn.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The only way to compel a neighbor to do something is to sue him and get the court to use force. In order to succeed in your lawsuit, you need to show that you have been harmed (annoyance/nuisance does not count). The courts are generally not sympathetic to battle lines being drawn, but might in principle listen if you show that the tree is harming you (not just annoying you). Even then, the court will order compensation for that damage and will not order the removal of the tree.\nThe tree\\-owner has a duty to take reasonable care to maintain the tree, so they cannot just let it fall on your gazebo and say \"oops\". The problem is that the basic rule is that \"a possessor of land is not liable to persons outside the land for a nuisance resulting from trees and natural vegetation growing on the land\", but if a tree destroys your property, the courts also will not suppose that the neighbor has a right to negligently destroy your house. See [Scott v McCarty](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2533344/scott-v-mccarty/), 41 So. 3d 989, [Gallo v. Heller](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1111782/gallo-v-heller/), 512 So. 2d 215\\. Therefore, a lawsuit would have to focus on the extent of actual damage \u2013 it has to be more than a nuisance. Also, the principle that \"it is wiser to leave the individual to protect himself, if harm results to him from this exercise of another's right to use his property in a reasonable way\" does not mean that you cannot trim the tree at all: you may be able to mitigate the problem without damaging the tree. You almost certainly will have to accept some level of \"trespass\" from the vegetation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a property dispute in Florida involving a tree that crosses the property line, which of the following statements is most accurate according to the legal principles outlined?\n\nA) The property owner can compel their neighbor to remove the tree if it causes any annoyance or nuisance.\n\nB) The court will always order the removal of a tree if it grows over the property line, regardless of damage.\n\nC) The property owner can trim parts of the tree that cross the property line, even if it kills the tree.\n\nD) The property owner might have a case if they can prove actual damage beyond mere nuisance, but the court is unlikely to order tree removal.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D.

You can imagine the list of exclusive rights listed above as a handful of post it notes. One says, \"to reproduce the copyrighted work...\" Another says \"the right . . . to display the copyrighted work publicly.\" Someone who owns all of these exclusive rights can do anything he wants with them. He can give one of the post\\-it notes away permanently (assignment) to another person, or he can give it away temporarily (usually, a license). He can give away just one, or all at the same time.\n\nThe terms of this website are effectively requiring you to let SE borrow, forever, the post\\-it note that says \"publicly display\" **so that they are not violating your exclusive right of public display**.\n\nHowever, this assumes you even own that exclusive right (post\\-it note). Something in the public domain no longer has any rights (post\\-its). No exclusive rights exist at all with respect to such a public domain work *in copyright*.\\*\n\nTherefore, since you do not possess any copyright rights with respect to a public domain work, you have nothing to give to SE, and so you have not given anything to SE.\n\nThe answers to your questions therefore are \"no you have not licensed anything\" and \"yes it stays in the public domain\".\n\n* Other rights can apply to images, such as trademark.

The Stack Exchange Terms of Service require users to allow SE to display profile content, but for a public domain work, this permission is unnecessary as no one holds display rights to restrict. The image remains in the public domain, and Stack Exchange gains no new rights over it.

Are you a US citizen?\n\n\t* For a person who is a citizen of the United States and at least one other country, is it okay simply to answer *yes*?\n\t* For a person who is a citizen of multiple countries, not including the United States, is it okay simply to answer *no*?\n2. What country are you a citizen of?\n\n\t* Is it necessary to disclose all countries of citizenship when responding to the second question? Does it matter if one of those countries is the US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. Yes. A multi\\-nation citizen who has US citizenship has equal US citizenship with every other citizen; therefore the answer to this binary question is \"Yes\". The citizenship(s) of anyone who does not have US citizenship is irrelevant to this question; thus, the answer to this binary question is \"No\".\n2. Yes. The main point here is to determine if you have the relevant documents and permissions to be legally present in the US. If you are a US citizen, a) this makes the process easier for you and b) avoids any possible issues if evidence is found of citizenship from another country, which will make immigration think that A) you are not a US citizen and b) you lied to them. Most people have only a single citizenship. That is the default mindset of immigration. There's no downside for you to inform them; there may be additional difficulties, delays, and scrutiny if you do not.\n\nIf you are not a US citizen, most of the same applies. Additionally, lying (even by omission) can be grounds to have your legal status revoked.\n\nIn summary, if you have the legal *right* to be in the US (e.g. US citizen, legal resident) being fully honest cannot hurt you, and can make the process smoother.

The employer may not provide the employee with goods on credit. The employer may, by agreement, provide the employee with goods as a credit against the employee's remuneration, provided that the goods are provided at the average cost price. The goods provided must be of average type and quality unless expressly agreed otherwise. The value of the agreed benefits in kind or the crediting of the goods provided against the remuneration may not exceed the amount of the attachable part of the remuneration.\n> * The payment of regular remuneration may not be excluded in cases where the employee receives a tip from a third party for his work. A tip is an amount of money paid by a third party to the employee without a legal obligation in addition to a service owed to the employer.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThe base *Salary* can never be paid in anything but Euros.\n\nMakes sense, how would you determine whether 2 apples, an egg and a parttime timeshare of a camel each month are above or below the minimum wage? How would the employee pay their own costs from that, even it it were worth more? Taxes would be a nightmare. Good luck to the Ex\\-Wife and kid, getting half an apple and a stinky camel timeshare for a day as alimony. No, money is there for a reason.\n\n*Benefits* like bonuses or additional agreements on top of your basic salary *can* be goods of other kinds. Loot boxes for example. Please note that the employee has to explicitely agree on that. I will assume getting an *additional* lootbox on top for free is something an employee can agree on without a second thought. Getting parts of your salary normally paid in Euros or bonus normally paid in Euros as Lootboxes would be something the employee would have to explicitely agree to, otherwise it must be Euros. You cannot \"force\" an employee to accept anything but Euros.\n\nNote the sentence that the employer can give the employee goods instead of Euros not for their made up \"sale\" price, but for the cost of making them. So for no profit. You could pay someone partially in loot boxes, but since a loot box costs about 0,01\u20ac to make (electricity, database maintenance, the developer who has to press the button once a month), that would be a *lot* of loot boxes to pay a part of the salary.\n\nAnd yes, even \"goods\" will be taxed. They are part of your income. So if you get a \"lootbox\", be preprared to pay taxes on that. If you don't play the game, paying taxes on something you don't use might not be worth it after all.\n\nIt is well known that companies have employee\\-only pricing schemes. For example you will find that employees of automobile manufacturers will drive their brands cars, because getting a good price on a car is a big deal. Some companies allow private use of company cars for the employees that work \"in the field\". But it is very rare that employees get actual goods monthly as part of their salary in Germany.\n\nBut there is no mention of \"luck\" anywhere in the law.

However, employers and employees can agree on benefits in kind (such as bonuses) as part of the remuneration if it's in the employee's interest or aligns with the nature of the employment relationship. This includes items like lootboxes, but requires explicit agreement from the employee. The law also specifies that the value of such benefits cannot exceed the attachable part of the remuneration.

The purchases were made on their Canadian website. The product in question is a consumer product (a type of tool) of which there are many versions; the key difference between the different versions is the materials used. The different versions are easily distinguishable in pictures because they are differently coloured. For this situation we\u2019ll consider two versions of the product: version A is an upgraded version of the \u201cstandard\u201d version B, version A usually costs around double what version B does.\n\n**The situation**:\n\nI\u2019m part of a facebook group that pertains to one of my hobbies. Someone on one of those groups shared a link to the online store of the retailer, who was selling version A of the product around 40% less than normal retail price (it\u2019s common to share such links on this group when you find good deals). The advertised image on the website was that of version A and the description (basically a specs sheet) clearly stated the materials used were those of version A. It was a good deal, not too good to be true (stuff goes on sale all the time) but some group members contacted the store\u2019s customer support to make sure. Customer support confirmed that it was indeed version A. So far, so good, everyone\u2019s happy, a few of us bought the item thinking that it was version A. (you probably figured out where this is going) \n\nA few days later packages start arriving in the mail and everyone received version B. We had a good deal on version A at 40% off, but even at that price it\u2019s slightly more than what version B would cost\u2026 so one was happy. We contacted customer support who apologized, they said they did not carry version A (in fact, they never carried it in Canada) and that it was simply a mistake on the website. The website has now been updated to show the image and description of version B. Because they do not sell version A, they say that there\u2019s nothing they can do to provide us with the products that were advertised. They offered everyone who contacted them to return the item for a refund.\n\n**Additional info**:\n\nSome people who bought the items took screenshots of the webpage which was clearly advertising version A, and of the email sent to them by customer support confirming that it was indeed version A.\n\n**My question**:\n\nWhat can I do in this situation?

Do I break the EU's or US's laws in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Technically, downloading such pictures and sending them to others is copyright infringement, unless they have been released under a license which permits sharing them with others.\n\nCopyright infringement is not a crime. It is a ***tort***. That means the copyright owner can sue, if and when the owner learns this has happened, and chooses to bring a court action. As that would involve paying a lawyer, and court fees, and other expenses, most owners will not bring such a suit unless they think the damages are likely to be large enough to make it worth their time and trouble, over and above getting their expenses back. Most copyright owners would not bother to sue over personal sharing of pictures posted on the net. However, that is the choice of the owner to make, if they learn of the sharing.\n\nNote that, if instead of attaching a picture to an email, one sends a link, there is no copyright infringement involved, even technically.\n\nWhile the details of copyright laws differ in different countries, the information above is true for both the US and the EU, and most if not all other countries.\n\nOne of the ways in which copyright laws differ between countries is in the exceptions to copyright that are available. In the US there is the somewhat complex concept of \"fair use\". Being personal and non\\-commercial use does not automatically make something fair use, although it helps support a finding of fair use. Some EU countries have a specific exception for personal use. I believe that India has such an exception also. Many countries have exceptions for news reporting, use in classroom teaching, parody, and various other cases.\n\nI said above tyht copyright infringement is not a crime. That is not always true. Under [17 USC 506](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506) infringement can be criminal, but **only** if the infringement is:\n\n1. willful;\n2. for private financial gain or commercial advantage; and  \n\n3A) of works valued at over $1,000, or  \n\n3B) of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, knowingly preempting such distribution by electronic posting.\n\nI believe that there are similar limits on criminal copyright infringement in the laws of other countries.\n\nBeyond that, the current policy of the US Department of Justice is to prosecute criminal copyright infringement **only** when it is done on a bulk basis, as a business. In particular, mass reproduction and sale of CDs and DVDs without permission may be prosecuted.\n\nComments point out that a plaintiff may, in the US, elect to receive statutory damages, instead of actual damages, and in that case need not prove any financial loss. This is true, but the damages may be as low as $750 per work infringed (not per copy) or as low as $200 for \"innocent infringers\". The amount is set by the court, as it thinks just.\n\nIt is also true that a US court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs, under 17 USC 505\\.

Non\\-competition clauses involving lawyers are also subject to heavy professional ethics regulations not common to non\\-legal professional activities.\n\nWithout a more concrete example of what the dropservicing business model would entail, it is impossible to do a very definitive analysis. Your model seems to be based upon obtaining services from a third\\-party and re\\-selling those services.

Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the FOIA, Presidential Records Act, 44 USC 2204(c)(1\\), the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of E.O. 13526, only if such classification or reclassification meets the requirements of E.O. 13526, and is accomplished on a document\\-by\\-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official. Information may not be reclassified after declassification and release to the public under proper authority.\n\nSimilar provisions were detailed in [E.O. 12958](https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/appendix/12958.html).\n\nA \"proper authority\" would not include, say, leaks, like those due to Snowden. Note that, as for Trump's situation, while he most surely counted as a \"proper authority\" while President, there is no indication whatsoever that the information was also released to the public under his or any other proper authority.\n\n[A recent and somewhat controversial example of reclassification began in 1999 under the Clinton administration, as a result of aforementioned E.O. 12958, and lasted for several years after](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB179/index.htm).\n\n> To justify their reclassification program, officials at CIA and military agencies have argued that during the implementation of Executive Order 12958, President Clinton's program for bulk declassification of historical federal records, many sensitive intelligence\\-related documents that remained classified were inadvertently released at NARA, especially in State Department files. Even though researchers had been combing through and copying documents from those collections for years, CIA and other agencies compelled NARA to grant them access to the open files so they could reclassify documents.\n\nA separate article from the same link provides:\n\n> ...security officials at DOE had become concerned that the implementation of EO 12958 had led to the inadvertent release in State Department and other agency records at NARA of \"unmarked\" restricted and formerly restricted data on nuclear weapons. In the fall of 1998, Congress formally authorized the Department of Energy to remove from public document repositories any and all sensitive nuclear weapons design\\-related information pursuant to Section 3161 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, entitled \"Protection Against Inadvertent Release of Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.\"\n\nThe argument the agencies seemed to advance for this reclassification is that prior declassifications had not undergone the proper equity considerations: meaning that agencies other than the ones who declassified them had an interest and say in their classification, which should not have been overlooked. While some complained about the reclassification of information that had entered the public domain\u2014the material had been on the public shelves for years, and some of it had even been published and a good deal more of it sifted through by various parties\u2014this did not seem to matter to the agencies.

It used to be that the local municipality billed the tenant directly for their exact usage. Now, management companies are using 3rd party billers, of which there's a marked increase in the cost of utilities.\n\nThere are two popular methods of calculating these utility costs applied by most management companies. The first is to bill for exact usage. In this case the management company receives your metered bill, pays it, and then has the tenant billed by the 3rd party which is then added to the rent payment. The second is to use an algorithm to \"share\" the cost among tenants. In these cases the algorithm varies but in all cases the tenants who use less pay for the tenants who use more (this is always included in an addendum to the rental agreement).\n\nRegardless of the method, management companies refuse to show the original bill so that the tenant can independently verify that they're being charged the correct amount. Further, many will lie and claim they have nothing to do with the charges and that it's completely controlled by the 3rd party biller.\n\nDoes the tenant have a right to see the bill and verify that the required payment is correct? What remedies might be available to the tenant in Florida should the first question prove true (and the landlord or management company refuse to provide documentation)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My guess is the answer to this question is going to be in your lease. You likely signed a lease that agreed that you would pay accept this practice and spelled out what ever rights you have to challenge the billings. My guess is they are as limited as the courts will allow in Florida. And the only way to ensure access to those records would be to get the court to compel they provide you with the records. \n\nPerusal of the [Water codes in Florida](https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ChapterHome.asp?Chapter=25-30) does not appear to directly engage this practice(I could have missed it). However it appears that there is code regulating the management of electrical limits the billing to no more than the actual costs to the customer of record(probably your real estate management company.)\n\nAccording the the [NCSL](http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/utility-submetering.aspx) (This refers to electrical service. I am assuming there is similar language used elsewhere for plumbing, or that the intent of the law is uniformity of these codes in all utility billings.\n\n> Where individual metering is not required and master metering is used\n>  in lieu thereof, reasonable apportionment methods, including\n>  submetering may be used by the customer of record or the owner of such\n>  facility solely for the purpose of allocating the cost of the\n>  electricity billed by the utility.

The 3rd party is the one levying fees for the management on your landlord.

Is it an easement, *profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre*; is that a full fledged *fee simple* or a mere interest arising out of a contract?\n2. Is it alienable/assignable?\n3. Can there be apportionment of the right?\n4. Does the right outlast the life of the original\ngrantee/holder?\n\nLooking for a [*Restatement (Third)*](https://books.google.com/books?id=T_loAxRR0XUC&lpg=PT121&vq=profits&dq=american%20law%20institute%20restatement%20third%20servitudes&hl=fr&pg=PT118#v=onepage&q&f=false) compliant answer if it's based on U.S. common law. One can assume the deed is ambiguous and therefore all the presumptions come into play except for the fact it mentions the grantee has an **exclusive** right to fish, that his intent is **sport** fishing, and that there is **no dominant land** whatsoever involved. \n\n---\n\nExpanding on the first question, whether those fishing rights include any interest whatsoever in the river bed or whether it is seen as a charge/burden on the land owner's (A) radical title is of particular interest (registration considerations may be discussed if pertinent).3\n\n**II**. Since *Restatement (First's)*, I read *profits\\-a\\-prendre* are subsumed into *easements* in the U.S.. Therefore, I would also like to know which American states still have a *noncommercial easement in gross which is assignable*, based on past precedent i.e. states which have not yet integrated *Restatement (First's)* in that respect (i.e. in so many words still have *profits \u00e0 prendre* independent of the modern easement).\n\n---\n\n1 I'm revisiting a civil law decision through the eyes of the common law. The landmark decision is [*The Matamajaw Salmon Club* v. *Duchaine, since deceased*](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1921/1921_94.html), \\[1921] UKPC 94, \\[1921] 2 AC 426, with the opinion delivered by [Viscount Haldane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Haldane,_1st_Viscount_Haldane#Contribution_to_Canadian_Constitutional_Law) for the *Judicial Committee of the Privy Council*, at that time the court of last resort for the Empire, overturning a decision from the *Supreme Court of Canada*, [\\[1919] S.C.R. 223](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/9478/index.do), on appeal from [27 Que. K.B. 196](https://books.google.com/books?hl=fr&id=j081AQAAMAAJ&dq=editions%3Ax1kdf4OyzisC&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=matamajaw), concerning *fishing rights* bought by a famous Canadian character, [Lord Mount Stephen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephen,_1st_Baron_Mount_Stephen#Salmon_fishing), Bt., GCVO. What happened is that in the first instances of the case, reference was made by the Quebec justices to the common law concept of *profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre*. So what you end up having is a very intricate discussion about the foundations of property law and implicit comparisons between the civil and common law traditions. Perusing this material is not required in order to provide an answer.\n\n2 It is not clear whether the economic balance in the exchange plays a role in qualifying of the right someone like (B) would hold. One justice [explains](http://citoyens.soquij.qc.ca/php/decision.php?ID=F7A9615607E83E62CE8D34BADFA97FB8&page=1) Viscount Haldane's inclination to see more than a personal right arising from the fishing right in the aforementioned case, is a *consideration* motivated analysis of the exchange. The right was granted in exchange of what is assumed to be valuable land, so it must be worth more than some trinket, and therefore justifies a self\\-contained title of some similar value. (*Mc Whirter c. Cochrane*, 2008 QCCS 5643, par. 17\\). For further background on *personal servitudes* and the impact of *Matamajaw* on Quebec civil law, see also [*Club Appalaches c. P.\\-G.

From my perspective, the fish in the river is closer conceptually to that very water, than it is to crops and fruits. It is *res nullius*, the *thing nobody owns*, and as such it is *appropriation* i.e. fishing, which creates property; it is not property before that, that I know of. So can a fee simple be based on that? Plus I read that in UK common law, a [profit a prendre](https://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/lexispsl/property/document/393788/55KG-P261-F18C-41F9-00000-00/Profits%20a%20prendre), as opposed to an easement, can only be registered if it's in respect of something which can be owned (I quote: *eg a right to take water from a spring or pump, or the right to water cattle at a pond may be an easement but cannot be a profit a prendre. Water, when taken, is not owned by anyone; nor is it part of the soil*).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an area of law that is in flux. For example, in Colorado, where I practice, the rule has changed over the last ten to thirty years. I'll provide a traditional and modern view of each.\n\nThe intermediate view and to a lesser extent the modern view, also give more weight to individualized evidence of the intent of the parties on a case by case basis, while the traditional view would be rather indifferent to the actual intent of the parties.\n\n> How do you qualify that fishing right? Is it an easement,\n>  profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre; is that a full fledged fee simple or a mere\n>  interest arising out of a contract?\n\nThe traditional view would be that this would be a profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre, also known as an \"easement in gross\" which is a property interest (since it is permanent or at least indefinite). The modern view would see it as having more similarities to an easement (or more precisely to a generic \"servitude\"). This assumes, of course, that it was not merely an expressly designated or orally created \"license\" as opposed to a property right.\n\n> Is it alienable/assignable?\n\nThe traditional view is that it is not alienable or assignable. The intermediate view is that it is alienable or assignable only if it expressly so provides. The modern view is that it is alienable or assignable unless the instrument creating it expressly provides otherwise.\n\n> Does the right outlast the life of the original grantee/holder?\n\nThe traditional view is that it does not. The intermediate view is that it only does so if it expressly so provides. The modern view is that it presumptively survives the life of the original grantee/holder.\n\nThe traditional view would also terminate the right upon the death of the grantor, at least if it does not expressly provide otherwise.\n\n> Can there be apportionment of the right?\n\nThe traditional view is no. The modern view is that the right can be apportioned only if this can be done without increasing the burden that the rights holder (the dominant estate) imposes on the river owner (the servient estate) and does not expand its scope. Depending upon the way that the right is formulated, this may or may not feasible.\n\nAn exclusive right for one person to fish and an exclusive right to fish exercised by thirty people impose a very different burden on the fishery, unless the thirty people are limited to the catch that one person exclusively fishing would have reasonably accomplished.\n\n> I would also like to know which American states still have a\n>  noncommercial easement in gross which is assignable, based on past\n>  precedent i.e. states which have not yet integrated Restatement\n>  (First's) in that respect (i.e. in so many words still have profits \u00e0\n>  prendre independent of the modern easement).\n\nShort of a full fledged law review article this is pretty much impossible to answer. Based on searches of similar kinds of legal issues that I've done in the past, I would guess that 40%\\-60% of states have no clear precedents on the issue one way or the other, and another 10\\-20% of the states have some precedents but those precedents are ambiguous or are so stale that it is not obvious that they would be applied if the issue was litigated today.\n\nThe remaining states would probably be split fairly evenly between the traditional and modern rules.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a jurisdiction that follows the modern view on fishing rights granted as an interest in property, which of the following statements is TRUE regarding the alienability and duration of such rights?\n\nA) The fishing right is not alienable or assignable and terminates upon the death of the original grantee.\n\nB) The fishing right is alienable and assignable only if expressly stated in the deed, and presumptively survives the death of the original grantee.\n\nC) The fishing right is alienable and assignable unless expressly prohibited in the deed, and presumptively survives the death of the original grantee.\n\nD) The fishing right is not alienable or assignable but automatically survives the death of the original grantee.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Under the modern view, fishing rights granted as an interest in property are presumed to be alienable and assignable unless the instrument creating them expressly provides otherwise. Additionally, these rights are presumed to survive the death of the original grantee/holder.

The tenant can indeed appeal the court's decision to enter a judgment on what they believe was a moot issue. This is because deciding whether an issue is moot is a matter of law, and issues of law are appealable.\n\nThe success of this appeal would depend on the evidence presented about the tenant's occupancy status at the time of the judgment.

The meme about under 3\\.5 inches derives from the general statute pertaining to concealed weapons, where [CO Rev Stat \u00a7 18\\-12\\-101](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-18/article-12/part-1/section-18-12-101/) defines \"knife\" as being over 3\\.5 inches long (and it is a misdemeanor to carry a concealed knife). We'll come back to this.\n\nThe applicable part of the definition of \"deadly weapon\" in the school\\-specific law is\n\n> (II) A knife, bludgeon, or any other weapon, device, instrument,\n>  material, or substance, whether animate or inanimate, that, in the\n>  manner it is used or intended to be used, is capable of producing\n>  death or serious bodily injury.\n\nThis raising a question that I encourage you not to test, whether the school deadly weapon definition excludes knives that are longer that 3\\.5 inches. The definition section for Article 12 starts by saying\n\n> (1\\) As used in this article, *unless the context otherwise requires*\n\nso that means that \"knife\" is redefined in a special way (in terms of length), and that is for the entire article which includes the school weapon section. The actual definition of \"knife\" in the definitions section of Article 12 is\n\n> (f) \"Knife\" means any dagger, dirk, knife, or stiletto with a blade\n>  over three and one\\-half inches in length, *or any other dangerous\n>  instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds*,\n>  but does not include a hunting or fishing knife carried for sports\n>  use. The issue that a knife is a hunting or fishing knife must be\n>  raised as an affirmative defense.\n\nThe modifier \"with a blade over three and one\\-half inches in length\" might be thought to refer to all of the preceding terms, or just the last one \u2013 stiletto. These is a rule of legal interpretation that a modifier should be interpreted as referring to the *last* antecedent, meaning that the length limit pertains to stilettos. The punctuation (lack of comma) supports the interpretation \"stiletto with a blade over three and one\\-half inches in length\", meaning that a knife is a knife. Whether or not a literal knife with a blade under 3\\.5 inches long constitutes a redefined knife, it certainly constitutes a \"dangerous instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds\".\n\nIn the context of a specific law restricting the possession of weapons (concealed or not) in schools, the context requires that the definition explicitly mentioned in 18\\-1\\-901(3\\)(e), which is outside Article 12, is being referred to. The reason the law was explicitly written to refer to *that* definition was so that the general definition in article 12 would be overridden.\n\nMy point is that this is a not atypical example of the problem of legal definitions, which can get rather convoluted. If someone has told you that a knife under 3\\.5\" is legally not a knife, you probably now know why they would say that, but also you should know what that's simply not true when it comes to weapons in school.\n\nI omitted one complication, which in this instance is not applicable, namely the kirpan exception. In [Singh v. Thompson](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/36/1102/562950/), 36 F.3d 1102, it was ruled that a prohibition against knives (in school), in that instance, violates the Free Exercise clause (the kirpan must be worn at all times). On the other hand, [TSA does forbid](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/frequently-asked-questions/may-i-keep-head-coverings-and-other-religious-cultural-or) taking a kirpan into the secure zone, a matter which has so far not been litigated.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under Colorado law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the possession of knives in schools?\n\nA) A student can legally bring a knife with a blade under 3.5 inches to school, as it's not considered a \"knife\" under state law.\n\nB) The definition of a \"deadly weapon\" in schools excludes all knives with blades under 3.5 inches in length.\n\nC) A knife of any length could potentially be considered a \"deadly weapon\" in a school setting, depending on how it's used or intended to be used.\n\nD) Religious exceptions, such as for Sikh students carrying kirpans, automatically override all school weapon prohibitions in Colorado.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the complex interplay between different Colorado statutes and legal interpretations regarding knives in schools. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while there's a 3.5-inch distinction in the general concealed weapons statute, this doesn't apply to the school-specific law. \n\nOption B is false because the school weapons law refers to a broader definition of deadly weapons that isn't limited by blade length.\n\nOption C is correct.

For example, this person could not plausible be classified as a salaried employee or manager in this scenario for FLSA purposes.\n\nYou could, of course, set a reasonable expectation regarding how much time should be allocated to reading the manual, so long as the expectation you set is indeed reasonable \\- five minutes would be unreasonably short, but 20 hours to memorize it would be unreasonably long.\n\n**Is The \"Employee\" An Independent Contractor?**\n\nIt is conceivable that the person you describe as an employee is really an independent contractor, rather than a employee, and hence not subject to minimum wage laws. \n\nFor example, you do not have a duty to determine that a catering company that serves many customers and is its own business providing food for you on an irregular basis, or a third\\-party restaurant that delivers either itself or through a third\\-party delivery service, is paying minimum wage or complying with work safety laws like OSHA, because they are independent contractors. \n\nBut, there is nothing in your question that suggests that this is the case. (Note that if this person is an \"employee\" and not an \"independent contractor\" that it is also important that you obtain worker's compensation and pay withholding taxes for your domestic employee; often this is done via a third\\-party payroll service.)\n\n**Applicable Law**\n\nThe [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, et seq., requires you to pay every hourly employee the federal minimum wage, plus overtime if applicable, from \"Portal to Portal\" (i.e. from showing up to work until leaving work, because commuting time is not counted as work for purposes of the FLSA).\n\nHours worked is defined as follows by the FLSA at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(o), contains no exception for time spent reading a safety manual:\n\n> In determining for the purposes of sections 206 and 207 of this title\n>  the hours for which an employee is employed, there shall be excluded\n>  any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end\n>  of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during\n>  the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice\n>  under a bona fide collective\\-bargaining agreement applicable to the\n>  particular employee.\n\nThis states with respect to employees in domestic service at 209 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(f):\n\n> Any employee\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) who in any workweek is employed in domestic service in a household\n>  shall be paid wages at a rate not less than the wage rate in effect\n>  under subsection (b) of this section unless such employee\u2019s\n>  compensation for such service would not because of section 209(a)(6\\)\n>  of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 409(a)(6\\)](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title02/0209.htm)constitute wages\n>  for the purposes of title II of such Act \\[42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 et seq.],\n>  or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) who in any workweek\u2014\n> \n> \n> (A) is employed in domestic service in one or more households, and\n> \n> \n> (B) is so employed for more than 8 hours in the aggregate, shall be\n>  paid wages for such employment in such workweek at a rate not less\n>  than the wage rate in effect under subsection (b) of this section.\n\nThe referenced Section 206(b) is the currently effective federal minimum wage (currently $7\\.25 per hour).

This understanding came to Party B partly because, according to Party B, that is how the agreement was presented by Party A, contrary to the letter of the agreement.

The above is a working example, but my general question is whether a clause in a written contract is valid and enforceable, if all parties took regular actions contrary to the clause for a very long time without any dispute. An analogy to the above situation would be a written agreement of parties that monthly, 10$ would be exchanged for a selfie, for a period of 20 years. Then 19 years pass and nobody ever sent a selfie, or 10$ in exchange, or took any action with respect to that agreement, but one party starts sending selfies (many years later) and asks for their rightful 10$.

To the extent that Party A suffered damage, tough \\- they don\u2019t get to benefit from their own breach.\n\nParty A might wish to argue that Party B has [waived](https://sklawyers.com.au/dictionary/waiver/) their right to adjust the payment but this would be difficult to prove. It doesn\u2019t appear that there is an explicit waiver but neither is their an implied waiver: Party A would need to show that Party B was aware of and condoned the breach in some way.\n\nYou are right that a contract can be altered after it is entered into and that such a change can be implicit rather than explicit. But that would require showing some action rather than inaction by the parties to effect a different arrangement. In practice, where one party affirms the written contract, without clear and compelling evidence that the contract has subsequently been changed, the written contract will prevail.\n\nFor an example, Yale University periodically collects the interest due on a perpetual [bond](https://news.yale.edu/2015/09/22/living-artifact-dutch-golden-age-yale-s-367-year-old-water-bond-still-pays-interest) originally issued by the Dutch water board Lekdijk Bovendams on 15 May 1624\\.

The practice of using \"John Doe\" or \"Jane Doe\" as a placeholder name is common in such situations. This allows the legal process to continue without being completely halted by the lack of a defendant's true identity. There are precedents for cases involving unnamed defendants or those identified only by DNA profiles. While refusing to identify oneself might create challenges for the court, it doesn't necessarily prevent the case from moving forward or result in automatic dismissal or indefinite suspension. The defendant's right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment generally protects them from being forced to self-incriminate, which could extend to revealing their identity in some circumstances."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89421/the-prevention-of-corruption-act-in-india", "docs_id": 89421, "title": "The Prevention of Corruption Act in India", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The section 7A of the [Prevention of Corruption Act](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/handle/123456789/1558?sam_handle=123456789/1362) in India states:\n\n> Taking undue advantage to influence public servant by corrupt or\n> illegal means or by exercise of personal influence.\n> \n> \n> Whoever accepts or obtains or attempts to obtain from another person\n> for himself or for any other person any undue advantage as a motive or\n> reward to induce a public servant, by corrupt or illegal means or by\n> exercise of his personal influence to perform or to cause performance\n> of a public duty improperly or dishonestly or to forbear or to cause\n> to forbear such public duty by such public servant or by another\n> public servant, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which\n> shall not be less than three years but which may extend to seven years\n> and shall also be liable to fine.\n\nUndue advantage means illegal compensation in this Act.

The section does not explicitly mention the extraction or extortion of money after the act has been done.\n\nHowever, it is possible that the act of extorting money from Y by X after causing the public servant to perform a duty improperly or dishonestly could be considered as an attempt to obtain an undue advantage by X through illegal means. The court's interpretation of the section will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case, and the intent of the drafters of the law.\n\nIt is important to note that the Prevention of Corruption Act is a special law that is intended to combat corruption and ensure the integrity of public servants.

The law starts by addressing the proscribed act, which is if one (I'll get to \"one\" below, which is the crux of the matter)\n\n> intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any\n>  other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or\n>  electronic communication\n\nThe [definition of \"intercept\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2510) is\n\n> the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire,\n>  electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic,\n>  mechanical, or other device.\n\nA robo\\-call is send\\-only, so that action does not acquire anything. Then the question is whether Jarvis is a \"device\". There is a specific exemption from the definition of \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\":\n\n> (b) a hearing aid or similar device being used to correct subnormal\n>  hearing to not better than normal\n\nJarvis is not covered by (b). Part (a) exempts\n\n> any telephone or telegraph instrument...furnished to the\n>  subscriber...being used by the subscriber...in the ordinary course of\n>  its business... or (ii) being used by a provider of wire or electronic communication service\n\nwhich we can assume is not the case with Jarvis (the provider does not supply the device): Jarvis is a device, and Jarvis intercepts.\n\nOne way that such interception can legally be accomplished is via consent. At the federal level, it is sufficient that one party consents, though in some states, such as Washington, all parties must consent. Assume that only the federal law is relevant. The law regarding consent says\n\n> (d) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for *a person* not\n>  acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic\n>  communication where such person is a party to the communication or\n>  where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent\n>  to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the\n>  purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the\n>  Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State.\n\nA program is not a person, so a program cannot consent. However, if we go to the very top of the law, the prohibition starts:\n\n> Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any *person*\n>  who...\n\nA program cannot violate the law (laws apply to people), at the moment.\n\nIf a program is deemed to be a legal person (either statutorily or by Supreme Court ruling), this all changes, but then Jarvis would have the capacity to consent (unless a program is deemed to be a person incapable of consent, but that would be silly because criminal law is predicated on the assumption that the actor \"consented\" to do the act).

Alex, without consulting the others, issues new shares that significantly dilute the ownership stakes of Bella, Charlie, and Dana. The other co-founders want to take legal action.

While the company is incorporated in Dubai, the fact that all parties reside in Australia could be sufficient grounds for Australian courts to claim jurisdiction. However, even if an Australian court accepts the case, it would likely apply Dubai law since that's where the company is incorporated. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while Dubai courts would have jurisdiction, they are not the only possible venue. \nOption B is false because Australian courts may claim jurisdiction based on the residency of all parties involved. \nOption C is incorrect as it unnecessarily limits the options; while arbitration could be a possibility, it's not the only recourse, and court action is still an option.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the complexity of international business disputes, where the choice of court (jurisdiction) and the choice of law applied can be separate issues."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/71313/can-a-restrictive-covenant-deny-a-land-owner-the-right-to-use-a-road-on-their-ow", "docs_id": 71313, "title": "Can a restrictive covenant deny a land owner the right to use a road on their own property?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If an easement appurtenant grants access to a property for the purpose of traversing it, can it also restrict the servient estate from any use of that way of access?\n\nI am wondering about the enforceability of a restrictive covenant on a deed that completely denies the use of a road to a servient estate.\n\nIt would seem that a restrictive covenant that entirely prevents the servient estate from using a road that crosses their property, essentially conveys the property to the dominant estate because in that case the servient estate would have no use whatsoever of that portion of their property. Since the whole point of a property right is to use and enjoy that property, it would seem that a restrictive covenant entirely denying access to a part of a property to the property owner would violate that fundamental right.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can a restrictive covenant deny a land owner the right to use a road\n> on their own property?\n\nYes.\n\nA restrictive covenant could impose such a limitation, although usually a court would disfavor that interpretation of a covenant unless no other reasonable interpretation is possible from the language of the covenant.\n\nThis is basically because it would be lawful (at common law anyway) to convey the land in its entirety to the covenant beneficiary, so it is lawful to convey a lesser interest to that person.\n\nIt isn't inherently unconscionable unless it makes the property subject to the covenant landlocked with no access to a public road, in which case some mandatory doctrines regarding a right of access would probably apply.\n\nOften this would be done to create a private drive across the \"front lot\" (which has direct access to a public road by other means) when the \"back lot\" of a parcel was conveyed by the owner of the combined lot to the new owner of the back lot.\n\nA covenant might be chosen instead of an outright conveyance of the dogleg of road because it retains mineral rights in the servient estate owner, because it clearly allocates property tax payment duties to the underlying owner as part of a larger economic deal, and/or because it could make a transaction possible that would otherwise be prohibited by subdivision requirements applicable in that locality. The restriction might also reduce the servient estate owner's liability for accidents arising from use of the covenant access easement, since it would ordinarily vest all maintenance and use regulation in the dominant estate owner.\n\nSome other common easements that deny the servient estate owner all use of land for a period of time are easements to allow staging of road construction activities, and easements incident to mineral rights in states where destruction of the surface is allowed if it is later restored when the minerals are extracted (such as Wyoming).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A property owner, Alice, grants an easement appurtenant to her neighbor, Bob, allowing him to use a private road across Alice's property to access his landlocked parcel. The deed includes a restrictive covenant stating that Alice may not use this road for any purpose. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The restrictive covenant is automatically void because it completely denies Alice use of a portion of her own property.\n\nB) The restrictive covenant is likely enforceable, but a court would interpret it narrowly and try to find alternative interpretations if possible.\n\nC) The restrictive covenant is unenforceable because it makes Alice's property landlocked with no access to a public road.\n\nD) Restrictive covenants can never deny a property owner use of their own land, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, a restrictive covenant can indeed deny a landowner the right to use a road on their own property. While courts generally disfavor such interpretations and would try to find alternative meanings if possible, they can be enforceable if clearly stated. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the covenant is not automatically void, even if it denies use of a portion of the property. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the scenario doesn't state that Alice's property becomes landlocked; it only restricts her use of one specific road. \n\nOption D is too absolute and contradicts the information given, which states that such restrictive covenants can be enforceable under certain circumstances.\n\nThis question tests understanding of easements, restrictive covenants, and how courts interpret such agreements in property law."}}
