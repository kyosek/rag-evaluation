There are [exemptions](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/screen75.asp) some of which relate to the minimum wage requirements, which I will ignore. Then there are state rules regarding [when minors can work](https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/youth-employment/hours-of-work). Age 14 is the lower ends of allowed minor labor without a court order. There are two age brackets, 14\\-15 and 16\\-17, regarding the number of hours per day and week, whether during a school week or a non\\-school week. There are also exemptions where minors (16\\-17\\) are not restricted e.r.t. \"school week hours\" depending on whether e.g. then are married, are parents, are taking college courses, or have a high school diploma or GED, but they are otherwise restricted from fully volunteering their labor.\n\n[Title 49](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49) has the state laws regarding labor. It is challenging to establish that anyone can legally volunteer their labor under state law, even though it is not prohibited at the federal level. If you turn to Chapter 49\\.46 RCW which relates to minimum wage, under the definition of \"employee\" excludes\n\n> (d) Any individual engaged in the activities of an educational,\n> charitable, religious, state or local governmental body or agency, or\n> nonprofit organization where the employer\\-employee relationship does\n> not in fact exist or where the services are rendered to such\n> organizations gratuitously.\n\nThere are no further restrictions on volunteer labor, at least w.r.t. to the issue of being paid (insurance is a separate title).\n\nYou can now put these two parts together. *No* minor can work unlimited hours; a minor *can* work as a volunteer for certain non\\-profits."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old high school student wants to volunteer at a local non-profit organization dedicated to environmental conservation. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal restrictions on their volunteer work?\n\nA) The student can work unlimited hours as a volunteer since labor laws don't apply to unpaid work at non-profits.\n\nB) The student is subject to the same hour restrictions as paid work, but only during school weeks.\n\nC) The student can work unlimited hours as long as they have parental permission and it doesn't interfere with their education.\n\nD) The student is subject to hour restrictions for both school and non-school weeks, with some potential exemptions based on their personal circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the provided information, minors (including 16-year-olds) are subject to hour restrictions for both school and non-school weeks when working, even as volunteers for non-profits. There are two age brackets (14-15 and 16-17) with different restrictions. While there are some exemptions for 16-17 year olds regarding \"school week hours\" (e.g., if they are married, parents, taking college courses, or have a high school diploma/GED), they are still generally restricted in their work hours. The law does not allow unlimited hours for minors, even in volunteer positions. Answer A is incorrect because labor laws do apply to volunteer work for minors. Answer B is partially correct but incomplete, as restrictions apply to both school and non-school weeks. Answer C is incorrect because parental permission alone does not override labor law restrictions for minors."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16481/can-chelsea-manning-be-sued-in-civil-court-by-anyone-named-in-the-documents-that", "docs_id": 16481, "title": "Can Chelsea Manning be sued in civil court by anyone named in the documents that were leaked?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Since Chelsea Manning's name is in the news, the following question seems interesting: \n\n* Manning leaked a large set of documents\n* Some of them could have clearly had a negative effect on specific persons (e.g. loss of reputation).\n\n**As such, can a person who was negatively affected by the leak sue Manning in civil court?** (assuming they have a reasonable claim that they were indeed damaged by the leaks meaningfully).\n\nBy \"can,\" I mean \"has a reasonable chance of having a meaningful lawsuit that proceeds, instead of it being thrown out by a judge as ridiculous due to obvious legal problems\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming that the documents were either true, or Manning reasonably believed that they were true, [there would be no cause of action for defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation#Truth).\n\nMany of the documents disclosed would have been confidential in some sense, but usually a violation of a confidentiality statute has a criminal sanction associated with it, but does not carry with it a private cause of action \u2013 in part, because conceptually, the party actually harmed is considered to be the government and not the person about whom information is revealed.\n\nIt is also possible that Manning could utilize the [state secrets privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege) as a defense and have such a suit dismissed on the grounds that a full and adequate defense of the claims would require the disclosure of official state secrets. For example, if a covert agent were murdered due to a wrongful disclosure of information, usually official disclosure of the fact of being a covert agent would be required to prove the case, and that evidence would be barred by the state secrets privilege, effectively barring the lawsuit entirely.\n\nConstitutional claims of privacy violations under the 4th Amendment generally relate to the wrongful acquisition of information and not its wrongful disclosure. The constitution bars unreasonable search and seizure, not unreasonable disclosure of information.\n\nThe only privacy tort that might be applicable is \"Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts.\" (A sister privacy tort, Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into privacy affairs, is directed at the collection of data phase and not the dissemination phase).\n\n*See* [Restatement of the Law (Second) of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 652B and 652D](https://cyber.harvard.edu/privacy/Privacy_R2d_Torts_Sections.htm).\n\nBut, this tort raises serious First Amendment concerns and has not been widely adopted. Realistically, this tort is unconstitutional in the absence of an affirmative contractual or quasi\\-contractual duty not to reveal facts that runs to the person making the disclosure, and in general, Manning would not have that kind of relationship. \n\nThe classic public disclosure of embarrassing private facts case would involve a lawyer's or psychotherapist's revelations about a client.\n\nAlso, in the case of the public disclosure tort the basis for damages is largely personal emotional distress and violation of trust, as opposed to damage to reputation, *per se*. The requirement is that the disclosure be embarrassing or breach of contract, not that it harm someone's reputation since you have no legal right to a reputation that differs from the truth."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A military analyst, Sarah, leaked classified documents containing information about several high-ranking officials' involvement in controversial overseas operations.

If someone were to give you a physical copy of their resume (assuming such a thing would happen in this day and age) then giving this to someone else without copying it is not copyright violation. There may be privacy issues involved but that\u2019s another issue.\n\nFurther, in the United States, there is a [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) doctrine which allows limited copying without permission in certain circumstances. This is likely to apply in a lot of situations around copying resumes.\n\nFinally, permission does not have to be explicit. For example, if you receive a resume in the course of a job application then permission to make copies *for that purpose* can be assumed to have been implicitly given.\n\n> Can you get sued if the resume finds its way to someone the author did not intend to see it, and the author suffers some harm as a result?\n\nUnder privacy law, possibly. Under copyright law, no.\n\nWhat you can be sued for is *making a copy*. It doesn\u2019t matter where this ends up.\n\n> Is distributing a resume in the context of professional networking considered as implicit consent to allow sharing with anyone under the US legal system?\n\nNo. It\u2019s explicit consent because those networking sites have Terms and Conditions that explicitly deal with copyright.

When someone submits a resume for a job application, there is an implicit permission given to make copies and share the resume within the company for purposes related to the job application process. This falls under the assumption of implied consent for the specific purpose of evaluating the candidate for employment opportunities within the company.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because receiving a resume does not imply unlimited sharing rights. There are still copyright and privacy considerations.\n\nAnswer B is too restrictive. Explicit written permission is not always necessary for internal sharing related to the job application process, as implied consent can be assumed in this context.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it misunderstands copyright law.

In New Zealand the procedure is set out in [r 9\\.36](https://legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2016/0225/latest/DLM6951893.html) and the following rules. Court experts can be appointed both on an application by a party and on the court's own volition.\n\nAs explained in [McGechan on Procedure](https://www.thomsonreuters.co.nz/mcgechan-on-procedure-westlaw-nz/productdetail/121396):\n\n> The procedure has not been widely used, probably because it goes\n> against the traditionally adversarial way in which litigation has been\n> conducted: each party would rather bring along its own expert, hoping\n> to discredit the other's expert in cross\\-examination, but ultimately\n> leaving it to the Court to choose between them.

Ultimately the court will decide who it will be (if anyone) from the list of candidates proposed by the parties.\n\nWhat is vague to me is whether the expert has to agree to be appointed. In case of regular expert witnesses they obviously are free to appear or not. But is it he same with court experts?

The correct answer, D, reflects that while it's advisable for parties to secure an expert's willingness beforehand, the formal requirement for consent is at the point of appointment by the court. This allows for a situation where parties might nominate experts without prior contact, but the court would need to secure the expert's consent before making the appointment official.

As an example, New York continues to consider an individual to be domiciled in NY until and unless that individual establishes a permanent domicile elsewhere.\n\nAnd (with few exceptions) if New York considers you to be domiciled in NY, you are considered a resident and must pay state tax on your worldwide income. This is distinct from individuals who have to pay state tax on NY source income.\n\nBottom line: if New York considers you a resident, you must pay state taxes on worldwide income, even if you did not set foot in NY or in any way have a connection to NY during the tax year.\n\nExample: John Q. Smith lives in NY and pays taxes for five years. For all of 2015 he is outside of NY and couch surfs around the US without establishing a permanent domicile. He does not return to NY after 2015\\. New York considers him to still be domiciled in NY for 2015 and therefore he must pay NY state tax on all of his worldwide income for 2015\\.\n\nSmith objects and faces off with New York in court. The first question would be what court(s) would have jurisdiction. New York would love it to be heard in state court and just cite their state tax law as their authority to tax Smith. And Smith wants it to be heard in federal court, but can't sue the state due to the Eleventh Amendment. So is that it, end of ballgame for Smith? The case is heard in NY, New York state law is the authority cited, Smith gets a state judgement against him and he has no way to appeal it outside of the state's jurisdiction?\n\nAnd the second question, assuming somehow the case gets to federal court or another state's court: Smith argues he had no connection to New York during 2015 and shouldn't have to pay New York state taxes. New York state counters his argument with: \"We have the authority to tax John Q. Smith under the legal theory \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\".

This is a hypothetical question on legal theory, not an actual case I'm trying to resolve.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On a certain level, it doesn't really matter which court hears the case, because New York's imposition of tax on a potential nonresident is a question of due process.\n\nIf he lands in a New York state court, he still raises the same constitutional challenge. If it is successful, it doesn't matter what the state law says. Even if the state court just says, \"Suck it; you're in New York so you pay according to New York law,\" he of course still has the opportunity to appeal that judgment to the U.S. Supreme Court once he's exhausted his appeals in state court.\n\nOn the second question, the basic idea is that you can't be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of one of those states (or D.C., Puerto Rico, etc.). We determine which state you're a citizen of based on domicile, so until a New York citizen sets up somewhere other than New York, he's stuck with New York citizenship. This concept is fundamental to a lot of different areas of law, and New York's approach is not at all unique.\n\nI don't have a case to cite to at the moment, but this has definitely been tested in court.

If John challenges this in court, what is the most likely outcome?\n\nA) John will automatically win because he didn't earn any income in New York that year.\nB) New York will win because states have unlimited power to tax former residents.\nC) John will lose because New York's domicile theory is constitutionally valid until he establishes a new permanent domicile.\nD) The case will be dismissed due to lack of jurisdiction in any court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. New York's approach to taxing based on domicile, even when a person is absent from the state, is generally considered constitutionally valid. The documentation explains that until a person establishes a new permanent domicile elsewhere, they remain a citizen of their last state of residence. This concept is fundamental in various areas of law and has been tested in court. While John could challenge this on due process grounds, the general principle is well-accepted.

To more clearly define the issue I have been collecting data from calibrated decibel loggers placed outside and inside homes along different neighborhood streets. I also launched a survey (peer\\-reviewed to ensure that it is unbiased) on SurveyMonkey. This was launched two weeks ago and to\\-date it has received 500 responses. An invitation to local Home Owners Associations to have members take the brief survey will go out next week.\n\nOur community of 15 square miles is allocated one officer from the County Sheriff's Department. Noise complaints made to the Sheriff's Office are pretty much ignored. \n\n**Noise Levels from Custom Exhaust Systems**\n\nIf the same noise events due to custom exhaust systems on some streets occurred at a work place, this would literally raise red flags with OSHA. For example, on a regular basis, noise levels registering 120 dB or higher are measured at distances of 140 feet or more for periods of 15 minutes or more. \n\n**Retaliatory Behavior**\n\nWarnings issued by apartment managers to drivers of loud vehicles often trigger retaliatory drive byes against the apartment complex. These typically start within one hour of the warning. Over the next five the seven days, the count of noise measurements higher than three sigma decibels higher than the average background noise for the street, more than doubles. (Typically 99\\.7% of all noise measurements for a given street will fall below the average plus three sigma decibels. The measure being used is the count of noise readings higher than 99\\.7% of typical noise measurements for a given street.)\n\n**Survey Results (thus far)**\n\nAfter approximately two weeks there have been 500 responses to the survey. Barking dogs are the number 1 source of noise with vehicles with custom exhaust systems and stereos as number 2\\. (Dogs were number 1 in surveys performed by the US EPA in the 70s and 80s). The top noise sources as of today are:\n\n1 Animals (barking dogs, cockerel)\n\n2 **Vehicular noise (custom exhausts, stereos)**\n\n3 Highway noise\n\n4 Aircraft\n\n5 DIY (power tools, hammering)\n\n6 Household activities (stereos, parties)\n\n7 Commercial/Utility/Emergency Vehicles\n\n8 Trains\n\nVehicular exhaust and custom stereo noise was lower in similar polls conducted by US EPA in the 70s and 80s (prior to the de\\-funding of ONAC).\n\n**Impact on Property Values and Ability to Sell Real\\-estate**\n\nAs one realtor put it, noise is a raw real\\-estate nerve. Data from sources such as Zillow\\-Research show that a single family home in a noisy neighborhood will take 3 to 4 months longer to sell than an equivalent home in a quiet neighborhood. Homes in noisy neighborhoods will typically sell for 10% to 15% less than homes in quiet neighborhoods. The same results have been reported by studies conducted by Booz\\-Allen\\-Hamiltor in the United States (1994 \\- homes near airports) and the Swedish Government. Recorded noise levels in some neighborhoods match noise levels reported near large airports. \n\n**Absence of Legal Recourse**\n\nOur County Law Director insists that probable cause can only be established by a law enforcement officer. I proposed that citizens should be able to submit actionable complaints using three forms: (1\\) A screening form that is scored to determine if the complaint is legitimate or not (2\\) The same form filled out by law enforcement officers and (3\\) a notarized form that acknowledges the consequences of filing a false report. This was rejected due to concerns on workload.\n\nNeighborhoods that have genuine noise concerns essentially have no effective legal recourse. Fines imposed by a General Sessions court will only encourage retaliation.\n\n**Retaliation by Law Enforcement**\n\nOn more than one occasion, reports made to local law enforcement and local government have been met with retaliatory drive\\-byes by officers on motorcycles. This typically occurs between 1:30 AM and 2:30 AM following a complaint. The pattern (and this in on video) is an officer pulls close to the home and revs his bike as loud as he can under the nearest window of the person who filed the complaint. The officer then makes a very loud and high speed pass through the neighborhood, returns the spot under the window and revs his bike as loud as he can. This is typically repeated three or more times. Complaints and videos sent to our county law director generate no response what\\-so\\-ever.\n\nWho does one talk to when a law enforcement officer is the problem? Who does one talk to when local government does not respond to complaints about a law enforcement officer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need is a legal basis for a (legal) complaint. OSHA regulations are set by the federal government, which gets its regulatory power via an interaction between politics, Congress, and the Commerce Clause: OSHA regulations don't apply to your neighborhood. There are often local noise ordinances that restrict noise. I can look up the numbers for my county, which are in a 4x4 table (source vs. destination, 4 zoning classes), and the ordinance describes the required sampling details in engineering\\-grade detail. (Best to read the whole ordinance to be sure there aren't specific exceptions, such as the bell exception \\-\\- bells are apparently unregulated). The ordinance will probably say something about enforcement, e.g.\n\n> The sheriff may administer and enforce this chapter and any rules and\n>  regulations adopted or authorized by this chapter in accordance with\n>  state law. The director may enforce this chapter and any rules and\n>  regulations adopted or authorized by this chapter in accordance with\n>  K.C.C. Title 23 and state law. Upon request by the sheriff or\n>  director, any other county departments and divisions may assist in\n>  enforcing this chapter.\n\nI note that this says \"may\", not \"shall\". Assuming that you have such ordinances, that the noise unquestionably violates the ordinances, and the enforcer refuses to enforce, then you would need to either (a) vote the sheriff out of office or (b) file a suit to compel enforcement of the ordinance. You could sue seeking a writ of mandamus. At this point you would be hiring an attorney, where questions would arise such as whether you have the legal right to compel action, is the sheriff obligated to enforce the ordinance, and so on (can you show that? I don't mean, is there a good reason, I mean in a technical legal sense). The answers reside in your state's case law and ordinances.\n\nIt is possible that your state Attorney General would pursue the sheriff, since what you describe seems like a blatant violation of the law (retaliations especially). Another possibility would be a federal Civil Rights lawsuit.

The similarities between Gattaca and Heinlein's novels appear to be mostly conceptual (e.g., genetic selection, falsifying identity to join a space crew) rather than specific expressions of those ideas.

In particular, has any court ruled on the question?**\n\nI have not found any other part of the executive order that could be read as barring green card holders from entering the US, but I may have overlooked something. **Is there another part of the order that is relevant to the entry of permanent residents?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [The order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html) refers in sec. 3(c) to \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12\\) of the INA, [8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187)\". That section specifically names Iraq and Syria, plus \"points to\" potential areas of concern, as identified by the Sec'y of State and Sec'y of Homeland Security. The full list extends to Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, and is set forth at [81 FR 39680](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-17/pdf/2016-14422.pdf). \n\nThe cited authority is [8 USC 1182(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182), a section about inadmissible aliens, which says\n\n> Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any\n>  class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the\n>  interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such\n>  period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or\n>  any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the\n>  entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nThus he has authority to exclude permanent residents from re\\-entry (they are aliens, and re\\-entry is a subcase of entry), and has done so for 90 days. In the case of Syrian nationals, under sec 5(c) of the order, they are excluded until the order is changed. Sec. 5(c) of the order specifically declares\n\n> Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby\n>  proclaim that **the entry of nationals of Syria** as refugees is\n>  detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any\n>  such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient\n>  changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian\n>  refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n\nThe long\\-term ban on Syrians also specifies \"as refugees\", so \"such entry\" might not be interpreted to refer to entry of refugee or non\\-refugee Syrian nationals who are permanent residents. The 90\\-day ban in 3(c) (\"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens\") does not include any further restrictors, apart from the various government\\-official visas that are exempted, so there would be no basis in the order for excluding permanent residents. Whether this will be strictly enforced is a separate question, though in the period when the order was active (a day), it was applied to permanent residents. Sec. 3(g) allows exceptions \"on a case\\-by\\-case basis, and when in the national interest\". A recent (Saturday the 28th) [White House briefing](http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/legal-residents-with-green-cards-warned-not-to-leave-u-s/) says that green card holders \"will need a case by case waiver to return to the United States\".\n\nThe ban includes immigrants and non\\-immigrants, so it doesn't particularly matter how \"immigrant\" is defined \u2013 what matters is what an alien is. Still, \"immigrant\" is defined in [8 USC 1101 (15\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) as any alien, except a bunch of categories such as diplomats, tourists, business visitors, people in transit, students, and fashion models and similar, working temporarily here. Any permanent resident has an immigrant visa (but at any rate is an alien, and is either an immigrant or a non\\-immigrant).\n\nReturning to the words of the order, neither 3(c) nor 5(3\\) limit the ban to issuance of visas, it refers to entry. Not all entry by foreign national requires a visa. The word \"visa\" is mentioned, so it is possible to construe that mention as contextually restricting the ban to visas, however 3(a) which is entitled \"Suspension of Issuance of Visas and **Other Immigration Benefits** to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern\" orders the review \"to adjudicate any visa, **admission,** or other benefit under the INA\" which indicates that there is no such limitation.\n\n[8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(C)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) does say that a permanent resident is not \"regarded as *seeking* an admission into the United States\". Admission itself is defined in 8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(A), when applied to an alien, as \"the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer\". While a permanent resident is not *seeking* admission (and is not *applying* for admission), it would still be consistent with the law to forbid admission (legal entry). If you read 8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(C) as granting permanent residents widest latitude to enter without restriction, then that has the absurd consequence that permanent residents are subject to no scrutiny at all. The absurdity is avoided if \"seeing admission\" is a step prior to and is distinct from \"being admitted\" i.e. \"lawfully entering\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the executive order and relevant laws, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the entry of permanent residents (green card holders) from the affected countries?\n\nA) Permanent residents are completely exempt from the entry ban due to their legal status.\n\nB) The executive order explicitly bars permanent residents from re-entering the United States for 90 days.\n\nC) Permanent residents may be subject to the entry ban, but can apply for case-by-case waivers to re-enter.\n\nD) The executive order only applies to new visa applicants and does not affect permanent residents at all.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The executive order does not explicitly exempt permanent residents from the entry ban. While permanent residents are not considered to be \"seeking admission\" under 8 USC 1101(a)(13)(C), the order's broad language referring to \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry\" could be interpreted to include them. The order allows for exceptions \"on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest\" (Section 3(g)).

Mactavish wrote at the end\n\n> \\[60] **NSERC has not sought its costs of this application \\[embolding mine]**, and Dr. Luk\u00e1cs has not persuaded me that this case raises an important new principle regarding the Access to Information Act such that he should be entitled to his costs, notwithstanding the result. Consequently, no order will be made as to costs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Caveat: This analysis discusses typically and obvious reasons that there might be an agreement as to costs. But, we have know way of knowing the actual reason in particular cases.\n\nIn *Vancouver (City) v. Ward*, 2010 SCC 27, there were three claims in the underlying lawsuit. One was an award of $5,000 for wrongful imprisonment that was undisputed. One was an award of $5,000 for a wrongful strip search which was appealed but ultimately was affirmed. One was an award of $100 for claims related to seizure of a car, which was reversed on appeal.\n\nThe appeal decided by the Canadian Supreme Court was an appeal from a direct appeal to an intermediate appellate court. So, no further legal record had to be prepared at that stage of the litigation (with potentially expensive transcription fees), so the only issue as to costs that was outstanding were the costs for the final appeal, which would have been modest out of pocket, although, of course, attorneys were involved. And, even the legal arguments had already been made once by both sides in intermediate appellate court briefing.\n\nEven if the trial court plaintiff had lost both parts of the appeal brought by the government, he would have been a prevailing party in the litigation as a whole based upon his wrongful imprisonment damage award.\n\nBut, when you have several claims, some of which go for one party and some of which go for another, there is room for debate over who really prevailed.\n\nUnder the circumstances, given the comparatively small amount of dollars at stake, the parties may have simply agreed on a costs resolution (which probably awarded the trial court plaintiff all or most of his costs) to avoid spending more on litigation over how costs are awarded (and equally important, to avoid spending precious words in an Canadian Supreme Court appellate brief arguing that small dollar side issue).\n\nI've entered into similar agreements in appeals of complicated cases in the U.S. for the same reasons.\n\nI don't know if Canadian practice is to file a stipulation of record regarding costs in the trial court, or to simply note in the trial court record or an appellate brief that there is an agreement that has been reached, with a signed copy sitting in each side's files.\n\nAnother possibility is that at the outset of the case, or after an initial mediation, there was an agreement reached about costs (perhaps with both sides waiving a claim to costs) as part of a global agreement regarding procedural matters like limiting the scope of the claims to be pursued, dismissing secondary parties from the suit, or stipulating to key facts and/or to the admissibility of key documents to streamline a trial.\n\nVancouver may well have been motivated in part by appearances. Also, at least in U.S. practice, court filing fees are waived for governmental entities, and neither the lawyers nor the police witnesses give rise to any meaningful marginal cost particular to this lawsuit since the government lawyers and police are both salaried employees of the government, even though the legal fees of the government lawyers are probably recoverable in the proper case. So, waiving a right to collect costs may have been a very minor economic concession to it.\n\nVancouver also has a great strategic interest in having the case resolved in a precedent making case that can guide its future policies and practices going forward in a situation like is likely to recur, so they have some interest in having the trial court Plaintiff go the distance all of the way to the Canadian Supreme Court to resolve the legal issue the case presented. So, there are all sorts of reasons that Vancouver, in a case involving a recurring type issue presented to a governmental entity might want to reach an agreement on costs and would not merely be focused on maximizing its outcome in the particular case.\n\nAlso, while we don't know for sure, it is doubtful that the trial court Plaintiff was personally paying out of pocket to litigate to the Canadian Supreme Court over a $5,100 damages award. Probably some NGO or lawyer with a strategic interest in establishing the precedent financed most of the costs in practice. So, neither side economically felt much of the costs in this case making it an easier issue to negotiate.\n\nBut, in *Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Luk\u00e1cs*, 2018 SCC 2, and *Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi* (Rev 3\\) \\[2015] UKSC 67, which don't involve governmental entities, concerns about public image or a paramount desire to make precedents to guide future transactions of one of the parties are not nearly so great.\n\nIn those cases, a cost\\-benefit analysis in the individual case about the amount of costs at issue v. the amount of money that could be spent fighting over costs is probably more likely to be the main factor, particularly if the cases are complex enough that the amount of work necessary to fully litigate the costs issue could be significant."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of legal proceedings, what is the most likely reason for a pre-existing agreement between parties regarding costs, as mentioned in Vancouver (City) v.

This is particularly true in complex cases with multiple claims where some go in favor of one party and others in favor of the other party. In such situations, determining who truly prevailed can be debatable and potentially costly to litigate further. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while waiving costs might occur, it's not typically the primary reason for such agreements. Option C is unlikely as these agreements often aim for a more nuanced approach rather than having one party bear all costs. Option D is incorrect because these agreements are about managing costs, not increasing damages.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the practical approach often taken by parties to manage litigation expenses efficiently, especially when the costs of arguing over costs might outweigh the costs themselves."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85485/what-legal-rights-do-i-have-after-paying-a-deposit-for-some-building-work", "docs_id": 85485, "title": "What legal rights do I have after paying a deposit for some building work?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently got some quotes in for refitting the garage door on my house.

The details of the license depend on your use, the licensing agency, and the item being licensed. Online music licensing is a business, and there are a number of options to choose from. One concern would be assuring that the service didn't just become a way to get free music. Whether or not you could find an agency willing to create such a license is, well, not a legal question.\n\nApart from the problem of making the works available online, there is also the matter of copyright and your lesson plans. It is not clear what the content of such lesson plans is, but if you would be inserting substantial excerpts from the lyrics into your text, you need permission (a license) to do that. You can certainly talk about Taylor Swift's \"mean\" in your book and can quote brief passages (under the \"fair use\" doctrine), but you can't just copy the lyrics without permission. The fact that you can easily find the lyrics online does not mean that those webpages do so with permission."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A language teacher wants to create an online platform that uses copyrighted popular songs for educational purposes.

The documentation clearly states that to make songs available on a webpage, licenses are required from the copyright holders. Additionally, while brief quotes may fall under \"fair use,\" using substantial excerpts of lyrics in lesson plans also requires permission or licensing. Option A is incorrect because while \"fair use\" allows for brief quotes, it doesn't cover making entire songs available or using substantial excerpts.

The other countries of the E.U. (as of 1984\\) had rules similar to those of Britain's loser pays rule, although there was significant variation in detail from country to country that made this less of an omnibus statement than it might seem. See Werner Pfenningstorf, \"[The European Experience With Fee Shifting](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3749&context=lcp)\", 47(1\\) Law and Contemporary Problems 37 (1984\\).\n\nMost countries with civil law systems (i.e. those systems based upon the civil code tradition of Continental Europe rather than the common law tradition of England or something else entirely) outside of Europe in Africa and Asia are derived from the French Civil Code (most of West, Northwest and Central Africa, for example), or the German Civil Code (Korea and Japan, for example), and probably have followed in the footsteps on their parent legal traditions on this issue. This is also true of most formerly Communist Eastern European countries.\n\nMost countries in Spanish speaking Latin America, however, have legal systems derived from the Spanish legal tradition (and national constitutions modeled on that of the U.S.), so other countries besides the U.S. and Spain without automatic fee shifting to a prevailing party are probably located in Latin America. Some of these Latin American countries, however. probably adopted fee shifting rules of their own, and many of these countries declared independence from Spain before Spain adopted its civil code, so the extent to which those countries follow the Spanish model may not be as complete as in countries that gained independence later on.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, however, in most civil law countries, the fees that an attorney can charge are usually significantly more highly regulated than in the United States, so the possibility of extremely high litigation fees is lower. Furthermore, civil litigation, in general, involves lower attorney fees on average in civil law countries (and in Islamic law and Chinese style Communist countries) than in the United States, in litigated cases, because the process is less attorney resource intensive due to civil procedure differences.\n\nSo far as I know, fee shifting is also not used in Islamic law countries, where the basic assumption is that the parties are often pro se (i.e. without lawyers) and the institution of a professional legal class post\\-dates the establishment of the relevant legal rules.\n\nI do not know what the situation is in the People's Republic of China or similar legal systems.\n\n**The American Rule**\n\nIt also bears noting that there are many exceptions to the \"American rule\" in U.S. law.\n\nWhile the American rule does not shift attorney fees, fees for out of pocket litigation expenses such as filing fees, copying charges, and expert witness fees are shifted as a matter of course to the prevailing party.\n\nMost professionally drafted written agreements have fee shifting provisions.\n\nMany specific statutes (e.g. civil rights actions and many labor law and consumer rights enforcement cases) also have fee shifting provisions (sometimes one sided, sometimes two sides).\n\nFees can also be awarded in certain kinds of breach of fiduciary duty litigation contexts and in cases involving a dispute over a \"common fund\".\n\nIn divorce cases, litigation costs of both sides are often (really usually) allocated by the court in proportion to ability to pay, as \"winning\" and \"losing\" are ill defined.\n\nThe biggest areas where fees shifting would be unusual in the U.S. would be in common law tort lawsuits, such as negligence cases (e.g. automobile accidents and slip and fall cases), strict liability products liability cases, defamation cases, intentional harm cases, and fraud actions. The American rule also applies in cases of oral contracts or contracts drafted by inexpert non\\-lawyers. Even in those cases various kinds of litigation misconduct can result in fee shifting.\n\nIn U.S. tort cases, defendants usually have their attorney fees paid for by their insurance company, and plaintiffs often have an attorney paid on a contingent fee basis. Furthermore, awards by juries for non\\-economic damages and/or punitive damages often makes it possible for a prevailing plaintiff to receive full or nearly full economic loss compensation in such lawsuits, with the non\\-economic and/or punitive damages awards effectively providing resources to pay the attorney for the plaintiff on top of economic loss compensation for the plaintiff."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about fee shifting in different legal jurisdictions is NOT correct?\n\nA) Most countries in the European Union follow a \"loser pays\" rule similar to Britain's, although there are variations in the details.\n\nB) Islamic law countries typically do not use fee shifting, as their legal systems often assume parties represent themselves without lawyers.\n\nC) The United States consistently applies the \"American rule\" of each party paying their own legal fees, with very few exceptions.\n\nD) Spain, as of 1984, had rules on fee shifting that were very similar to the American rule.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct according to the passage, which states that most EU countries (as of 1984) had rules similar to Britain's loser pays rule.\n\nB is correct as the passage mentions that fee shifting is not typically used in Islamic law countries, where self-representation is often assumed.\n\nC is incorrect.

Offensive comments could lead to a viable claim of defamation only if they contain *enough factual connotation* that is false and tends to harm the professor's reputation. Actionability depends on whether (1\\) those *statements of fact* lead to provable losses; or (2\\) the law recognizes them as defamatory *in and of themselves*, that is, regardless of the context (under U.S. defamation law, this is known as *defamation per se*).\n\nIf comments are truthful or they veritably constitute *statements of opinion*, they are not actionable under defamation law.\n\nThe professor's \"severe depression\" itself does not trigger actionability.\n\n> What I\u2019m not sure is whether There is a data privacy case in this particular scenario.\n\nThe university's publication of the professor's picture preempts any actionability for other's act of posting that picture elsewhere.

If the premise is open to the public, restricting access is harder to justify. If the premise is restricted, access can be restricted pretty arbitrarily, apart from infringing on a person's property interest in the facility. A laboratory, for example, may restrict access to a specific list of people, or to a describable class of people. \"A department\" is a pretty big thing and generally does not describe a concrete location, but perhaps you mean \"may not enter the department office\" or \"may not enter any of the following offices\". Hallways in buildings are generally public places, unless there is a particular wing of the building where all access is restricted. \n\nIf there is good reason, a university official may prohibit a person, including a student, from entering a premise, and they can tell a specific person that they may not enter the department office.

You are subject to $1,000 payment whenever during your lifetime you should happen to ask for a pet care service to someone met through Wag!. Is this legal?\n\nThe provision is akin to a non\\-compete clause where the dog sitter agrees not to start a separate business in competition against their employer. In that case $1,000 qualifies as a compensation for breaching the agreement. However dog sitters (like Uber drivers) are not Wag! employees, and by the way these clauses are not permissible in all jurisdictions.\nThis is might be the reason they use the term 'referral fee', anyway, the fee is many times more the value of the referred pet\\-care services: imagine to pay $10,000 for a second hand car and $50,000 for someone helping finding the seller. It is reasonable to assume nobody would willingly accept to pay such a huge fee and the only reason to enter the contract is the misrepresentation of the associated costs.\n\nAll that given:\n\n1. How such a clause is to be construed (in a court)?\n2. If they charge customers credit cards with a $1,000 referral fee, what type of legal protection will they have?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: About the part where they say that will charge your payment method, when you terminate your relationship with the company, you should send registered mail withdrawing authorization to charge your credit card thereafter, and you should notify the credit card company that further charges are not authorized. This won't change your legal liability, it just changes whether they have to first prove that you are legally liable before collecting the money.\n\nIt is problematic that only the company has the right to terminate the contract, but you can treat that as a harmless omission of wording on their part. Surely they did not intend that you are perpetually bound to the terms of the contract and the obligations in section 11\\. Of course, you have to stop using their services in order to terminate the contract. Given the nature of their service, you can send a notice (registered mail again) to them informing them that you are terminating the contract and will not be using their services.\n\nIf then some time in the future you do hire a pet walker that you met through the service, they might come after you for the $1,000 (although, at their sole discretion, they can increase that amount to $20,000 or anything else, see section 2\\). If you have prevented them from charging your credit card, they would have to get a judgement against you, meaning they would have to go for arbitration. Or, if they did charge your credit card, then you would have to initiate the proceedings to get your money back. That is, unless you opted out of arbitration within 30 days of starting the relationship. Let's assume you did opt out.\n\nThe question would then be whether a perennial \"no\\-compete\" clause would be enforceable against you. Employees are often bound to no\\-compete agreements prohibiting them from doing the same work in the same area for a certain period of time. A lifelong no\\-compete agreement would be unenforceable, at least in court, but a 6\\-month no\\-compete clause could easily be. In [Medix Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Dumrauf](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/illinois/ilndce/1:2017cv06648/344091/36/0.pdf?ts=1524130353), the court recites standard legal requirements of enforceable no\\-compete agreements, especially that they be \"reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer\". In such a case, the court would consider \"the hardship caused to the employee, the effect upon the general public, and the scope of the restrictions\", and the company would have to show that the \"full extent of the restraint is necessary for protecting its interests\". It is in principle possible that the court would find such a clause unenforceable (owing to it imposing a life\\-long obligation on you). This could be a new area of law: customer non\\-compete clauses. \nOne other point about that clause is that it is just a penalty clause, which is unenforceable (calling it a \"referral fee\" doesn't change the fact that it is a penalty clause). It can't reasonably be interpreted as a liquidated damages clause (which is enforceable). $100 might be.\n\nYou might rely on the mercy of the court, hoping that they would find such a perma\\-ban clause to be \"unconscionable\" and unenforceable; in principle, the arbitrator could find the same thing.

This was done most recently in the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/drug-law-reform/fair-sentencing-act) that reduced excessive penalties for crack cocaine relative to powder cocaine.\n\nIn the same way, when the death penalty is legislatively repealed in a state, the death sentences of the handful of people on death row at the time is often commuted legislatively.\n\nWhile Congress cannot impose criminal penalties on someone legislatively, which is a [Bill of Attainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder) and constitutionally prohibited, it can single out people for special treatment in a [private bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_bill), which is a constitutional exercise of legislative power at the federal level (not every state allows private bills to be enacted due to Progressive era reforms to state constitutions).\n\nFor example, private bills often eliminate the collateral effects of a criminal conviction upon a person, there is even [a standard procedure for doing so](https://www.shusterman.com/privatebillruleshouseofrepresentatives/), which is functionally equivalent to a Presidential pardon of the crime for that purposes (the vast majority of Presidential pardons are issued after the person convicted has served the sentence for the crime).\n\nA private bill cannot impair contract or property rights, which would be a prohibited *[ex post facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law)* law. \n\nBut no one other than the federal government has a legally protected interest in keeping someone incarcerated or otherwise punishing them for a crime. Crimes are prosecuted in the name of the People and victims of crimes do not have legal rights in those proceedings except as created by statute. So, this would not be an *ex post facto* bill or a *taking* governed by the Fifth Amendment for takings of property interests. And, Congress may, by legislation, determine what the federal government will do in essentially all cases where it is not expressly prohibited from doing so (some argue that there is a minimum of federal authority vested exclusively in the President in the area of foreign affairs and military affairs, but that exclusivity of power does not extend to domestic criminal justice).\n\nBasically, anything that Congress could do for everyone via a public bill, it can do for someone in particular via a private bill, unless a specific constitutional prohibition applies, and there is no such prohibition when it comes to relieving someone from a sentence or the collateral effects of a criminal conviction prospectively via a private bill. This isn't exactly equivalent to a Presidential pardon or commutation, but it is very close to one in practical effect.\n\nFor a fuller, but somewhat outdated treatment of the issue, you can read this [1939 article](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3734&context=californialawreview) in the California Law Review which acknowledged that legislative pardons were possible under existing law. \n\nThis said, government prosecutors routinely fervently oppose any retroactive criminal legislation that reduces punishment, particularly via private laws (although some countries, such as France, have constitutional requirements to retroactively reduce the sentences of anyone currently serving time for a crime whose punishment is legislatively reduced prospectively).\n\nPrivate bills that constitute legislative pardons are very rare. A [2011 law review article](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=clsops_papers) recounts how the tool of the legislative pardon (in parallel with the executive pardon which is also used much less frequency) has fallen into disuse. \n\nPart of the decline is due to the adoption of the right to appeal from a trial court criminal convictions which did not exist in the federal system until the 1890s. Until then, the only judicial relief available from a federal criminal conviction was via a writ of habeas corpus, and that was available only on very limited grounds such as a lack of jurisdiction to conduct the trial, or the non\\-existence of the crime of conviction. Conviction by a jury in a court with jurisdiction of a constitutionally permissible crime was an absolute defense to the extent of the sentence imposed to a habeas corpus petition at that time.\n\n(As a footnote, the term \"private bill\" can be confusing. In many governments with a parliamentary system, a \"private bill\" means one sponsored by an individual legislator rather than the prime minister and his or her cabinet. But, in U.S. terminology, a \"private bill\" refers to a bill with an effect limited to one person or a small number of persons who are either identified by name or by a very narrowly defined situation.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Congress passes a private bill that retroactively reduces the sentence of a specific individual convicted of a federal crime, effectively pardoning them.

The second is whether all civil wrongs constitute crimes and hence can be regarded as illegal acts.\n\nA *crime* is generally defined as *an act or omission that is prohibited by law*. Thus, from what I understand, states will have various statutes that are passed by their respective legislatures defining what acts/omissions constitute crimes in their jurisdiction as well as what their potential punishments will be. For example, California may have a law written in a statute somewhere saying that an individual may not assault someone and that the penalty is no more than 2 years imprisonment etc.\n\nNow suppose someone in California bumps into someone else walking on the pavement (accidently) causing the other to fall and injure themselves. In this case, because the action of bumping into someone had no malice aforethought (it was accidental), we could say that the individual has not in fact committed a crime but instead has possibly committed a *civil wrong* (a *tort*). If this is the case, are there statutes in each respective state defining exactly what acts and omissions constitute civil wrongs? If there are statutes defining these civil wrongs, surely this would mean that all actions/omissions defined by statute to be civil wrongs are also in fact *prohibited by law* ? (since there exists a statute stating that the act/omission carries with it a potential penalty etc). If this is true, all civil wrongs must necessarily be *crimes* as well as civil wrongs since they are prohibited by law because a statute declaring a potential penalty for an act/omission is functionally a prohibition by law.\n\nAm I correct in my thinking here? Is it the case that all civil wrongs are necessarily crimes because they constitute actions/omissions that are prohibited by law (since there exists statutes defining them and their potential penalties)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The detailed answer depends on the jurisdiction that you are asking about (e.g. Saudi Arabia, France, US or specifically California): my answer is about the US. You should note that the term \"crime\" originally comes from Ancient Greek [\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=kri/ma), which means \"decision; judgment\": the word form is pretty stable, compared to the concepts that it is associated with. When the legal system changes, the referent of \"crime\" changes. Some facts about how the words are used are because of historically earlier concepts. At an earlier stage of English law, there was no distinction between crimes and civil wrongs, there were simply wrongs (\"tort\", in French).\n\nIn contemporary American practice, \"crime\" is a sub\\-type of offense against the government, the other being an \"infraction\" (such as a parking ticket). \"Civil wrong\" encompasses breaches of contract, breaches of trust, and \"torts\" such as trespassing and assault, and have in common that they are wrongs against an individual. If you commit a crime, it is you against the government, and one set of principles is adhered to in deciding *guilt*. If you commit a civil wrong, it is you against the individual (though it may be that the government acts as the mouthpiece when e.g. the \"citizens of California\" have been each wronged), and different principles are adhered to in deciding *liability*.\n\nThe distinction can be murky given overlap in certain cases, for example assault is both a crime, as dictated by statutory law and punishable by prison time, and also a tort (sub\\-type of civil wrong) as recognized at common law (traditionally recognized since the 13th century in England), and passed on to modern America. You can sue a person for the tort of assault, but the government prosecutes you for committing the statutory offense of assault. In the case of a lawsuit over assault, you seek compensation for the harm done do you, you do not seek punishment for an offense against society. That is the function of criminal law, to define the acts which may be punished.\n\nMost states in the US have done away with \"common law crimes\", but as far as I know the remnants of common law crime in the US are limited to \"definitions\" \u2013 punishments are set out in statutory law. An example of common law definitional inheritance is \"assault\" under [Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.36&full=true), where assault includes poisoning, transmitting HIV, and assaulting in various ways (relying on the common law definition of \"assault\"). This common law definition is then transmitted to the juror via a [set of instructions](https://govt.westlaw.com/wcrji/Document/Iefa7d8b5e10d11daade1ae871d9b2cbe?contextData=%28sc.Default%29&transitionType=Default), which summarize the case law that defines \"assault\".\n\nAs you can see, there is a bright line between crimes and civil wrongs, so it is plainly not the case that all civil wrongs are crimes. A number of civil wrongs are statutorily defined (e.g. copyright infringement), and there is in the US a tendency to statutorily encode the essentials of civil wrongs as well as crimes.\n\nYou are probably right that crime is \"generally\" defined as an act or omission prohibited by law, where \"generally\" means \"by most people\", but that is because most people don't have a clear understanding of \"law\", \"statute\" and \"common law\". Here in Law SE, we tend to use \"legal\" in a very broad sense, meaning \"would probably be allowed and not incur any sanction by the courts\". Copyright infringement is not (necessarily) a crime, but it is prohibited by law, thus \"prohibited by law\" is not a good definition of crime.\n\nBecause of the distinction between \"crime\" and \"infraction\", both of which are cases of the individual vs. the government, \"crime\" has to be defined in terms of a specific aspect of the statutory law, the punishment. You can be imprisoned for committing a crime, but not for an infraction, such as a parking ticket. In Washington, [\"infraction\" is defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=7.84.020) with reference to Title 76, 77, 79, or 79A RCW or RCW 7\\.84\\.030(2\\)(b) that \"is declared not to be a criminal offense and is subject to the provisions of this chapter\", such as [fishing with barbed hooks](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=77.15.160). Even though the government is the prosecutor in such a case, [the offense is defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=7.84&full=true) is said to be \"civil in nature\".\n\nIn other words, the distinction is anything but clear."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between civil wrongs and crimes in the United States legal system?\n\nA) All civil wrongs are necessarily crimes because they are prohibited by law and have potential penalties.\n\nB) Civil wrongs and crimes are completely separate categories with no overlap in any circumstances.\n\nC) Civil wrongs are always prosecuted by the government, while crimes are pursued by individuals seeking compensation.\n\nD) Some actions can be both civil wrongs and crimes, but they are treated differently in legal proceedings and have distinct purposes.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the nuanced relationship between civil wrongs and crimes in the US legal system.

The prosecution must prove Bob's guilt for murder beyond reasonable doubt, even though he has an existing conviction for assault. This situation creates a complex legal scenario, as it's logically impossible for Bob to have committed both crimes simultaneously. However, the existing assault conviction doesn't automatically prevent a murder trial or create insurmountable reasonable doubt.\n\nThe prosecution would need to address the conflicting evidence and explain how Bob could be guilty of murder despite his assault conviction. This might involve proving that the initial conviction was based on false evidence or testimony. The defense would likely use the assault conviction to argue reasonable doubt in the murder case.\n\nOption A is incorrect because overturning the assault conviction isn't a legal requirement before trying Bob for murder. Option B is false; individuals can be tried for other crimes while serving a sentence.

One can only try and log in with a Google account and it will fail if you are not registered, but one can also sign up for an account. When this happens, the app sends me an email with the email address and the name of the person that wishes to register. This information is given to me by Google.

It holds the actual data and has only showed it to you so you can grant or refuse access to your system.\n* You are a processor of data.\n\nYour part as a processor is exempt from GDPR because it is part of the household activities exception. Of course, that would be void if you tried to use the data for any other purpose (e.g. sending spam to the users trying to sell your application).

The trustees act on behalf of all creditors, so any creditor involved in the bankruptcy case has the right to request an assessment.\n\nD) Incorrect. While the tax tribunal oversees the appeal, it is not mentioned as having the authority to request an assessment of the trustees' costs. The assessment would be a separate process initiated by a creditor.\n\nThe correct answer highlights the important point that in bankruptcy proceedings, the trustees' primary responsibility is to the creditors, not to the bankrupt individual.

A good place to start is with who the regulations apply to. \u00a7160\\.10 lays that out: a health plan, health care clearinghouse, care provider, their business associates, and the Inspector General. Family members are not regulated entities. Subpart E regulates individually identifiable health information (such as \"person X has condition Y\") \u2013 this is protected information. \u00a7164\\.502 states that\n\n> A covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose\n>  protected health information except as permitted or required by this\n>  subpart or by subpart C of part 160 of this subchapter.\n\nThe first permitted use / disclosure is that the information may be revealed to the individual (*the* individual).

The police, or the store manager, can legally request you to come in for a conversation: what matters most is whether you were forced to come in against your will.

The police are irrelevant to the remainder of the question.\n\nWhat remains is whether your rights were violated because the manager told you to go away and never come back under pain of prosecution. The store is private property, meaning that the owner has wide latitude to grant or deny permission to enter. If they hate pink hair and your hair is pink, they can legally \"ban\" you. If they suspect you of involvement in a criminal activity, that can most certainly legally ban you.
