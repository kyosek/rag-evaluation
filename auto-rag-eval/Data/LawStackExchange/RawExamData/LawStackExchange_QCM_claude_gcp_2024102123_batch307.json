Whether it be his offices, his hotels or his restaurants, few assistants, in each of the settings, help in creating a false professional pretext to lure victims to the location and then slithering away to leave her alone with Weinstein. \n\nI know that discrimination cases against a company can be investigated by federal prosecutors. Can federal prosecutors investigate a pattern of sexual harassment inside a company? Can the acts of executives and assistants who aided Weinstein be viewed as solicitation? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The EEOC has authority to bring civil claims against companies in cases of sex discrimination, of which sexual harassment is a sub\\-type. Indeed, generally speaking, you can't bring a federal sex discrimination lawsuit against a private company without first presenting it to the EEOC.\n\nBut, to the extent that the conduct doesn't exclusively involve employees or prospective employees, the EEOC would not be involved in those matters, and the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department and private attorneys for the victims might have concurrent jurisdiction to bring civil claims.\n\n> Can federal prosecutors investigate a pattern of sexual harassment\n>  inside a company\n\nWhen the EEOC gets a complaint, it can expand the scope of its case beyond the person bringing the complaint. Saying \"federal prosecutors\" in this context is somewhat misleading, however, since that term is usually reserved for federal government lawyers who bring criminal cases, rather than civil sexual harassment charges.\n\nI don't recall whether the EEOC brings civil cases discrimination cases that goes to trial with its own lawyers (I think that this is usually the case) or with Justice Department lawyers. Both, in any case, are federal government lawyers, and in neither case would this be a criminal prosecution. \n\nThe EEOC can choose not to bring the claim, in which case a private attorney for the victim can bring it.\n\nSexual harassment, in a narrow sense, is not a state or federal crime, *per se*, although often sexual harassment involves conduct which is a state and/or federal crime. Usually, state law has a crime for unwanted sexual contact, a crime for unwanted sexual intercourse, a crime for extortion, and a crime for coerced prostitution, to name a few. I won't attempt to enumerate the potentially relevant federal crimes which usually must have some form of \"federal\" hook (e.g. transporting someone across state lines for purposes of sexual activity, or raping a federal employee).\n\nState crimes can be prosecuted by the state prosecutor (often both a county or district attorney and a state attorney general with concurrent jurisdiction, but sometimes integrated into a single agency with local branches in others like Florida). \n\nFederal crimes can be prosecuted by a federal prosecutor, usually a U.S. Attorney's office for a U.S. District Court District (which is part of the Justice Department), but sometimes federal crimes are prosecuted by lawyers assigned to a particular national level sub\\-division of the Justice Department (e.g. the Civil Rights Division). Private parties cannot prosecute crimes as a general rule (with some exceptions in a handful of cases in a few states most in the East).\n\nIt wouldn't be unheard of to have one set of federal government lawyers press a civil EEOC claim for sexual harassment, while a separate team of federal government lawyers press criminal charges related to the same conduct, with the separate teams of lawyers coordinating with each other to some extent. \n\nIt would be exceedingly rare to have the same lawyers handling both civil and criminal charges at the same time in a sexual harassment fact pattern. There would almost always be different lawyers handling civil cases and criminal cases in the federal government.\n\n> Can the acts of executives and assistants who aided Weinstein be\n>  viewed as solicitation?\n\nIndividuals who personally participate in some manner in the civil tort of sexual harassment or the crimes charges could have civil or criminal liability respectively in most circumstances.\n\nUPDATE: The FBI is basically investigating this kind of thing right now per Fox News. But, the FBI is an investigative/law enforcement agency, rather than attorneys prosecuting a case (even though a large share of FBI agents have law degrees). Federal agencies have broader powers to *investigate* potential crimes or civil rights law violations than they do to prosecute claims. Investigation requires only probable cause to believe that there was wrong doing, or even a reasonable suspicion or less for many forms of investigation (like asking for voluntary testimony from witnesses without conducting any 4th Amendment searches), even if there is not more solid evidence of it at the outset. \n\nFederal agencies also often have statutory civil subpoena power to investigate if there have been violations of particular federal statutes that does not require a showing of probable cause and can be utilized prior to bringing a civil action or criminal charges against anyone.",

Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the potential division of responsibilities: the EEOC can handle civil claims related to employees, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division might address civil claims involving non-employees, and separate federal prosecutors (likely from a U.S. Attorney's office) could pursue any applicable criminal charges. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the EEOC does not handle criminal prosecutions. Option B is wrong because while the FBI might investigate, they do not prosecute cases. Option D is incorrect because it incorrectly limits federal involvement and mischaracterizes the EEOC's scope."

In such circumstances if one party refuses a correction a court might order it. However, a date that is wrong by a month doesn\u2019t qualify. Even one that is wrong by years might not \\- there are leases that run for decades and a court would need to be satisfies that this isn\u2019t one of those.\n\nUnless both parties agree that it is a drafting mistake it is not subject to correction.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In North Carolina, a tenant signed a 2-year lease agreement in July 2016, but later discovered that the end date on the lease was August 2018 instead of the expected June 2018. The landlord acknowledges in an email that the lease was for 2 years but refuses to change the written lease. What is the most accurate legal interpretation of this situation?\n\nA) The tenant can enforce the June 2018 end date based on the landlord's email admission of a 2-year lease.\nB) The written lease is definitive, and August 2018 is the legally binding end date unless both parties agree to change it.\nC) The tenant can easily get a court order to correct the lease to June 2018 since it's clearly a mistake.\nD) The lease is void due to the discrepancy between the verbal agreement and the written document.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the legal principle outlined in the documentation, the terms of a written contract are considered definitive. Even if there were prior discussions or communications about a different end date, the date written in the lease (August 2018) is what was contractually agreed upon. Courts presume that the final written agreement represents the parties' ultimate intentions, regardless of prior negotiations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because email communications do not typically override the terms of a signed written lease.\n\nOption C is incorrect because courts are unlikely to order a correction for a minor discrepancy like a one-month difference, as this doesn't make the agreement absurd or obviously mistaken.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a discrepancy between verbal discussions and the written document doesn't automatically void the lease. The written document typically takes precedence.\n\nThe lease could only be changed if both parties agree to modify it, or in rare cases where a court finds the mistake so significant that it renders the agreement absurd, which is not the case here."

Does it not make a difference if a person is a contractor or employee until a dispute arises and it becomes unclear which laws (e.g. labour laws) apply? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Raise the question with your employer\n-------------------------------------\n\nIf you believe that you are an employee and not a contractor then there is presumably something you want from your employer. This may be additional wages and entitlements that you would have or will become entitled to for past or future work respectively. Or you may have been injured and want workers' compensation. Or terminated and you want redundancy pay. Whatever it is, work it out and raise the issue with your employer. You might want to consult an accountant or union to help you.\n\nThey may acknowledge that you were incorrectly classified and give you what you want. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!\n\nOr they may dispute it. If so, you need to follow the dispute resolution processes at your workplace. These typically involve informal discussions, escalating to mediation and then to a workplace tribunal run by the government. You will almost certainly want to consult a lawyer or union to help you \\- given that you don't know where to start the learning curve is likely to be too steep.\n\nIn virtually every jurisdiction if people *are* employees at law they can't *choose* not to be.\n\nin [british\\-columbia](/questions/tagged/british-columbia \"show questions tagged 'british-columbia'\") the relevant law appears to be the [Employment Standards Act](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/forms-resources/igm/definitions#employee) although it's not unheard of in edge cases for a person to be an employee under one law (e.g. workers' compensation) and a contractor under another (e.g. income tax).\n\nFrom the linked site:\n\n> The overriding question is \u201cwhose business is it?\u201d Is the person who is doing the work doing it as a person in business for themselves?\n\nIf you are working \"for\" your own business you are probably a contractor. If you are working \"for\" your employer's business you are probably an employee.\n\nFor example, if you are an accountant with several dozen clients, maintain your own business premises and charge for your advice based on the amount quoted rather than by the hour, you're a contractor.

The agency also controls which clients she works for and how she completes her tasks. If Sarah wants to claim employee benefits, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding her employment status in Canada?\n\nA) Sarah is clearly an independent contractor because she works from home and uses her own equipment.\nB) Sarah is definitely an employee because she receives a fixed monthly salary.\nC) Sarah's status is ambiguous and would need to be determined by a court or tribunal based on the overall nature of the working relationship.\nD) Sarah can choose whether to be classified as an employee or contractor based on her preference for tax purposes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Sarah's employment status is not clear-cut and contains elements of both employee and contractor relationships. While she works from home and uses her own equipment (suggesting contractor status), the agency exerts significant control over her work, sets her hours, and pays her a fixed salary (suggesting employee status). In Canada, the determination of employment status considers multiple factors, with the key question being \"whose business is it?\" Given the mixed factors in Sarah's case, her status is ambiguous and would likely need to be determined by a relevant court or tribunal based on a comprehensive assessment of the working relationship.

Before then, the Westminster parliament was only the Parliament of England. The Acts of Union provided, in part,\n\n> That the United Kingdom of Great Britain be Represented by one and the same Parliament to be stiled the Parliament of Great Britain\n\nWith that act, the Parliament of Great Britain assumed the role of the Parliament of Scotland. As a consequence, the Claim of Right Act of 1689 *grants power to* the Westminster parliament rather than circumscribing its power. To the extent the people are sovereign, this sovereignty is vested in their representatives in Westminster.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're talking about [the 1989 claim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claim_of_Right_1989), that document\n\n> has never had or claimed any legal force.",

The passage explains that the Scottish Claim of Right of 1689 established principles of parliamentary monarchy and invited William and Mary to accede to the Scottish throne. It circumscribed the power of the monarchy, not the Westminster Parliament. In fact, after the Acts of Union in 1707, the Westminster Parliament assumed the role of the Parliament of Scotland. As a result, the Claim of Right Act of 1689 actually grants power to the Westminster Parliament rather than limiting it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Claim of Right does not explicitly state that the people of Scotland are sovereign over Westminster.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the Claim of Right does not limit Westminster's power; it actually ends up granting it power after the Acts of Union.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the passage specifically states that the 1989 Claim of Right \"has never had or claimed any legal force.\""

Did this happen with equal regularity over the years or\n> was this something that happened mainly when the union was new?\n\nYou are right the Supreme Court of the United States is the venue for state vs. state disputes. Though I would be careful to differentiate \"inter\\-state\" litigation from \"stave vs. state\" litigation. These disputes did happen regularly over the years yes, but with differing success as the strength of the Federal Government and Supreme Court increased\\*. In general state v. state cases are not too common, and generally deal with issues such as land and border disputes or questions.\n\n\\*(See as a partial reference this video where when NJ sued NY over a land dispute, NY effectively ignored the Court/ the Court didn't hear the case in 1832\\. Whereas in the 1990s NY did not ignore it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=SgZ1f4ACZBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZ1f4ACZBQ))\n\nFor background the relevant provisions of the Constitution and statute are as follow:\nU.S. Const. Article III: Sec 2:\n\n> In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and\n> consuls, and those in which a **state shall be party**, the Supreme Court\n> shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before\n> mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both\n> as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations\n> as the Congress shall make. <https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii>\n\n28 USC Sec. 1251\n\n> **(a)The Supreme Court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of\n> all controversies between two or more States.**\n> \n> \n> (b)The Supreme Court shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of:\n> (1\\)All actions or proceedings to which ambassadors, other public ministers, \\> consuls, or vice consuls of foreign states are parties;\n> (2\\)All controversies between the United States and a State;\n> (3\\)All actions or proceedings by a State against the citizens of another State or against aliens. <https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1251>\n\nFor a recent/ current state v. state case see Mississippi v. Tennessee: [https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22o143\\.html](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22o143.html) concerning territorial matters/ water rights.\n\n> Is it therefore at least in theory possible for two states to have\n> contrary laws and scotus be forced to make a value judgment contrary\n> to state law to resolve some dispute?\n\nGenerally no, unless the state law is impermissible under the United States Constitution or otherwise preempted by federal law for example. But the Supreme Court wouldn't really rule on \"contrary\" state laws, most cases are concerning federal laws or land matters. Also, unless there is a matter of Federal Law (\"federal question\") or the state v state controversy under Article III the Supreme Court doesn't have jurisdiction to rule on state matters (again unless a \"federal question\" is involved).\n\n> Can scotus decide not to hear inter\\-state litigation in the same way\n> it often does with constitutional matters or are they forced to\n> mediate because there is no other way to settle such matters?\n\nYes, they can choose not to hear state vs. state cases. Rule 17 of the Supreme Court Rules regards \"Procedure in Original Action\" <https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/rule_17> in which the Court \"Court thereafter may grant or deny the motion, set it for oral argument, direct that additional documents be filed, or require that other proceedings be conducted.\"\n\nThough, and I will note for completeness in answering your question, some current Justices believe it is not discretionary. See below:\n\n> 155, ORIG. TEXAS V. PENNSYLVANIA, ET AL.  \n> \n> The State of Texas\u2019s motion for leave to file a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demonstrated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed as moot.\n> \n> \n> Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins: In my view, **we do not have discretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint in a case that falls within our *original jurisdiction***. See *Arizona v. California*, 589 U. S. \\_\\_\\_ (Feb. 24, 2020\\) (Thomas, J., dissenting).

Suppose the Coroner, on reviewing the body and scene, finds nothing but deadly injuries consistent with the fall and the circumstances in which the body was found. Now, one of four scenarios is possible:\n\n1. The person died of natural causes and then fell (natural death)\n2. The person fell accidentally (accidental death)\n3. The person fell intentionally of their own volition (suicide)\n4. The person was caused by another to fall (homicide)\n\nDoes the Coroner have the final say on cause of death?\n\nOr do any other offices have the right to investigate a death to look for evidence of homicide *in opposition to a verdict of the Coroner*?

But I would expect that would happen only in unusual circumstances. Like, maybe an internal investigation. Standard procedure is for the prosecutor, police and medical examiner to work together to investigate crimes and prosecute criminals.\n3. **Does a District Attorney (when not the Coroner) have the means and/or authority to conduct an independent and contrary investigation?** Yes. But it's unusual. See answer to number 2\\.\n4. **Or do any other offices have the right to investigate a death to look for evidence of homicide in opposition to a verdict of the Coroner?** Same answer as \\#2 and \\#3\\.\n\n---\n\nExplanation\n-----------\n\n### They work together on the same team\n\nThe medical examiner is a state employee and usually works on the side of law enforcement. If a medical examiner were to report a cause of death that did not support evidence of a crime, that information would have to be made available to any potential defendant. In the hands of any competent attorney that should be sufficient basis to create reasonable doubt and achieve an acquittal. I doubt many prosecutors would ever consider hiring an outside examiner in this case except under highly unusual circumstances like an internal investigation as mentioned above.\n\n### The defendant must create reasonable doubt\n\nIn the alternative scenario, when evidence of a crime is supported by the M.E. report, it would be up to the defendant to produce reasonable doubt by cross\\-examination or producing expert testimony that contradicts the M.E.'s conclusion. This might or might not include hiring an independent third party ***forensic pathologist*** as an ***expert witness***. [Dr. Cyril Wecht is a famous one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Wecht).\n\n### All opinions are subject to error, disagreement and cross\\-examination\n\nAll that said, the \"cause of death\" reported by the Coroner is just a medical opinion and is subject to error and disagreement like any other opinion. It's just that it's unlikely that disagreement would come from the side of law enforcement in most cases.\n\nFor further reading, [here is a link to the Coroner's Handbook](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/misc/hb_me.pdf). At the bottom of page 11, it acknowledges:\n\n> *Causes of death on the death certificate represent a medical opinion that might vary among individual medical\\-legal officers.*",

E.g. does it matter if Bob's construction business is Bob's Construction Inc. or Bob's Construction Corp.?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is there any significance to \"Inc.\" vs \"Corp.\"?\n> \n> \n> does it matter if Bob's construction business is Bob's Construction\n> Inc. or Bob's Construction Corp.?\n\nNo.\n\n\"Inc.\" is an abbreviation for \"incorporated\" and \"corp.\" is an abbreviation for \"corporation\" which are really just different grammatical variations of the same word.\n\nLimited is a term that can include both limited liability companies and corporations in some contexts, so this is less desirable if you want to make clear that you are a corporation rather than a limited liability company. Making the distinction between a limited liability company and a corporation is desirable because a 1099 has to be issued for payments to an LLC but not for payments to a corporation.\n\nThe word \"company\" is even broader and can be used to refer to any business firm regardless of its form of organization.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the choice between \"Inc.\" and \"Corp.\" as suffixes?\n\nA) Using \"Inc.\" provides stronger liability protection than \"Corp.\"\nB) \"Corp.\" is preferred for tax purposes and simplifies 1099 reporting\nC) There is no significant legal or practical difference between using \"Inc.\" or \"Corp.\"\nD) \"Inc.\" is only suitable for smaller businesses, while \"Corp.\" is better for larger enterprises\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, there is no significant difference between using \"Inc.\" (short for \"Incorporated\") or \"Corp.\" (short for \"Corporation\") as a suffix for a business name in Oregon. These terms are essentially different grammatical variations of the same concept and do not confer any special legal or practical advantages over one another. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the level of liability protection is not determined by the choice between \"Inc.\" and \"Corp.\"\n\nAnswer B is false because there is no tax or reporting advantage to using \"Corp.\" over \"Inc.\" Both are treated the same way for tax purposes.\n\nAnswer D is a misconception. The size of the business does not dictate whether \"Inc.\" or \"Corp.\" should be used. Either can be used for businesses of any size.\n\nThe key point is that both \"Inc.\" and \"Corp.\" clearly identify the business as a corporation, which is important for legal and tax purposes, particularly in distinguishing it from a limited liability company (LLC)."

I generally don't do this for money, it is more because I enjoy doing it and helping out friends and acquaintances I know through local small business organizations and meetups, and I hate to see these scammy SEO optimization companies charging what I feel are exorbitant fees so I have offered to help a number of small businesses with their website and email hosting for what I feel is fair and not exploitative. Generally I prefer barter\\-in\\-kind for my services (Eg. Free or discounted remodeling, lawn service, tax services, etc...) and my accountant makes sure I am square with the IRS.\n\nI am working on a website for a customer that has a number of products that he wishes to sell on his website, and as I usually do websites through customized Wordpress templates, I have the option to install a commerce plugin that will handle the payment processing side of things. I am fully qualified and comfortable to do this work, however I have only historically ever done integration with payment processors in the role of an employee for another organization, and as such I never had to worry much about the potential damage from cyber crime.\n\nMy concern is that if I set this up for this client, and (knock on wood) the client or his customers became negatively impacted by a security exploit in the plugin or payment processor, then I would be potentially drawn into litigation.\n\nAs I do not have an LLC and this is more of a hobby job for me, I could stand to fall into personal bankruptcy in the worst case scenario no? Further I looked into cyber crime insurance a few years back for an unrelated matter and the quote I had seen given to a different client was far beyond the realm of affordability for either myself or my clients.\n\nWhat steps short of establishing an LLC can I take to protect myself here? Is there any kind of legal document or agreement that I could sign with my client that would absolve me of any legal responsibility for the use of the websites online store such that I am at least somewhat protected?\n\nIf not then I am thinking I will not be comfortable doing an online store for this client.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, the use of an LLC to do such work would not protect you from liability for negligence or intentional misconduct.\n\nTo do such work in reasonable security, you would need to inform your employer, in writing, making it plain that for the security of the e\\-commerce transactions, you would be depending on the security of the third\\-party tech. You would also make the extent of your experience in using such technology clear. Sources on the security of the plugin could also be referenced.\n\nIt might well be wise to have an actual written contract, that spells out what you would, and would not, be responsible;e for, in dong this website. In particular such a contract could make it clear that you will be relying on third\\-party software (which would be named) for the security of the \"store\" part of the site, and that you could not be responsible for the security of that plugin.\n\nThere are various reliable published and online sources for drafts for website development contracts. There should be no need to create one from scratch. Indeed it is better not to try to write such an agreement from nothing. But you could (and might be wise to) have a lawyer review the final draft of any such agreement. That should not be overly expensive.\n\nSuch a contract woulds offer much better protection than the use of an LLC. If you have an LLC it could be used as well, but the protection that gives is from debt liability, not from liability for professional negligence. It also helps one document business income and expanses if used consistantly, and can be helpful for tax purposes.",

Is anything known, or can we make any reasonable inferences, about why New York State hasn't charged him for battery?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: E. Jean Carroll first sued Donald Trump in 2019 for defamation in connection with his statements in 2019 denying a prior assault upon her in the 1990s in response to her 2019 memoire asserted that he had done so in the 1990s. The statute of limitations in that case ran from the time that Trump made the statement. The first lawsuit is still pending because of issues over whether Presidential immunity from lawsuits applies to it:\n\n> The Justice Department has argued Trump was acting as the president\n> while responding to Carroll\u2019s allegations and said the United States,\n> rather than Trump himself, should be the defendant. If the courts\n> agree, it would probably torpedo Carroll\u2019s claim because the\n> government cannot be sued for defamation.\n> \n> \n> The issue remains unresolved. The D.C. Court of Appeals heard\n> arguments on the case but essentially punted on the issue this month,\n> sending it to another court.\n\nThe criminal statute of limitations on this underlying conduct in the 1990s expired long before the lawsuit was filed. She did not press criminal charges at the time.\n\n> Last year \\[i.e in 2022], Carroll filed a second lawsuit, this one\n> accusing Trump of battery and defaming her again after he left office.\n> That lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\n> District of New York, is the one scheduled to go to trial on Tuesday\n> \\[i.e. last week]. The suit was filed in November 2022 as a New York\n> law known as the [Adult Survivors Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Survivors_Act) took effect. That law\n> allowed sexual assault victims to sue years later, which proponents\n> said was necessary because it can take considerable time for survivors\n> to feel ready to speak out.\n\nAll of the factual statements in this answer, including all quotes material, are from an April 24, 2023 article in the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/04/24/e-jean-carroll-trump-rape-trial/?itid=ap_markberman).\n\nAs a practical matter, a final resolution of the second lawsuit will resolve essentially all issues in the first lawsuit except Presidential immunity (and arguably a slight amount of damages), under the doctrine of collateral estoppel (a.k.a. issue preclusion). A defense verdict from the jury in the pending case would render the Presidential immunity issue in the first case moot.\n\nSources including [this one](https://today.westlaw.com/Document/I3b97cf141ce011ed9f24ec7b211d8087/View/FullText.html?transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)&firstPage=true) have concluded that the Adult Survivors Act (ASA) is likely to withstand a constitutional challenge. This is because a similar law passed on 2019, the Child Victims Act (CVA), was upheld as constitutional. The ruling in the CVA cases, in turn, relied heavily on a 9\\-11 related statute of limitations revival act which was upheld by New York State's highest court in 2017:\n\n> Shortly after the passage of the CVA, lawsuits were filed with the\n> state and federal courts of New York arguing that the CVA was\n> unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause.

Given the threat of COVID\\-19, and how each infection increases the risk of future infections exponentially, the misinformation being spread could realistically put lives at risk.\n\nNow I'm not suggesting anyone be punished for COVID\\-19 misinformation specifically, for many reasons. However, it got me wondering at a more general level if there are forces in place to handle more direct and blatant spread of dangerous misinformation via the news.\n\nIt does make me wonder what laws exist for intentional spread of misinformation. Slander and Libel laws only apply to misinformation about an individual, they wouldn't apply to other forms of misinformation. The FDA has stepped in to stop false claims about drugs and medication, but again that is only one specific type of misinformation.\n\nWhat about more general misinformation? If some news agency decides as an April fools joke to report that the government is encouraging all kids to play on highways today, or some other grossly negligent and potentially dangerous fact, and there is reasonable evidence to suggest it was done intentionally what laws may be used to penalize such a dangerous spread of misinformation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While the other two sort out their disagreement, here's one way the broadcast of misinformation is regulated which is not subject to dispute.\n\nThere is a federal agency called the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/about/overview) regulates interstate and international communications over TV, radio, satellite, cable, etc., throughout the US and its territories. \n\nAmong its duties and powers, it [prohibits](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/broadcasting-false-information) the broadcast of false info regarding a crime or catastrophe if the broadcaster \"knows the information is false and will cause substantial 'public harm' if aired.\" FCC rules indicate that the harm \"must begin immediately and cause direct and actual damage to property or the health or safety of the general public; or divert law enforcement or public health and safety authorities from their duties.\" \n\nAdditionally, while law prohibits the FCC from engaging in censorship or otherwise infringing on First Amendment rights of the press, it is nonetheless illegal for \"broadcasters to intentionally distort the news, and the FCC may act on complaints if there is documented evidence of such behavior from persons with direct personal knowledge.\" \n\nThe FCC may not interfere with how a broadcaster chooses to select or present news or commentary and its authority to respond to complaints regarding the above is [narrow in scope](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/complaints-about-broadcast-journalism). Generally, it cannot intervene without testimony from a person with \"direct personal knowledge of an intentional falsification of the news.\" \n\nThe FCC's authority for this may be found at [47 CFR \u00a7 73\\.1217](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/73.1217), which states: \n\n> \u00a7 73\\.1217 Broadcast hoaxes. \n>  No licensee or permittee of any broadcast\n>  station shall broadcast false information concerning a crime or a\n>  catastrophe if:\n> \n> \n> (a) The licensee knows this information is false;\n> \n> \n> (b) It is forseeable that broadcast of the information will cause\n>  substantial public harm, and\n> \n> \n> (c) Broadcast of the information does in fact directly cause\n>  substantial public harm.\n> \n> \n> Any programming accompanied by a disclaimer will be presumed not to\n>  pose foreseeable harm if the disclaimer clearly characterizes the\n>  program as a fiction and is presented in a way that is reasonable\n>  under the circumstances.\n\nImportant context is included in the accompanying note, which states: \n\n> For purposes of this rule, \u201cpublic harm\u201d must begin immediately, and\n>  cause direct and actual damage to property or to the health or safety\n>  of the general public, or diversion of law enforcement or other public\n>  health and safety authorities from their duties. The public harm will\n>  be deemed foreseeable if the licensee could expect with a significant\n>  degree of certainty that public harm would occur. A \u201ccrime\u201d is any act\n>  or omission that makes the offender subject to criminal punishment by\n>  law. A \u201ccatastrophe\u201d is a disaster or imminent disaster involving\n>  violent or sudden event affecting the public.\n\n**EDIT: Addition:**\n\nMore helpful context may come from Sec. 4 of this law review article and you may find the article in general, about criminalizing false speech on social media, interesting: [https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v31/31HarvJLTech65\\.pdf](https://jolt.law.harvard.edu/assets/articlePDFs/v31/31HarvJLTech65.pdf)",

According to the New Jersey Administrative Code, alcohol possession and consumption are prohibited in areas under the jurisdiction of the State Park Service, unless specifically approved by the Director of the Division of Parks and Forestry or the Assistant Director for the State Park Service. However, there is no statewide law governing non-state parks such as city and county parks. These local entities can create their own regulations regarding alcohol consumption in their parks.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the prohibition only applies to state parks, not all public parks in New Jersey. Option B is incorrect because it reverses the actual situation; state law prohibits alcohol in state parks by default, not allows it. Option D is partially correct about the approval process for state parks but incorrectly implies this applies to all parks in New Jersey."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: First a little background, this issue doesn't affect me personally (I'm not a practitioner of alternative medicine or being treated by one).\n\nI read a slate article about a woman who was forgoing conventional medical treatment for breast cancer (which was treatable) In favour of some kind of vegetable based diet and imagining tying ribbons around various internal organs. It seems obvious to a reasonable person that continuing down this treatment path will inevitably lead to the patient's death.\n\nMy question is this, once the patient dies, what is the criminal liability of the alternative medicine practitioner for treating the patient with a treatment that a reasonable person could clearly see would be ineffective?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Practicing medicine without a license or [beyond the scope of your license](http://www.bellinghamherald.com/news/local/article100755692.html) (e.g. engaging in medical activities that your license does not authorize you to engage in, even though you have license to engage in some medical activities) is a [criminal offense](https://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/pontius.html) (e.g. Unlawful Conduct Of Practicing Medicine Without a License, Utah Code Ann. \u00a758\\-1\\-501(1\\)(a) and 58\\-67\\-501\\) in most jurisdictions and is [not protected by the privileges](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/redmond-naturopath-accused-of-taking-indecent-liberties-with-female-patients/) afforded to people practicing medically within the scope of their license (e.g. an exemption from laws criminalizing contact with intimate parts when done for medical purposes). Of course, [fraudulently claiming to have licensure](http://abc3340.com/news/local/claimed-naturopathic-hoover-doctor-indicted-for-defrauding-cancer-patients) is also a crime over and above practicing without a license.\n\n[Administering non\\-FDA approved medicines to cancer patients](http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2016/07/seen-worlds-naturopathic-one-terrifying.html), for example, is a federal crime, even if this is done with full disclosure and good intentions. The approval process is described [here](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/) by the Food and Drug Administration under the [Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Food,_Drug,_and_Cosmetic_Act). (Similarly, a [conviction](https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/port-angeles-naturopath-sentenced-prison-distributing-hormone-drug-weight-loss) was obtained in another case for distributing a hormonal weight\\-loss treatment without a license.)\n\nFor example, in 2006, a naturopath in Wheat Ridge, Colorado was [convicted](http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/naturopath-pleads-guilty-to-negligent-homicide) of \"theft, perjury, criminally negligent homicide, illegal practice of medicine and third\\-degree assault\" for providing alternative holistic treatment to someone resulting in their death.\n\n[Criminal negligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_negligence) generally involves conduct sometimes also called \"gross negligence\" that is not just careless but is almost reckless given the serious potential harm that could foreseeable result (and in all cases that are prosecuted, actually did result) from the course of conduct taken. \n\nFor example, while ordinary medical mistakes by a medical doctor such as confusing two drugs with similar names or putting the decimal point in a prescription dosage, causing harm to a patient, would not ordinarily result in criminal liability, coming into an operating room while too drunk to drive and without reviewing which limb of a patient needs to be amputated despite a clear indication in marker on the leg of a patient showing that fact, might constitute criminal negligence on the part of a medical doctor. Here, if the need for and possible benefits of conventional treatment for breast cancer with particularly clear, prescribing alternative diet based treatment and mental exercises while discouraging conventional medical treatment, might very well constitute criminal negligence on the part of the holistic practitioner.\n\nSimilarly, a naturopath was [criminally charged](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/09/sydney-naturopath-arrested-after-baby-comes-close-to-death-on-treatment-plan) in Australia with \"reckless grievous bodily harm and failure to provide for a child causing danger of death\" for urging parents to discontinue medical treatments for a child in favor of a raw food diet, causing serious harm to that child almost causing the child's death. The naturopath admitted that she endangered the child with her medical advice and was [ultimately convicted in that case](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/naturopath-marilyn-bodnar-admits-raw-food-diet-advice-endangered-babys-life-20170825-gy42fk.html).\n\nLiability would be fact specific. Does the person have a license of some kind? Are they within the scope of their license? Do they falsely convey the impression that they are licensed medical practitioners? Did their actions constitute the practice of medicine?\n\nBut, often, in the fact pattern you describe, particularly if it is not \"faith healing\" protected by the freedom of religion, this would be a crime.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that a [self\\-help remedy of murdering the holistic practitioner](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/03/10/widower-slain-naturopath-said-chemotherapy-is-for-losers/) after the fact is legal.\n\nCivil liability for professional negligence and failing to meet the applicable standard of care for a person engaging in the kind of treatment conduct described is also possible. In other words, one can sue a naturopath of money damages for malpractice, just as one could sue a doctor for malpractice. As noted [here](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/cam-and-the-law-part-3-malpractice/):\n\n> Alternative medicine providers can, of course, be guilty of\n>  malpractice if they perform their interventions below the commonly\n>  accepted standards of their own communities. They may also have\n>  liabilities for injuries caused by discouraging patients from seeking\n>  conventional care and, in some jurisdictions, for not recognizing when\n>  a patient\u2019s condition is beyond the scope of their form of treatment\n>  and subsequently referring the patient for treatment by a medical\n>  doctor.\n\nThe fact scenario in the Slate article would appear to implicate grounds for civil as well as potentially criminal liability.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A naturopath, licensed only to provide dietary advice, treats a patient with stage 2 breast cancer. The naturopath recommends a strict vegetable diet and visualization exercises, explicitly discouraging the patient from pursuing conventional medical treatment. The patient follows this advice for 18 months, during which time her cancer progresses to stage 4. The patient dies 6 months later. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the naturopath's potential criminal liability?\n\nA) The naturopath cannot be held criminally liable as they were operating within the scope of their dietary advice license.\n\nB) The naturopath can only be charged with practicing medicine without a license, but not for the patient's death.\n\nC) The naturopath could potentially face charges of criminal negligence or manslaughter due to recklessly endangering the patient's life.\n\nD) The naturopath is protected from criminal charges under freedom of religion laws if they claim their treatments were faith-based.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The naturopath could potentially face charges of criminal negligence or manslaughter. This is because:\n\n1. The naturopath was practicing beyond the scope of their license by treating cancer, which is not within the realm of dietary advice.\n2. They actively discouraged conventional medical treatment for a serious condition, which a reasonable person would recognize as potentially life-threatening.\n3. Their actions showed a reckless disregard for the patient's life, which meets the standard for criminal negligence in many jurisdictions.\n4. There are precedents of alternative medicine practitioners being charged with criminal offenses in similar cases, such as the naturopath in Colorado convicted of criminally negligent homicide.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the naturopath clearly exceeded their license scope. Answer B is insufficient, as the charges could extend beyond just practicing without a license. Answer D is incorrect because the scenario doesn't mention any religious basis for the treatment, and even if it did, such protections typically don't extend to cases of serious bodily harm or death."

Has a law been broken?\n\n---\n\nI live in one of those old buildings that has bad water pressure and sometimes the toilet flush doesn't work. Like it brings the poop back up. And if it's used too often it takes 5 minutes to load etc.\n\nLandlord claims it can't be fixed (probably just being cheap).\n\nAnyway, I live with this guy who is really sensitive about the toilet being flushed. And he has complained to me multiple times. I don't always have time to stand there five minutes, so to be fair, a couple times I have been in a hurry and flushed it, hoping for the best. \nBut I regularily find his remains in the toilet too and I just flush it, like a normal person does. \n\nSo yesterday I come home and I find a turd on my bed. He claims its there for me to learn a lesson. I think it's sick. I don't know if he took a shit on my bed or fished it out of the bowl, either way that is F\\*\\*ed up and I don't want to live with him anymore.\n\nI told him he has to move out. He insists I have to move out.\n\nWho is in the right here? I feel like this would be classed as some sort of niche crime. There must be some legal protection against people pooping in your bed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You should probably call the cops as this sounds like it could be assault, which covers a number of actions that would inflict or threaten bodily harm (typically if paired with Battery, then \"Battery\" is the infliction and Assault is the threat of action). Assault can be considered in cases such as spitting upon someone or unwanted exposure to bodily fluids... while what you described is neither of these things, I would say any judge and cop would be well within the spirit of the definition of \"unwanted exposure\" portion of some laws, though it's highly jurisdiction specific (and depending on where, it might be a case law since it's not something that happens every day).\n\nIf you have any evidence that it happened, be prepared to turn it over to the cops as well (I really hope you took pictures of this just for evidence documentation. If not, it's not all lost. Did you text him when you had your justified WTF? outrage at him? That works too. I have more ideas, but as I said, jurisdiction is important.).\n\nI would also look into filing for a restraining order in either case as the crime is probably not gonna keep him away for long. Again, you are accusing, so you need to show some evidence.\n\nYou should also notify your landlord in a way that will not alert him right away. Your landlord is ultimately going to have to deal with eviction stuff, not you. I can imagine that in the lease, there's some wording about **Health and Safety** as well as property damage that can be invoked by the Landlord.\n\nAfter you contact the landlord, take anything of value you own and leave for some temporary place you can crash. If you have family or friends in the nearby area, ask if you can crash with them. Otherwise check into a hotel for a few days if you can afford it. Speaking from personal experience, I've done the \"my roommate is in trouble with the law and I informed the Landlord\" and he did not take the eviction process well (he trashed his own bedroom while I was out and when I finally returned to get my other things, I discovered he had broken into my room and trashed mine as well and then hid the damage to make it look like I did it. The Landlord had enough sense to not believe the evidence).",

The answer suggests that this action could be considered assault due to unwanted exposure to bodily fluids, which is a criminal offense. This provides an official record of the incident and may lead to immediate action to ensure the victim's safety. Additionally, a police report can serve as evidence for any subsequent legal actions, such as obtaining a restraining order or supporting the landlord's decision to evict the offending roommate.

I handed in the paper personally, because I still worked out there. I made sure to get some sort of confirmation in order to prove afterwards that the termination was handed in. I handed it in to one of the employees, which signed that he had received it and then copied it (one copy for me, one copy for the gym/boss). In the termination I wrote, that the gym owner (who is obviously the contract holder) should send me another confirmation of receiving the termination and telling me the actual termination date of the contract.\n\nSince then, I have not received any mail from the owner regarding this additional confirmation paper. I asked him about 1 week after turning in the termination if he got it, he said he got it. Another 2 weeks later I asked if he already sent the confirmation, he said he'll do it at the end of the month (for whatever reason). I wasn't really worried about that because we never had any disagreements or something. I just quit the membership because I'm moving soon. Today I asked again, and he said something along the lines \"oh, you did not get it? I'll send you one the next day\".\n\nSince he already said he'd send the confirmation weeks ago, without him actually doing so, I don't really trust him this time either. So my question now is: **Is the termination of the contract valid without me receiving (or him sending) the confirmation?** Or in other words maybe: Is the signiture of the employee under the termination enough for me to be sure I don't have to pay the next membership period (which is 6 months, starting in march).\n\nAll this takes place in Germany, may be relevent to the case because of local laws and stuff I guess.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you have done all that is required to terminate the contract then the fact they have not done what they are required to do is irrelevant \\- the contract has been validly terminated.\n\nHowever, are you sure you that hand delivery of a termination notice meets the requirements of the contract?

According to the information provided, if the member has fulfilled all the requirements specified in the contract for termination, the contract is likely terminated validly, even if the gym owner fails to send a confirmation.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Victoria, Australia, a partnership of four members (Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David) operates a construction company. On Monday, Bob negligently installs faulty wiring in a client's home. On Tuesday, Charlie leaves the partnership and is replaced by Eve. On Wednesday, the faulty wiring causes a fire in the client's home. On Thursday, the client decides to sue. Who can be held liable for the damages?\n\nA) Only Bob, as he directly caused the negligence\nB) Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David, as they were partners when the negligence occurred\nC) Alice, Bob, David, and Eve, as they are the current partners\nD) Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, and Eve, as they were all involved in the partnership at some point during the events\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In this case, the negligent act (faulty wiring installation) occurred on Monday when Alice, Bob, Charlie, and David were partners. Partners are jointly and severally liable for acts and omissions of each partner committed while they are partners. Even though Charlie left the partnership on Tuesday and the damages occurred on Wednesday, he was still a partner when the negligent act took place. Eve, who joined on Tuesday, cannot be held liable for negligence that occurred before she became a partner. The fact that the damages manifested later doesn't change the liability of the partners at the time of the negligent act."

[According to the New Zealand Foreign Affairs \\& Trade website](https://www.mfat.govt.nz/en/countries-and-regions/pacific/cook-islands/), our relationship is described as follows:\n\n> The Cook Islands became a New Zealand colony in 1901 but after a push\n>  for self\\-determination in the 1960s it became self\\-governing in \u2018free\n>  association\u2019 with New Zealand in 1965\\.

According to the New Zealand Foreign Affairs & Trade website, Cook Islanders are New Zealand citizens who are free to live and work in New Zealand. This is due to the \"free association\" agreement established in 1965. The Citizenship Act 1977 includes the Cook Islands in its definition of New Zealand, and the Cook Islands Constitution Act 1964 does not affect this citizenship status. Therefore, Cook Islanders automatically have New Zealand citizenship and full rights to live and work in New Zealand without needing to apply or meet additional criteria."

Unfortunately, almost anything I cook triggers a false alarm.(Even turning on the oven with nothing inside will set it off.)\n\nI think it may be possible to solve this problem responsibly by replacing the smoke detector with a photoelectric detector, but if I do so, am I legally \"tampering\" with the detector? I've technically removed their smoke detector, but I've preserved (perhaps even improved) the general fire safety of the apartment.\n\nWhat are the legal consequences for doing this in the state of Georgia?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here's [a bit of Georgia law](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2020/title-25/chapter-2/section-25-2-40/) that is relevant. By law, your apartment\n\n> shall have installed an approved battery operated smoke detector which\n> shall be maintained in good working order unless any such building is\n> otherwise required to have a smoke detector system pursuant to Code\n> Section 25\\-2\\-13\\.\n\nAlso, \"Detectors shall be listed and meet the installation requirements of NFPA 72\".

If we assume (as is reasonable to do) that you install an approved device, then there is no code violation by picking your own device, does not change liability, and can have no effect on insurance rate / cancellation. OTOH, it is conceivable that the lease is written to prohibit any monkeying around with the smoke detector.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Georgia, a tenant replaces an ionization smoke detector with a photoelectric smoke detector in their rented apartment due to frequent false alarms from cooking. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The tenant is in clear violation of Georgia law and could face immediate eviction.\n\nB) The tenant is legally responsible for maintaining the smoke detector, but replacing it with an approved device does not necessarily constitute a violation.\n\nC) The landlord is solely responsible for smoke detectors, so the tenant has no legal right to replace it.\n\nD) Changing the smoke detector type automatically voids the tenant's insurance policy.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Georgia law, tenants are responsible for maintaining smoke detectors in good working order. While the law requires an \"approved\" smoke detector, it doesn't specify the type. If the new photoelectric detector meets NFPA 72 standards, replacing it doesn't necessarily violate the law. The tenant's action could be considered maintenance if the new detector is approved and improves safety. However, it's important to note that the lease agreement might have specific clauses about modifying apartment fixtures, which could affect the legality of the replacement. The law also states that smoke detector issues don't affect liability or insurance rates, ruling out options A and D. Option C is incorrect because the law places some responsibility on the occupant, not just the landlord."

Once it is in your hands, its prior history is completely irrelevant. \n\nThe vulnerability to theft is one reason that large transactions are rarely conducted in cash, and are instead conducted either via wire transfer or via a check or money order (giro in Europe) of some sort payable to a particular person.\n\nIf the bank was somehow negligent in a manner that you could prove, and you could prove that this caused your harm, you might be able to sue the bank on a negligence theory, but generally a robbery would be an intervening cause of your loss that would absolve the bank of ordinary negligence.\n\nA better fact pattern for negligence claim would be something like this: the bank where you had a safe deposit box left the safe door open and the keys to your box in an easily to see cork board by its door, meanwhile the employees of the bank all left on their lunch break at the same time and forgot to lock the bank's front door when they left, and as a result, someone stole something out of your safe deposit box. \n\nUsually, the bank would cooperate in helping you to prove your loss with a withdrawal slip and other corroborating evidence, which would allow you to take a casualty loss deduction and/or make a claim for theft against your own insurance policy (which will often cover a very modest amount of theft of cash).

Once John withdrew the cash, it became his property and the bank is not responsible for its subsequent theft. Banks are generally not liable for robberies unless there's provable negligence, which is not indicated in this scenario. However, banks typically cooperate in documenting such losses to help customers with insurance claims or tax deductions for theft losses. Options A and D are incorrect because banks are not obligated to refund money stolen after withdrawal.

Under which of the following circumstances does the warship NOT have the right to board the vessel according to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea?\n\nA) The vessel is suspected of engaging in piracy\nB) The vessel is believed to be transporting illegal drugs\nC) The vessel is suspected of engaging in the slave trade\nD) The vessel is thought to be broadcasting unauthorized radio signals\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Article 110 of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a warship is justified in boarding a foreign ship on the high seas only under specific circumstances. These include suspicion of piracy (option A), engagement in the slave trade (option C), and unauthorized broadcasting (option D). Transporting illegal drugs is not listed as one of the reasons that justify boarding. The other circumstances allowing boarding are if the ship is without nationality or if it's suspected of flying a false flag. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as drug trafficking alone does not give the warship the right to board the vessel under this convention."

Should you study from the point of view of a lawyer or an individual citizen? What if laws change? What is most applicable to real life?\n\nMost importantly: where can you find all this information? Are there textbooks, or do you have to comb through the internet yourself, or is there a website where all this information is organized?\n\nThank you T\\_T\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> If you want to study the basics of law, where should you start?\n\nDon't try memorizing individual laws. That would be a waste of energy, in part because \\-\\-as you rightly point out\\-\\- laws change. There are many introductory books. [Law 101, by Jay M. Feinman](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0190866322), is an excellent starting point.\n\nThe next step \\-\\-broadly speaking\\-\\- consists of reading court decisions (aka court opinions). Opinions released by upper (aka reviewing) courts are available online for free. If you are interested in jurisdictions in the US, [Leagle.com](http://www.leagle.com/leaglesearch) is one of many very good resources; EU cases are available [here](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/recherche.jsf?oqp=&for=&mat=or&lgrec=en&jge=&td=%3BALL&jur=C%2CT%2CF&dates=&pcs=Oor&lg=&parties=&pro=&nat=or&cit=none%252CC%252CCJ%252CR%252C2008E%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252C%252Ctrue%252Cfalse%252Cfalse&language=en&avg=); and so forth.\n\nAcquainting yourself with court opinions is quite beneficial. First, court opinions \\[collaterally] teach how to formulate one's legal positions. Rather than merely being formulaic and a copycat, a litigant is to convey that his legal position is more consistent (compared to the adversary) with the laws and underlying doctrines. His points are easier to get across by adapting his presentation thereof to how courts are used to handle the legal principles involved.\n\nSecond, court opinions identify the statutes that are relevant to the type of disputes that arise between parties. This is indicative of importance that a statute or procedural rule entails in relation to other laws.\n\nThird, court opinions reflect how statutes, rules, and doctrines are interpreted. Oftentimes the way how legislation is worded leads \"laypeople\" to have misconceptions on the interpretation of laws and rules, when in reality these are construed usually in a much narrower way.\n\nLaw journals are a good source once you have gained some background in law and are interested in a sort of monograph about a topic that is new to you. But, as explained above, court opinions also serve that purpose (perhaps less *scholarly*).\n\nHaving a legal dictionary is always a good idea. Courts in the US oftentimes quote definitions from [Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) for crucial terms which statutory law does not define.\n\n> What is most applicable to real life?\n\nWithout knowing whether you are interested in a particular field, it is safe to say that contract law is the most applicable.\n\nEntering contracts is part of our everyday life even if laypeople don't notice it when they purchase goods \\& services, reach an agreement, or engage in a course of conduct which reasonably fosters expectations. And good news is that the principles of contract law are largely similar among modern jurisdictions, including the America (the continent, not just the USA), many member states of the EU, and Asian countries.\n\nThe [Restatement (Second) of Contracts](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/restatement-second-contracts.html) is a very useful formulation of contract law. Courts in the US very often cite the *Restatement* for premising their decisions on contract disputes. In countries with a *civil law* system, the principles of contract law are usually formulated in one or multiple sections of the \\[countries'] Civil Code.\n\nProcedural law (aka rules of criminal or civil procedure) is also highly applicable: Large portions thereof apply to all disputes which are brought to court. To a great extent these rules are very similar across the jurisdictions of one same country, but the litigant ought too ensure his compliance with the rules lest he loses the case for a technicality. Lastly, procedural law can be remarkably boring unless the person anticipates he will be involved in litigation.",

But I am confused with certain measures taken thus far by the government.\n\nThere is currently a temporary shutdown of vast sectors of the economy now and workers affected are not receiving any income.\n\nTo me, logic would dictate that here should also be a temporary cessation of payments for rental properties (for small businesses as well as individuals) and, to be fair, a temporary cessation of payments for loans for owners of those properties. In turn, banks would be given temporary cessation payments for interest to its customers since the banks would not receive any payments on loans including payments on mortgages from homeowners. That would essentially close the loop on money flow which again would be temporary and the impact to the greater economy would be limited.\n\nIf undue burden is placed on any one of these points in the cycle, and right now, workers and small businesses are taking that brunt, then there could be long\\-standing damage to the economy from bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc.\n\nThe Fed is already addressing the banking side of things by keeping rates close to 0\\.\n\nDoes the government have the authority to push for a standstill in mortgage/interest/rent payments? \nI feel this temporary measure would alleviate economic hardship and prevent long\\-term damage to the economy.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the applicable state laws granting emergency powers. The [most recent decree in Washington State](https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/proclamations/20-49%20-%20COVID-19%20Garnishment.pdf) suspends garnishments and post\\-judgment interest. The governor was given broad powers by the legislature ([RCW 43\\.06\\.220](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.06.220)) to suspend laws in case of an emergency. If a state has no such powers (every state does) or if a particular action is not within the scope of the governor's emergency powers, then no. Otherwise yes. The governor of Washington has the emergency power to limit assembly, anything to do with flammables, sale of anything related to preservation of life, health and peace, and \"other activities as he or she reasonably believes should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace\". He also can suspend government enforcement actions, such as garnishment and post\\-judgment interest (and court proceedings resulting in judgments), an suspects statutory / regulatory restrictions on actions (could suspend the sales tax). He cannot, however, single\\-handedly write new laws. There is no existing provision that would allow cancellation of interest obligations, although the legislature has the power to restrict interest in various ways (such as the usury statutes). So without a new power being passed by the legislature, the answer is Washington is \"no\".",

These powers allow the governor to suspend certain laws and government enforcement actions during an emergency. Specifically, the documentation mentions that the governor has recently used these powers to suspend garnishments and post-judgment interest.\n\nOption A is incorrect because canceling mortgage payments would be creating a new law, which is beyond the scope of the governor's emergency powers.\n\nOption B is correct as it falls within the governor's authority to suspend government enforcement actions and certain statutory provisions during an emergency.\n\nOption C is incorrect because eliminating rental payments would be creating a new law and interfering with private contracts, which exceeds the governor's emergency powers.\n\nOption D is incorrect as forgiving bank loans would be creating a new law and interfering with private financial agreements, which is not within the governor's emergency authority.\n\nThe key is that the governor can suspend certain existing laws and enforcement actions, but cannot create new laws or interfere with private contracts without legislative action."

This approach balances the need for diverse and targeted focus groups with anti-discrimination principles.

The owner sells finished products exclusively to the very high end of the professional market (if you have to ask, you can't afford it), and hobbyists have built their own designs using that concept for their own living rooms, claiming that the owner has given blanket permission to hobbyists for their own personal use.\n\nI've also seen someone with the owner's name on public hobby forums, who explains it in deep technical detail, and all of his posts are many years old now.\n\nSo:\n\n1. Taking a cue from the hobbyists, what if an engineer/carpenter team were to design, build, and install one specifically for a non\\-profit organization where they both volunteer already?  \n\n(the engineering and labor are donated, and the organization buys the materials)\n2. What if I were to design and build one myself to use in my own rig for profit?\n\nMy understanding of the purpose of patents is to prevent the loss of revenue caused by someone else undercutting the inventor, probably because the someone else doesn't have to make up the expense of inventing it.\nIn that framework, and given either of the situations above, it would certainly be a violation to sell it, because that customer might have bought it from the owner instead if there wasn't a cheaper option.\n\nBut if the available budget clearly does not allow purchasing from the owner, and thus the owner would not have had a sale anyway (we'd use a different design that is available more cheaply), is it okay to make one (or several) personally or in\\-house for personal or in\\-house use, with the caveat that it is illegal to sell until the patent runs out?\n\nOf course, we can't outsource the work because it would mean that *they* would be selling to *us* and thus violate the patent themselves. It seems to me that it must *all* be done in\\-house, to even have a chance. So does that chance exist?\n\n---\n\nNotes:\n\nIt might seem like several different questions, but it's really the same question several different ways.\n\nNor am I asking if it's okay to violate in a particular situation. I'm asking if the action in that situation IS a violation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The relevant section of US patent law was already posted in an answer on one of the questions you linked, but I'll repeat it:\n\n> 35 USC 271 (a): Except as otherwise provided in this title, whoever without authority **makes**, **uses**, offers to sell, or sells any patented invention, within the United States or imports into the United States any patented invention during the term of the patent therefor, infringes the patent.\n\nMerely making a patented invention is infringement; it isn't relevant whether you sell it. It is also infringement if you use it yourself, regardless of who made it or whether you paid them, or whether you would have otherwise bought it from the patent holder.\n\nThere are some special exceptions for things like certain kinds of pharmaceuticals, but I browsed the rest of 35 USC Chapter 28, and didn't see anything that would appear to be relevant in this case.",

Which of the following scenarios would NOT constitute patent infringement under U.S. patent law?\n\nA) The organization's volunteers design and build the loudspeaker themselves, using only donated materials and labor.\n\nB) The organization purchases the materials and has volunteers construct the loudspeaker for in-house use only.\n\nC) The organization obtains written permission from the patent holder to build and use the loudspeaker for non-commercial purposes.\n\nD) The organization builds the loudspeaker but only uses it occasionally for special events, not for regular operations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to 35 USC 271 (a), making or using a patented invention without authority constitutes patent infringement. Options A, B, and D all involve making and using the patented loudspeaker design without the patent holder's permission, which would be infringement regardless of the non-profit status, use of volunteers, or frequency of use. Only option C, where the organization obtains explicit permission from the patent holder, would not be considered infringement. This scenario provides the \"authority\" mentioned in the law, allowing the organization to legally make and use the patented design."

What are the potential pitfalls of an external company being given confidential CVs that include private information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, candidates must receive transparent information about this.\n\nYour exact obligations depend on whether your company is acting as a data controller, or as a data processor on behalf of another data controller.\n\nData controller is whoever determines the purposes and means of processing. If you're working on behalf of candidates, you're likely a controller. If you're working on behalf of companies, you may be a controller or processor depending on further context.\n\nA **controller** is responsible for the compliance of all processing activities for which they determine the purposes, even if the activities are outsourced to another company.\n\nAs the controller, you are responsible for fulfilling data subject rights, in particular the right to transparent information under [Art 13 UK GDPR](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/13). Per Art 13(1\\)(e), this information must include \u201cthe recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any\u201d. Data processors working on your behalf are recipients. Information is typically provided via a privacy notice.\n\nAs a data controller, you are also responsible for ensuring the security and compliance of your processing activities, by determining and implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures (TOMs). See Art 24 and 32\\. Such measures might include encryption, backup strategies, access controls, training and screening for staff, confidentiality agreements, and anything else. What is appropriate depends on the specific risks you face, the costs of implementing these measures, and on the state of the art. See also the [ICO guidance on security](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/security/).\n\nPer [Art 28(1\\) UK GDPR](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/28), if you engage an external company to process personal data on behalf of you, you will ensure that this external company provides \u201csufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures\u201d. Per Art 28(3\\), these sufficient guarantees must be based on an enforceable contract with the data processor (commonly called a Data Processing Agreement, DPA).\n\nA **processor** is primarily responsible for following the instructions of their controller, as laid down in the DPA pursuant to Art 28(3\\). Processors are not directly responsible for handling data subject rights, so they need not (and must not) provide their own privacy notice to data subjects. However, they must assist their controller as appropriate, for example by providing necessary information so that the controller can satisfy their responsibilities.\n\nWhen a processor wants to engage a sub\\-processor to further delegate processing activities, this must be done in accordance with Art 28\\. Specifically, the sub\\-processor must be bound by the same data protection obligations as you are, see Art 28(4\\). So you'd need to enter a processor\\-to\\-processor DPA. Also, you need to obtain prior authorization from your controller to engage that additional processor per Art 28(2\\).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A recruitment company uses an external service to format CVs received from job candidates. Which of the following statements is MOST accurate regarding the company's data protection responsibilities?\n\nA) The recruitment company only needs to inform candidates if the external service is located in a different country.\n\nB) As long as the external service signs a confidentiality agreement, no further action is required.\n\nC) The recruitment company must inform candidates about the use of the external service, ensure the service provides sufficient security guarantees, and have a Data Processing Agreement in place.\n\nD) The external service is responsible for providing a privacy notice to the candidates and handling any data subject rights requests.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. As a data controller, the recruitment company has several key responsibilities:\n\n1. They must inform candidates (data subjects) about the recipients of their personal data, which includes the external CV formatting service. This is part of the transparency requirements under Article 13 of the GDPR.\n\n2. They need to ensure that the external service (as a data processor) provides \"sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures\" as per Article 28(1) of the GDPR.\n\n3. They must have a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with the external service, as required by Article 28(3) of the GDPR.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the obligation to inform candidates exists regardless of the external service's location. \n\nAnswer B is insufficient; while a confidentiality agreement might be part of the measures, it alone does not fulfill all the GDPR requirements.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because as a processor, the external service is not directly responsible for providing privacy notices or handling data subject rights requests. These remain the responsibility of the recruitment company as the data controller."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: POSIX is a standard for operating system API, trademarked by IEEE. It ensures \"source\\-code\" level compatibility between operating systems and applications. It receives triple designation and its full text can be obtained from IEEE, ISO, and OpenGroup.\n\nFor logical reasons, many programming languages (Python for example) include modules whose name is \"posix\" (lower\\-case per identifier naming convention of respective languages). Even though these modules provide functionalities that are specified in the POSIX standard and claim obvious relationship to it, these modules and languages that provide them nonetheless don't infringe the POSIX trademark. So how is this possible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A caveat to begin with: It's not definitive whether this particular use is or is not infringing, given that the circumstances haven't been tested in court.\n\nThe usual scope for this kind of thing is called \"nominative use\" or \"nominative fair use\" in the U.S. context. The Python developers are offering a software module so that Python programs, when run on POSIX systems, can make use of capabilities of those systems covered by the POSIX standard. They have named their module `posix` so that Python programmers will have a fighting chance of guessing what it does. (The official documentation does say you ought to prefer use of `os` instead, but let's ignore that wrinkle.) Likewise, other parts of the standard library contain trademarks of other companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Oracle, in relation to Python code which interacts with those companies' products. These are all internal to the Python codebase and documentation, are not distributed separately, and \"POSIX\" is not part of the name of any product or service offered by the Python Software Foundation. Python is using that word \"nominatively\", describing some aspect of Python which relates to POSIX but is not POSIX.\n\nThe module authors might consider it sensible to use the word \"POSIX\" in its name and documentation, for the reason that compatibility with POSIX is essential to its functionality. But the rightsholders might also object to its appearance as a bare word (as opposed to `posixinterface` or something), because they want to preserve the meaning of \"POSIX\" as referring to their specific standard, the commercial value of which depends on restricting which operating systems can describe themselves as POSIX\\-compatible.\n\nIn the U.S., circuit courts have taken slightly different directions in trying to carve out whether trademark use like this is OK. In the Second Circuit, there is a recent case about nominative fair use of a certification mark, [Int'l Info. Sys. Sec. Certification Consortium v. Sec. Univ., LLC, 823 F.3d 153 (2d Cir. 2016\\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-2nd-circuit/1735354.html). The plaintiff, (ISC)2, offers the mark \"CISSP\" for security professionals who have passed certain examinations that they administer. The defendant, SU, offered training classes where the instructor was described as a \"Master CISSP\", to which the plaintiff objected because consumers could be misled into thinking that (ISC)2 endorsed the classes, and their trademark was being diluted because \"Master CISSP\" is not a term they use. On appeal, the upper court found that for assessing consumer confusion, courts must consider the eight \"*Polaroid* factors\" (named for [Polaroid Corp. v. Polarad Electronics Corp., 287 F.2d 492 (2d Cir. 1961\\)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Polaroid+Corporation+v.+Polarad+Electronics&hl=en&as_sdt=4,60,107,112,114,122,127,129&case=2293827617926067028&scilh=0) and rephrased in the judgement):\n\n> The eight factors are: (1\\) strength of the trademark; (2\\) similarity of the marks; (3\\) proximity of the products and their competitiveness with one another; (4\\) evidence that the senior user may \u201cbridge the gap\u201d by developing a product for sale in the market of the alleged infringer's product; (5\\) evidence of actual consumer confusion; (6\\) evidence that the imitative mark was adopted in bad faith; (7\\) respective quality of the products; and (8\\) sophistication of consumers in the relevant market.\n\nand also:\n\n> (1\\) whether the use of the plaintiff's mark is necessary to describe both the plaintiff's product or service and the defendant's product or service, that is, whether the product or service is not readily identifiable without use of the mark; (2\\) whether the defendant uses only so much of the plaintiff's mark as is necessary to identify the product or service; and (3\\) whether the defendant did anything that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the plaintiff holder, that is, whether the defendant's conduct or language reflects the true or accurate relationship between plaintiff's and defendant's products or services.\n\nOther circuit courts have adopted subtly different phrasings and this divergence has yet to be resolved by the Supreme Court or by Congress. Whether this standard is met in the example of this question is a matter for argument on the detailed facts.\n\nIn the EU, there is an explicit protection for this specific kind of use, by virtue of Article 14 of the latest trademark directive, [Directive 2015/2436 of 16 December 2015](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32015L2436):\n\n> 1. A trade mark shall not entitle the proprietor to prohibit a third party from using, in the course of trade:\n>   \n> ...  \n> \n> (c) the trade mark for the purpose of identifying or referring to goods or services as those of the proprietor of that trade mark, in particular, where the use of the trade mark is necessary to indicate the intended purpose of a product or service, in particular as accessories or spare parts.\n> 2. Paragraph 1 shall only apply where the use made by the third party is in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters.\n\nThe `posix` library could be regarded as an \"accessory\" to a POSIX\\-compatible operating system, in this sense, but is nonetheless within scope if the word \"POSIX\" is essential to identify what the module does. A key case in the CJEU, concerning a previous version of the Directive but with the same provision, was [BMW Nederland BV v Deenik \\[1999] C\\-63/97](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-63/97), where a garage owner advertised himself as able to repair BMW cars, with \"BMW\" being a trademark of the complainants since 1930\\. The court held that so long as Deenik didn't imply that he had any commercial relationship or endorsement by BMW, he could reasonably use the term \"BMW\" as part of describing his services.\n\nAs with the U.S. system, whether there is actual infringement would depend on the precise situation, and the relevant factors end up being pretty similar. That is partly because of conscious international efforts to harmonize trademark law.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company develops a module named \"posix\" for their programming language to interact with POSIX-compliant operating systems. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of using the term \"posix\" in this context?\n\nA) The use of \"posix\" is automatically protected under fair use and cannot be challenged by trademark holders.\n\nB) The software company must obtain explicit permission from IEEE to use the term \"posix\" in their module name.\n\nC) The use of \"posix\" may be permissible under nominative fair use, but its legality depends on specific factors and hasn't been definitively settled in court.\n\nD) Using \"posix\" in lowercase automatically differentiates it from the trademarked \"POSIX\" and is therefore always legal.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the use of \"posix\" in this context falls under the concept of nominative fair use, which allows for limited use of a trademark to refer to the trademarked product or service. However, the legality of such use is not automatically guaranteed and depends on various factors, including:\n\n1. Whether the use of the mark is necessary to identify the product or service.\n2. Whether only as much of the mark is used as is reasonably necessary.\n3. Whether the use suggests endorsement or sponsorship by the trademark holder.\n\nDifferent courts have slightly different standards for evaluating nominative fair use, and this specific scenario hasn't been definitively settled in court. Therefore, while the use may be permissible, it's not guaranteed to be legal in all circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fair use is not automatic and can be challenged. Option B is overly restrictive, as explicit permission is not always required for nominative use. Option D oversimplifies the issue, as merely using lowercase doesn't automatically make the use legal."

I assume that this is actually a US bank, and not a Nigerian bank that you access from the US. However, there is no regulation that requires a bank to be able to handle mobile deposits. If the problem is just that you can't make online deposits, that is legally allowed. For example, my own bank did not have the facility for processing mobile deposits until a few years ago, and even now I have to use a smart phone to make such deposits (it is a traditional bank). The only way in which your situation would be legally problematic would be if your contract with the bank promises that you can make mobile deposits. You could reasonably argue that an 8 month delay in solving the problem was unreasonable.\n\nPresumably there is some benefit to maintaining this bank, one which you'd like to keep rather than closing the account and moving on.

Sorry, but that's just the way it is.\n\nFirst of all, it depends on whether there actually was a contract. Under the law, a contract does not need to be something written down and signed. If you have this conversation with someone:\n\n\"Hey, can you do \\[this job] for me?\"\n\n\"Sure, it'll run you about \\[cost].\"\n\n\"Great.\"\n\nYou have a contract, which may well be legally binding and enforceable in court.\n\nEven if, for whatever reason, there was no contract\\-\\-for instance, the person you talked to didn't actually work for the company s/he said s/he did\\-\\-there are legal doctrines that could give you some rights. They have names, depending on the jurisdiction and the facts, like \"quantum meruit,\" \"unjust enrichment,\" and \"implied contract.\"\n\nThese doctrines all say, basically, the same thing: if you didn't have a contract for some reason, but you still gave someone something of value, reasonably expecting to be paid, then they have to pay you.\n\nWhether these doctrines apply is going to depend on the facts of the specific case. For example, you can't paint someone's house secretly in the middle of the night without being asked, then demand payment. But if you're a painting contractor, he asks you to paint it, and he sees you painting it every day for a week, at the end of the week he can't say, \"I never signed anything, so I don't have to pay you anything.\"\n\nIf this situation applies to you, your best bet is to discuss it with a lawyer licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.",

Indeed, such requirements [usually exclude church\\-related service](http://www.coyotecommunications.com/stuff/community.html).\n\nAlso, I don't see how this policy discriminates against your religion specifically. It seems on its face to apply to all religions equally.\n\nEven if \"Church\\-related\" is read broadly to include both service that benefits a church, and also service that is organized by a church, that doesn't preclude you from coming up with some other kind of service that is neither of these things.\n\nWhy would you be prevented from coming up with service that is neither of these things when other students do not? \n\nUnless you have also undertaken Holy Orders or something, in which case 100% of your time away from school would be devoted to your church, it is hard to see what the problem would be with this requirement for you as opposed to someone else. And, it would probably be improper for a public school to allow you to use religious activities to satisfy a graduation requirement \\- that would sound like an establishment clause violation.\n\n[Some of the relevant U.S. Supreme Court cases](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/10-important-supreme-court-cases-about-education) are:\n\n> *Engel v. Vitale* (1962\\) and *Abington School District v. Schempp* (1963\\)\n> \n> \n> This pair of cases shaped the modern understanding of how the\n>  Establishment Clause of the First Amendment constrains prayer in\n>  public schools. In Engel, the Court struck down a New York State rule\n>  that allowed public schools to hold a short, nondenominational prayer\n>  at the beginning of the school day. The Court decided that these\n>  prayers amounted to an \u201cofficial stamp of approval\u201d upon one\n>  particular kind of prayer and religious service, and said that, since\n>  teachers are agents of the federal government, the scheme violated the\n>  Establishment Clause.\n> \n> \n> The reasoning in Engel was also applied in Schempp, in which the Court\n>  struck down a Pennsylvania policy that required all students to read\n>  10 Bible verses and say the Lord\u2019s Prayer at the beginning of each\n>  day. While a student could get an exemption with a parent\u2019s note, the\n>  Warren Court decided that this still amounted to an unconstitutional\n>  government endorsement of a particular religious tradition.\n> \n> \n> *Lemon v. Kurtzman* (1971\\)\n> \n> \n> This case adjudicated a different sort of Establishment Clause\n>  challenge, where the controversy dealt with a statute providing\n>  financial support for teacher salaries and textbooks in parochial\n>  schools. The Burger Court unanimously decided that this financial aid\n>  scheme violated the Establishment Clause and delineated the governing\n>  precedent for Establishment Clause cases known as the Lemon test.\n>  Under Lemon, statutes (1\\) must have a secular legislative purpose; (2\\)\n>  must have primary effects that neither inhibit nor advance religion;\n>  and (3\\) cannot foster an \u201cexcessive government entanglement with\n>  religion.\u201d The Court held that this scheme violated the third prong of\n>  the Lemon test.\n\nAllowing Church\\-related community service projects could implicate both the second and third prongs of the *Lemon* test.\n\nIn a pertinent ruling, the Colorado Supreme Court [upheld a state constitutional requirement that no public funds be used to assist religious organizations](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/colorado-supreme-court-strikes-down-school-voucher-program/2015/06/29/a382768e-1e75-11e5-bf41-c23f5d3face1_story.html?utm_term=.d7c50d3e60ed), even if this prevented a facially neutral voucher program from treating religious and non\\-religious schools equally. The [opinion in this 2015 case](https://www.courts.state.co.us/userfiles/file/Court_Probation/Supreme_Court/Opinions/2013/13SC233.pdf) reviews some of the relevant law. \n\nA critical portion of the analysis is that aid to religious institutions must be limited to institutions that do not discriminate on the basis of religion and that supporting religious institutions at the K\\-12 level is more of a concern than doing so at the higher educational level. A Church, however, would (and should) discriminate on the basis of religion. \n\n**In General**\n\nThere has been consideration of whether community service requirements, in general, are constitutional. Generally, [courts have upheld the programs](http://www.wright-house.com/ac/papers97/Parr-ac1.html). See also [here](http://www.luc.edu/media/lucedu/law/centers/childlaw/childed/pdfs/2011studentpapers/byrne_reading_writing.pdf).\n\nIn particular, Rhode Island is in the 1st Circuit of the federal courts, which has expressly ruled that community service requirements are constitutional.\n\nA [1999 law review article in the Duke Law Journal](http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1149&context=lcp) considers the issue from several perspectives. So does a [1997 Loyola of Los Angeles Law Review](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2033&context=llr) article. A 1916 case called *Butler v. Perry* is [a particularly strong precedent in favor of the proposition that mandatory service is constitutional](http://volokh.com/posts/1216846359.shtml), despite arguments to the contrary under the 13th Amendment. The issue was discussed in the New York Times [in a 2003 article](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/23/nyregion/the-logic-of-mandatory-volunteerism.html?mcubz=1).\n\nBoth are concerned about the involuntary servitude aspect of the requirement, but given that school attendance may be mandatory, and a community service requirement is one, relatively unconstrained aspect of mandatory educational activity, this isn't a very easy case to make.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the constitutionality of this policy?\n\nA) The policy likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment Clause by singling out religious activities.\n\nB) The policy is unconstitutional because it infringes on students' freedom of religion under the First Amendment.\n\nC) The policy is likely constitutional and aligns with court precedents on separation of church and state in public schools.\n\nD) The policy is unconstitutional because mandatory community service violates the 13th Amendment's prohibition on involuntary servitude.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The policy is likely constitutional and aligns with court precedents on separation of church and state in public schools. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled against religious activities in public schools to avoid government endorsement of religion (Engel v. Vitale, Abington School District v. Schempp). The Lemon test further requires that government actions neither advance nor inhibit religion. By excluding church-related service, the school avoids potential Establishment Clause violations. Additionally, courts have generally upheld community service requirements in schools, with the 1st Circuit (which includes Rhode Island) expressly ruling them constitutional. The policy does not single out any specific religion and allows for numerous non-religious service opportunities, making it unlikely to be seen as discriminatory or violating students' religious freedom."

There is a state act called Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) that gives employees 60 days of work before their jobs are made redundant.\n\nHowever, I have found another job which needs me to start in 5 weeks.\nI spoke to my manager at his discretion it is okay if I just take the job (although HR has said I would have to wait two months). I would have to return at the end of the month to get my sign a letter to get my severance.\n\nSo I would be receiving a salary from the new company for 3 weeks of the month and also get a salary for the same 3 weeks from my existing company. The new company will not know I am doing this.\n\nCan I get in trouble legally or from the new company if I take the new job?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-102/pdf/STATUTE-102-Pg890.pdf) is a **Federal law** requiring certain types of employers (e.g. those with more than 100 employees) to notify workers at least sixty days in advance of mass layoffs and plant closures. These terms are defined in the law. Since Texas does not provide supplementary protections in these circumstances, workers are protected only by the WARN Act.\n\n***The WARN Act does not prevent you from finding new employment since it does not contain provisions for compensation of workers***. If you continue to work for your company during the period of notification then you will continue to be paid for your work. Additionally, and as mentioned by Tim, a new employer will likewise pay you for time worked.\n\nSince it seems that you may be interested in concurrently holding the two positions, you will likely have to consider the following outside the scope of this question:\n\n1. **Do you intend to collect a severance?** The issue of severance is not governed by the federal WARN ACT. Employer policies and state law may be worth looking at here. The U.S. Federal Government makes no requirement that employers pay severance. By agreeing/signing to the terms of severance, you make your severance compensation conditional upon the terms of that agreement. These conditions might include a prohibition against concurrent employment elsewhere or, more narrowly, that you must meet basic attendance requirements. However, you are always entitled to payment for work performed, and your employer is required to provide you with your last paycheck. **Your union is a great resource.** If you have one a union steward, talk to him or her about the language in your company's severance agreement; they may have already paid a lawyer to examine various employer documents.\n2. **Will you be seeking [unemployment benefits](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/collecting-unemployment-benefits-texas-32500.html)?** Generally, you must be unemployed and seeking work to qualify for these benefits. Forms for application for unemployment benefits have strict language, making an easy perjury case in the event someone attempts to both collect wages and unemployment benefits.\n3. **Will you work both jobs for the duration of the WARN Act notice?** It does not appear that there would be any federal restriction on doing so. Again, your employer may have policies that restrict you from being concurrently employed elsewhere, and ***violating company policy could be grounds for termination outside WARN Act protection***. But this might not be worrisome for you, since you will already have another job. Remember that the WARN Act exists in part because employers know that by notifying workers, they invite the workers to leave in droves. You may find that your employer is happy to work with your new work schedule, while they struggle to keep their facility staffed. It is unclear what, if any, ramifications there would be for a facility that had too sparse a work force to continue safe operations, and whether this would re\\-classify the employer under the WARN Act exceptions for a faltering company.\n\nConsider getting the advice of a lawyer, and know that it's usually a good idea to keep records of agreements. **Document everything of concern.**",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee in Texas is being laid off from Company A after 20 years of service. The company has invoked the WARN Act, requiring 60 days' notice. The employee has found a new job starting in 5 weeks. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the employee's legal and ethical obligations?\n\nA) The employee must work the full 60 days at Company A to receive severance pay, as mandated by the WARN Act.\n\nB) The employee can start the new job immediately without informing either company, as the WARN Act protects their right to seek new employment.\n\nC) The employee can work both jobs simultaneously for 3 weeks without legal consequences, but may face ethical issues and potential policy violations.\n\nD) The employee is legally required to inform the new company about their continued employment at Company A during the notice period.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The WARN Act does not prevent employees from seeking or starting new employment during the notice period. However, working both jobs simultaneously could potentially violate company policies and raise ethical concerns, even if it's not strictly illegal. The employee is not legally required to inform the new company about their current employment status, but doing so might be advisable to avoid potential conflicts. Option A is incorrect because the WARN Act does not mandate severance pay or working conditions. Option B is partially true about seeking new employment, but overlooks potential policy violations. Option D is not a legal requirement under the WARN Act or general employment law."

The only opportunity to do so involves cutting in front of a moving school bus traveling at 40 mph. The driver successfully changes lanes without causing the bus to brake suddenly. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The driver has committed a traffic violation by cutting off a school bus, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nB) The driver has not violated any traffic laws, as Colorado statutes only regulate interactions with stopped school buses.\n\nC) The driver may be cited for reckless driving, as changing lanes in front of a school bus is inherently dangerous.\n\nD) The driver's actions are likely legal, provided the lane change was executed safely and with proper signaling.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, option D is the most accurate. Colorado traffic laws do not specifically prohibit changing lanes in front of a moving school bus. The key factors are whether the lane change was performed safely and with proper signaling. As long as the driver did not cause the bus to brake suddenly or create an unsafe situation, and used turn signals, the action would likely be considered legal. The documentation mentions that Colorado statutes mainly address interactions with stopped buses, not moving ones. Additionally, the answer suggests that if the lane change was not performed in an unsafe manner and there was adequate space, no violation would have occurred.

A [U.S. Department of State report\nfor the year 2020](https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/sri-lanka/) also noted that in Sri Lanka:\n\n> The constitution prohibits discrimination, including with respect to\n> employment and occupation, on the basis of race, religion, language,\n> caste, sex, political opinion, or place of birth. The law does not\n> prohibit employment or occupational discrimination on the basis of\n> color, sexual orientation or gender identity, age, HIV\\-positive\n> status, or status with regard to other communicable diseases.\n\nAs 2021 [summary of women's rights in Sri Lanka](https://wbl.worldbank.org/content/dam/documents/wbl/2021/snapshots/Sri-lanka.pdf) entitled \"Women, Business, and The Law\" noted that there was no law in Sri Lanka which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex in the extension of credit (although women also [aren't prohibited from taking out loans](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/172710/sri-lanka-country-gender-assessment-update.pdf) or engaging in financial and economic activity).\n\nI didn't find any sources that specifically resolved the issue of whether gender discrimination in pricing by private firms was prohibited by law, but it is fair to say that addressing that issue is [not even on the agenda](https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/172710/sri-lanka-country-gender-assessment-update.pdf) of people concerned about these issues in Sri Lanka, and I found no positive evidence that this was legally prohibited.",

If this individual visits Hawaii 1.5 years after committing the crime, and the authorities in New York become aware of the offense, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences?\n\nA) The individual cannot be charged because they are in a different state.\nB) Hawaii authorities can immediately arrest and prosecute the individual for the New York crime.\nC) New York can issue a warrant, but Hawaii's response depends on the crime's severity and New York's willingness to extradite.\nD) The statute of limitations has expired, so no legal action can be taken.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. If New York authorities become aware of the crime and decide to press charges (which they can do within the 2-year statute of limitations), they can issue an arrest warrant. However, since the crime was committed in New York and the individual is now in Hawaii, the process of interstate extradition (also known as rendition) comes into play. Hawaii's response to the warrant depends on the severity of the crime and whether New York is willing to pay for the costs of extradition. If New York decides not to extradite due to costs or the nature of the offense, Hawaii authorities would likely not detain the individual further on that warrant.\n\nOption A is incorrect because being in a different state doesn't prevent charges from being filed in the state where the crime occurred. Option B is wrong because Hawaii cannot prosecute for a crime committed in New York. Option D is incorrect because the statute of limitations (2 years in this case) has not yet expired."

As explained in the documentation, if the plaintiff's arguments are limited to issues pertaining only to themselves, the ruling might dismiss only the plaintiff from the counterclaim while allowing it to proceed against other parties, including the third-party defendant. The court has the discretion to partially dismiss claims or parties based on the merits of the motion and the specific circumstances of the case.

But that copyright can be sold or otherwise transferred. If the creator was a contractor, it is likely that the copyright was transferred to the client. If a business owns the copyright, and it is bought by another business, that copyright will most likely be transferred along with the rest of the business.\n\nThe copyright owner may also chose to grant permission to others to use the image in various ways. This is known as a *license*. The terms of the license can be pretty much anything that the copyright owner chooses to make them.\n\nWhen an image appears on a merchant website, it may be that the merchant owns the copyright, or that the manufacturer of the item pictured owns the copyright, and has licensed the image to the merchant for use in the catalog. It may even be that a third party owns the copyright, and has licensed the image to the merchant, directly or via the manufacturer. \n\nIn any case, by displaying the image on the catalog site, the merchant has given visitors permission to view the image, and probably to download copies for personal use. But unless there is an explicit grant of additional permissions, a user may not re\\-use the image in any other way. This would include distributing it to others, creating modified versions of the image, or combining it with other images.\n\nIn addition to being protected by copyright, the image may possibly be a trademark, used to identify the product it represents. This is more likely for product or business logos, and less likely for simple pictures of a product, but it is possible in either case.\n\nIf an image is also a trademark, it may not be used to advertise or indicate the source of goods or services without permission from the trademark holder, and it may not be used to indicate or imply any endorsement or association between the trademark holder or the maker of the product and the person using the image, without permission.\n\nThere are limited exceptions to copyright. In the US *Fair use* applies. This is for comment on or reference to the copyrighted work, or for limited use of it, particularly for \"transformative use\" this is different from the original use. It is more likely to apply for non\\-commercial use, but can apply to some commercial uses. A somewhat similar, but narrower, exception known as *Fair dealing* applies in the UK and some other countries. [This law.se Q\\&A](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) describes fair use in more detail.\n\nThere are limited exceptions to trademark protection. In general, use of a trademark to identify or comment on a trademarked item is *nominative use* and is permitted. Nominative use is more likely to apply to a word than to an image or logo.",

When a merchant displays an image on their website, they implicitly grant permission for visitors to view and download copies for personal use. Using the image as a personal phone wallpaper falls under this category.\n\nOption A involves creating a derivative work and using it for commercial purposes, which would likely require explicit permission from the copyright holders of all images used.\n\nOption C involves modifying a copyrighted image and using it in a way that might imply endorsement, which would require permission from the copyright holder (likely the manufacturer).\n\nOption D is a clear copyright infringement, as one retailer cannot simply copy and use images from another retailer's website without permission.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates understanding of the limited permissions typically granted by merchants for personal use of displayed images, while the incorrect options involve various forms of copyright infringement or unauthorized use."

This is in the UK, Merseyside.\n\nThe client has been advised to send a letter of claim to them, and then to issue court proceedings via the Government\u2019s Small Claims Track Online System if they don't respond.\n\nHowever, the consent form signed by the client prior to the treatment included the following clauses: 'I understand that no warranty or guarantee of specific results have been made to me' and 'I understand my cheeks/jowls may not achieve the desired improvement anticipated.'\n\nWould a claim be worth pursuing when the client has signed these clauses? The client has also been advised that it is 'arguable that those warranties are legally enforceable for the clinic, especially as this is a business to consumer contract.'\n\nThis completely conflicted what they were saying to the client in person during the consultation. They didn't mention to the client verbally once that there might be no change and assured the client that the procedure they were recommending would definitely help with addressing the areas the client was concerned with. They did however say that the client would need a 're\\-treat' 4 weeks after initial procedure to touch up. This would cost a minimum of \u00a3500 although likely more and would have involved more of the same treatment. The client however didn't attend this as the client had seen zero impact from the first round of treatment and did not want to spend more on a treatment that had already cost so much and resulted in no change. The client also saw a review somebody had left for the clinic, who had had the same treatment, seen no results, paid more at the clinic's recommendation of more of the same treatment, still seen no results, paid more, still not results etc. The client did not want to have same experience.\n\nHowever, the clinic is now saying that, because the full treatment was not completed (the post 4 week 're\\-treat'), the results will have been affected and they cannot judge the treatment effectively. However, after just 2\\-3 weeks, once the swelling subsided, it was already clear there had been no improvement. They are also saying that 'there is a considered understanding, that there will be a 40% drop after the first treatment and this has been communicated with you.' The procedure was a 'thread lift' wherein temporary sutures are used to produce a subtle but visible \"lift\" in the skin. This is supposed to last up to 2 years. This '40% drop' was not communicated to the client during the consultation or procedure, or anywhere in the consent form. Furthermore, any 'lift' that was seen beyond the immediate swelling was gone within 3 weeks.\n\nThey offered the treatment within an hour of the client's initial consultation, really not giving time to think it through or research the producedure. The client rather based the decision on what they were saying about the procedure (which was that it would definitely address the client's concerns).\n\nSo my question is \\- with these clauses being present in the consent form, is there any point in pursuing a claim? As mentioned above, I've been told that it is 'arguable that those warranties are legally enforceable for the clinic, especially as this is a business to consumer contract.' The client is wary of adding more legal costs to the already large amount spent at the clinic if it is likely the claim has no weight in court due to the consent form.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Would a claim be worth pursuing when the client has signed these clauses?\n\nAltogether it appears that the client (you) would prevail.\n\n[Section 57 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/57) largely renders null and void the no\\-warranty clause. The absolute lack of improvement from the procedure makes it quite a stretch for the clinic to allege that its qualified representations trigger section 50(2\\)(a). To avail itself of [section 50](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/50)(2\\)(b), the no\\-warranty clause ought to be clear enough about the possibility that the procedure might bring no improvement *at all*. That is because no reasonable person would enter a contract and spend \u00a34,000 without expecting at least some improvement. It was the clinic's responsibility to make a disclaimer of that sort, and instead the clinic \"*assured the client that the procedure they were recommending would **definitely** help with addressing the areas the client was concerned with*\" (emphasis added).\n\n> They offered the treatment within an hour of the client's initial consultation, really not giving time to think it through or research\n\nThat argument would be unavailing. Your description gives no indication that the clinic indulged in *harassment, coercion or undue influence*. See [Part 2 of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1277/part/2). The failure to think it twice or do some research prior to entering the contract is not the clinic's fault.",

The Consumer Rights Act 2015, particularly Section 57, largely renders null and void the no-warranty clause in this context. The clinic's verbal assurances contradicted the written disclaimers, and the complete lack of improvement makes it difficult for the clinic to argue that its representations were qualified. Consumer protection laws in the UK tend to favor the consumer in business-to-consumer contracts, especially when there's a significant discrepancy between verbal assurances and written disclaimers. The fact that the client didn't complete the \"re-treat\" is less relevant given the total lack of initial improvement, and there's no indication of harassment or coercion that would be necessary for option D to be correct."

Do I lose my right to be forgotten if some or all of the data provided was inaccurate/fake?\n4. Should I tell the company that the data is inaccurate or that I was a minor at that time? Does this increase the chance of being forgotten?\n\nI am most interested in the EU (Germany) but would also be interested in the USA or others as well, if there are different answers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The data controller is obliged to use \u201call reasonable measures to verify the identity\u201d of the person exercising their data subject rights (GDPR, Recital 64\\). That sentence has caused a lot of confusion:\n\n* \u201call reasonable\u201d: does this mean all measures the controller can be reasonably burdened with, or all measures that are necessary for identifying the data subject with reasonable certainty?\n* \u201cidentity\u201d: does that mean the identity of a natural person, or just a check that the person exercising their data subjects rights is identical with the data subject?\n\nSo depending on how the company interprets this, there is a lot of leeway regarding which info may be requested from you. In general, being able to log in to the service should be all that is necessary (compare also Recital 57\\).\n\nNote that the company doesn't just have to satisfy your data subject rights, they also have to protect your data against unauthorized access. Giving an attacker access just because they control a particular email address might not be secure enough (but is in practice because the attacker could use a password\\-reset functionality to get the full credentials anyway).\n\nYou do not lose your data subject rights if you used pseudonymous/fake data: the service may still contain other personal data regarding you, for example usage profiles. You are still a data subject. Pseudonyms can also be identifying data, e.g. Art 4(1\\) calls online handles out as a kind of personal data. However, this does lead to complications with companies that interpret identity verification as ensuring that the person making a request is a particular natural person.\n\nIf the controller isn't sure about your identity, they can request additional information (Art 12(6\\)). If the data subject cannot be identified, the data subject rights do not apply (Art 11(2\\)). However, that describes a subtly different scenario: that the data held by the controller lacks identifying data.\n\nYou do have a right to access and a right to rectification (correcting the data they hold about you). However, they require the exact same identity verification as the right to erasure.\n\nThat you were underage at the time of account creation is likely irrelevant now, if the data in the account doesn't indicate your true age. Unless the subject matter of the online service makes an age restriction necessary, the relevant age limits are 13\\-16 years (Art 8 GDPR, subject to EU member state laws) or 13 years (COPPA, U.S.).\n\nIf you believe you have provided all data that is reasonably necessary to verify your identity and your data subject rights are denied to you, you can issue a complaint with your local data protection authority. In Germany, each Bundesland has their own Datenschutzbeauftragte agency.\n\nBelow, relevant GDPR excerpts used in this answer. \u201cErasure\u201d is Art 17 but Art 12 covers modalities for exercise of data subject rights. Recitals are explanatory but not normative.\n\n> **Art 12(6\\):** Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.\n> \n> \n> **Art 11(2\\):** Where \\[\u2026] the controller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the data subject, \\[\u2026] Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification.\n> \n> \n> **Recital 57:** Identification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log\\-in to the on\\-line service offered by the data controller.\n> \n> \n> **Recital 64:** The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity of a data subject who requests access, in particular in the context of online services and online identifiers.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the GDPR, a data controller is obligated to use \"all reasonable measures to verify the identity\" of a person exercising their data subject rights. In the context of an online service where a user created an account with fake data while underage, which of the following approaches is most likely to be considered compliant with this obligation?\n\nA) Requiring the user to provide their government-issued ID and proof of address, regardless of the nature of the service\nB) Accepting the user's ability to log in to the account as sufficient verification\nC) Denying the request outright due to the use of fake data during registration\nD) Requiring the user to provide the exact day of registration and all historical account activity\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to Recital 57 of the GDPR, identification should include digital identification of a data subject, such as through authentication mechanisms like the same credentials used to log in to the online service. This approach balances the need for identity verification with the practical realities of online services.\n\nOption A is excessive for most online services and goes beyond \"reasonable measures.\" Option C is incorrect because using pseudonymous or fake data does not negate a user's data subject rights. Option D is unreasonable, as users are unlikely to remember such specific details, especially after a long time.\n\nIt's important to note that while logging in should generally be sufficient, the specific requirements may vary based on the nature of the service and the sensitivity of the data involved. However, in most cases, being able to access the account demonstrates a reasonable level of identity verification for exercising data subject rights."

If/when something happens, the organizer can be sued.\n\n1. If you are organizing a trip publicized on a web page, is it not sufficient for you to add a warning informing people that you assume no risk on the web page?\nPosting on a web page leaves open proving that the disclaimer was not added after the fact, but that's a separate question.\n2. If the answer to the first question is that an actual physical signature on paper is necessary, can you make do with a first name, last name, and signature, or do you also have to go through the much more intrusive date of birth and proof of identity?\n\nThe jurisdiction in question is Canada.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\n**Scenario 1**\n\nYour group is coming down the hill. I\u2019m crossing the road (legally) when 7 of you plot into me causing hundreds of thousands of damages in medical bills, lost income and pain and suffering. I never saw your website or your disclaimer. You raise the disclaimer in court and my lawyer and the judge laugh and laugh and laugh. It\u2019s nice to see someone enjoying themselves after a tragedy.\n\n**Scenario 2**\n\nSusan is one of the 7\\. She\u2019s there because her mate Allen told her about the trip. She never visited the website or saw the disclaimer. She has also suffered damage *and* is being sued by me. See above.\n\n**Scenario 3**\n\nAllen might have seen the waiver but unfortunately he suffered a head injury in the crash and can\u2019t remember a lot of things \\- his wife\u2019s name, how to be an engineer, whether he saw the waiver etc. Since the organisers are relying on the waiver, they have to prove Allen agreed to it, he doesn\u2019t have to prove he didn\u2019t. Since there is no evidence either way, Allen wins the case.\n\n**Scenario 4**\n\nJim is one of those rare individuals: a totally law abiding person. He saw the waiver and agrees that if it were part of a contract it would be valid and enforceable. However, he points out that since no consideration ever passed from him to the organisers, there is no contract and therefore no waiver.\n\n**Scenario 5**\n\nThe website says: \u201cBike ride Sunday. Nothing to do. Just turn up and have fun!\u201d At the scene of the accident, city officials turn up and ask to see the permit. It turns out that any group of more than 15 cyclists is required to have a permit. And a first aid kit. The permits are free and rarely if ever refused. They also come with a free first aid kit. Unfortunately, the fine for not having the permit is $1,000 per participant plus $5,000 if there is no first aid kit. Each member of the group is jointly and severally liable for the fine. Everyone who isn\u2019t an organiser doesn\u2019t think they should pay. The waiver doesn\u2019t address this explicitly. The city sues everyone. All non organisers sue the organisers.\n\nTL;DR\n-----\n\nSubject to local law, waivers in contracts can be effective. However, a notice on a web site isn\u2019t a contract and, notwithstanding, they are of no effect on third\\-parties who are not part of the contract.\n\nFor the best legal protection, form a properly registered club and buy insurance.",

The documentation clearly illustrates that waivers, whether posted online or signed physically, have significant limitations in protecting organizers from liability. They are ineffective against third-party claims (as shown in Scenario 1), may not apply to participants who didn't see them (Scenario 2), can be challenged if there's no proof of agreement (Scenario 3), may lack consideration to form a valid contract (Scenario 4), and don't protect against regulatory issues or fines (Scenario 5). The answer emphasizes that waivers in contracts can be effective to some extent, but they are not a comprehensive solution. The documentation suggests that for the best legal protection, organizers should form a properly registered club and obtain insurance, which goes beyond simple waivers or disclaimers."

Assuming that to be unknowable, whether or not this interpretation is self\\-restraint or activism is more of an opinion than a fact.

The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.\n\nIt does not appear in the situation described that the data subject has been clearly informed that consent is being given.\n\n### Recital 42\n\n[Recital 42](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-42/) reads in relevant part:\n\n> In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC a declaration of consent pre\\-formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms. ...
