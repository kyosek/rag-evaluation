How to? ... Is that a question really? Police should stop! Get another tank, a big excavator, fire a missile to it on a empty road or do whatever...\n is that good that he killed people, crashed machines and destroyed half the city??\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are various practical considerations such as the fact that a spike strip is not effective against a tank. The main legal reason is that in the US, a seizure (arrest) must be reasonable under existing interpretations of the 4th Amendment. A person has a constitutional right to his life and property, and police force potentially infringes that right. For example, stopping a jaywalker with a shotgun blast would be unreasonable force, and could open the government up to a section 1983 lawsuit (referring to [42 USC 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983)). So while the police are motivated to protect lives and property and to enforce the law, their use of force has to be reasonable.\n\nThere is no mechanical procedure for determining, in any arbitrary instance, where the line is between reasonable and unreasonable force. The courts have determined that it is whatever force a reasonable officer would use in the given circumstances. More force is justified if the reasonable officer believe that he or others are in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death, and lack of such a reasonable belief could lead to a protracted low\\-speed car chase to arrest a suspect. There are guidelines that help police make these decisions, see [this](https://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/officer-safety/use-of-force/Pages/continuum.aspx) for example, and department will have specific rules about use of force. \n\nThere is a tradeoff between spending more time waiting for a suspect to stop, and using force to stop a vehicle. One way to stop a fleeing vehicle is with a spike strip, but that will destroy property and is likely to cause injury, so you need a policy. [Here](https://www.ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Files/Briefing-Room/News-Releases/Policy-and-Legislation/Vehicular-Pursuit/CORSA-Vehicular-Pursuit-Model-Policy.aspx) is a policy in Ohio, which begins by stating that\n\n> Due to the unique conditions within the community we serve the agency\n>  designee has determined that high speed pursuits are generally \n>  restricted to exigent circumstances, and when occurring are \n>  authorized and closely monitored by supervisors.\n\nSpike strips can be used in some circumstances, but not all. That is, police have to follow the law in making an arrest.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, what is the primary legal consideration that restricts police from using excessive force to stop a fleeing suspect in a vehicle chase?\n\nA) The cost of potential property damage\nB) The Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizure\nC) State-specific laws on vehicular pursuits\nD) The inability of spike strips to stop certain vehicles\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The primary legal consideration mentioned in the documentation is the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizure. The answer states that \"a seizure (arrest) must be reasonable under existing interpretations of the 4th Amendment.\" This constitutional right limits the amount of force police can use, as they must balance the need to apprehend suspects with the suspect's right to life and property.

Yes, a ten year open case. She was taken from her mother. \n\nMy fiance (at the time) did not have a stable living situation or employment (but was NEVER a safety concern) so Oregon wouldn't give him custody. After about a year into the state having custody of his daughter he was in the position to have custody of his daughter. But, the state wouldn't grant custody. \n\nThe state required my fiance to take many classes (he did). But, there was always another hurdle for him to jump. When I met my fiance almost 6 years ago he had his own 2 bedroom appt., a job and was living a normal life, but, without his daughter. \n\nWe began to push back and write letters to the state, all attorneys involved, DHS, the juvenile judge ect. the case had gotten so bad and the judge, case workers and attorneys have gotten biased and had their own plans for his daughter. \n\nThey began to make a permanent plan for where his daughter will live and the life she will have for her remaining childhood. A court date was set to finally TAKE my fiancee parental rights (as he would not ever willingly give them up). \n\nThree days before that court date, a meeting was frantically put together by DHS and they invited my fiance, his attorney, the mother of his daughter, her attorney, his daughter, her attorney and casa, the case workers involved in the case and a supervisor whom my fiance has never met. The purpose of that meeting was to see if my fiance was going to willingly give up his rights (it was a quick meeting). The DHS supervisor also stated that he had NEVER seen a case that big and open for so many years. \n\nThree days later, we went into court and that DHS supervisor asked to speak to the judge, attorneys and casa. They all went into the judges chambers and when they all returned that DHS supervisor said that DHS is pulling out of the case and told the judge that she should grant custody to my fiance. The judge tried to talk DHS out of that decision but DHS told her they won't continue to keep custody of my fiances daughter. The judge continued to struggle with that decision and got DHS to agree to staying involved in our lives for 3 months if she were to grant my fiance custody. \n\nA week later, we had full custody of my fiances daughter. \n\nDuring all the time the state had custody of his daughter he racked up some owed child support to the state as well as paid the state thousands of dollars. They took his tax returns every dang year, until last year! \n\nWe know that DHS pulled out of the case and the judge was basically forced to give my fiance his daughter because as soon as that supervisor from DHS looked over the case he realized they should have given custody to my fiance YEARS AGO! \n\nWhile we will never be able to get back the time and raising his daughter who is now 16, we want the child support that the state took while they kept custody of his child when they shouldn't have. \n\nHow do we go about finding someone to help us? What sort of lawyer should we contact? Any immediate steps we should take to make this process quick and easy? And, is there any cheap way to go about this? \n\nI'm a stay at home mom and my fiance supports our family of 6\\. We are considered low income right now and DHS has a huge part in our crappy financial situation. \n\nAny and all suggestions will help and be very appreciated. Thank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You shouldn't try to bring suit against the state or DHS.\n\nDHS and the state and any other plausible defendants all have sovereign immunity from all liability for the kinds of conduct that you describe. Their actions were expressly approved by judges which gives them complete immunity from liability. You would not prevail. There is nothing you can do about that. You need to move on and get past it.\n\nNothing described constitutes a violation of someone's constitutional rights that can be remedied in a civil action.\n\nAlso, there is no way that he would ever get the child support back. Whether he liked it or not, the state paid money over that ten year period to support his daughter, and he had a legal duty as a father to provide some of that economic support. Child support cannot be changed retroactively, even if the custody decision was wrong.\n\nIf his child was physically harmed (or, for example, raped) over that ten years, the child may have a cause of action for that harm which could be brought by the child when the child becomes an adult, or by a guardian appointed for the child. \n\nBut, no facts above suggest that this has happened, proving that the harm was caused by the wrongful actions of a responsible person (like a foster parent) rather than, for example, a fellow child in foster care, showing damages, and overcoming the qualified immunity of the persons who allegedly caused the harm, is pretty much an insurmountable barrier as well.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the LawStackExchange documentation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the family's potential legal recourse against the state or Department of Human Services (DHS)?\n\nA) The family can sue the state to recover child support payments made during the daughter's time in custody.\nB) The family has a strong case for constitutional rights violations and can seek damages.\nC) The daughter may have a cause of action for physical harm if any occurred during her time in state custody.\nD) The family has no viable legal options due to sovereign immunity and judicial approval of actions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The documentation clearly states that DHS, the state, and other potential defendants have sovereign immunity from liability for the described conduct. Their actions were approved by judges, granting them complete immunity. Additionally, child support payments cannot be recovered retroactively, even if the custody decision was wrong. The family has no viable legal options in this situation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the child support payments cannot be recovered, as they were used to support the child during her time in state custody.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation specifically states that nothing described constitutes a violation of constitutional rights that can be remedied in a civil action.\n\nOption C, while partially true, is not the most accurate answer. The daughter may have a cause of action for physical harm, but only if such harm occurred and can be proven to be caused by a responsible person. The question doesn't provide evidence of this, and overcoming qualified immunity would be extremely difficult."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67794/is-a-company-allowed-to-break-their-own-terms-of-service-tos", "docs_id": 67794, "title": "Is a company allowed to break their own Terms of Service (TOS)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have spotted multiple counts of a gamecompany breaking their own TOS for their own or \"associates/friends\" gains, including real world trading (selling items for money) while stated in their TOS it's not allowed, allowing the use and game assets from a dozen games that were directly copied and having them featured in their game or promoted on their social media and more counts.

However, if it says *you* won\u2019t do X, it doesn\u2019t restrict what they can do at all.\n\nSo, for example, if a game includes tradables and the ToS prohibit users from selling them for real world consideration, then users are prohibited. The company isn\u2019t and can sell as many as they want.\n\nFurther, there is nothing stopping them from having one contract with general users and another contract with different terms with premium users and a third contract with even more different terms with the founder\u2019s brother\\-in\\-law Jim. Or, they can tell Jim that they won\u2019t take action if he ignores this part of the contract.\n\nThis is called *discrimination* and, unless there is a law against it (which there is for protected classes like race, gender etc.) it\u2019s perfectly legal. \u201cBeing married to my sister\u201d is not a protected class so I can discriminate in favour (or against) people who are.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-part exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: GameWorld Inc. has a Terms of Service (ToS) that prohibits users from selling in-game items for real money.

The key points to understand are:\n\n1. A company's Terms of Service primarily govern what users can and cannot do, not necessarily what the company itself can do.\n2. Companies can have different agreements or practices with different users or groups.\n3. Discrimination is legal unless it's against protected classes (race, gender, etc.).\n4. The company isn't bound by user restrictions in the ToS unless it explicitly states so.\n\nTherefore, GameWorld Inc. can legally sell items for real money even if the ToS prohibits users from doing so, as long as they don't discriminate based on protected classes.

After moving out, the tenant receives a call from a collection agency demanding an additional month's rent for not providing 60 days' notice. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landlord is within their rights to demand an additional month's rent, as most lease agreements require 60 days' notice.\n\nB) The tenant is liable for the extra month's rent because they didn't get the 45-day notice agreement in writing.\n\nC) The landlord has breached the implied warranty of habitability, and the tenant is not responsible for additional rent.\n\nD) The collection agency can legally report the tenant's spouse to credit bureaus for the unpaid rent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The landlord has breached the implied warranty of habitability by failing to address the severe mold issue that was causing health problems for the tenant and their family. This breach renders the apartment uninhabitable, and the tenant is not responsible for additional rent. The initial acceptance of the 45-day notice by property management further supports the tenant's position.

When someone commits a crime, they are **guilty** of that crime. This is true whether or not they are ever prosecuted, or even if law enforcement knows who the guilty one is. If someone runs a red light at 2 in the morning on an empty street, it's still illegal and thus they are guilty of running a red \\- but no one will ever catch them. If someone is shot in the middle of the street, then *someone* is guilty of shooting them.

They may be right. They may be wrong. But the suspicion of having committed it is enough to charge you.\n\nTo continue the traffic example: If an officer sees you running the red light, they can write you a ticket (effectively charging you) for doing so. They may or may not actually be right (it could have been yellow or malfunctioning, for example), but **law enforcement has the power to charge** regardless. \n\n4\\) A defendant may or may be found guilty and convicted.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n> [Conviction:](https://thelawdictionary.org/conviction/) In a general sense, the result of a criminal trial which ends in a judgment or sentence that the prisoner is guilty as charged. Finding a person guilty by verdict of a jury.\n\n*This* is where the presumption of innocence comes in \\- the default assumption is that the accused did not commit the crime that they are being charged with, and it's the prosecutor's job to prove otherwise.

POTUS, Congress and state governors can do it, to some extent. Art. 1, \u00a79 (speaking of powers denied to Congress) says that \"The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it\". Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus is one fundamental element of \"martial law\". Art. 2 \u00a72 (presidential powers) grants relatively little power to POTUS, but does say \"The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States\", so as commander in chief, POTUS can command the army, but in general requires authorization from Congress.\n\nAt the outset of the Civil War, Lincoln declared a numbered of things which Congress ratified, but this did not include a declaration of martial law. In [Ex parte Merryman](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F.Cas/0017.f.cas/0017.f.cas.0144.3.html), 17 F. Cas. 144, the Taney (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States) stated that \"the president, under the constitution of the United States, cannot suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, nor authorize a military officer to do it\". Congress eventually retroactively legalized the suspension of habeas corpus. Without Congressional approval of the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, a \"declaration of martial law\" would be meaningless and toothless.\n\nThe [Posse Comitatus Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_Comitatus_Act) further limits the ability of the army to meddle in domestic affair, and [18 USC 1385](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1385) states that\n\n> Whoever, except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized\n> by the Constitution or Act of Congress, willfully uses any part of the\n> Army or the Air Force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the\n> laws shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two\n> years, or both.\n\nOne of authorizations by Congess is [The Enforcement Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Acts), which empowered federal intervention when states refused to protect the constitutional rights of citizens, and this was invoked more recently during the Eisenhower administration and in connection with the Mississippi Burning murders. Another much older authorization is the [Insurrection Act of 1807](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrection_Act_of_1807), now at [10 USC Ch. 13](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/subtitle-A/part-I/chapter-13) allows use of the military (\u00a7252\\):\n\n> Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions,\n> combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of\n> the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the\n> United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial\n> proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of\n> any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary\n> to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion.\n\nThe next section [\u00a7253](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/253) would, no doubt, be the statutory provision invoked for use of the military:\n\n> The President, by using the militia or the armed forces, or both, or\n> by any other means, shall take such measures as he considers necessary\n> to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful\n> combination, or conspiracy, if it\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the\n> United States within the State, that any part or class of its people\n> is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in\n> the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities\n> of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right,\n> privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United\n> States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\n> \n> \n> In any situation covered by clause (1\\), the State shall be considered\n> to have denied the equal protection of the laws secured by the\n> Constitution.\n\nThe rhetoric that would need to be associated with such an executive order (sending in the troops) would resemble that in Texas v. Pennsylvania et al, which did not turn out well for POTUS.

As noted by the [Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/legitimate-interests/), \"*Legitimate interests is the most flexible lawful basis for processing, but you cannot assume it will always be the most appropriate. It is likely to be most appropriate where you use people\u2019s data in ways they would reasonably expect and which have a minimal privacy impact, or where there is a compelling justification for the processing.*\".\n\nThe legitimate interest here would be that you need a sign up system which prevents duplicate registrations. Remember though that the processing has to be \"*necessary*\" for the purposes of the legitimate interest. One might argue that it is not since you could design the system to give the appearance of accepting the duplicate registration followed by sending an email to the account holder to inform them. On the other hand this will result in a less user friendly experience which could itself be a legitimate interest.\n\nUltimately this is a balancing exercise and it is hard to say whether you have struck the right balance until someone complains to the ICO or the court and a decision is issued. The fact that the practice is widespread among well\\-resourced and large companies would tend to indicate that it is lawful albeit this is not conclusive in the absence of a court decision. I'm not aware of any cases involving this particular issue but would be interested to hear from others on this point.\n\nIf the processing is unlawful then Article 18 is applicable:\n\n> 1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies: \\[...]\n> (b) the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the\n> erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of their use\n> instead\n> 2.

The FDA approval statement does not prohibit the use of the device in the mentioned scenarios, including for patients under 18.

RCW 82\\.24\\.050(2\\) states that\n\n> A retailer may obtain cigarettes only from a wholesaler subject to the\n>  provisions of this chapter\n\nand in case you thought you might not be a retailer, a [retailer](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.24&full=true#82.24.010) under Washington tobacco law is\n\n> every person, other than a wholesaler, who purchases, sells, offers\n>  for sale or distributes any one or more of the articles taxed herein,\n>  irrespective of quantity or amount, or the number of sales, and all\n>  persons operating under a retailer's registration certificate\n\nI am not kidding. If you buy a pack of cigarettes, you are a retailer. This goes back at least to the 1935 laws (ch. 180 \u00a783\\).

Does the Supreme Court ever rule that something is prohibited, or only protected/not protected?**\n\nNot exactly sure how this could go down anyway. The Supreme Court doesn't write laws, and a prohibition on abortion would have to involve not only the prohibitory statement itself, but also exact definitions, sentencing mandates, parole guidelines, etc. This sounds more like the state legal codes on homicide (first\\-degree murder, premeditated murder, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, accidental homicide, accessory to murder, etc.) than a Supreme Court ruling.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no higher court which can overturn a SCOTUS decision, so in theory (or, imaginarily) they can rule any way they please. The ruling could then be overturned by a later court, as happened in [these cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_overruled_United_States_Supreme_Court_decisions). However, justices of the Supreme Court can be impeached (impeachment is not subject to judicial review), so the individuals responsible for such a ruling could be impeached. Or, if the sitting president is favorable and the enabling legislation has been passed, additional members of the Supreme could be added, as was unsuccessfully attempted during the Roosevelt administration.\n\nThe court could not write specific enforceable statutes defining the crime and imposing a penalty. They could rule that there is such\\-and\\-such right which is protected by the Cconstitution, and that that right must be protected by the states (for instance, a state may not pass a law that prohibits practicing the Pastafarian religion). It would be unprecedented, though, for SCOTUS to order a legislature to pass particular legislation. That would not mean that a ruling could not be written which mandated that, but it would be a huge break from tradition and a clear breach of the separation of powers. Legislatures could respond \"[they have made their decision; now let them enforce it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia)\".\n\nDecades ago, existing state death penalty laws were [declared unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furman_v._Georgia) as defective with respect to the 8th Amendment, meaning that there was no death penalty in many states for some time.

Referring yourself (via the subterfuge of using a joint account that you have) would not be bringing in new business; nor would getting family (including \"same household\"). The first interpretation limits the prohibition of referrals to just \"yourself\", and fails to include a prohibition against referring all of your aunts, cousins and roommates (which they assume, reasonably enough, are not actual potential new customers). Furthermore, there is no sensible meaning to \"referring yourself via a family member\".

To overcome this, Parliament passed the [*Parliamentary Papers Act 1840*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Papers_Act_1840), which provides absolute privilege for a report published \u201cby or under the authority of either House of Parliament\u201d (ie. Hansard).\n\n[Section 3 of the Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/3-4/9/section/3) provides qualified privilege for publishing an \u201cextract or abstract\u201d of Hansard. In relation to statements made under parliamentary privilege in breach of a court order, the Committee on Super\\-Injunctions wrote in its report on [Super\\-Injunctions, Anonymised Injunctions and Open Justice](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/JCO/Documents/Reports/super-injunction-report-20052011.pdf) (May 2011\\):\n\n> In order to obtain the benefit of the immunity from civil or criminal proceedings under section 3, the individual must prove, before a jury, that the relevant material was published in good faith and without malice. It is an open question whether publication of any extract from or abstract of Hansard which had the effect of frustrating a court order and was deliberately intended to do so would be held to be in good faith and without malice \u2026\n> \n> \n> Where media reports go beyond, or fall outside, the ambit of protection provided by the 1840 Act, it is the common law which determines whether there is any protection from contempt proceedings for breach of court orders. Mr Woolf noted that while *Wason v Walter* (1868\\) 4 QB 73 established a limited common law protection in defamation proceedings for honest, fair and accurate reporting of Parliamentary proceedings, there was \u2018no reported case which authoritatively decides the extent of protection against proceedings for contempt available in respect of fair and accurate reports of proceedings of Parliament\u2019 \u2026\n> \n> \n> It therefore appears to be an open question whether, and to what extent, the common law protects media reporting of Parliamentary proceedings where such reporting appears to breach the terms of a court order and is not covered by the protection provided by the 1840 Act. What is clear is that unfettered reporting of Parliamentary proceedings (in apparent breach of court orders) has not been established as a clear right.\n\nIn its report on [Parliamentary Privilege](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt201314/jtselect/jtprivi/30/30.pdf) (June 2013\\), the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege said that the *Parliamentary Papers Act* would generally not apply to the contemporary media, and that the defence of qualified privilege was limited to defamation actions:\n\n> An \u201cabstract\u201d was defined by the 1999 Joint Committee as a \u201csummary or epitome\u201d. Thus media reports of what goes on in Parliament, even if they draw on documents published by order of the House, such as Hansard, do not generally enjoy the (qualified) protection afforded by section 3 of the 1840 Act\u2014a point confirmed by Sarah McColl, Solicitor Advocate in the BBC Editorial Legal Department, in her oral evidence on behalf of the Media Lawyers Association \u2026\n> \n> \n> Outside the field of defamation, it does not appear that media reports of parliamentary proceedings (as opposed to extracts or abstracts) enjoy legal protection. This arises most obviously in the case of breaches of court injunctions \u2026\n\nThe Joint Committee recommended that the law should be reformed:\n\n> On balance, we do not support extending absolute privilege to all reports, including media sketches and summaries, of proceedings in Parliament \u2026 we consider that the existing protection of qualified privilege\u2014that is, that all fair and accurate reports are protected, unless they can be proved by the claimant to have been made maliciously\u2014already provides a robust defence of press freedom \u2026\n> \n> \n> At the same time, we acknowledge that the media need clarity and certainty. The *Parliamentary Papers Act 1840* provides qualified protection for all \u201cextracts and abstracts\u201d of parliamentary publications (including broadcasts), but as we have already said these terms do not appear to cover media reports or editorial comment \u2026\n> \n> \n> We endorse the recommendation of the 1999 Joint Committee that \\[the] *Parliamentary Papers Act 1840* should be replaced by modern statutory provisions \u2026 We recommend that these new provisions should \u2026\n> \n> \n> * establish that qualified privilege applies to all fair and accurate reports of parliamentary proceedings in the same way as to abstracts and extracts of those proceedings;\n> * provide that in all court proceedings in respect of such fair and accurate reports, extracts or abstracts, the claimant or prosecution shall be required to prove that the defendant acted maliciously \u2026\n\nHowever, it appears that Parliament has not taken up the Joint Committee\u2019s recommendation, and the extent of any common law protection remains an open question. Accordingly, the article linked in the question states that \u201cThe BBC is not naming Soldier F for legal reasons.\u201d", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, what is the current legal status of media outlets in the UK reporting on parliamentary statements that breach court orders, such as naming \"Soldier F\"?\n\nA) Media outlets have absolute privilege to report such statements without legal consequences.\nB) Media outlets are protected by qualified privilege as long as their reporting is fair and accurate.\nC) Media outlets have no clear legal protection and may be at risk of contempt of court.\nD) Media outlets are protected by the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 for all forms of reporting on parliamentary proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that there is no clear legal protection for media outlets reporting on parliamentary statements that breach court orders. The Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 provides limited protection for \"extracts and abstracts\" of parliamentary publications, but this doesn't typically cover contemporary media reporting. The extent of common law protection remains an open question, and the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege noted that outside of defamation cases, media reports of parliamentary proceedings do not appear to enjoy legal protection, especially in cases of breaches of court injunctions. This uncertainty is why the BBC stated it was not naming Soldier F \"for legal reasons,\" suggesting that media outlets may indeed be at risk of contempt of court for reporting such information.\n\nOption A is incorrect because absolute privilege does not extend to media reporting of parliamentary proceedings. Option B is incorrect because while qualified privilege exists for defamation cases, it's not clear if it applies to breaches of court orders. Option D is incorrect because the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 does not generally apply to contemporary media reporting, as stated in the information provided."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21649/due-process-hearing-concerning-returning-to-work-after-medical-leave", "docs_id": 21649, "title": "&quot;due process&quot; hearing concerning returning to work after medical leave", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My wife works at a local university as an accountant. Or perhaps I should say \"worked\" ... she suffered a brain injury in late December. She has recovered physically for the most part, but still has significant issues with short\\-term memory. So knowledge work is not a very realistic option at this point, and consequently, she is still on medical leave.\n\nWe just (yesterday) received a letter from the university. They want to convene a \"due process\" hearing to determine whether she can return to work and what accommodations might be necessary.\n\nIt's not (IMO) unreasonable for them to ask whether and/or when she intends on returning to work. And we live in a state (Ohio) where employment is \"at will\" (either the employee or employer may sever the relationship at any time).\n\nAt the same time, recovery from this type of injury is typically 1\\-2 years. (That doesn't necessarily mean everyone makes a full recovery. It means that, however much a person recovers, 90%\\-95% of that is going to happen withing 12\\-24 months.) So December 2017 / January 2018 would be a more appropriate time to have a discussion about her long\\-term capabilities.\n\nAnd I am somewhat concerned that the hearing is next week, and they want a list of people who will testify on her behalf by the end of this week (three days from now). It was probably unlikely that I could get any of her doctors or therapists to this meeting; but with so little notice, I have zero chance of getting any of her medical providers to the meeting.\n\nI'm not looking for specific legal advice so much as I'm wondering if this type of hearing is a standard procedure ... and if so, I'd like to have a rough idea of what to expect.\n\n**Update / Clarification:**  \n\nMy wife's employer is a state school (not private). I don't know for certain whether her position would be classified as civil service or not; but I would guess that it is (civil service), since she is required to contribute to the state employees' retirement fund.\n\nI do not believe her position is covered by a collective bargaining agreement \\-\\- as I understand it, most positions at this university are not (although some functions, e.g. maintenance or campus police, may be an exception).\n\n**Update 2:**  \n\nThe university agreed to postpone the hearing. And I did contact an employment attorney. His opinion was that this was probably just a routine formality \\-\\- policy does say that medical leave should be reviewed at or about six months \\-\\- they would probably just extend her leave, and it would be a waste of time for him to attend the meeting with us.\n\nHe was partially correct. The meeting certainly was a formality, and it probably would have been a waste of time for him to attend. But as to the outcome ... they had obviously already made the decision to terminate her employment.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are procedural rules in place in the state universities pertaining to any negative action, but the exact rules depend on the nature of the position. Faculty for example have one set of rules, students another, and staff yet others. A hearing is thus required to do anything significant (such as fire an employee), so it is very common. The function of a \"due process\" hearing is to make certain that the rules are followed before visiting a negative outcome on an employee. This is not a matter that you should try to deal with on your own: you need an attorney.\n\nThere are two distinct issues involved in such a procedure. One is whether the hierarchy of fact\\-finders follows the process. Usually there is a technical screw\\-up (I was part of the process in Ohio), but typically not anything that would lead to overturning a final decision. The other is whether there are specific disability or work\\-related injury protections.\n\nThe timing of such a hearing and matters of notice would figure prominently in the first response from an attorney. Three days notice is not inconceivable, but it is arguably unreasonable, which is one of the first things that an attorney would tell them.

In 1869 there was [*Griffin\u2019s Case*, 11 F. Cas. 7, 2 Am. Law T. Rep. U. S. Cts. 93; 8 Am. Law Reg. N. S. 358](https://cite.case.law/f-cas/11/7/?full_case=true&format=html). This was tried by Chief Justice Chase, in his role as a Circuit Justice, not as a Supreme Court case.\n\nOne Caesar Griffin was accused of shooting with intent to kill, tried before a Virginia state court, convicted, and sentenced to two years in prison. He then filed a writ of *Habes Corpus* claiming that his imprisonment was unlawful, because the jusge before whom he was tried, Hugh W. Sheffey, (in the words of Justice Chase):\n\n> in December, 1849, \\[Sheffey] as a member of the Virginia house of delegates, took an oath to support the constitution of the United States, and also that he was a member of the legislature of Virginia in 1862\\. during the late Rebellion, and as such voted for measures to sustain the so\\-called Confederate States in their war against the United States; and it was claimed in behalf of the petitioner, that he thereby became, and was at the time of the trial of the petitioner, disqualified to hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any state ...\n\nSeveral other people tried and convicted before Judge Sheffey in the circuit court of Rockbridge county, including some convicted of murder, filed similar *Habes Corpus* petitions, claiming that Sheffey was prohibited by Section 3 from holding office, and that therefore their convictions were invalid. Judge Sheffey had been appointed to the office of Judge after the end of the US Civil War by the reorganized government of Virginia, the one recognized as valid by the Federal Government. He was appointed before the ratification of the 14th Amendment. There was no dispute that he fit the letter of the group of prohibited persons in Section 3\\.\n\nJustice Chase wrote:\n\n> The general question to be determined on the appeal from this order is whether or not the sentence of the circuit court of Rock\\-bridge county must be regarded as a nullity because of the disability to hold any office under the state of Virginia, imposed by the fourteenth amendment, on the person, who, in fact, presided as judge in that court.\n\nJustice Chase rejected the suggestion that all official actions by Sheffey and anyone in a similar position were automatically void and of no authority because of sectio0n 3\\. He wrote that:\n\n> The proposition maintained in behalf of the petitioner, is, that this prohibition, instantly, on the day of its promulgation, vacated all offices held by persons within the category of prohibition, and made all official acts, performed by them, since that day, null and void.\n\nAfter pointing out that many of the offials of the reconstructed governments of the sothern states were withign the terms of the prohibition of section 3, Chae went on to write:\n\n> If the construction now contended for be given to the prohibitive section, the effect must be to annul all official acts performed by these officers. No sentence, no judgment, no decree, no acknowledgment of a deed, no record of a deed, no sheriff\u2019s or commissioner\u2019s sale \u2014 in short no official act \u2014 is of the least validity. It is impossible to m\u00e9asure the evils which such a construction would add to the calamities which have already fallen upon the people of these states.\n\nAs a further reason not to construe section 3 as instantly and automatically removing all such officials, Chase wrote:\n\n> Now it is undoubted that those provisions of the constitution which deny to the legislature power to deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law, or to pass a bill of attainder or an ex post facto, are inconsistent in their spirit and general purpose with a provision which, at once without trial, deprives a whole class of persons of offices held by them, for cause, however grave. It is true that no limit can be imposed on the people when exercising their sovereign power in amending their own constitution of government. But it is a necessary presumption that the people in the exercise of that power, seek to confirm and improve, rather than to weaken and impair the general spirit of the constitution.\n\n...\n\n> Is there, then, any other reasonable construction? ... The object of the amendment is to exclude from certain offices a certain class of persons. Now, it is obviously impossible to do this by a simple declaration, whether in the constitution or in an act of congress, that all persons included within a particular description shall not hold office. For, in the very nature of things, it must be ascertained what particular individuals are embraced by the definition, before any sentence of exclusion can be made to operate. To accomplish this ascertainment and ensure effective results, proceedings, evidence, decisions, and enforcements of decisions, more or less formal, are indispensable; and these can only be provided for by congress.\n\n...\n\n> \\[I]t seems to put beyond reasonable question the conclusion that the intention of the people of the United States, in adopting the fourteenth amendment, was to create a disability, to be removed in proper cases by a two\\-thirds vote, and to be made operative in other cases by the legislation of congress in its ordinary course.\n\nChase also note that, 2 months after the conviction of Griffin:\n\n> in February, 1869, congress adopted a joint resolution entitled \u201ca resolution respecting the provisional governments of Virginia and Texas.\u201d In this resolution it was provided that persons, \u201cholding office in the provisional governments of Virginia and Texas,\u201d but unable to take and subscribe the test oath prescribed by the act of July 2, 1862 \\[12 Stat. 502], except those relieved from disability, \u201cbe removed therefrom;\u201d\n\nand that this indicates that such people were regarded by Congress as having remained in office and not beign automatically removed.\n\n*Griffin's Case* seems to establish that **some** proceeding is needed to establish when a person falls under the exclusion rule of Section 3 of the 14th. In 1869 this was done by military order. In 1870 Congress passed a statute providing for criminal proceedings in such cases. This was repealed at the end of Reconstruction.\n\nCurrently [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 2383](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383) makes \"rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof,\" a crime, and provides that anyone convicted of it \"shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.\" This is not quite the same as the section 3 disqualification. One the one hand, it does not depend on a prior oath to support the constitution, and on the other it does not appear to ban holding a state or local office. But it shows how a similar law could be drafted by Congress.\n\nLegislative declaration\n-----------------------\n\n> Can a Congressional resolution, or a Federal statute declare that specific people have so engaged?\n\nThis is probably prohibited as a *Bill of Attainder*, that is, a legislative declaration, without trial, that particular persons are guilty of particular crimes.\n\nOther Proceedings\n-----------------\n\n> What proceedings would be needed to establish that a person had \"engaged in insurrection or rebellion\"?\n\nIf a person subject to the section 3 disqualification was elected to either house of Congress, that house could refuse to seat such person, or expel him or her, as the Constitution permits. Most state legislatures have similar powers over the seating and expulsion of their own members.\n\nIf a person is convicted under 18 USC \u00a7 2383 or any similar law, that person would clearly be excluded. Congress could pass a law establishing a special tribunal for determining when a person was subject to Section 3 of the 14th. But it has not done so.\n\n### See also\n\nSee also:\n\n* [this leglal blog post](https://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2020/08/section-three-of-the-fourteenth-amendment-.html)\n* [This article in *Constitution Daily*](https://constitutioncenter.org/amp/blog/the-constitution-offers-another-path-to-trump-accountability)\n* [14th Amendment's Section 3 Gets New Look as Democrats Weigh Measures Against Trump](https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/2021/01/12/14th-amendments-section-3-gets-new-look-as-democrats-weigh-measures-against-trump/) from the *National Law Journal*", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to Chief Justice Chase's ruling in Griffin's Case (1869), which of the following best describes the application of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment regarding the disqualification of individuals from holding office?\n\nA) The disqualification is automatic and immediate upon ratification of the 14th Amendment, requiring no further action or proceedings.\n\nB) A criminal conviction for insurrection or rebellion is absolutely necessary before an individual can be disqualified from office.\n\nC) Congress must pass a specific law for each individual to be disqualified, identifying them by name.\n\nD) Some form of legal proceeding is required to determine whether an individual falls under the disqualification clause, but the exact nature of this proceeding was left for Congress to determine.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Chief Justice Chase's ruling in Griffin's Case established that Section 3 of the 14th Amendment does not automatically and immediately disqualify individuals from office upon ratification. He argued that it would be impractical and potentially unjust to interpret the amendment in this way, as it would invalidate numerous official acts and cause widespread disruption.\n\nChase stated that \"proceedings, evidence, decisions, and enforcements of decisions, more or less formal, are indispensable\" to determine which individuals are subject to disqualification. He concluded that the intention was to create a disability that could be \"made operative in other cases by the legislation of congress in its ordinary course.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts Chase's ruling against automatic disqualification.

While there are [some](http://www3.lancashire.gov.uk/corporate/web/viewdoc.asp?id=100088) contracts that must be in writing to be valid at law, there are none that require a signature and none that require a witness to that unnecessary signature.\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t sign it, or don\u2019t have your signature witnessed or have it witnessed by a relative *and the other party accepts that*, either explicitly or implicitly, you have a binding contract. If it emerges latter that the witness was your sister (who I think everyone would agree is a relative) that will be of no practical effect on the operation of the contract.\n\nThat said, it shows a certain sloppiness to start a contract by technically breaching it (even if that breach is not actionable) so find a witness who isn\u2019t related to you at all.

The documentation states that there is no generally applicable definition of \"relative\" in contract law, and the parties to the contract need to agree on what they mean by \"relative\" if they use the term. This implies that the definition can vary and should be specified by the parties involved.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that there isn't one universal definition of \"relative\" across different areas of law in the UK.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the documentation doesn't provide a specific rule about third cousins, and it suggests that the definition of relative can vary depending on the contract.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect for two reasons. First, the documentation states that there are no contracts that legally require a witness signature. Second, it mentions that even if a witness signature is requested (not required), having a relative as a witness wouldn't necessarily invalidate the contract if the other party accepts it."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45162/am-i-obligated-to-pursue-an-invoice", "docs_id": 45162, "title": "Am I obligated to pursue an invoice?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently had a contractor do some work on my house.\n\nI was not happy with them at all: They started later than promised, finished later than promised, did not update me on progress, literally forgot to do part of the project (they did it later, after it came up in inspection), sent me the wrong invoice, and then failed to void the wrong invoice as promised.\n\nThe original terms were 1/2 up\\-front and 1/2 when the job is done.\n\nNow that the job is done, I have not received the final invoice.\n(I can guess why: I have reason to believe they sent it to the wrong address because of their own sloppy record\\-keeping)\n\n**Do I have any legal obligation to pursue this invoice?

Spenceley*, [\\[1972] 2 O.R. 429](https://canlii.ca/t/g17r5) (C.A.)):\n\n> The Court was referred to a number of cases under the law as it then stood whereby it was strictly required that special damages be set forth in the pleading and whereby no plea of general damages would be entertained. This was changed in England by the Defamation Act, 1952 (U.K.), c. 66, s. 3 (1\\), and here by a similar section, s. 19(a) of the Libel and Slander Act, 1958\n> (Ont.), c. 51 ...\n\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal quoted from *Clavet v.

When opening a bank account she used her correct social security number, but used her similar planned new name instead of her current legal name. Well of course she discovered it was much harder to have your name legally changed than she believed, and you are required to post about it in the papers which somewhat defeats the point. So she may have committed a kind of fraud or forgery for very innocent reasons, not financial gain.\n\nWhat sort of legal repercussions might this have? She would like to get her old financial records from this now closed account, but her ID does not match. Might she have any way to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an interesting question and one that does not have a uniform answer.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, while there is a court proceeding by which you can change your name, there is also case law precedent that says your legal name is what you go by even if it doesn't match your birth certificate or other official records.\\* \n\nFor example, I have a client who has a birth name completely different from the one she uses in day to day life (as different as, for example, \"Sophia\" and \"Betsy\" are from each other) that she picked up in college and just started living under for reasons that she could never really fully explain to me in a way that made sense. Under Colorado law, the name she used on a day to day basis is one of her legal names, even though there was never a legal name change proceeding conducted in a court.\n\nI happen to know someone who set up a bank account with a name other than on their official documents and with their own Social Security number at a bank and it caused no problems, because banks don't routinely check Social Security numbers against names (employers, in contrast, routinely do cross\\-check).\n\nNot every state recognizes \"common law\" name changes, or even every bureaucratic entity within a state that expressly does have that as their law. Most bureaucrats in both the public and private sector don't understand the concept of a common law name change even in places where that is the law, because it doesn't fit with bureaucratic logic.\n\nIt is not forgery, which would involve signing with an intent to appear to be some other actual person who you are not. \n\nWhether or not it is fraud turns on intent. If you use a different name to evade a creditor or to cash a check that wasn't intended to be payable to you, that is fraud. But, simply changing a new to avoid family members who mistreat you is not fraud.\n\nIn terms of getting the bank records, the best thing to do is to try to explain the situation to the bank official (ideally with, e.g., a Social Security card and other evidence such as the name of a former employer or a person to whom checks were regularly written to corroborate your story).\n\nName disconnects aren't that unusual in banking. For example, I was beneficiary of an account established by my late father that identified me by my pre\\-marital name of 23 years ago. But, the rule of law is that a beneficiary designation is valid if the intended person is clear, even if the names don't exactly match, for example, because your name changed in the meantime. As a result, I am able to deposit checks payable to my pre\\-marital name. So, a lack of a name match shouldn't be a strict bar to getting old banking records of your own account.\n\nFor another purpose, it is also permissible to have checks whose name don't match the name on the account, and to have \"trade name\" accounts of an unincorporated individual supported only by an obscure trade name filing for businesses. \n\n**Post\\-Script: Some Similar Concepts**\n\n* In the same vein, Colorado recognizes common law marriage that arises when two people agree that they are married and hold themselves out to the public as married, without any formal paperwork. If you just start calling someone \"my husband\" and you both mean it, it is true.\n\nEmancipation of a minor in Colorado is a similar concept. An emancipated minor in Colorado is a minor who provides most of his or her own support and lives independently. Courts in Colorado don't declare that a minor is emancipated causing the minor to become emancipated following a petition requesting emancipation. Instead, courts in Colorado determine as a factual matter if given the way that the minor lives his or her life, he is or is not emancipated. The emancipation determination of a court flows from the reality on the ground, rather than the other way around.\n\nThe race\\-notice recording system for real estate also works this way. Ownership of real estate flows from transactions that happen outside the recording system and can be private. Recording real estate documents provides evidence of an underlying reality and provides a means of weighing evidence when there is a dispute over who owns real property, but recording a document with the clerk and recorder of a county in not what actually causes title to that real estate to change, unlike the situation in title registration jurisdictions like the UK and Germany and South Africa where the filling with the government office is the moment at which title is changed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Sarah, who lives in Colorado, has been using the name \"Emma Smith\" for the past 5 years in her daily life, though her birth certificate shows her name as \"Sarah Johnson\".

Therefore, she can open a bank account under this name without it being considered fraud or requiring a formal name change proceeding.

I am going to take a few moments to give an overview of both and then get to the question of self\\-prescribing.\n\nExpanded Access has been around for about 30 years, when it began as a way to make experimental HIV drugs available to patients during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It has been used since them to make drugs available for a variety of diseases (like [cancer](https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/clinical-trials/compassionate-drug-use.html)), and most recently for COVID\\-19\\.\n\nThe Right to Try Act is similar in that it makes experimental drugs available to patients before they have received full regulatory approval. The mechanism for that availability is a different, and it has since it is a law it has the explicit approval of Congress. Here are a [journal article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7081483/) and a [very good table breaking down the differences](https://triagecancer.org/expanded-access-vs-try-patients#:%7E:text=What%20is%20the%20Food%20%26%20Drug,access%20to%20investigational%20medical%20products.) between Right to Try and Expanded Access.\n\nNeither of these modify the patient/doctor relationship, so they do not effect whether a prescriber can write their own prescriptions either way. **A doctor could probably prescribe COVID\\-19\\-related treatments for themselves approved for widespread use under Expanded Access; they would likely be unable to self\\-prescribe other more medically\\-complex, higher\\-risk treatments like chemotherapy.** See below.\n\n---\n\n**Self\\-prescribing is legal under federal law.** As noted by the [Emergency Care Research Institute](https://www.ecri.org/components/HRC/Pages/AskHRC111219.aspx):\n\n> Under federal law, physicians in the United States are not prohibited from self\\-prescribing medications. State laws governing physicians, however, vary greatly, and some may prohibit physicians from prescribing, dispensing, or administering certain medications to themselves or family members.\n\n[Restrictions vary by state](https://www.grantsformedical.com/self-prescribing-laws-by-state.html).

Many prohibit prescribing of Schedule II drugs to family members. I have found several sources that claim some states outright prohibit self\\-prescribing, but whenever I follow those back to the actual statute they only apply to Schedule II drugs.\n\nProfessional organizations like the American Medical Association strongly discourage their members self\\-prescribing, stating in their [Code of Ethics](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/ethics/treating-self-or-family) that \"treating oneself or a member of one's own family poses several challenges for physicians, including concerns about professional objectivity, patient autonomy, and informed consent.\"\n\nThe greatest barrier to self\\-prescribing lies at the pharmacy, where pharmacists are able to refuse prescriptions when they question the medical necessity or standard of care that lead to the prescription.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Dr. Smith, a licensed physician, wants to prescribe herself a COVID-19 treatment that has been approved under the FDA's Expanded Access Program.

While Greek accounting laws may use a 5-year depreciation period for IT equipment, this is not an EU-wide regulation and doesn't require actual replacement.\nC) is correct.
