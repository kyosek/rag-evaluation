This is also required under the governor's [order of March 20](https://www2.illinois.gov/Pages/Executive-Orders/ExecutiveOrder2020-10.aspx). Foreclosure entails eviction \u2013 though the order prohibits the enforcement of an associated eviction order, and doesn't prohibit starting action against a property owner. Theoretically, you could file for eviction against your tenant and at some point the petition could be granted, and the sheriff would enforce it. Those are the current legal options.

The lease ends in October 2020. Given the legal situation in Illinois as of March 2020, what is the most accurate statement regarding the landlord's options?\n\nA) The landlord can immediately evict the tenant for non-payment of rent.\nB) The landlord can file for eviction, but enforcement is suspended until at least mid-May 2020.\nC) The landlord must wait until October 2020 when the lease ends to take any action.\nD) The landlord is prohibited from filing for eviction until the COVID-19 crisis is officially over.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, while landlords can technically file for eviction, the enforcement of eviction orders has been suspended by court order and the governor's executive order. The sheriff, who would normally carry out evictions, is not enforcing them during this period. The document suggests that evictions might potentially resume in the second half of May, though this is described as an optimistic projection. Therefore, while the landlord can initiate the eviction process, they cannot actually remove the tenant until the suspension is lifted. Options A and D are incorrect as they misstate the current legal situation.

(Most calls for cell phone bans in Europe seem to relate to the idea that extreme overuse might cause cancer: [http://www.reuters.com/article/us\\-italy\\-phones\\-idUSBRE89I0V320121019](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-phones-idUSBRE89I0V320121019) My understanding is that there is still a great deal of debate as to whether this is so, and can serve to illustrate the interaction of the law and science.)\n\n* If there is no legislation regarding the rights of minors to carry cell phones, or be restricted from doing so, have there been any court decisions related to the subject?\n* If there are laws that support the confiscation of cell phone from minors where parental consent is given, is it possible the law is unconstitutional?\n\nAn activist might use the trip\\-\\-getting barred for refusing to relinquish their phone, or because their parents refused to sign the contract\\-\\-to generate publicity on the potential unconstitutionality, and reach out to activist lawyers willing to work [pro\\-bono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_bono) on the issue. (I could also see approaching cell phone manufacturers to back the suit for financial or PR purposes, i.e. fighting for the rights of kids to always be connected.)\n\nI caution you that such suits, although always interesting, are generally extremely expensive, and can even be financially ruinous. The process, especially when dealing with constitutional issues, can take years and even decades. *(Outcome of trials can never be known, thus settlement is generally seen as the most prudent choice in business litigation, although your issue is in a different domain.)*\n\nThe first steps in challenging the constitutionality of this contract would be to:\n\n1.

The actual laws are in the [Florida Code sections 709\\.2100 thru 709\\.2402](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0709/0709.html)\n\n[Health Care Advance Directives](https://www.floridahealthfinder.gov/reports-guides/advance-directives.aspx) from the Florida Health Care Administration is a consumer guide to Living wills, surrogate designations, and related issues.\n\n[Florida Living Wills Laws](https://statelaws.findlaw.com/florida-law/florida-living-wills-laws.html) from FindLaw lists legal provisions related to living wills in Florida. The relevant code sections are stated as 765\\.101, and subsequent sections (Health Care Advance Directives).\n\nTerminology\n-----------\n\nThe person who makes the Power of Attorney (POA) is the *principal* \\-\\- the mother in the situation described in the question. The person appointed to do things for the principal is known as the *agent*, and is sometimes also called the *attorney\\-in\\-fact*.\n\nA *Limited POA* gives the agent power only over a particular transaction, or over a single or small number of types of transactions. One might give a limited POA to manage a particular investment, or to sell a car or a house, say.\n\nA *General POA* gives the agent power to do anything that the principal could do in person, or anything except for some specifically excluded things.\n\nA *Durable POA* remains in force even if the principal becomes incapacitated (for example with serious dementia). It includes specific language to this effect. It is usually also a general POA. Any POA that is not durable is not in effect when the principal becomes incapacitated. The situation described in the question would often be met with a durable POA.\n\nA durable POA:\n\n> contains the words: \u201cThis durable power of attorney is not terminated by subsequent incapacity of the principal except as provided in chapter 709, Florida Statutes,\u201d or similar words that show the principal\u2019s intent that the authority conferred is exercisable notwithstanding the principal\u2019s subsequent incapacity. (*Section 709\\.2104*)\n\nA *Medical POA*, sometimes also called a *Healthcare POA* grants the agent power to make medical or health choices for the principal. It is also known as a *health care surrogate designation*. It is normally a separate document form a POA dealing with non\\-medical issues, sometimes called a *financial POA*, even if the same agent is appointed for each.\n\nA *living will* is \"a written or oral statement of the kind of medical care you want or do not want if you become unable to make your own decisions.\" (*from the Advance Directives pamphlet linked above*)\n\nLiving wills and Healthcare POAs are collectively known as *Advance Directives*. The pamphlet says:\n\n> \\[I]f you have not made an advance directive, decisions about your health care or an anatomical donation may be made for you by a court\\-appointed guardian, your wife or husband, your adult child, your parent, your adult sibling, an adult relative, or a close friend.\n\nUnder section 709\\.2102:\n\n> \u201cIncapacity\u201d means the inability of an individual to take those actions necessary to obtain, administer, and dispose of real and personal property, intangible property, business property, benefits, and income.\n\nAgent\n-----\n\nAny competent adult that the principal selects may be an agent. The pamphlet linked above says:\n\n> Any competent person 18 years of age or older may serve as an agent. Agents should be chosen for reliability and trustworthiness. Certain financial institutions with trust powers also may serve as agents.\n\nThe agent may hire assistants, such as a lawyer,, an accountant, or a realtor. But the agent may not delegate or transfer his or her powers as an agent, or appoint a sub\\-agent.\n\nThe agent must act as instructed by the principal. When no specific instructions apply, the agent must act in the best interests of the principal, to the best of his or her understanding and ability.\n\nCreating a POA\n--------------\n\nThe POA must be in writing, and signed by the principal and two witnesses, and notarized. The principal must be competent when the POA is signed \\-\\- that is, must be in condition to understand the purpose and effect of the POA, and what is going on generally. (See the definitions section above.)\n\nThe agent must accept the POA, and often signs the POA to acknowledge the POA and accept the responsibility of acting as agent.\n\nA POA may appoint backup agents to act if the first agent is unable to act, or resigns, or dies. It may also appoint multiple agents any of whom may act, but this can cause problems if the agents disagree.\n\nThe text of a POA may be drafted by a lawyer. But there are also software programs that will produce the text of a POA, after appropriate information is entered and questions are answered as to the desired effects. Such programs normally produce text tailored to ma particular state's laws.\n\nEnding a POA\n------------\n\nThe principal may revoke a POA at any time, if the principal is competent. A principal may also revoke a living will or other advance directive at any time.\n\nThe agent may resign at any time\n\nIf either agent or principal dies the POA is ended. (If a POA appoints multiple agents, it ends only if they all die or resign.)\n\nIf the agent becomes incapacitated, the agents power ends. If there is not other agent, the POA ends.\n\nIf the agent is married to the principal, a divorce or separation or a petition for a divorce, ends the agent's authority, unless the POA explicitly says it will continue after a divorce or separation.\n\nIf a legal process to appoint a guardian is started, the POA is suspended, unless the agent is the principal's \"parent, spouse, child, or grandchild\". (This may include stepchild.) If a guardian is appointed, the court will rule on whether the POA continues; often it will not, unless the agent is also the guardian appointed.\n\nFlorida code section 709\\.2109\u2003(3\\) (*Link above*) says:\n\n> If any person initiates judicial proceedings to determine the principal\u2019s incapacity or for the appointment of a guardian advocate, the authority granted under the power of attorney is suspended until the petition is dismissed or withdrawn or the court enters an order authorizing the agent to exercise one or more powers granted under the power of attorney. However, if the agent named in the power of attorney is the principal\u2019s parent, spouse, child, or grandchild, the authority under the power of attorney is not suspended unless a verified motion in accordance with s. 744\\.3203 is also filed.\n\nIf the POA includes an ending date or condition, it ends when this occurs.\n\nA third party, one who is neither the agent or the principal, can only have a durable POA revoked by petitioning a court to do so, usually in connection with the appointment of a guardian. The court will do this only if a guardian is needed, and that the action of the agent under the POA is not sufficient to serve he interests of the principal; or if the agent is shown to have been untrustworthy or neglectful, or has become incapacitated.\n\nLiving wills normally remain in effect unless revoked, even if a guardian is appointed.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nNo one has an automatic right to be appointed as the agent, no matter what relationship to the principal that person has, or for how long a relationship has existed.

She is still legally married to her second husband but they have been informally separated for years.

According to Florida law, a principal (the woman in this case) can choose any competent adult as her agent for a power of attorney, regardless of family relationships. As long as the woman is competent when creating and signing the POA, and it is properly executed (in writing, signed by the principal and two witnesses, and notarized), it is valid. Neither the husband nor the stepchildren have an automatic right to override or contest the POA simply because they were not included.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the second husband does not have an automatic right to override a validly created POA, even if he is still legally married to the woman.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the stepchildren cannot easily contest the POA just because they were not included. They would need to prove that the son has acted against the mother's best interests or that there was undue influence in creating the POA.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because if the POA is made \"durable\" (which is likely given the woman's health concerns), it remains valid even if the principal becomes incapacitated."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87797/app-that-contains-a-feature-that-allows-users-to-deposit-money-that-they-may-use", "docs_id": 87797, "title": "App that contains a feature that allows users to deposit money that they may use to purchase later or get refunded", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In my app / website, there is a feature for the user to deposit money that they could then use to purchase later or get refunded 3 months later.\n\nWhat is the legal implication of this feature?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An incomplete list:\n\n* Getting the money.  \n\nHow did you plan to get paid?

Is there a possibility that all the potential suits and countersuits could result in forcing a nationally\\-uniform set of voting laws, or is this lawsuit narrowly tailored enough that it wouldn't have repercussions like that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nThe Texas suit alleges that significant changes were made to the election rules in the various defendant states, and that these were not approved by the legislatures of those states, but were made by administrative or court decisions. It also claims that differences in local practice and polices made absentee or mail\\-in voting easier, or invalid votes less likely to be detected, in some counties than in others, meaning that voters in some parts of those states were treated differently than voters in other parts.\n\nNote that this theory has not yet been accepted, or in any way passed on, by SCOTUS. But even assuming that the theory were to be accepted, it would require, at most, strict adherence to the election statutes of each state, and that changes or variances be approved by the state legislature. It would have nothing to say about the actual content of the various state laws, unless those laws treated different parts of a state differently, in which case there would be an equal protection violation.\n\nThe Electors clause, cited in this suit, gives to the legislature of each state the power to \"direct\" how electors are to be appointed. This is done through laws, statutes. The suit cites this clause as a source of authority, and nothing in it could be taken as suggesting a requirement of national uniformity in election law.\n\nI have not yet seen the response to this suit, if indeed one has been filed. It may be that a response would argue that the changes were, in fact, authorized by provisions of the various state laws granting authority to officials. No one knows how the Court will respond to this suit.

The legal theory in Texas' lawsuit focuses on ensuring that states adhere to their own election laws as enacted by their legislatures. It does not suggest imposing national uniformity (A) or allowing states to challenge the content of other states' laws (D). While the theory might allow states to challenge how well another state applied its own laws, it wouldn't permit wholesale challenges to properly enacted laws of other states (B).

When Arpaio accepts the presidential pardon, he loses Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination for the specific federal crimes covered by the pardon. This means he can be compelled to testify about those matters in both federal and state cases. However, the presidential pardon does not cover potential state crimes or federal crimes not included in the pardon. For these, Arpaio would retain his Fifth Amendment rights.

Or does the community service not constitute sufficient consideration for a contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **tl;dr**\n\nThe community service is unlikely to be valid consideration.\n\n**Background**\n\nWhile the father seemingly intends to induce performance via the offer, as in [Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 81](http://www.cs.xu.edu/~osborn/main/lawSchool/contractsHtml/bottomScreens/Briefs/Restatement%2081.%20Consideration%20as%20Motive%20or%20Inducing%20Cause.htm), judge\\-ordered community service is an exception.\n\nIn particular, [Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 73](http://www.lexinter.net/LOTWVers4/performance_of_legal_duty.htm) says performing a preexisting legal duty does not constitute consideration. For example, in *McDevitt v. Stokes*, 192 S.W. 681 (Ky. 1917\\), a breeder who had promised a horse jockey money if he won a race was allowed to renege on the promise because the jockey already had a professional duty to try to win.\n\nLikewise, if you promise the police a reward if they bring the person who burgled your house to justice, they already have a preexisting duty to bring the criminal to justice.\n\nThere's a small window here to argue the opposite if the dad was trying to induce something above and beyond what the judge ordered.\n\n[united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Matt, a 17-year-old, has been sentenced to 10 hours of community service by a judge. His father offers him $1000 if he completes the service with a positive attitude and volunteers for 2 additional hours beyond the requirement. Matt agrees and completes 12 hours of service with a documented positive attitude. His father then refuses to pay. Which of the following is most likely true regarding the legal status of this agreement?\n\nA) The agreement is an enforceable contract because Matt went beyond his legal duty by doing extra hours and maintaining a positive attitude.\n\nB) The agreement is void because Matt is a minor and cannot enter into binding contracts.\n\nC) The agreement is unenforceable because completing court-ordered community service cannot serve as consideration for a contract.\n\nD) The agreement is an enforceable contract because there was a clear offer, acceptance, and consideration in the form of the extra hours worked.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: While performing a pre-existing legal duty (the court-ordered 10 hours) typically cannot serve as consideration for a contract, Matt's father specifically asked for performance beyond the legal requirement. By completing 2 extra hours and maintaining a documented positive attitude, Matt provided something beyond his legal obligation. This additional performance can serve as valid consideration, potentially making the agreement an enforceable contract. \n\nOption B is incorrect because while minors generally have limited capacity to contract, contracts made by minors are typically voidable, not automatically void. \n\nOption C would be correct if the father had only asked Matt to complete his required service, but the additional requirements make it incorrect in this case. \n\nOption D is close but not the best answer, as it doesn't address the key issue of going beyond the pre-existing legal duty."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41647/contesting-a-harassment-injunction-and-university-action-years-later", "docs_id": 41647, "title": "Contesting a harassment injunction and university action years later", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Two members of the same university are in a relationship that goes sour.

But then she notifies the school, which issues him a suspension to ensure that he complies with the injunction. Devastated, angry, confused and afraid of getting in further trouble he again just apologizes, complies and returns to school the following semester, but both actions remain on his legal and academic records.\n\nDid the school overstep their authority in the suspension?

I assume he is a student (\"suspension\" only makes sense in that context), and also assume she is a student (as a faculty member, a rather different kettle of fish is implied). There will be some code of conduct that students are required to obey, and the university will take the position that by violating the injunction, the student has violated that code. Suspension is a reasonable response, given that the university would open itself up for a Title 9 lawsuit (for tolerating sexual harassment). The university will almost certainly have the authority to suspend or even expel a student for violating an injunction that involves another of their students.\n\nThere may be a requirement for a hearing: you would have to look into the university rules. The chances are low that a university would ignore such a rule (if they did, their action could easily be overturned in the ensuing lawsuit). \n\nIf he is going to contest the injunction, that involves the courts, and not the university. The courts will not remove the injunction from \"the record\". He might get it vacated, dismissed or modified, but there will be \"a record\". The university is likely to keep records of disciplinary actions against students somewhat private, and again there will be university rules about that topic (some of which are compelled by FERPA). Whether or not he has a right to a university\\-internal appeal depends on university rules, but you should assume that there is very limited opportunity for appeal.

The above\\-described actions do not clearly constitute a breach of that duty as described in document 12011\\. They specifically identify a gift prohibition [5 CFR 2635\\.202(a)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=sp5.3.2635.b&rgn=div6), the\n\n> standards that prohibit an employee from soliciting or accepting any\n> gift from a prohibited source or any gift given because of the\n> employee's official position, unless the item is excluded from the\n> definition of a gift or falls within one of the exceptions set forth\n> in this subpart\n\nThis includes meals. However, that does not mean you cannot invite a person to dinner if they work for the IRS, because the gift is given out of friendship, and not because of the person's official position. A person (gift\\-giver) might be a prohibited person because for example they are \"doing business with or trying to do business with the Service\". But furthermore, \"a person is not considered a prohibited source just because he/she is a taxpayer\".\n\nThe regulations prohibit soliciting gifts in exchange for \"professional favors\": but I could wonder, if I don't do this, might they not seek my return and flag it for an audit? It's not clear exactly what discretion an IRS auditor has to trigger an audit, but [reportedly](http://www.boston-tax-lawyer.com/files/A%20Rare%20Look%20Inside%20the%20IRS%20Tax%20Audit%20Process%20in%202020%20-%20boston-tax-lawyer.com%20.pdf), audits are triggered by objectively verifiable facts such as a relationship with an existing audit or a reporting discrepancy.

The Ethics Handbook for IRS employees prohibits soliciting or accepting gifts from prohibited sources or due to their official position. However, neighborly favors and social interactions aren't necessarily prohibited. The auditor's actions are concerning and may skirt ethical boundaries, but they don't clearly breach regulations unless it can be proven that the requests are made specifically because of their official position or involve prohibited gifts. The neighbor is not legally obligated to comply with requests, and the auditor shouldn't be able to target them for audits arbitrarily.

While Larry did not physically throw bricks or directly damage property (ruling out direct charges for property damage), his actions could be construed as aiding and abetting under 18 USC 2.

This requires a bit of background, so please bear with me.\n\nOur school district published just now, in the middle of school year, the following schedule for \"hybrid learning\" for elementary school kids:\n\n1. The kids will be separated into two cohorts; each cohort will attend school for 1\\.5 hour per day, 4 days a week. That's 6 hours per week of instruction, roughly same as used to be per day.\n2. During other hours the kids will have no guidance whatsoever, they are on their own. Basically homeschooling.\n3. If the parents opts for online learning, the kids will be pulled from their classes and grouped with other online learning kids from different schools and **different grades**. Meaning there will be zoom sessions with kids from different grades who don't know each other, far worse than what they have now.\n\nThis is all very shocking, especially since there are other school districts that are fully open and that the proposal is far worse than even the current situation. It's puzzling why would they do that; however, during discussions with other parents the following came up:\n\n\"I am in a nearby district with many teacher friends. This is what they tell me: **these terrible schedules and plans for reopening are to detour parents from wanting the reopening! It is arranged to fail, so\\-to\\-speak. The teacher unions are working against reopening (for some reason) even if some teachers want to resume classes.** I am not saying all teachers agree with the Union tactics, but many do.\nAll of these tactics are unconstitutional since education is paid for with our taxes. If parents come together and (respectfully/responsibly)  \n\ndemand the schools open, fully, the districts and unions will have to comply. There is no way around it.\"\n\nIf this is true, if some school districts, under the guidance of CTA, are indeed sabotaging re\\-opening with deliberately unworkable plans, how illegal is that?

In general, it is legal for there to be a union which represents teachers and which negotiates with school boards on behalf of the members. No law requires them to put some other party's interest ahead of the interest of the employees. Metaphorical \"sabotaging\" as you indicate is a completely legal negotiating position for an employee.\n\nIt is not true that a band of parents respectfully demanding that the schools do a thing meant that the school district must comply. The *voters* which will include some subset of parents can have some influence, in that they can force out the current board at the next election, but the voters have no power over the unions. The board has the power to set district practices; the union has the power to call a strike within certain limits, which include unfair labor practices (endangering the lives of employees).

In addition one of the four elements (4\\), (5\\), (6\\) or (7\\) must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution in a criminal trial. Elements (6\\) and (7\\) are particularly relevant to the question here.\n\nThe meaning of the words used in those elements is further defined in case law interpreting the statute in connection with the preparation of a jury instruction applying this statute to the facts presented at trial in a case (as well as lots of more general instructions on how a jury makes factual determinations). Only elements of the offense upon which some evidence has been presented by the prosecution are included in jury instructions.\n\nBut the definitions in a jury instruction which is operationally the law in any particular case doesn't get a whole lot more specific than the statutory language quoted above. Ultimately, any vagueness in that language has to be resolved unanimously by the jury (or by a judge in a trial to the court).\n\nIf these elements are established, the maximum punishment of (8\\) is authorized.\n\n### Caveat\n\nThe discretion of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence is not nearly as unfettered as it appears due to general provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code related to the exercise of sentencing discretion by a judge which incorporate by reference the federal sentencing guidelines adopted by an appointed federal government commission. These guidelines are advisory, rather than mandatory, but still have real effect. A judge has to calculated the guideline sentence, then articulate based upon judicial findings of fact any reason for deviating from the guideline sentencing range, and if this process is not followed, or if the findings of fact made aren't supported by the trial court record or don't support the conclusion reached, the sentence can be reversed for an abuse of discretion when the guideline sentence isn't followed, even if the maximum sentence authorized by this statute is not exceeded.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scenarios would most likely constitute a violation of 18 USC \u00a7 2384 (Seditious Conspiracy)?\n\nA) Two individuals discussing their dissatisfaction with the current government over coffee.\n\nB) A group of protesters peacefully demonstrating outside a government building against a new law.\n\nC) Three people planning to use force to prevent Congress from certifying election results.\n\nD) A political activist writing an op-ed criticizing government policies.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C because it most closely aligns with the elements of seditious conspiracy as defined in 18 USC \u00a7 2384.

The juries appear to have changed what Alice/DL's obligations are under the contract (e.g. because they're sympathetic to defendants Alice/DL or because the defendants have painted plaintiffs as selfish for even trying to enforce the contract, etc.) and want to give defendants better deals than they originally signed. Can they do that, and arbitrarily change the terms of the contract after the fact? If they do, what happens next (if anything)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're missing some pretty important details in describing the facts of this case.\n\nThe most important of which is: **What were the agreed terms upon which Alice obtained possession of the car prior to paying?**\n\nYour description says:\n\n> Alice takes the car and doesn't pay.\n\nIf that's literally true, then this case is both criminal theft and the tort of ***conversion*** \u2014 not breach of contract. Since the remainder of your question references a breach of contract, then I have to conclude that the fact as you stated it is not literally correct and there is some important missing detail about the terms upon which Alice was in possession of the car when she crashed it.\n\nSo, I will have to invent some scenarios that would fit two other facts you describe:\n\n1. The jury awarded Bob $5,000\\.\n2. The jury found Alice to be in breach of contract.\n\nThe following are the scenarios I can think of that would match the facts (as I understand them and speculated where important details are missing from the question).\n\n1. Maybe this is a small claims court and the damages are capped at $5,000? I never heard of a jury trial in small claims court but I guess it could be possible. Or maybe it was actually a judge and use of the term ***jury*** was careless or otherwise inaccurate?\n2. Maybe the terms under which Alice was in possession of the car when she crashed it put the parties in position where they effectively shared liability or risk of damage to the car? Like maybe Bob (or both parties) was/were required to carry insurance on the car while Alice was \"test driving\" it. I only use the term \"test driving\" as a placeholder for whatever she was doing with the car prior to paying for it which is left unclear by the question.\n3. Maybe Bob was found to have contributed to the breach of contract by something he did or didn't do. Similar to the above speculation about insurance. All this would be much easier to analyze if we knew how and under what terms Alice came to possess the car.\n4. Maybe there was only $5k of damage done to the car? Or, alternatively, the car was only found to be worth $5k and, for whatever reason (again, which we can not fully analyze given only the partial set of facts presented) the liquidated value of the car was the basis for the damage award and not the contracted price. (Consistent with @jimsug's comment.)\n5. I can easily imagine a scenario where Bob and Alice are close friends or family so the entire transaction is handled very loosely and informally and Bob let's Alice drive the vehicle while she is gathering the money to pay him.

In contract law, damages are typically based on the actual loss suffered by the non-breaching party. If the market value of the car at the time of its destruction was $5,000, this could explain why the jury awarded that amount rather than the full contract price. This aligns with the principle of putting the non-breaching party in the position they would have been in had the contract been performed, but not in a better position.

This is true in pretty much every country. You would **not** be able to reuse them lawfully without permission, unless an ***exception to copyright*** applies. If no exception applies, and you have not obtained permission, this is **copyright infringement**. In most cases copyright infringement is treated as a tort (a civil matter), not as a crime. This means that law enforcement generally will take no action and have no interest in such a situation.\n\nThe copyright owner could sue for infringement, and possibly collect money damages. In the US, statutory damages can be as high as $30,000, or up to $150,000 for \"wilful\" infringement, or as low as $750 (per work infringed). Or actual damages can be collected instead. In other countries, actual damages plus costs of suit are more likely, but the rule can be different in each country.\n\nThe possible exceptions to copyright vary significantly in different countries. In the US the major exception is **Fair use**. See [Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use?

Using content from other websites without permission, especially for commercial purposes, can indeed constitute copyright infringement. However, this is generally treated as a civil matter rather than a criminal one. The copyright owners could potentially sue for damages, but law enforcement typically doesn't get involved. There are exceptions to copyright, such as fair use in the US, which might apply in some cases, particularly for short snippets or for purposes of commentary or criticism. The legality depends on various factors and can vary by country. \n\nOption A is incorrect because crediting sources doesn't automatically make copyright infringement legal.

The authority found Google's processing of personal data for ads personalization lacked transparency, was inadequately informed to users and did not obtain valid consent. Specifically, CNIL [said](https://cnil.hosting.augure.com/Augure_CNIL/default.ashx?WCI=EmailViewer&id=acbcae1a-7f3d-4d9a-b072-01a18c6ae979)\n\n> Users are not able to fully understand the extent of the processing operations carried out by GOOGLE. But the processing operations are particularly massive and intrusive because of the number of services offered (about twenty), the amount and the nature of the data processed and combined. The restricted committee observes in particular that the purposes of processing are described in a too generic and vague manner, and so are the categories of data processed for these various purposes. Similarly, the information communicated is not clear enough so that the user can understand that the **legal basis of processing operations for the ads personalization is the consent, and not the legitimate interest of the company**.\n\nArticle 6\\.1 of the GDPR lays out the conditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful. It seems the subparagraphs most relevant to Google's processing of personal data for the purposes of ads personalization are:\n\n> 6\\.1\\.(a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;\n> \n> \n> 6\\.1\\.(b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n> \n> \n> 6\\.1\\.(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.\n\nIt seems that the satisfaction of 6\\.1\\.(b) or 6\\.1\\.(f) would preclude the need for Google to obtain consent to process personal data. The terms under which Google processes personal data for the use of ads is stated in their [Ads Data Processing Terms](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/processorterms/), with the types of personal data in scope for those terms listed [here](https://privacy.google.com/businesses/adsservices/). If a user registers to Google, personally identifying their searches, are they not also agreeing to these terms, thereby satisfying 6\\.1\\.(b)?\n\nAdditionally, I don't fully understand why it is not a legitimate interest for Google, an ads\\-serving company, to process personal data for the purpose of ads personalization?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a large question, so I'll only put a spotlight on some misconceptions.\n\nWhy can't Google use legitimate interest instead of consent to serve ads?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA data controller such as Google must choose an appropriate legal basis per Art 6(1\\). But if the legal basis is consent, and the data subject declines or retracts consent, you can't do the processing anyway under legitimate interest instead. It seems that the issue is not that consent was an inappropriate legal basis, but that they decided to use consent and did not collect it properly (see below).\n\nHowever, Google's analysis that they need consent is likely correct. There is an good argument that a website can show first\\-party ads under a legitimate interest. Google does so as well. But the consent in question is for *ad personalization*, i.e. on creating detailed profiles on users in order to show more \u201crelevant\u201d ads. For that purpose, Google's legitimate interest would likely not outweigh the data subject's rights and freedoms (compare Art 6(1\\)(f)).\n\nWhy might consent be invalid?\n-----------------------------\n\nThe GDPR defines consent in Art 4(11\\) and specifies further requirements in Art 7\\. The EDPB has issued guidelines 05/2020 and previously WP259 on consent.\n\nA core requirement, in addition to the general Art 5(1\\)(a) transparency principle, is that consent is *specific and informed*. The user must be informed about the specific purpose for which consent is being asked, and must be able to control consent individually for each purpose. Additionally, consent requires an affirmative action, consent is never the default.\n\nThe EDPB recommends a layered information approach: in the first information layer, at the point where consent is being asked, the proposed processing activities are summarized. Full details (including all information per Art 13\\) are provided in a second layer that can be reached via a link. Consent will not be informed if the data subject is required to read the entire privacy policy first.\n\nHow does the CNIL see Google's approach to consent and transparency?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CNIL asserts that Google failed at every step of a layered information design and failed to obtain valid consent:\n\n* consent controls were hidden by default, i.e. there was no first information layer\n* consent controls were pre\\-checked, thus requiring opt\\-out. That's not how you ask for consent (but might have been alright if Google had used legitimate interest instead).\n* consent is all\\-or\\-nothing and not sufficiently granular\n* Google's main information layer is its privacy policy, but it is very general and does not provide sufficiently specific information\n* Google only provides specific information spread across further documents, often 5 or 6 levels deep\n\nCould Google rely on Art 6(1\\)(b) necessity for performance of a contract?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf a data subject enters a contract about Google using their data for ads, yes. Otherwise, no. But in practice, necessity for a contract is very similar to consent because the data subject can freely decide whether or not to enter a contract.\n\nEven when the legal basis is a contract, the data controller still has an obligation to provide transparent information. Depending on the structure of the contract, a layered approach could be used as well. However, the purposes of processing are ultimately given by the contents of the contract.\n\nWhat about the Ads Data Processing Terms?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThese terms are not part of the terms of service or the privacy policy that end users agree to.

(US vs. Europe)\n\nIt is not that US and Europe mandate different approaches to NDAs or to contracts in general. The terms and scope of contracts are largely a matter of each party's purposes and the ensuing negotiations toward reaching a mutual agreement.\n\nYou might want to inquire of your counterparty whether encompassing \"future agreements\" in that clause truly serves any concrete purpose. If it does not, then keeping that boilerplate in the contract seems pointless.\n\nFurthermore, many contracts contain a clause stating that the contract at issue \"*supersedes any prior and contemporaneous agreements between the parties*\".

Article 15 of the ICCPR specifically requires that a more lenient penalty be applied if one is introduced after the offense was committed. This is stated in the third sentence of Article 15(1).\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the ICCPR does prohibit retroactive application of criminal law in terms of conviction and increased severity of sentences, it actually requires the application of more lenient penalties if introduced later.\n\nOption B is partially true but incomplete. While Article 15(2) does preserve the legitimacy of trials for crimes \"according to the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations\" (which includes war crimes), this is not the only case where retroactive application is addressed.\n\nOption D is incorrect because not all countries have adopted Article 15 without reservations.

The hat definitely keeps the heat off my neck and shoulders. This year the heat is worse with 40\\+ degrees Celsius.\n\nAre companies allowed to insist on their dress code in extreme weather conditions or can an employee make reasonable adjustments for basic comfort and safety?\n\nI would like to know the laws according to both Canada and the USA.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I limit my answer to U.S. law.\n\n**The Right To Quit And Its Impact On Unemployment Benefits**\n\nFirst, absent narrow exceptions (e.g. soldiers), any employee can quit at any time, from work with a bad employer.\n\nNormally quitting forfeits a right to unemployment insurance payments, but if the employee can convince the unemployment eligibility hearing office that the conditions the employer established were so bad that there was a \"constructive discharge\" the employee will be treated as having been fired for purposes of unemployment insurance.\n\nThe employee can't get an advisory opinion on constructive discharge, however. The employee must act first and argue that there was a constructive discharge afterwards at risk of not getting any unemployment benefits if the employee loses.\n\n**Occupational Safety and Health Laws**\n\nSecond, the employer is obligated to follow workplace safety law. Outside the mining industry (which does not include oil and gas work), workplace safety regulations are primarily promulgated by OSHA (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) which is a subdivision of the federal department of Labor. Many states have a parallel state agency. (The mining industry is governed by MHSA a parallel and much more powerful body.)\n\nViolating workplace safety rules established by OSHA can result in the employer being fined and being required to correct the situation going forward, although the amounts of the fine even taken together with worker's compensation packages, are often far less than the amount of liability that the employer would have in a third\\-party negligence lawsuit. The government and not the employee receives the fine paid if one is imposed.\n\nAlso, OSHA is vastly understaffed and routinely ignores worker complaints out of sheer lack of manpower, since it is responsible for all safety issues for 98%\\+ of all employees in the entire United States.\n\nOSHA has protocols related to requirements for employees working in extreme heat that are discussed [here](https://www.osha.gov/heat/heat-index). In particular, OSHA states that:\n\n> Washington, Minnesota, and California have specific laws governing\n> occupational heat exposure. Federal OSHA has a General Duty Clause\n> (Section 5[a](https://www.osha.gov/heat/heat-index) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970\\)\n> that requires employers to provide a place of employment that is \u201cfree\n> from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death\n> or serious physical harm to employees.\u201d The OSHA Technical Manual\n> Chapter on Heat Stress establishes that OSHA uses WBGT to determine if\n> a heat hazard was present.\n\nThus, outside those three states, rather than having detailed requirements in a regulation, OSHA has general suggestions and provides a framework for evaluating heat related safety and occupational illness issues that gets evaluated on a case by case basis if OSHA asserts that an employer has violated these general safety requirements, which will be resolved in a hearing, if necessary, if a citation issued by OSHA on this basis is issued by OSHA and disputed by the employer.\n\n**Worker's Compensation**\n\nThird, the employer has liability without regard to fault for all work related injuries, illness and deaths under worker's compensation law. The employer has liability even if the employer didn't violate any OSHA regulations or standards.\n\nBut, the recovery allowed is much more meager than it would be between strangers suing each other for negligence. It is largely limited to lost wages, medical expenses, and funeral expenses, although if a deceased worker has dependents, their dependent survivors are also entitled to worker's compensation lost income benefits.\n\nThe existence of worker's compensation coverage, however, bars an employee from bringing a lawsuit other than a worker's compensation claim against the employer, however.\n\n**Collective Bargaining Rights Of Unionized Workers**\n\nFourth, in a unionized workplace, the union could raise a grievance with the employer under the collective bargaining agreement governing the workplace which will universally require the employer to follow safety rules.\n\nIf there is a dispute, these disputes are typically referred to an arbitrator in union\\-management arbitration. The arbitrator has considerable freedom to fashion remedies if the arbitrator feels that the safety rules were not followed. Neither side can appeal the arbitrator's ruling.\n\nIf the employer does not follow an order from an arbitrator, this is converted to a court order at an ordinary court with jurisdiction over the employer and the court will make the arbitrator's order a court order which may be enforced under pain of contempt of court sanctions (including incarceration or punitive fines).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee is working in extreme heat conditions (40+ degrees Celsius) and their employer refuses to allow any modifications to the dress code for comfort and safety. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the employee's options and rights under U.S. law?\n\nA) The employee can file a complaint with OSHA, who will immediately fine the employer and force them to change their dress code policy.\n\nB) The employee can quit their job and will automatically qualify for unemployment benefits due to the unsafe working conditions.\n\nC) The employee has no recourse and must continue working under the current conditions as long as they want to keep their job.\n\nD) The employee can quit and potentially argue for \"constructive discharge\" to receive unemployment benefits, but this is not guaranteed and comes with risks.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate. While an employee always has the right to quit, doing so typically forfeits unemployment benefits. However, in cases of extreme working conditions, the employee can argue for \"constructive discharge,\" which if successful, would allow them to receive unemployment benefits as if they had been fired. This is not guaranteed and comes with the risk of potentially receiving no benefits if the argument is unsuccessful.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while OSHA does have protocols for extreme heat, they are often understaffed and may not respond immediately. Additionally, fines are not guaranteed and any changes to policy would likely take time.\n\nOption B is incorrect because quitting does not automatically qualify an employee for unemployment benefits. The \"constructive discharge\" argument must be made and accepted.\n\nOption C is incorrect because employees do have options and rights, including the ability to quit or file complaints with OSHA, even if these actions come with certain risks or limitations."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44663/are-there-successful-ways-of-getting-out-of-a-reverse-mortgage", "docs_id": 44663, "title": "Are there successful ways of getting out of a reverse mortgage?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My father in\\-law took out a reverse mortgage several years ago.

John's children recently discovered the existence of the reverse mortgage and are concerned about Mary's living situation. What is the most likely outcome in this scenario?\n\nA) The reverse mortgage will be automatically voided due to John's death, allowing Mary to retain full ownership of the house.\nB) Mary can continue living in the house indefinitely without any obligation to repay the reverse mortgage.\nC) Mary may be able to stay in the house, but the loan will need to be repaid when she moves out, sells the house, or passes away.\nD) John's children can easily contest the reverse mortgage and have it cancelled if they suspect John was coerced into the agreement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the case of a reverse mortgage where one spouse is a non-borrowing spouse (as Mary is in this scenario), recent rule changes by HUD have provided some protections. Mary may be able to continue living in the house as long as she meets certain criteria (such as paying property taxes and insurance). However, the loan will still need to be repaid when she no longer uses the home as her principal residence, sells the house, or passes away.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because reverse mortgages are not automatically voided upon the borrower's death. Answer B is incorrect because while Mary may be able to stay in the house, the loan will eventually need to be repaid. Answer D is incorrect because contesting a reverse mortgage is typically very difficult unless there is clear evidence of fraud, coercion, or mental incompetence at the time the loan was taken out, which is not indicated in this scenario."}}
