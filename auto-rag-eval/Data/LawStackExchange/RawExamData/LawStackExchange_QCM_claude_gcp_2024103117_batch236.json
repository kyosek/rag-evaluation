The statute defines a \"confidential communication\" as follows:\n\n> The term \u201cconfidential communication\u201d includes any communication carried on in circumstances as may reasonably indicate that any party to the communication desires it to be confined to the parties thereto, but **excludes a communication made** in a public gathering or in any legislative, judicial, executive or administrative proceeding open to the public, or in any other circumstance **in which the parties to the communication may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.**\n\nOnce AT\\&T, or anyone else for that matter, states that the communication is being recorded, it is no longer considered a confidential communication requiring the consent of all parties in order for any party to record it.\n\nPart of the California Civil Jury Instructions for this code requires that the plaintiff must prove, among other things, that the plaintiff had a \"reasonable expectation that the conversation was not being overheard or recorded.\"\n\nYou can see the full jury instructions here: [https://www.justia.com/trials\\-litigation/docs/caci/1800/1809\\.html](https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1800/1809.html)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In California, you're on a phone call with a customer service representative from a company.

This means the requirement for all-party consent no longer applies. The definition of \"confidential communication\" excludes circumstances where parties may reasonably expect that the communication may be overheard or recorded.

Additionally, it is entirely possible to not have earphones covering you ear and still perfectly hear the sound from the device due to it's general proximity to the ear drum.\n\nThe reason for this ban is because there are several audio cues that are required for safely driving a vehicle.

Using a single earphone is allowed.\nC) This is the correct answer and a violation of the law. The phrase \"resting on\" in the statute covers this scenario, even if the earphones are not inserted into or completely covering the ears.\nD) Bone conduction headphones typically don't cover, rest on, or insert into the ears, so this would likely be permissible under the law.\n\nThe key point is that the law aims to ensure drivers can hear important audio cues for safety, such as sirens, horns, or warning sounds from other vehicles.

In a \"no fault\" insurance regime, such as [the one in place in Utah](http://www.all-about-car-accidents.com/resources/insurance-law/car-insurance/utah-auto-insurance-law), minor car accidents are covered by the insurance company of the person who suffers the damage, and not by the person who is at fault in the accident.\n\nUtah's \"No\\-Fault\" Insurance System\n\n> Utah is a \"no\\-fault\" car insurance state. This means that when a car\n>  accident occurs, the people injured in the crash turn to their own\n>  insurance coverage first (and sometimes exclusively), filing what is\n>  known as a \"first\\-party\" claim. This insurance is required to pay at\n>  least $3,000 in Personal Injury Protection (PIP) benefits, regardless\n>  of who was at fault for the accident. For minor accidents, that may be\n>  the extent of the process \\-\\- an injured person receiving a settlement\n>  from their own car insurance carrier. Because Utah is a no\\-fault\n>  state, its laws limit the situations in which people injured in car\n>  accidents can step outside the no\\-fault rules and file a liability\n>  claim or lawsuit seeking compensation from others who may have caused\n>  the accident. Before filing a lawsuit after a car accident in Utah, an\n>  injured person must first have incurred $3,000 in medical expenses\n>  stemming from the accident, or must have suffered certain kinds of\n>  serious injuries as a result of the accident. In Utah, the kinds of\n>  injuries that qualify under this \"injury threshold\" are:\n>  \\- permament disability\n>  \\- permanent impairment\n>  \\- permanent disfigurement, or\n>  \\- dismemberment\n\nWithout knowing more details about the damages suffered and the terms of the respective policies, it is hard to determine if your claim is or is not beyond the threshold where private lawsuits are allowed. It could be that property damage is not covered by \"no fault\" at all, or that it could be covered by \"no fault\" but that you have waived that coverage.\n\nIf this is a case where private lawsuits are allowed, someone who is injured would hire a private personal injury lawyer, unaffiliated with their insurance company, to sue the person at fault in the accident to recover the damages not covered by your no fault coverage due to the other driver's fault. This would not be the responsibility of your insurance company, unless you have uninsured motorist coverage and the other driver was uninsured, which does not seem to be the case.\n\nIn non\\-no fault states and in cases in a no fault state where a lawsuit is allowed, your insurance company (after paying any PIP benefits) would not be involved and cannot help you sue the other driver. If you sue the other driver, the other driver's insurance company will hire a lawyer to defend him and would have authority to settle the case up to the policy limits of the other driver's insurance policy.\n\nThe insurance company has a duty to affirmatively help you obtain the rights you are entitled to under your policy and if they fail to do so this is called a \"bad faith breach of insurance contract\".

Brand Protection: It protects the overall brand name, which will be used across multiple products in the line.\n2. Flexibility: It allows the company to easily add new products under the \"BrightWave\" brand without needing separate trademarks for each.\n3. Broader Coverage: A trademark for \"BrightWave\" would likely provide protection for use of that term in conjunction with various products in the relevant industry.\n4. Cost-Effective: It's more economical to maintain one strong trademark than multiple product-specific ones.\n5. Future-Proofing: It accommodates the company's plans for expansion within the product line.\n\nOption B is less ideal because individual product names might be too generic or descriptive to trademark separately.

Since it is an infringement to falsely claim or imply an endorsement or affiliation, such that the quality and good will associated with the trademark or its owner is attributed to the product being described, such a disclaimer makes it clear that no such claim is being made.

The response given is the standard response to any allegation of law. Allegations number 1, 2, and 9\\-14 are all allegations of law. The only factual allegations are allegations 3\\-7 (with allegation 8 merely unnecessarily reincorporating the previous allegations by reference).\n\nFurthermore, a bare denial of an itemized allegation of fact is sufficient, without further explanation.\n\n> Does the government limit its defenses to the jurisdictional issue,\n> and to the failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted\n> by not following the rule requires defendants state in short and plain\n> terms its defenses to each claim asserted against?\n\nThe requirement of the rule is to set forth affirmative defenses in the section entitled defenses, but denials of fact sufficient to defeat the elements of the claim for relief sought also suffice.\n\nIf further affirmative defenses are discovered in the course of the litigation, the answer can be amended and leave to do so is granted liberally.\n\nIn this case, the government is basically saying, \"So what?

It is trying to establish new law that is not present in prior precedents.\n\nAlso, in modern civil litigation, the main means of getting factual information is though disclosures and discovery required later in the litigation process. The notion that the answer to the complaint should be a significant source of substantive disclosure of facts was largely abandoned in connection with the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in the 1930s.\n\nThe denial of jurisdiction is primarily on the basis of lack of standing (since lack of standing is one form of lack of subject matter jurisdiction). It has not alleged that is has members who suffered an injury to a legally protected right, or that the entity itself suffered an injury to a legally protected right.\n\nIt is likely that the complaint will be dismissed summarily in early motion practice, probably for lack of standing.

In case this is important I live in England to this is a case of UK law\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A number of commercial cartoonists operate in the US, so you might be sued in US courts (with judgment enforced by your courts), regardless of where you live. Basically, you have to comply with *everbody's* copyright law, when you operate a web page, unless there's an issue with a strange law in a country that has no legal reach into the UK (no treaty governing enforcement of foreign judgments).\n\nIf you knowingly and willfully allow others to post protected material, you can be sued and found liable for major damages. If you unwittingly allow others to post protected material, you can be sued and found liable for lesser damages, unless you've protected yourself by following DMCA safe harbor rules. The gist of those rules is that you have to make it easy for rights\\-holders to contact you and request removal of infringing material. If you do this in the right way (expeditiously; following a certain protocol for notice and counter\\-notice), you will not be liable. There are particular requirements on the takedown notice and so on: pushing the matter off onto the uploader will not work. Rather, *you* must respond to takedown requets. (From a practical POV, putting contributor's email addresses out there in the open is also going to seriously restrict the number of contributors you will get).\n\nYour website presumably operates under someone else's domain, hardware and so on, and that business might be sued as well, for letting you let someone infringe copyright. Undoubtedly they will have included some statement about copyright infringement in their terms of service with you, and they can sue you if you don't do that. It is extremely unlikely that you could hide from a person whose copyright you have infringed (the service provider will comply with requests for information, assuming privacy laws are followed in doing so), so assume that a cease and desist letter can and will be delivered to you, even if *you* don't provide any contact information.\n\nThere is no equivalent safe\\-harbour law in the UK. This may put some burden on the rights\\-holder, that they may have to give you \"actual knowledge\" of infringement (it would not be hard for a rights holder to provide evidence of their rights). \n\nA TOS clause whereby users must vow that they have a right to upload the material does not remove your liability. You could include an indemnification clause requiring an infringer to cover your costs created by his actions, but then you would have to locate and sue the infringer to actually cover those costs. Since the work is being used for profit, you would also be liable for those lost revenues, even if you had paid out a share to the uploader.\n\nSince there is no definitive database where one can determine who holds the rights to a work, it can be difficult to protect oneself against infringers who upload to your website. The risk can be reduced by making it easy for rights\\-holders to notify you of infringements, and by responding rapidly to such notices. However, it is not automatically safe to take down any alleged infringing materials, because that may infringe on the contractual rights of your contributors, especially since the user provides you something of value in exchange for something that they value (money, in particular). If you just take down somebody's cartoon, you may be liable for lost revenues and even copyright violation. If the uploader had in fact infringed somebody else's copyright, they could not sue you for taking down \"their\" cartoon: but you don't know if they actually have the rights. To prevent yourself from getting sued by contributors, your TOS would need to include language reserving the right to take down a contribution (this is where you would need to hire an attorney to craft the TOS).\n\nDMCA not only protects a service provider against liability for infringement, it also protects them against customers who want to sue for taking down their material. [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Notice_from_copyright_owner) gives an overview of this aspect of DMCA law, and redundantly building such provisions into your TOS is not legally harmful.

Sect 119 continues:\n\n> (2\\)A person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of\n>  attorney without actual knowledge that the signature is not genuine\n>  may rely upon the presumption under section 105 of this act that the\n>  signature is genuine.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) A person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of\n>  attorney without actual knowledge that the power of attorney is void,\n>  invalid, or terminated, that the purported agent's authority is void,\n>  invalid, or terminated, or that the agent is exceeding or improperly\n>  exercising the agent's authority may rely upon the power of attorney\n>  as if the power of attorney were genuine, valid and still in effect,\n>  the agent's authority were genuine, valid and still in effect, and the\n>  agent had not exceeded and had properly exercised the authority.\n\nA prudent person would not hand over your stuff to a stranger or someone claiming to have power of attorney, unless they were sure that the person with a POA form actually had a legitimate POA form. They would be liable for damages if they gave away your stuff to an unauthorized person. An acknowledged POA is better than a POA with two neighbors as witnesses, because the acknowledged POA further establishes that the signature is valid.\n\nSection 120 also requires acceptance of an acknowledged POA within 7 days (whereas with neighbor signatures, further investigation may be called for, meaning delays).\n\nThe existing statute is [here](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=11.94&full=true), which is the law at the moment. There is no mention of a notary requirement, and no witness signature requirement (that changes). Section 40(1\\) says that \"Any person acting without negligence and in good faith in reasonable reliance on a power of attorney shall not incur any liability\" \u2013 now, is it negligence to accept a signature (of a principle) without investigating its validity? I really don't know. If you follow the new rules and get it notarized, that is covered. RCW 11\\.94\\.010 addresses the \"what type\" question, that is, whether the POA remains valid if you are incapacitated, or becomes effective once you are incapacitated. The point is that you have to say what they can do, and when they can.

This is also true in most other kinds of lawsuits.\n\n> if I cannot beat this challenge, can I remove myself as beneficiary\n> and have the Probate court declare that all 5 blood\\-related\n> grandchildren will get equal shares?\n\nRemoving yourself as a beneficiary is called filing a \"disclaimer\" in legalese. It means to refuse to accept a gift or inheritance. But you can't do that if you have already received any personal benefit from the estate and there are other statutory restrictions. For tax purposes, the deadline to do is nine months after the date of death, but the state law deadline could be different.\n\nWhat would happen if you do so depends upon the language of the will. Usually, gifts to a group of people are made \"per stirpes\" (also called \"by representation\") which means that if a child predeceases or makes a timely disclaimer that their children share in the share that their parent would have received only. It is possible that it says something different, but that would be by far the most common provision.\n\n> Under the original Probate interpretation, when the real\\-estate sold,\n> I invested the proceeds in the stock market and there have been\n> losses.

One set punishes sexual assaults involving sexual penetration that has greater penalties. The other set punishes sexual assaults involving sexual contact without sexual penetration that has smaller penalties but otherwise the same elements of the offense.\n\nUsually, almost every offense which is a crime when it involves sexual penetration is also a crime when it involves sexual contact but not sexual penetration, with the fairly frequent exception of statutory rape offenses that cover an adolescent victim who is below the age of consent but post\\-pubescent (with the statute itself setting specific age thresholds that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction).\n\nOften, even when statutory rape of an adolescent (i.e. sex with consent by an adolescent under the age of consent) itself is a relatively minor crime, often a misdemeanor, and is rarely prosecuted to the full extent of the law, child prostitution or attempted child prostitution with the same victim is often a very serious offense, and child pornography offenses often also carry serious penalties when the \"child\" is under the age of eighteen, even when the sexual act filmed or photographed itself is of people who are above the age of consent and are legally having consensual sex.\n\nIn many states, sex with someone in a position of authority over the victim is a crime without regard to consent, much like a statutory rape offense, but without regard to age. In some states there would be a parallel sexual contact offense, and in some states there would not be one.\n\nThe name of the offenses varies considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Sometimes they are different degrees of the same offense, sometimes they are offenses with different names, and the names used varies quite a bit.\n\nAlso, even when an arguable sexual contact offense is not a sex offense, it would almost always be some form of non\\-sexual criminal assault offense.\n\nFor example, [Colorado](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2018-title-18.pdf) has sexual assault related crimes called **sexual assault** at Colo.

An unaggravated sexual contact without consent offense may be punishable by up to six to twelve months in jail or a long period of probation. The offenses are too varied by jurisdiction and crime details to summarize easily. Aggravated rape is a death penalty offense in U.S. military justice although the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the imposition of the death penalty (at least in cases where the victim is not a child) is unconstitutional. Some states declare in their statutes that the aggravated rape of a child is a death penalty offense although the constitutionality of those statutes has not been tested in court and no one has been executed for such an offense since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s in the U.S.\n\nMost sex offenses in the U.S. of all types, including both sexual contact offenses, sexual penetration offenses, and even offenses involving no contact at all, such being a peeping tom, also require to convicted defendant to register as a sex offender, either for a long period of time or for life, which is a quite severe and separate punishment in addition to the incarceration and/or fine and court costs and surcharges involved.\n\nIn the case of child sex offenses and some repeat rape offenders, even after a term of incarceration is fully served, the state may seek to have the offender detained indefinitely civilly to protect the public until it is determined that the offender is no longer a threat, which rarely happens in practice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding sexual assault offenses involving fully-clothed dry-humping without consent?\n\nA) It would always be classified as rape, regardless of the circumstances.\nB) It would typically fall under sexual contact offenses, which generally carry lesser penalties than penetrative sexual assaults.\nC) It would not be considered a crime unless the victim is a minor.\nD) It would only be prosecuted if the perpetrator was in a position of authority over the victim.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The information provided indicates that most states have two parallel sets of sexual assault statutes - one for offenses involving sexual penetration (with greater penalties) and another for sexual contact without penetration (with lesser penalties). Fully-clothed dry-humping without consent would typically fall under the category of sexual contact without penetration. While it's not explicitly called rape, it would still be considered a form of sexual assault or unlawful sexual contact in most jurisdictions. The offense could be aggravated if the victim is a minor or if the perpetrator is in a position of authority, but these factors are not necessary for the act to be considered criminal. The severity of the punishment would depend on the specific circumstances and the laws of the jurisdiction, but it would generally carry lesser penalties than penetrative sexual assaults."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35889/how-to-fix-a-forged-endorsement-on-a-cashier-s-check", "docs_id": 35889, "title": "How to fix a forged endorsement on a cashier\u2019s check", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the best fix for a cashier\u2019s check with a forged endorsement signature that hasn\u2019t been deposited yet?

In the latter case the burden of proving a *lack of intent* is on the accused, while in the former case I think it's not. Nevertheless, the two provisions are similar due to \"sexual intent\" being used. How is this proven and disproven?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sexual intent is proven (or disproven) like any other form of intent. A confession is not necessary, although that is one available method. It may be inferred with proof from circumstantial evidence.\n\nAny combination of direct and circumstantial evidence is allowed. There isn't a formula for it. The prosecution or defendant, as the case may be, simply has to convince the trier of fact that there was or was not sexual intent. Any otherwise admissible evidence that could rationally show that sexual intent is more or less likely can be presented.\n\nIf it happens in a gynecological appointment, or because the defendant slipped on a banana peel after the defendant's glasses were splattered with mud so he couldn't see what he was doing, this is going to be exceedingly hard to prove in the absence of a pattern and practice in multiple cases that couldn't be a coincidence, or with something like bragging to a friend in private.\n\nIf this happens at a festival celebration, or after a dinner date, or intent is corroborated by perverted photographs on the defendant's phone, or is accompanied by sexual language, any other intent is going to be highly implausible and circumstantial evidence will strongly point to a sexual intent.\n\nOne way to disprove sexual intent is for the defendant to testify that there was some other intent. There is risk in that approach. You can't simultaneously testify that sexual contact never happened and that sexual contact did happen but without sexual intent, for example. Testifying that there was sexual contact without intent basically admits some other element of the crime. But it also forces the prosecution to prove that the defendant is lying, which depending upon the evidence, may be easy, or may be hard.\n\nIn real life, most of the cases that get prosecuted are easy cases. But, there will always be cases that are closer and circumstances that one wouldn't easily foresee in advance, and that is why we have courts and trials.\n\nUltimately, the prosecution presents evidence and the finder of fact has to decide if it proved that element of its case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a case of alleged sexual harassment under the Indian Penal Code, which of the following scenarios would likely be the most challenging for the prosecution to prove sexual intent?\n\nA) The accused touched the complainant's breast during a crowded festival celebration.\nB) The accused made explicit sexual comments to the complainant after a dinner date.\nC) The accused, a gynecologist, touched the complainant's genitals during a routine medical examination.\nD) The accused was found to have multiple sexually explicit photos of the complainant on their phone.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the correct answer because it presents the most challenging scenario for proving sexual intent. In a medical context, particularly gynecological examinations, physical contact with intimate areas is expected and necessary for proper medical care. Without additional evidence suggesting misconduct, it would be difficult to prove that the doctor's actions were motivated by sexual intent rather than professional medical practice.\n\nOption A, while occurring in a crowded setting, still involves unwanted touching in a sexual area outside of any professional context, making sexual intent easier to infer.\n\nOption B involves explicit sexual language, which is strong evidence of sexual intent.\n\nOption D provides clear circumstantial evidence of sexual interest in the complainant, making it relatively easy to establish sexual intent.\n\nThe key here is understanding that proving intent often relies on context and circumstantial evidence. In a medical setting, the context provides a non-sexual explanation for the contact, making it the most challenging scenario for prosecutors to prove sexual intent beyond a reasonable doubt."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/62414/can-i-contact-this-mans-probation-officer", "docs_id": 62414, "title": "Can I contact this man&#39;s probation officer?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My parents and I live in Suffolk County, New York.\n\nIn January 2017 my father's friend began living with us.

There is a term in the standard conditions that would have protected you in this situation, but you waived it voluntarily and with understanding of what it meant.\n\nYou could in theory have a case for misrepresentation against the agent, but before even speaking to a lawyer you need to consider \n\n* If the agent is paid by the seller, he has a fiduciary duty to obtain the best price for his principal; there is no corresponding duty to you since he has no contract with you.\n* You were \"under the impression\" that the seller would only consider bids that waived this condition.

However, an important part of the agent's job is to do everything possible to persuade you to sign short of actual fraud; are you quite certain of the actual words he used? If your unsupported evidence is \"He told us so in the hotel lobby\" and the agent's evidence is \"No, I didn't\", your point is not legally proved.

It is unclear that any fines or imprisonment would actually have been brought against the man.\n\nIt turns out that The House of Commons and The House of Lords technically have the power to summon, imprison, and fine anyone. ([See point 252 on page 62 here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/79390/consultation.pdf))\n\n[An older BBC article goes over these alleged powers in greater detail](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17912253). The last time that an non member was summoned was in 1957:\n\n> *\u201dThe editor of the Sunday Express, John Junor, was brought by the Serjeant at Arms to the bar and admonished by the Speaker for publishing an article that cast doubt on the integrity of MPs over their constituency petrol allowances.\u201d*\n\nHowever, the powers of fining and imprisonment have not been exercised for 100\u2019s of years and their legitimacy today is debatable. Specifically, the European Convention of Human Rights would seem to undermine such arbitrary powers of imprisonment.\n\nThe article alleges that the last recorded cases of fines or imprisonment are as follows:\n\n> *\u201dThere is a former cell in the lower floors of the clock tower. But in practice it is only the police within the parliamentary estate who have the right to arrest anyone. The last time a non\\-MP was imprisoned was in 1880 when a man called Charles Grissell was detained.\u201d*\n> \n> \n> *\u201dThe last time MPs fined someone was in 6 February 1666 when a man called Thomas White was forced to pay the House \u00a31,000 for preventing an MP attending parliament.\u201d*\n\nSo I\u2019m summary, it is murky territory and highly unlikely that the business man in question would have faced serious fines or imprisonment for failing to comply. [This parliamentary article](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmliaisn/697/697we36.htm) nicely summarises how farcical the whole affair could have become: \n\n> *\u201dIn modern circumstances, as a televised proceeding, it would risk being a pantomime. Consider: the miscreant is brought to the Bar, accompanied by the Serjeant with the Mace, and is admonished by the Speaker in front of the House. Even assuming that the miscreant is prepared to come (and a refusal would be a further embarrassment) the proceedings are not controllable, and the House would risk looking like a lynch mob. The Speaker stands and delivers a rebuke, at a range of some thirty yards. Then what? The individual at the Bar, in prime TV time, may decide to have a go at the House and the treatment he or she has received. If the individual really does have a case, or perhaps produces some surprise piece of evidence which makes it clear that the House has got it wrong, the result could be a reputational disaster.\u201d*\n\nMonologue finished.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the current state of the UK Parliament's power to summon, fine, or imprison individuals?\n\nA) These powers are frequently exercised and widely accepted as legitimate under current UK law.\n\nB) These powers were last used in the 1950s and are still considered fully applicable today.\n\nC) These powers technically exist but have not been fully exercised in centuries and their legitimacy is questionable under modern human rights laws.\n\nD) These powers were officially abolished in 1880 after the last recorded case of parliamentary imprisonment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The question would be, is it a violation of your civil rights to prevent you from taking your baby home; is it legal for the federal government to investigate people who refuse to take a covid test? You can take the question along with pertinent evidence to a civil rights attorney.\n\nTo pick a [non\\-random hospital's web page](https://www.texashealth.org/Health-and-Wellness/Coronavirus/Common-Questions-During-Pregnancy-and-Birth), they note that \"Any person having surgery or a procedure, including birth, at a Texas Health hospital will be tested for COVID\\-19 to provide appropriate care for the patient, and for the protection of visitors and the care team\", and \"you will need to be tested at admission to help safeguard you and the care team\". In answer to the question whether you can decline testing, they say \"Testing is recommended to promote the health of you and your baby. Patients who have COVID\\-19 can have a weakened immune system and may have inflammatory symptoms that can compromise healing. We encourage you to speak with your provider about the best decision for you\", which doesn't explicitly say \"No you may not\", nor \"Yes, you may\". However, they cannot literally force you to take the test: at most, they can refuse to treat you.\n\nIn answer to the question \"Will I be separated from my baby if I test positive for COVID\\-19?\", they say \"Texas Health will follow guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of OB/GYN and the Centers for Disease Control for how to keep you and your baby safe during your hospital stay. Ultimately, any decisions about care for you and your baby will be between you and your provider, based on what is best for you both\". This is also not crystal clear.\n\nThere are three primary legal issues, putting a worst spin on their policy. They say up front that you will be tested prior to admission: the question is whether you can decline to take the test but force them to admit you. Now we are closer to the realm of a medical negligence attorney \u2013 they can refuse to treat you, but that might leave them liable.\n\nThe second question is whether they can temporarily take the infant away, against the mother's wishes (for example, hold the infant in a separate facility while the mother is in the hospital).

However, they cannot legally prevent the couple from taking their baby home without a court order.\n\nD) The couple has no legal recourse in this situation, as hospitals have complete authority over admission policies during a pandemic.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The hospital cannot physically force the woman to take a COVID-19 test, but they may have policies allowing them to refuse admission if she declines. However, the hospital does not have the authority to prevent the couple from taking their baby home after birth without proper legal procedures, which typically involve child protective services and a court order. This situation primarily involves civil rights issues rather than medical malpractice. While the hospital can set admission policies, they cannot arbitrarily keep a child from its parents without due process.

(The same contradiction also appears to exist for African Americans, who didn't have full voting rights until 1915\\.)\n\nWas it really intentional that women could be president from the beginning, but it took over 100 years for them to get the right to vote? Is there any reason why the Constitution was written this way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Prior to the 14th and 15th amendments, the US Federal Constitution and the Federal laws passed under it neither **allowed** nor **denied** anyone the right to vote. The decisions on who would and would not be allowed to vote, including for members of Congress and for President, was wholly in the hands of the sates, and were regulated by the various state constitutions and laws. A few states permitted women to vote, and at least one permitted free blacks to vote, at least for a period of its history. The Federal government had nothing to say on the matter.\n\nIn at lesat one case the US Supreme Court refused to consider such a question. That was the case of [*Luther v. Borden*, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1 (1849\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_v._Borden) which grew out of the [Dorr Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorr_Rebellion)\n\nThe state of Rhode Island, had retained its pre\\-revolutionary charter (dating from 1663\\) as its constitution, and required the ownership of a significant amount of landed property as a qualification to vote. The Wikipedia article on the rebellion (linked above) states:\n\n> By 1829, 60% of the state's free white men were ineligible to vote (women and most non\\-white men were prohibited from voting).\n\nIn 1841 a group led by Thomas Wilson Dorr held a convention to draft a new state Constitution, (known as the \"People's Constitution\"), and held ratifying votes on the draft. They declared that it had been approved by a majority of those qualified under the old laws as well as a majority of those voting and qualified under the new rules, and that it was therefore the valid constitution of the state. The old (charter) government said this was invalid and illegal. Attempts to establish the new government by force failed. However, a revised state constitution that greatly expanded voting rights was passed and took effect in 1843\\.\n\n*Luther v. Borden* was a case of trespass against members of the militia acting under the charter government, brought by a supporter of Dorr. The plaintiffs brought extensive evidence (over 150 pages) intended to establish that the Dorr or \"People's\" constitution had been validly ratified by a majority of voters, and that the old constitution had improperly restricted voting rights. The case went to the US Supreme Court, where Chief Justice Taney wrote in [the majority opinion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/48/1/):\n\n> The plaintiff contends that the charter government was displaced, and ceased to have any lawful power, after the organization, in May, 1842, of the government which he supported, and although that government never was able to exercise any authority in the State nor to command obedience to its laws or to its officers, yet he insists that it was the lawful and established government upon the ground that it was ratified by a large majority of the male people of the State of the age of twenty\\-one and upwards, and also by a majority of those who were entitled to vote for general officers under the then existing laws of the State.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The point, then, raised here has been already decided by the courts of Rhode Island. The question relates altogether to the constitution and laws of that State, and the well settled rule in this court is that the courts of the United States adopt and follow the decisions of the State courts in questions which concern merely the constitution and laws of the State.\n> \n> \n> Besides, if the Circuit Court had entered upon this inquiry, by what rule could it have determined the qualification of voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution unless there was some previous law of the State to guide it? It is the province of a court to expound the law, not to make it. And certainly **it is no part of the judicial functions of any court of the United States to prescribe the qualification of voters in a State, giving the right to those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State, or taking it away from those to whom it is given**; nor has it the right to determine what political privileges the citizens of a State are entitled to, unless there is an established constitution or law to govern its decision. {*emphasis added*}\n\nThus, until the passage and ratification of the 14th and 15th amendments, which forbid states to deny the vote based on race, national origin, and a few other grounds, the Federal Constitution had nothing to say on the point. States were required to grant the right to vote to women by the 19th amendment in 1920, and the 26th (1971\\) prohibited denial on the ground of age to anyone 18 or older. The 24th (1964\\) prohibited denial for failure to pay a poll tax or any other tax. The 14th amendment has been held to guarantee the equal weight of votes, in what was at first known as the \"one man, one vote\" rule (later \"one person, one vote\") and has been used to overturn individual and group denials of voting rights. But there **were** no federal voting rights in the years before 1865\\.\n\nI am not aware of any writings by any of the \"founding fathers\" (say the members of the Constitutional Convention) that seriously discuss the possibility of a female President. But they did consider and endorse the possibility of a person being elected president who might not be qualified to vote in some of the states. They declined to impose, or permit Congress to impose, a property, or other variable, qualification on the president, even though many of the original states had property qualifications for voters.

By stating that no disadvantage should apply to the drafter, the clause is essentially nullifying the \"contra proferentem\" doctrine for this contract.\n\nThe second part, \"no rules of strict construction will be applied against any party,\" is a clear \"no strict construction\" provision. This allows for more flexible interpretation of the contract terms, rather than adhering strictly to the literal meaning of the words.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the clause does not combine \"no strict construction\" with \"contra proferentem\" - it actually negates \"contra proferentem\" while including \"no strict construction.\"\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the clause does not reinforce \"contra proferentem\" - it contradicts it.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the clause may seem contradictory to established principles, it does have a practical effect in modifying how the contract should be interpreted.\n\nThis question tests understanding of both \"contra proferentem\" and \"no strict construction\" principles, as well as the ability to interpret complex legal language in contract clauses."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3784/illegally-crossing-hungarian-border", "docs_id": 3784, "title": "Illegally crossing Hungarian border", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently I read [this article](http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/09/16/raw-video-total-chaos-erupts-at-hungary-border-as-armed-mob-of-illegal-immigrants-clash-with-riot-police/) with the following quote:\n\n> But Hungary acted this week to stop the huge flow of people, sealing off its border with Serbia with a razor\\-wire fence and **making it a crime to enter the country illegally**.\n\nI'm wondering why it was not a crime previously to cross the borders illegally.
