Because U.S. mortgages generally can't be ported or assumed by new owners, U.S. fixed rate mortgages are paid off, on average, every ten years, even though the home owner could choose to live in the same home and keep the mortgage for thirty years. This limits, in practice, the risk that U.S. banks face when they allow customers to lock into a low thirty year fixed interest rate. (U.S. reformers tend to focus on making loans assumable and limiting the availability of prepayment penalties and wouldn't even dream of trying to establish portable mortgages.)\n\nSimilarly, while U.K. law does not require pre\\-payment penalties, the economic bargain involved in a U.K. mortgage has banks relying on people not pre\\-paying their loans or paying pre\\-payment penalties in order to establish the creditworthiness of the bank to regulators and third parties.\n\nSo, while it might be possible in theory to allow an assignable version of a U.S. mortgage which is tied to the property and not the person, in the U.K., one would have to simultaneously change other aspects of the transaction and the way that banks estimate their cash flow to meet their own obligations, for this change to work, something that would probably require regulatory cooperation to work in practice.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK mortgage system, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the portability of mortgages and the factors influencing this practice?\n\nA) UK mortgage portability is primarily mandated by strict government regulations, with banks having little say in the matter.\n\nB) The portability of UK mortgages is mainly a result of banking custom and practice, influenced by economic decisions made by banks, rather than being strictly mandated by regulators.\n\nC) UK mortgages are always portable, and this feature is legally required for all mortgage products offered in the country.\n\nD) The UK mortgage system is identical to the US system, where mortgages must always be paid off when a property is sold.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The information provided indicates that the portability of UK mortgages is primarily a result of banking custom and practice, based on economic decisions made by banks, rather than being strictly mandated by regulators in all cases. While there are regulatory safe harbors and institutional arrangements that influence these practices, the fundamental nature of mortgage portability is rooted in banking traditions and economic considerations. Options A and C are incorrect because they overstate the role of regulations and the universality of portability.

Many, if not all, large projects licensed under the GPL do this.\n\nThe other way of complying is to simply give anyone else who has a copy of the binaries, or who makes use of them, a copy of the source code. In your case, all you need to do is send your friends a copy of the source. As long as no one else uses this project, I think you satisfy the requirements of the license.\n\nYou must, however, also license your code under the GPL. This means, as mentioned in the comments, that you must somehow make your friends aware that if they redistribute your code, they must also do so under the terms of the GPL. This can be as simple as including a file called `LICENSE` in the root directory of the source code, containing a copy of the text of the GPL.\n\nThis further means that your friends will be able to share your code with other people without letting you know. You could politely ask them not to, but you can't stop them.\n\n(That said, you have no reason to be worried \\- only big breaches of license misuse by large companies ever tend to get chased up.

However, you are not required to make it publicly available if it's only distributed to a limited group. The developer must provide the source code to the two friends and license the entire project under GPL, not just parts interacting with the library.

There are exceptions to this rule, that don't obviously apply in the circumstances describe by the original post, but the mere fact that the issuer is not organized or based in the U.S. does not mean that it is exempt from the '33 Act.\n\nOn the other hand, if the non\\-accredited investors of the foreign issuer were all non\\-U.S. persons, there would be no securities fraud violations under U.S. law or the law of any U.S. state when the securities were issued.\n\n> what happens if the aforementioned offshore company re\\-domiciliates to\n>  U.S., specifically Delaware?

And, re\\-incorporation of the foreign issuer in Delaware might very well bring the company's previous '33 Act violations, if any, to the attention of the SEC even if the SEC had not previously been aware of those violations.\n\nBut, upon relocation to Delaware, the formerly foreign issuer would, going forward, be subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\\.

The sale of securities by a foreign company to non-accredited U.S. investors without SEC registration likely violated the Securities Act of 1933, even though the company was foreign at the time. Re-domiciling to Delaware does not constitute a new offering or retroactively change the legality of previous sales. However, becoming a U.S. company may bring these potential violations to the SEC's attention.

Sarah clearly owns the copyright to the lyrics she wrote. However, the ownership of the music is less straightforward. While Sarah created the basic melody, Tom's contribution in arranging and adding instrumentation is significant. Without a clear contract specifying copyright transfer, Tom's work as an independent contractor would typically result in him retaining some rights to his contribution. This creates a potential joint work situation for the musical component. The correct answer, D, accurately reflects this ambiguity and the possibility that negotiation may be required for distribution and royalty splitting.

(copyright? theft?)\n\nFurthermore, say said person contributed vastly more than the others, will his claim be justified / more justifiable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One possibility is that the person submitting the thesis can have their degree revoked. This is not strictly a legal matter, rather it is a matter between the student and their university, where the university can, after a process, revoke the degree. The grounds would be a violation of university rules pertaining to requirements for the degree, specifically the part where the student must submit a thesis representing \"independent research\". The exact wording of the requirement is obviously institution\\-dependent, and of course no university requires completely autonomous and isolated research and writing in the production of a thesis. It would be rather off\\-topic though fascinating to collects anecdotes on variation between institutions on what degree of collaboration is deemed acceptable. From the legal perspective, the student whose degree is revoked could attempt to sue the university for the revocation, since the student has a property interest in the degree, but generally university proceedings are held by the courts to be valid.\n\nAnother way to \"claim\" a work as your own is with respect to copyright. In that case, though, there has to be more than vague collaboration, there has to be actual co\\-authorship. The basic legal idea is that when multiple authors write a work, they jointly own the work (the work is called a \"joint work\"). The basic definition of a joint work under 17 USC 101 is \"a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\". Sharing of ideas or lab results doesn't make something a joint work, there has to be actual co\\-writing.\n\nThe US Copyright Office interprets that as meaning that authors have equal rights to the work (an undivided ownership share): in other words, any author can grant permission to publish, and a copyright license of transfer of rights does not have to be agreed on by both authors. However, profits are to be shared equally among the authors, in the same way that joint partners in a business venture share the profits of their business. This is so even if one author writes 90% of the work and the other one writes 10%.\n\nThis can then lead to a legal problem between the publisher and the non\\-signatory author. Typically, when a work is published, the publisher obtains from the contributor either a license to reproduce, or else a transfer of copyright, which allows the publisher to reproduce the work. Such agreements typically contain a clause where the contributor warrants that they have the right to transfer / license and that they are the sole author, or else the co\\-authors have been identified in the agreement (in which case the publisher pursues each author to get a signature on an agreement form). And there is almost surely an indemnification clause, saying that the contributor will indemnify the publisher against any infringement claims. Which is another way of saying, if it turns out that the contributor does not have the right to fully assign copyright to the work and the publisher gets sued, the contributor must cover the publisher's legal costs and possible losses from a judgment. As a co\\-author, you cannot grant an exclusive license (as some publishers will require).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A graduate student, Alice, submits a thesis that is primarily her work but includes significant contributions from her lab partner, Bob.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The university's decision to revoke Alice's degree is likely to be overturned by the court because Alice contributed the majority of the work.\n\nB) Alice's lawsuit against the university is likely to succeed because she has a protected property interest in her degree that cannot be revoked under any circumstances.\n\nC) The university's decision to revoke Alice's degree is likely to be upheld by the court, as universities generally have the authority to enforce their academic integrity policies.\n\nD) Alice cannot be held accountable for her actions because the thesis was not officially published, and therefore copyright laws do not apply.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Courts generally respect universities' internal processes and decisions regarding academic integrity, including the revocation of degrees for violations such as misrepresenting collaborative work as individual effort. While Alice does have a property interest in her degree, this doesn't prevent the university from revoking it if their policies were violated. The fact that Alice contributed more to the thesis doesn't justify claiming it as solely her own work. Additionally, copyright laws and publication status are not directly relevant to the university's authority to revoke a degree based on its own policies."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72677/how-many-people-can-legally-contest-a-given-mandate-at-the-same-time-in-the-unit", "docs_id": 72677, "title": "How many people can legally contest a given mandate at the same time in the United States?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How many people can legally contest a given mandate at the same time in the United States?

There is [a law](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/chapter.aspx?id=39159), the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (KRS 383\\.500 to 383\\.705\\) which states limits on residential leases (otherwise, the matter would be governed by the terms of the contract and common law). The state didn't enact those laws as enforceable in the state, it \"made them available\" for cities, counties and urban\\-county governments to adopt unmodified (or not). So it depends in part on whether your locale adopted the law. Assuming it did, in the [definitions](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=35726), \n\n> (13\\)\"Security deposit\" means an escrow payment made to the landlord\n>  under the rental agreement for the purpose of securing the \n>  landlord against financial loss due to damage to the premises \n>  occasioned by the tenant's occupancy **other than ordinary wear\n>  and tear**.\n\n(emphasis added)\nThat would mean that they can't take the cost of carpet cleaning, painting etc. out of your security deposit.\n\n[\u00a7383\\.595](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=35736) (again, if applicable) states the obligations of the landlord, so he must\n\n> Maintain in good and safe working order and condition \n>  all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, \n>  air\\-conditioning, and other facilities and appliances, including \n>  elevators, supplied or required to be supplied by him\n\nSo it depends on whether the URLTA was enacted in your jurisdiction. [This page](http://kyjustice.org/node/708) indicates where that is the law, and also urges you to read the lease.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in Kentucky is facing a dispute with their property manager over responsibility for maintenance costs under $200. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The property manager's interpretation is always correct, as the lease agreement supersedes all state and local laws.\n\nB) The tenant is universally protected by Kentucky state law from being responsible for any maintenance costs under $200.\n\nC) The legal situation depends on whether the local jurisdiction has adopted the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA).\n\nD) The tenant is always responsible for maintenance costs under $200 as long as it's stated in the lease agreement, regardless of local laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because in Kentucky, the applicability of the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA) varies by location. The state has made the URLTA available for cities, counties, and urban-county governments to adopt, but it's not universally enforced across the state. If the local jurisdiction has adopted the URLTA, it would provide specific protections for tenants, including landlord obligations for maintaining electrical systems and limitations on what can be deducted from security deposits. The lease terms must be interpreted in light of these local laws, if applicable. Therefore, the legal situation indeed depends on whether the local jurisdiction has adopted the URLTA, making answer C the most accurate statement among the options provided."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30842/undertakings-have-expired-am-i-allowed-to-do-whatever-i-want", "docs_id": 30842, "title": "Undertakings have expired - am I allowed to do whatever I want?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Previously I\u2019ve asked question about undertakings \n\\- [Non\\-molestation \\- undertakings \\- Legal Aid \\- is it possible to appeal?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30652/non-molestation-undertakings-legal-aid-is-it-possible-to-appeal) \\- whether there is a way to dispute them.\n\n*(what I did not realize at the time, it could have been a plot to obtain Legal Aid)*\n\nBack then agreed to not publish on social media. \n\nThese undertakings have now expired.\n\n### (potentially native) understanding:\n\n1.

If I get them to sign a contract agreeing that all material they provide me, they own the copyright for, and they agree to indemnify me, are these two things enough to protect me if someone makes a claim that I posted copyrighted material? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright Primer\n----------------\n\nIf **you** make a copy (or a derivative work like a Photoshopped photo) of a copyrighted work without the commercial copyright owner's permission then **you** are *prima facie* guilty of copyright infringement. Further, if you do not give attribution to or deal in a derogatory way with the holder of any moral copyright, you are breaching their rights as well. The commercial and moral copyright holder(s) may or may not be the same people.\n\nIf you are alleged to have infringed copyright you may be able to avail yourself of a fair dealing/use defense, however, in the circumstances you describe this is unlikely to be successful. Basically, what you are describing is **not** fair dealing/use.\n\nIt is unlikely that what you are proposing would be considered *criminal* infringement so you would not be subject to criminal sanctions like gaol time or fines.\n\nYou are open to being sued by the copyright (commercial and/or moral) holder. If you can prove innocent infringement (i.e. that you made all reasonable efforts to determine who the copyright holders are and sought their permission) then your damages are limited to an accounting of profits (i.e. you have to pay them the profit you made by breaching their copyright).\n\nIn the contract with your client you can require them to provide you with an indemnity against defense costs and damages: this means you can sue them if you get sued. Of course, if they have no money this doesn't really help. You can also take out insurance against this, however, their liability will be excluded if you breach the terms of your insurance contract.\n\nWhat you need to do\n-------------------\n\n1. Find the copyright owner. For photos, the commercial copyright holder is usually the photographer or the photographer's employer: **it is not the subject of the photograph!** For text, the commercial copyright holder is usually the author or their employer. The moral copyright is usually held by the photographer/author unless they have assigned their right to someone else.\n2. Get and document their permission and publish in accordance with the permission given (including attribution etc.).\n3. If you cannot determine the copyright owner, you may be able to determine if the works are public domain. In general, anything created before the 20th century is public domain: things more recent than that are harder to be definitive about. Some author's such as the US government (but most other governments *do* claim copyright) specifically renounce copyright \\- all their works are public domain.\n4.

The best approach is C, which involves actively verifying the copyright status of all materials and obtaining necessary permissions. This aligns with the advice in the document to \"Find the copyright owner\" and \"Get and document their permission.\" \n\nOption B is risky because the client may not actually own or have rights to use the materials they provide. Option D is overly restrictive and impractical for creating a modern Facebook page.

If Alex's intent was to deceive or misrepresent the involvement of the other founders, this could be considered fraud.

Option A is incorrect because being a director doesn't grant the right to forge signatures.

They can enforce those terms, or change them (in some appropriate manner). **You have no recourse if they remove you, block you, or delete your account, for example**. That's the measure that you would probably have, virtually every time.\n2. **To claim damages, or litigate beyond just website access control**, requires a legal claim. But there's a catch there. To claim damages, **they need to show *actual damage*, which they wish to be compensated for**. If you misused their website but no actual harm can be shown, the total damage claimable is zero, whether or not you followed their rules. Merely entering dishonest information isn't by itself harm. So they would have to show they suffered damage/harm because of that, which is directly attributable to your behaviour, was foreseeably harmful etc, or similar. They also need to consider legal costs, and ability to enforce, especially if you are in a different country.\n3. **If for some reason the computer use was also illegal**, then a criminal act could be committed and they could notify law enforcement. For example suppose you did this in the little known country of Honestania, where the law says that to prevent trolling and online abuse, anything posted on social media under any but your own legal name is a crime. Or suppose you'd been banned from the system and ignoring/evading such a ban was criminal computer use or criminal trespass due to the forbidden/unauthorised access (which can happen in several places).

SocialNet can enforce its terms of service by banning John's account or restricting his access.\n2. To pursue legal action beyond account control, SocialNet would need to prove actual damages resulting from John's false information, which is unlikely in this scenario.\n3.

While John violated the terms of service, this alone doesn't necessarily constitute a criminal offense, especially without evidence of harm or intent to defraud.\n\nOption A is incorrect because SocialNet can't sue for damages without proving actual harm. Option B is incorrect as providing false information to a website, while against terms of service, is not inherently a criminal offense.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) John can bequeath the land to his son, and his son's claim will automatically defeat the interest of the legal owner's heir.\n\nB) John cannot bequeath the land because adverse possession claims cannot be transferred through inheritance.\n\nC) John can include the land in his will, but his son's claim will be subject to the same adverse possession requirements and may not defeat the legal owner's heir's interest.\n\nD) John's adverse possession claim is immediately invalidated if he attempts to bequeath the land, reverting all rights to the legal owner.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In Australian property law, adverse possession claims can potentially be inherited, but they do not automatically transfer full ownership rights. The heir (in this case, John's son) would inherit John's interest in the property based on the adverse possession claim. However, this does not guarantee that the son's claim will defeat the interest of the legal owner's heir. The son would need to satisfy the requirements for adverse possession, which typically include continuous occupation for a statutory period (which varies by state in Australia). The son's claim would be subject to legal scrutiny and potential challenges from the legal owner's heir. Therefore, while John can include the land in his will, his son's claim is not automatically superior to that of the legal owner's heir and would need to be established through the proper legal channels."}, "33": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45228/are-intellectual-property-indemnity-clause-which-requires-the-employee-to-indem", "docs_id": 45228, "title": "Are intellectual property indemnity clause, which requires the employee to indemnify the employer, enforceable?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Jurisdiction is England (UK), and it's a clause in an employment contract (permanent).\n\n[The following question has been posted on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/6ix7gn/ip_indemnity_clause_in_employment_contract/), and I happen to be on the same boat. \n\n> I've been offered a job I'm really excited about, but I asked my friend \\[...] and she spotted something she said looked unusual in an employment contract.\n> \n> \n> x.1: The Employee warrants that the use of the Works by the Company will not infringe the rights of any third party.\n> \n> \n> x.2: The Employee shall indemnify the Company against all liabilities, costs, expenses and damages incurred by the Company in connection with any intellectual property infringement claim or other claim relating to the Works supplied by you to the Company during the course of providing the services set out in this agreement.\n\nApparently this is not an uncommon clause in a consultancy agreement or supply contract, but uncommon in an employment agreement.

This applies both to broadcasting and to other public use.\n\nThe basis for this appears to come from \u00a7\u00a045b of the [Copyright Act](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=248181)\\*:\n\n> Sound fixations of the performances of performing artists can, within the period of time specified in section 45, against remuneration, be made available to the pubic \\[sic] through public performance. \\[...] Both the producer of the fixation and the performing artists whose performances are\n>  reproduced are entitled to remuneration. \\[...] For public performance of sound fixations that are not protected under the copyright act, the [Act No. 4 of 14 December 1956](http://app.uio.no/ub/ujur/oversatte-lover/data/lov-19561214-004-eng.pdf) relating to a levy on the public performance of performing artists\u2019 performances, etc. applies.\n\nExplanation\n===========\n\nFFUK is a fund *for* performing artists, not one that takes from performing artists. In this situation, it is not the performing artist that pays the levy, but rather those who make use of a \"sound fixation\" (recording) of a performance of the performing artist.\n\nAn example would be a TV network that wishes to broadcast a pre\\-recorded orchestra performance. If this performance is a song under copyright, then that TV network must pay remuneration to Gramo so that the songwriters, producers, performers etc. can receive compensation. \n\nHowever, if that song is in the public domain then Gramo has no claim to any remuneration. This is where FFUK is involved. The Act No 4\\. of 14 December 1956 authorizes levies for these performances of public domain songs, and it is under this act that FFUK operates. The TV network must pay them a levy so that the performers may still be compensated as they still have rights over the performance of a public domain song.\n\nWhile all this explains the first link you cite, I realize that I'm not directly addressing the claims in the second link. I simply can't find a legal basis for those claims, and still think it's more likely that it's confusing levies for the performance of public domain works (non\\-existant as far as I can tell) with levies for *using* performances of public domain works.

A judgment can affirm that property was stolen and thereby invalidate what was previously good title to the property.\n\nLike any judicial order, such judgments can be found to be invalid and/or illegal.

My gut tells me it is just another way of referring to the reasonable/prudent person test but I am not sure. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Case to look at:**\n\nThe case you want to look at is [*MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.*, 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916\\)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPherson_v._Buick_Motor_Co). Prior to this case, privity of contract was required to impose duty on a defendant. This case held that a carmaker's liability for a defective product reached beyond the immediate purchaser of that car.\n\nJudge Cardozo eliminated that privity barrier to recovery and stated:\n\n> If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequence to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. That is as far as we need to go for the decision of this case. ... If he is negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow.\n\n**What does the duty of care refer to?**\n\nThe [duty of care](https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/introduction-to-negligence) requires you to act as a reasonable person, acting under similar circumstances, would act. This is the *general* duty applicable in all negligence cases. Sometimes, however, there is a *special* duty imposed on a defendant by case law or statute in place of or in addition to the general duty (one simple example is a law requiring all residents of a city to shovel the snow on the sidewalk in front of their house after snowfall). Other variations to the level of care a duty imposes may include common carriers, doctors, etc.\n\nTo find a duty of care, a few states simply consider whether harming the plaintiff was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions. Many more use some sort of multi\\-factor test to determine this. A California case, *Rowland v Christian*, 69 Cal. 2d 108 (1968\\) laid out this set of factors:\n\n* the foreseeability of harm to the injured party;\n* the degree of certainty he or she suffered injury;\n* the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered;\n* the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct;\n* the policy of preventing future harm;\n* the extent of the burden to the defendant and the consequences to the community of imposing a duty of care with resulting liability for breach;\n* and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved\n\n[As of about 8 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care), \"43 states used a multifactor analysis in 23 various incarnations.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a negligence case, a court is trying to determine whether the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff.

Most U.S. courts use a multi-factor test to determine whether a duty of care exists, based on the factors outlined in Rowland v Christian. These factors typically include the foreseeability of harm, the certainty of injury, the connection between the defendant's conduct and the injury, moral blame, policy considerations, the burden on the defendant, and insurance availability. The defendant's personal financial situation (annual income and assets) is not a standard factor in determining whether a duty of care exists. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the foreseeability of harm is a key factor in determining duty of care. \n\nOption C is incorrect because moral blame attached to the defendant's conduct is explicitly mentioned as one of the factors in the Rowland v Christian test. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the policy of preventing future harm is also a factor considered in determining duty of care."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46867/cybersquatter-posted-my-domain-for-sale-after-i-queried-it-can-i-still-file-a", "docs_id": 46867, "title": "Cybersquatter posted my domain for sale after I queried it - can I still file a UDRP?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm in a situation where a cybersquatter holds a domain name that I have trademarked.\n\nMy company \"Example Ltd\" is based in the UK, and we've been established under our brand name for over 30 years.

For a competent internet company the contract will usually specify which law applies, if not, the court must decide where the contract was entered into \\- this may be where you are or where they are.\n\nWhile clauses allowing unilateral changes are legal, the power must be used either reasonably or in good faith depending on which law applies. It is certainly arguable that imposing a charge on something for which there was a promise that there would never be a charge is not reasonable and almost certainly not in good faith.\n\n**Consumer protection law**\n\nMost country\u2019s consumer protection laws cannot be excluded by contract and apply based on where the consumer is, as well as where the business is. So, if the service is offered in the UK and a UK consumer buys it, then UK consumer protection law applies irrespective of the nationality of the business.\n\nAlmost all such laws prohibit deceptive and misleading conduct \\- offering something for \u201cfree\u201d when bundled with something else and then reneging is clearly that. \n\nThere is usually a statutory body responsible for dealing with complaints so you might get you issue resolved without needing to go to a court.\n\nTry doing a little research in your country.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: George signed up for a web hosting plan in 2016 that promised a \"Free Domain For Life\".

Using \"Contractor\" and \"Consultant\" interchangeably despite only the former being explicitly defined seems a bit sloppy, but it does not by itself alter or invalidate the meaning of the contract.\n\nThe excerpt you reproduce is self\\-explanatory. Its first sentence identifies the parties, and there are only two.

As long as the contract as a whole allows for clear identification of the parties and their roles, such minor terminological inconsistencies do not invalidate the agreement. The context of the contract makes it evident that \"Consultant\" is referring to Joe, who was initially defined as \"Contractor\". Courts would likely interpret these terms as referring to the same party, given the clear identification at the beginning of the contract.

Giving general health advice in a social setting does not establish a formal healthcare provider-patient relationship.\n\nB) Incorrect. Simply asking for a professional opinion in an informal setting does not create a protected relationship under HIPAA.\n\nC) Correct. By scheduling a follow-up appointment at her clinic, Alice would be establishing a formal healthcare provider-patient relationship, which would then be subject to HIPAA privacy protections.\n\nD) Incorrect. While this could be considered correct in the context of the informal barbecue conversation, option C presents a scenario where HIPAA would apply.\n\nThe key point is that HIPAA only applies when there is a formal healthcare provider-patient relationship. Information shared in informal social settings, even with a physician, is not automatically protected under HIPAA unless that relationship is established."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6081/can-i-bundle-mit-licensed-components-in-a-apache-2-0-licensed-project", "docs_id": 6081, "title": "Can I bundle MIT licensed components in a Apache 2.0 licensed project?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am creating a project that I would like to open source and license under the Apache 2\\.0 License.

This contrasts with releasing your work into the public domain, which would allow anyone do literally anything, even claim to be the author.\n\nThe difference is that permissive licenses allow you to re\\-license your derivative works however you like, while copyleft licenses require your derivatives to be licensed under the same license (hence the term viral). The reasons you'd choose either one are philosophical and political and beyond the scope of this answer.\n\nBoth the Apache License and the MIT license are permissive, so incorporating MIT licensed code into your Apache licensed project is certainly allowed. Just be sure to attribute the original author for the parts your incorporated and include a copy of the MIT License terms, as required by the license.

Both the Apache 2.0 License and the MIT License are permissive open-source licenses. This means they allow for the incorporation of code under one license into projects using the other license. The developer can bundle the MIT-licensed component with their Apache 2.0-licensed project, but they must ensure proper attribution to the original author of the MIT-licensed component and include a copy of the MIT License terms, as required by the MIT License.

Kramer](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/334/1/), racial covenants were considered to be outside the scope of the 14th Amendment, because as stated in [Corrigan v. Buckley](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/271/323/), \"the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment 'have reference to state action exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals'\". Therefore, a private agreement to exclude blacks does not run afoul of the 14th Amendment. The Shelley court also noted:\n\n> But here there was more. These are cases in which the purposes of the\n> agreements were secured only by judicial enforcement by state courts\n> of the restrictive terms of the agreements.\n\nThis leads to the primary holding of this case:\n\n> We hold that, in granting judicial enforcement of the restrictive\n> agreements in these cases, the States have denied petitioners the\n> equal protection of the laws, and that, therefore, the action of the\n> state courts cannot stand.\n\nThat is, the racially\\-restrictive agreements are not themselves forbidden by the 14th Amendment, but *enforcement* of such agreements is forbidden. An obvious question is, why had nobody advanced that argument before, but legal arguments often suffer from the forest / trees disability.\n\nAs far as I have been able to determine, that part of the Oregon Constitution excluding blacks became a legal nullity when the 14th Amendment was ratified, though it remained in the Constitution until 1926\\.

Kraemer in 1948, racially restrictive covenants were considered private agreements outside the scope of the 14th Amendment, as established in Corrigan v. Buckley. The 14th Amendment was interpreted to apply only to state actions, not private agreements. However, state laws that restricted property ownership or residency based on race, such as Oregon's exclusion of blacks, became legally nullified when the 14th Amendment was ratified, even if they remained on the books. The 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prevented states from enforcing such discriminatory laws against citizens, regardless of their race."}}
