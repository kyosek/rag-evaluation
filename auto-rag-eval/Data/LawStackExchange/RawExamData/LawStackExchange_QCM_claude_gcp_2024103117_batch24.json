[This story from *The Nation*](https://www.thenation.com/article/why-is-bank-of-america-asking-clients-about-their-citizenship/) says that Bank of America is denying accounts to non\\-citizens, and arguing that it is legal because of increased risks, although there are current court challenges to this. [*Perez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A*](https://www.venable.com/lawsuit-claiming-discrimination-by-lender-on-basis-of-immigration-status-survives-dismissal-09-18-2017/) is a case now pending challenging loan denials based on immigration status. This has particularly come up in regard to DACA recipients, rather than people with LPR status. \n\nThe US \"public accommodation\" laws probably do not apply, as a bank is not usually considered a place of public accommodation. Any specific state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of immigration status might apply. \n\nIn short, this is an issue still not clearly settled. There seems to be no law or regulation requiring banks to ask for citizenship information, much less to deny accounts based on it, and it would be well to seek a bank with a different policy if possible.\n\nThe above is very US\\-specific.

There seem to be quite a few countries where there are few*er* protections for criminal defendants, but I can't find any where \"guilty until proven innocent\" is literally the case. What I mean by this is that there are non\\-US jurisdictions that allow defendants to be convicted on evidence that would be thrown out of a US court as unconstitutionally obtained, but the prosecution still has to present this evidence and use it to convince the court of the defendant's guilt. The court does not simply assume, \"The prosecutor said it so it must be true, GUILTY!\".\n\nI would define a \"guilty until proven innocent\" legal regime as incorporating most, if not all, of the following criteria:\n\n* The contents of an indictment or other formal accusation are presumed true unless specifically rebutted in a court of law.\n* Defendants in court who plead Not Guilty are required to prove their innocence in order to obtain an acquittal.\n* Simply disproving the prosecution's evidence is insufficient for an acquittal unless the defendant *also* affirmatively proves their innocence.\n\nAre there any jurisdictions anywhere in the world where \"guilty until proven innocent\" is the rule for criminal cases?\n\nJust to be clear, I'm *not* asking for examples of jurisdictions that are not as friendly to defendants (e.g. hearsay is admissible, no doctor\\-patient privilege, trial by jury not guaranteed, expanded authority of judges to issue search warrants, no right to a \"speedy\" trial, etc.), but something more approaching, \"Oh no, John accused me of breaking into his garage. If I can't affirmatively *prove* to a jury that I was in America all of last month and couldn't have broken into his garage here in Ruritania, I'm going to prison!\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: English defamation law is considered to put the burden of proof on the defendant, and until 2010 English law supported a criminal charge of libel\\- so called \"criminal libel\" or \"defamatory libel.\" It should be noted that criminal libel was never affirmatively enshrined in English law, but it came about as an outgrowth of English common law. It was never heavily prosecuted, but was a crime and did carry a potential sentence of one to two years in jail.\n\nA comprehensive review of criminal libel in English law was published as \"Working Paper No. 84 Criminal Libel\". [You can read it here.](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2016/08/No.084-Criminal-Libel.pdf)\n\nIn England, when actions for libel are brought, the *defamatory statements are assumed to be false.* This assumes the defendant/publisher to be in the wrong, and they must demonstrate their actions to be reasonable. At the time, the defenses available (see paragraph 3\\.17 in linked reference) to the defendant/publisher were either:\n\n* Assert that the statements are not actually defamatory, or do not constitute libel on other technical grounds (e.g. were not actually published in a fixed medium)\n* Make an affirmative defense of \"justification\"\\- proving both that the defamatory statements were actually true AND that that there is a public interest in publishing the statements.\n* Make an affirmative defense of \"fair comment\"\\- similar to justification but for statements that are a matter of opinion rather than a matter of objective fact.\n\nThis satisfies your first condition\\- the statements named by the plaintiff/prosecutor are assumed to be false and defamatory (note another peculiarity of English common law was that actions of libel could be brought by a prosecutor but could also be brought by private citizens... even if they weren't the ones being libeled). This means the prosecutor was assumed to be in the right, and the defendant was assumed to be in the wrong.\n\nParagraph 3\\.19 in the linked document lays it out for us:\n\n```\nThe onus of proving the truth of the statement lies on the \ndefendant who must also prove the facts by reason of which \nit was for the public benefit for the statement to be \npublished. Accordingly, the person defamed need give no \nevidence to rebut the allegations made in the plea of \njustification, leaving the defendant to prove that the \nlibel was true and that the publication was for the public \nbenefit.\n\n```\n\nNote that this is a departure from most other western legal systems in two ways. In the US we say that \"Truth is an absolute defense against libel claims.\" If the statement is true, then you can say it under US law, no matter how badly it damages someone's reputation. Note that this is not true for common law criminal libel\\- merely being true is not sufficient defense, the statements must both be true AND there must be a public interest in publishing the statements. Thus a newspaper or gossip rag that published lovers' intimate details could be prosecuted for criminal libel even if those details are true. Truth is not an absolute defense.\n\nAt this point we have also satisfied your second condition. Once an action of libel has successfully been brought, the defendant must assert some defense or else they automatically lose. Either they must contend that the alleged defamatory statements don't technically rise to the level of libel under the law, or they must prove the truth of their statements and provide a compelling public interest in making those statements.\n\nOther legal systems handle libel very differently. In the USA, libel laws vary on a state\\-by\\-state basis. In general however, a plaintiff wanting to bring suit for libel must provide evidence that the libelous statements are in fact false. If they cannot provide some evidence to that effect, there is no prima facie case of libel and the defense could move for a summary judgement. As has already been said, truth is an absolute defense in the USA.\n\nWhile the crime of libel no longer exists in England, all of this carries over into modern\\-day civil libel actions. The onus is still on the defendant to prove their innocence. Modern observers have coined the terms \"libel tourism\" and \"libel terrorism\" to refer to the practice of attacking critics in English courts rather than more appropriate venues specifically because of the fewer protections afforded to defendants there. The US in particular passed the SPEECH Act in 2010, saying that findings of libel from foreign courts are unenforceable in the US, largely due English libel tourism.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In English defamation law prior to 2010, which of the following statements best describes the burden of proof in criminal libel cases?\n\nA) The prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant made false and defamatory statements.\n\nB) The defendant had to prove that the allegedly defamatory statements were true, but did not need to prove public interest.\n\nC) The defendant had to prove both the truth of the statements and that there was a public interest in publishing them.\n\nD) The court assumed neutrality, and both prosecution and defense had to present evidence to support their claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In English defamation law before 2010, the burden of proof in criminal libel cases was placed on the defendant. The correct answer is C because the defendant had to make an affirmative defense of \"justification\" by proving both that the defamatory statements were actually true AND that there was a public interest in publishing the statements. This approach differed significantly from many other legal systems, including the US, where truth alone is typically an absolute defense against libel claims. Options A and D are incorrect because they misrepresent the burden of proof in English libel law at the time.

Likewise, if the \"practice\" were characterized more broadly\u2014selling both the women's and men's versions at a discount from time to time, not necessarily at the same time\u2014then the analysis will also have difficulty getting past 19(2\\)(b).)\n\nThe question is whether the application of this practice indirectly discriminates against \"male purchasers.\"\n\n### 19(2\\)(a): does the Nike store apply this practice to male and non\\-male purchasers?\n\nYes. (This is why we're in an indirect discrimination analysis rather than direct discrimination.)\n\n### 19(2\\)(b): does this practice put male purchasers at a disadvantage?\n\nDepending on evidence showing that male purchasers are more likely to want to purchase the Nike Jordan 4128s (men's), then yes. (I could also see a tribunal cutting the analysis off at this stage, depending on how much weight they place on choice. I know that [Canada avoids inquiring into the \"source\" of the disadvantage or blaming it on an individual's choice](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18510/index.do), but I have no idea what the approach in the U.K. is to this aspect.)\n\n### 19(2\\)(c): would this practice put a particular male claimant at that disadvantage?\n\nDepending on evidence showing that the particular claimant wants to purchase the Nike Jordan 4128s (men's), then yes.\n\n### 19(2\\)(d): is it the case that the Nike store cannot show the practice to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim?\n\nMy prediction is that the store would be able to justify the practice as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\n\nOne example of a legitimate aim: a charging policy at swimming pools that disproportionately affected \"disabled swimmers\" was found to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, being part of \"an overall financial structure which covers the provision of a wide range of public services\" ([https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2022/1588\\.html](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2022/1588.html))\n\nOther [examples of legitimate aims](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/check-what-type-of-discrimination-youve-experienced/justifying-discrimination/): \"running an efficient service,\" \"requirements of a business,\" \"desire to make a profit.\" However,\n\n> Economic reasons alone are not enough to justify discrimination. Someone can\u2019t justify discrimination by saying it\u2019s cheaper to discriminate. But costs can be taken into account as part of the justification if the person can show there are other good enough reasons for the treatment.\n\nSo, depending on the business rationale, and the proportionality of the discount compared to the business need (e.g. cost of holding extra stock, risk of failing to sell stock as a new model comes in, etc.), the price differential could be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. This will depend on the evidence. I predict most stores would be able to justify a modest and occasional price differential, even in the case that the production costs of each shoe are identical.\n\n### Summary\n\nI see four ways through this analysis, each leading to the conclusion that this would not be indirect discrimination:\n\n* a narrow characterization of the \"practice\" as simply selling the women's version at \u00a3150 (probably too narrow of a view)\n* a broad characterization of the \"practice\" as selling all versions at a discount from time to time, albeit not necessarily at the exact same time\n* a view that any disadvantage experienced by men is due to their choice not the price discrepancy (dubious)\n* the price discrepancy is a proportionate means to achieve a legitimate aim (admittedly, a thin analysis requiring more research)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here is a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the analysis of indirect discrimination under the UK Equality Act 2010, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the scenario where Nike sells women's Jordan 4128s at \u00a3150 and men's at \u00a3200?\n\nA) This pricing practice would definitely constitute unlawful indirect discrimination against male customers, as it puts them at a particular disadvantage.\n\nB) The practice cannot be indirect discrimination because customers are free to choose which version to purchase, regardless of their gender.\n\nC) This pricing difference would likely not be considered indirect discrimination if Nike can demonstrate it is a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate business aim.\n\nD) The practice is clearly direct discrimination based on sex and is therefore automatically unlawful under the Equality Act.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is most accurate based on the analysis provided. While the pricing practice could potentially meet the initial criteria for indirect discrimination by putting male customers at a disadvantage, Section 19(2)(d) of the Equality Act allows for a practice to be justified if it is \"a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\" The documentation suggests that if Nike can provide evidence of a valid business rationale for the price difference (such as stock management or profit considerations) that is proportionate to the discount offered, this would likely not be considered unlawful indirect discrimination. Options A and D are incorrect as they fail to consider the possibility of justification. Option B oversimplifies the issue by focusing solely on customer choice, which does not negate the potential for indirect discrimination."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35770/what-recourse-do-i-have-when-someone-has-bought-an-old-domain-of-mine-and-mirro", "docs_id": 35770, "title": "What recourse do I have when someone has bought an old domain of mine, and mirrored my content (badly)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am based in the UK and I have run the [opendomesday.org](https://opendomesday.org) website as a free, non\\-profit history site for many years.\n\nWhen I originally built the site, about 8 years ago, I registered it at [domesdaymap.co.uk](http://domesdaymap.co.uk).

(This\n> is in the state of Georgia, USA.) I prefer approaches that do not\n> involve paying an attorney, since that fast becomes expensive and\n> counterproductive.\n\nChild support generally either is, or can be reduced to, by court process, a money judgment. The money judgment can then be enforced by writ of execution and levy attaching tangible personal property of a debtor, to the extent that the asset is not exempt from creditors claims. The money judgment can also be used to garnish bank accounts.\n\nIf someone has a manifest ability to pay child support, but has willfully failed to do so, a court can incarcerate the child support debtor for contempt of court until such time as the child support debt voluntarily turns over the assets that the debtor has an ability to pay the child support debt with. In theory, however, an inability to pay child support is a full defense to a contempt of court proceeding.\n\nAll of these kinds of legal child support collection proceedings are technical, and it would be very challenging to accomplish these goals through the court process without a lawyer. The going rate for contingent fee collection of child support debts is usually 50% of the gross amount recovered, plus out of pocket costs for filing fees and process servers out of your half, if you can find an attorney willing to take on a child support collection case at all.\n\nSometimes collection agencies will agree to collect child support for a similar fee. Collection agencies can make negative credit reports, and nag the child support debtor regularly, but otherwise have the same remedies available to them as a lawyer.\n\nMany states have procedures for the state child support collection agency to seize tax refunds, to revoke occupational and professional licenses, and to revoke driver's licenses if child support is not paid. Usually, state child support collection agencies either exclusively serve, or prioritize, cases where child support is owed to someone who has received state welfare benefits, and it applies some or all of the proceeds received to the welfare payments made to the child support beneficiary.\n\nNot paying child support might be a probation violation that could be reported to the child support debtor's probation officer. But, causing the child support debtor to be incarcerated for failing to observe probation terms doesn't naturally or easily translate into providing the child support creditor with money.\n\nUltimately, you can't get blood out of a turnip. If someone doesn't have an ability to pay child support, they won't. A new car is suspicious and probably indicates that there was some under the table work done. But, by the time it is seized, it is a used car, and its fair market value at auction may be quite modest. Whether or not it is cost effective is for you to decide.\n\nI once tried to collect a money judgment of about $100,000 from a drug dealer which presented similar problems. It wasn't easy.

For example, if the recipient of a forged check has a fatal allergic reaction to the ink, most courts will not hold the forger guilty of murder, as the cause of death is too remote from the criminal act.\n\nFloyd was arrested on an accusation that he passed a counterfeit $20 bill. This is not an \"inherently dangerous\" felony. Nor has it ever been established that he had the criminal intent that would have been required to convict him of a crime. Indeed it has not been proved that he knew the bill was counterfeit. But a finding of criminal intent to commit the underlying felony is essential to invoking teh felony murder rule. [MN code 609\\.632](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.19) subdivision 3 requires \"intent to defraud\" and \"having reason to know that the money order, currency, note, or obligation or security is forged, counterfeited, falsely made, altered, or printed\". Moreover when the value is under $1,000 the possible penalties are much lighter and may not even be a felony.\n\nIn any case passing a phoney $20 is not the kind of offense for which the felony murder rule is normally invoked, nor is being killed by an arresting officer a plausible, outcome, althoguh obviously it is possible.\n\n### Further sources\n\nThe University of Minnesota's page on [\"felony Murder\"](https://open.lib.umn.edu/criminallaw/chapter/9-4-felony-murder/) says:\n\n> When the defendant commits a felony that is inherently dangerous to life, he or she does so knowing that some innocent victim may die. In essence, this awareness is similar to implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. What is difficult to justify is a conviction for felony murder when the felony is not inherently dangerous to life. Thus most jurisdictions limit the felony murder doctrine to felonies that create a foreseeable risk of violence or death. ...\n\n> Joaquin, who has just lost his job, decides to burn down his apartment building because he can\u2019t afford to pay the rent.

When you co\\-sign a loan with someone else both you and the other person are equal parties in the loan, both jointly responsible in fully paying off the principle and interest. If loan is defaulted on, the bank can pursue legal remedies to try to recover its money against either or both of you.\n\nIf you end up having to pay part or all of the loan, then whether or not you can recover any of that money will depend on whatever agreement you made with the other person. Given that you probably wouldn't a have a signed written agreement with the other signer in case like this, it'll probably come down to whether or not you can prove (on the balance of probabilities) that the other party promised to you to pay off the full amount of the loan. It will help if the loan is specifically tied to a car, a house or other property that the other party benefits from but you don't. \n\nNote that you'd have to give serious consideration to whether the other party can actually pay the amount owed. There's no point going to court to obtain an unenforceable judgement.\n\nI also should say that from a financial perspective it does make some sense to think of it as if you were loaning out the money yourself. While there's a big and significant difference between the two, in that your bank account isn't affected unless the other person defaults, if they do the result is going to be pretty much the same. Indeed in that case it's not much different than just giving the other person the money.

While co-signing a loan is not legally equivalent to lending money directly, John may have legal recourse against Sarah. However, his ability to successfully sue Sarah depends on whether he can prove there was an agreement or understanding that Sarah would be responsible for repaying the full amount of the loan.

The success of such a lawsuit would also depend on Sarah's ability to pay, as there's little point in obtaining an unenforceable judgment.

The airline continued to operate flights and did not assess the situation as posing a risk requiring cancellation. Travel warnings and subsequent events, while concerning, do not automatically trigger a legal obligation for the airline to provide refunds for non-refundable tickets. The terms and conditions of the ticket purchase, which the student agreed to, typically govern such situations.

Personal or household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities.\n\nWhat information do we have to determine what counts as \"a purely personal or household activity\"?\n\nData processing tools available to the individual have become much more powerful in recent years, and it seems this is likely to increase rapidly in the near future. Last year I thought the most powerful tools available to anyone that had the potential to break the GDPR were [bellingcat's](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/09/19/identifying-suspicious-businesses-reddit-analysis-and-tracking-russian-propaganda-here-are-the-results-of-bellingcats-first-ever-hackathon/) [tools](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/10/06/automated-map-searches-scam-busting-tools-and-twitter-search-translations-here-are-the-results-of-bellingcats-second-hackathon/) for building personal network graphs from public information such as social media and Companies House. However in the last month open source tools derived from [Meta\u2019s LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) Large Language Model have improved to the point that they are competitive with the best in the world and [Google expects them to eclipse this performance in coming months](https://natural20.com/google-ai-documents-leak/).\n\nFor example [Vicuna\\-13B](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/) runs on a reasonable gaming computer and when asked \"tell me about \\[FIRST SURNAME] from \\[INSTITUTION]\" will provide a mostly inaccurate paragraph that includes some true personally identifiable information. This works for me and some others who have a web presence such as have published peer reviewed literature but are not in any way famous. [They have an online demo that requires no registration, you can try it yourself here](https://chat.lmsys.org/).\n\nIt seems at the very least it would be challenging to justify the use of such a tool under the GDPR. As I understand it all the information within the network is used to answer every question, even if just as far as \"do not use this bit of the network\". Therefore any use could be classed as the processing of personal data. Therefore if one wanted to download and experiment with such a model the easiest way would be to rely on the Household Activities exception. However it is not totally clear what would and would not be counted. What information could we use to try and determine if such a use was legal, and what the limits would be?\n\nPrevious Reaserch\n\n[The ICO has a page on the exceptions](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/) but that explicitly does not cover domestic purposes: \"This is simply because they are not covered by the UK GDPR\". It gives the topic two sentences, the first repeats the law and the second give a couple of examples that are not relevant here.\n\n[There is a denied FOI request](https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2019/2615778/fs50807165-1.pdf) for \"any policy, guidance, lines\\-to\\-take or other material you hold on the scope of the exemption contained in GDPR art 2(2\\)(c) and/ or recital 18\" with the denial based on this information appearing in guidance including \"a final published version\". However I cannot find this guidance with either Google or the ICO website search.\n\n[There is a case from the Netherlands](https://www.fff-legal.com/the-household-exemption-in-gdpr/) that excludes posting photos of one's child on social media from the household use exception. While this may not directly relate to my question, it does illustrate the the exception can be interpreted quite narrowly. It rather surprised me as posting photos of one's children seems to be quite a big bit of social media.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The household exemption is part of Art 2 GDPR, which lays out the subject matter scope. Clearly, the use of LLMs and other technologies can be GDPR\\-covered processing of personal data, unless this is done \u201cby a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity\u201d. You cited Recital 18, which provides a bit more background, and gives correspondence, keeping addresses, and some social media use as examples of personal or household activities.\n\nThere is some CJEU case law on the GDPR household exemption.\n\nIn *Lindqvist* (C\\-101/01\\), the court noted:\n\n> 47\\. That exception must therefore be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals, which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people.\n\nThat case was about a personal blog about the lives of coworkers. It would likely have been fine for that person to keep a personal diary of those matters, but here the problem was publication to the internet. Since *anyone* could read it, the blog was not purely personal.\n\nA decade later in *Rynes* (C\u2011212/13\\), the court noted that the legislators' use of the word \"purely\" requires this exception to be interpreted narrowly:\n\n> 30\\. The fact that Article 3(2\\) of Directive 95/46 falls to be narrowly construed has its basis also in the very wording of that provision, under which the directive does not cover the processing of data where the activity in the course of which that processing is carried out is a \u2018purely\u2019 personal or household activity, that is to say, not simply a personal or household activity.\n\nSuch a narrow interpretation is also necessary to maintain the data subject's fundamental rights.\n\nNote that Directive 95/46 is the old Data Protection Directive which was replaced by the GDPR. It contains a household exception that is worded virtually identically to the one in the GDPR, so these old CJEU judgments remain directly applicable. They also remain relevant in the UK, as all of this predates Exit Day.\n\nTo my knowledge there has not been any further guidance on the household exception, neither by the ICO nor by the EDPB. This is also because these data protection agencies do not make law or policy, but merely apply it. It is up to courts to correctly interpret the household exception. In the Dutch case you mention (for [GDPRHub has more details](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Rb._Gelderland_-_C/05/368427) and the [original judgement is here](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/#!/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBGEL:2020:2521)), the court does not explain why exactly the household exemption wouldn't apply, but the narrow interpretation seems in line with the CJEU case law. I want to highlight in particular that the defendant in that case failed to demonstrate that the personal data in question wasn't accessible to an \"indefinite number of people\", to borrow the expression from the Lindqvist case.\n\nMy personal opinion is that this \"indefinite number of people\" aspect provides the clearest criterion for whether the household exception might apply. If processing activities are not shared at all, or only made available to close friends and family, there's a good chance the exception might apply. In the LLM context, to the degree that their use constitutes processing of personal data, running such models for personal amusement or out of personal curiosity is probably fine. It might also be OK to share such outputs in a closed chat group. But creating them for non\\-personal purposes (e.g. employment purposes) or disseminating them to the public could cause GDPR to apply. LLMs are far from the only scenario where such difficult questions arise. Another fun topic is the degree to which the use of LinkedIn is GDPR compliant (since no one uses that platform for purely personal purposes), or how large a friend group's Discord server can grow while still counting as \"purely personal\".\n\nIf the household exception doesn't apply, this means that data processing activities have to be performed in compliance with the GDPR. This doesn't generally means that they would be illegal. However, the use of AI models does pose some potential challenges:\n\n* What is the legal basis for *training* the models? Perhaps there is a *legitimate interest* for using publicly available data, maybe not. Can an unlawfully trained model still be used lawfully?\n* What is the legal basis for using the models for *inference*? This will depend massively on the *purpose* for which the models are used.\n* How does the use of (potentially wrong) AI output interact with the Art 5(1\\)(d) accuracy principle and the Art 22 restrictions on automated individual decision\\-making?\n* To which degree are *prompts* other people's personal data? How does this interact with the legal basis used for inference?

The household exemption likely does not apply in this scenario for several reasons:\n\n1. The LLM processes personal data of an indefinite number of people, going beyond purely personal or household activities.\n2. The CJEU has indicated that the exception should be interpreted narrowly, and the word \"purely\" in the regulation emphasizes this.\n3.

The processing involves colleagues, which may blur the line between personal and professional activities.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the number of friends and the inclusion of colleagues' data likely exceed the scope of \"purely personal\" activities. Answer C is incorrect because the exemption's applicability is not solely determined by public dissemination or professional use.

What is the most likely outcome regarding John's obligation to cooperate?\n\nA) John is still legally bound by the plea deal and must cooperate, or face penalties for breach of contract.\nB) The pardon nullifies the plea deal entirely, freeing John from any obligation to cooperate.\nC) John's obligation to cooperate remains, but the government has no legal means to enforce it.\nD) The pardon is invalid because it interferes with an ongoing judicial process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. A presidential pardon would indeed remove the government's ability to prosecute John for the crimes covered by the pardon, effectively nullifying the threat of penalties that typically enforce a plea deal. However, the pardon does not automatically void the plea agreement itself.\n\nThe obligation to cooperate technically remains in place, as it was a voluntary agreement made by John. However, with the pardon in effect, the government loses its primary means of enforcing this cooperation - the threat of prosecution. John could choose to honor his agreement out of ethical considerations, but there would be no legal mechanism to compel his cooperation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the obligation may morally exist, it's not legally enforceable post-pardon. Option B is not entirely accurate, as the pardon doesn't automatically void the agreement, just the consequences. Option D is incorrect because a presidential pardon is valid even if it affects ongoing processes, provided it pertains to federal crimes."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51373/is-it-legal-to-short-a-companys-stock-and-then-blog-about-why-you-did-it", "docs_id": 51373, "title": "Is it legal to short a company&#39;s stock and then blog about why you did it?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In America, is it legal to short a company with which I never had any affiliation and then write a negative blog post about it affecting the company's stock price?\n\nMore specifically, suppose everything in this blog post is accurate, but kind of difficult to prove.

Example, one bullet points out that \"As per Supreme Court, all hospitals both governmental and private, are duty\\-bound to provide basic emergency medical care, and injured patients have the right to get emergency medical care.\" I would be extremely cautious, about the entire Charter. As one is able to discern by reading this simple example, they leave plenty of room for their own discretion as well. What I mean is this: though these hospitals are duty\\-bound to provide emergency medical care, this Charter does not provide for the level of care that these caregivers are duty\\-bound to give to these patients. A good provision is \"Such care must be initiated without demand for payment in advance, and the basic care should be given to the patient regardless of the ability to pay.\" Another point to pay attention to: Care must be \"initiated\" without demand in advance.\" No provision says they cannot stop the care and demand payment in full before continuing. Next, this provision states that \"the basic care should be given....\" So, when I am in an emergent situation, I expect the best care, not the basic care. However, in a few places I shall not name, basic is the best they provide.\nFurther into the Charter, one finds what you may be up against, \"Right to Confidentiality, Human Dignity, and Privacy.\" That is the 5th point, in succession. I'm of the opinion that the family may be facing quite the difficulty, as this provision states in the first bullet point: \"All patients have the right to privacy and doctors have a duty to hold information about their health conditions and treatment plans in the strictest confidence.\" The 15th condition in the Charter provides this: \"Right to Take Discharge of Patient....\" The bullet point, \"A patient has the right to take the discharge and cannot be detained in a hospital, on procedural grounds such as a dispute in payment of hospital charges.\"\nApparently, as I was prepossessed on this matter, the patient has all of these rights \\- the patient's family does not seem to possess any particular right to the patient in India even, in the hospital.\nResource:\nDo you know your rights as a patient?

Since there isn't a written easement, the determination has to be based upon actual use and necessity over the prescription period and there are all sorts of factors and arguments that can lead to the being larger or smaller.\n\nThe answer would also be influenced by how the issue presented itself in a court. One of the concerns about overhead power lines is the extent to which another use interferes with the operation of the activity that benefits from the prescriptive easement, this might be one thing for tall trees, another for activities that have significant electromagnetic output that could interfere with the lines, and a third for the erection of a fence that could interfere with the ability to line maintenance trucks to access the lines. It might be different for a high voltage trunk line and the local line getting electricity to the houses on a particular block. It might depend upon what kind of vehicle utility companies used to tend to these vehicles and could conceivably, for example, be reduced if it becomes possible to maintain these lines for air based drones rather than ground based crane trucks.\n\n> Would my pedestal (ok, really the power company owns it, not me)\n> qualify for me to have access to it (for the purpose of turning my\n> power on/off etc) under this prescriptive easement?

In cases of prescriptive easements without written documentation, the exact scope and dimensions are not automatically defined. If challenged, a court would need to determine the extent of the easement based on historical use, necessity, and other relevant factors. The power company's claim of a 10-foot right-of-way is not automatically enforceable just because they state it as their policy.

The vague general answer is \"It depend on what the sanctions are\". [Here](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/drcongo.pdf) is the summary of the sanctions against DR Congo. The gist of the sanctions is that they are directed against [7 particular individuals](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/13413.pdf). The prohibited transcations are described as:\n\n> Unless otherwise authorized or exempt, transactions by U.S. persons,\n> or in or involving the United States, are prohibited if they involve\n> transferring, paying, exporting, withdrawing, or otherwise dealing in\n> the property or interests in property of an entity or individual\n> listed on the SDN List.

Bear in mind that a service provider may take an action which is not absolutely mandated by US law, out of an abundance of caution and fear of misinterpreting the law.

This approach addresses the root of the problem and aligns with the recommendation in the documentation to \"analyze if the currently collected 'non-personal' data truly fulfills the definition of 'non-personal' data.\"\n\nOption A is excessive, as not all data needs to be treated as personal if it genuinely doesn't meet that criteria. Option B ignores a potential compliance issue and is therefore inappropriate. Option D might help prevent future incidents but doesn't address the underlying classification problem."}}
