When a company hires employees in different countries, even for remote work, those employees are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where they are physically located and performing the work. This means the startup must comply with each country's specific employment laws, work health and safety regulations, tax withholding requirements, and pension/superannuation systems for the respective employees. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the company cannot simply apply UK laws to all employees regardless of their location. Option B is not necessarily true, as the company may be able to hire employees in other countries without establishing separate legal entities, though this depends on specific country regulations.

While it's true that generally, contracts may become void when a company ceases to exist, there are exceptions. For instance, if the company's assets (including confidentiality agreements) were purchased during bankruptcy, the new owner might be entitled to enforce the agreement. Additionally, in some jurisdictions like Delaware, dissolved corporations can continue to exist legally for a period after dissolution, potentially keeping such agreements in force.

Usually there needs to be a claim of actual damage for an insurance company to treat it as an accident. The usual rule is \"no harm, no foul\" (unless someone is cited for a traffic violation).\n\nInsurance company accident records are not regulated to the same extent as say, credit reports. You could threaten to sue the company for negligent misrepresentation, or the driver of Car C for defamation, in order to try to get this statement removed, but those would be hard cases to win since you are at least arguably at fault and fault is to some extent a matter of opinion. It would be much easier to win a suit like that if the accident didn't happen at all.

While Car C rear-ended Car A, the initial collision caused by Car A's distraction contributed to the chain of events. The documentation suggests that fault in this scenario is a \"close call\" that could go either way in court. \n\nAdditionally, the answer states that it would be difficult to remove this from Car A's record, as fault is partly a matter of opinion in this case, and the accident did occur.

There's a seemingly unsolved question of \"How Many Federal Laws Are There?\" ([https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/03/frequent\\-reference\\-question\\-how\\-many\\-federal\\-laws\\-are\\-there/](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/03/frequent-reference-question-how-many-federal-laws-are-there/))\n\nAfter reading some related articles, delving into the Statutes at Large and United States Code, and finding a question in a similar vein ([How many lines of text in all currently active federal laws of US?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22502/how-many-lines-of-text-in-all-currently-active-federal-laws-of-us/22512#22512)), I'm starting to see the monstrous size of the problem.\n\nAssuming you don't care about time, effort, etc., what would be the simplest, most naive approach to compiling all of US law into a single body of work? Is it even theoretically possible?\n\nMy initial thought was to find all of the relevant information (all the many volumes and documents), but even this seems difficult. How does anyone (citizens, lawyers, judges, other government officials, etc.) even verify that the actions they've taken are legal when the potential applicable laws are so vastly separated from each other being in entirely different series of documents written in format of chronological amendments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main impediment is identifying exactly what \"a law\" is. When people talk (casually) about \"the law\", that can refer to statutes enacted by Congress, regulations set forth by administrative agencies to articulate specifics of those statutes, and Supreme Court rulings as to what \"the law\" is or says. The canonical example of \"a law\" is a statute passed by Congress. Under that understanding, you could point to the US Code and ask the question \"how many\", though you may have to also subtract things ruled unconstitutional by SCOTUS (they aren't removed from The Code, unless actually repealed by Congress).\n\nIn the US code, there isn't an enumerable element \"a law\". [Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17) pertains to copyright; [Title 18](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18) pertains to crime. There isn't just one law about crime and one law about copyright. There are 12 chapters in Title 17; Chapter 1 has a couple dozen sections. Sections can get fairly minutely subdivided: there is no clear point at which you can say \"this is one law, this is another\". However, it is legally irrelevant how many there are \u2013 unless Congress passes a law that counts likes (\"must repeal two laws for every new one passed\").\n\nThe immediate product of congressional enactments is the US Code; the immediate product of administrative rule\\-making is the [Code of Federal Regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/ECFR?page=browse). Supreme Court decisions are also published in [United States Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports), though I don't if there is an exhaustive online compendium of all rulings.\n\nAlso note that things passed by Congress are \"Laws\" (some public, some private). Things in the US Code originate in such acts of Congree, but not every act of Congress affects the US Code, for example [PL 118\\-81](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1617/text). When new subject matter is first introduced it is usually entirely contained in the corresponding law passed, but subsequently it can be amended, and an amendment to copyright law could be snuck into a bill generally about terrorism. I think that the stuff in the US Code corresponds to what most people think \"a law\" is, but it's better to look at the US Code as a single thing \u2013 \"the law\" \u2013 rather than try to count individual laws.\n\nIf you are armed with access to all of these resources, you would also need to know where to find relevant law. Once you find all of the applicable text, you simply apply general legal principles to reach a conclusion, then hire a lawyer to determine where you went wrong, then hire another lawyer to determine where *he* went wrong. At least in difficult cases. Fortunately, although enacted bills often glue stuff together in crazy ways, when it is assembled into the US Code, it is organized more sensibly. Still, not all crimes are defined in title 18 (there 1re 52 other titles to search to find crimes)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the challenge of compiling and understanding all US federal laws?\n\nA) The main difficulty lies in counting the exact number of federal laws, as each statute passed by Congress represents a distinct law.\n\nB) The primary challenge is accessing all relevant legal documents, as they are not readily available to the public.\n\nC) The core issue is the ambiguity in defining what constitutes \"a law\" and the complex interconnections between various legal sources.\n\nD) The main obstacle is the frequent changes in laws, making it impossible to create a comprehensive compilation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the passage highlights that the fundamental challenge in compiling and understanding all US federal laws lies in the ambiguity of defining what constitutes \"a law\" and the complex interconnections between various legal sources. The text mentions that laws can be found in statutes, regulations, and Supreme Court rulings, and that even within the US Code, there isn't a clear delineation of individual laws. The passage also notes the intricate relationships between congressional acts, the US Code, and how amendments can be inserted into seemingly unrelated bills. This complexity and lack of clear boundaries make it difficult to compile a single, comprehensive body of US law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that counting the exact number of laws is not the main issue and is legally irrelevant. Option B is inaccurate because the text provides sources where legal documents can be accessed, such as the US Code, Code of Federal Regulations, and United States Reports.

Legally this means you give us a nonexclusive license to publish your content on the Wattpad Services, including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing it).\n\nThe wording is different and shorter than the Naver terms quoted in the question, but in both cases the poster grants the service a non\\-exclusive license to the content.\n\nNaver specifies that this includes the rights to \"store, copy, reproduce, modify, publicly transmit, display, distribute, and create derivative works (only limited to translation)\" while Wattpad gives the more general \"anything reasonably related to publishing\" and specifically includes \"storing, displaying, reformatting, and distributing\". The other rights listed by Naver seem probably included in \"reasonably related to publishing\" with the possible exception of a right to \"create derivative works (only limited to translation)\". It dopes not seem that the rights claimed by Naver will be very much more extensive than those already granted to Wattpad.\n\nNothing in the Naver terms quoted says that Naver will \"own\" the content uploaded by users.\n\nIn addition although Naver will purchase Wattpad, one news story says \"Lau confirmed Wattpad will continue to operate independently\" which may well mean that its TOS will be unchanged \\-\\- it is not unusual for different services of the same owner to have different TOS documents and terms.\n\nMoreover, if the Naver terms did grant Naver significantly greater rights in the content uploaded by users, it is not clear that they could unilaterally obtain greater rights in content previously uploaded without some form of consent by the uploader\\-owners.\n\nIn short, I think the concerns expressed in the question are overstated."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Based on the information about Naver's acquisition of Wattpad, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright and ownership of user-created content on Wattpad after the acquisition?\n\nA) Naver will automatically own all user-created content on Wattpad once the acquisition is complete.\nB) Users must delete their content from Wattpad before the acquisition to prevent Naver from owning it.\nC) The rights granted to Naver are likely to be similar to those already granted to Wattpad, with users retaining copyright of their work.\nD) Wattpad's terms of service will definitely change to match Naver's, granting Naver extensive new rights over user content.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the information provided suggests that the rights granted to Naver are likely to be similar to those already granted to Wattpad. Both companies' terms of service indicate that users grant a non-exclusive license to publish and distribute content, rather than transferring ownership. The Naver terms, while more detailed, do not appear to claim significantly more extensive rights than Wattpad's current terms. Additionally, it's mentioned that Wattpad may continue to operate independently, which could mean its terms of service remain unchanged.

The existence of extradition treaties between the US and the official's country\n3. The willingness of the foreign country to cooperate (which is often a political decision rather than a purely legal one)\n4. The specific laws of the foreign country (some don't extradite their own citizens)\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the process and ignores the legal and diplomatic hurdles involved.

Specifically it is an order to a particular person to appear and testify at a particular time and place. In many but not all cases, the order also requires that person to bring specified records or documents along. That is known as a *subpoena duces tecum*. In some cases this is used to, order the production of documents without any accompanying testimony.\n\nThe word \"subpoena\" comes from Latin words meaning \"under penalty\" because the order requires the person to comply under penalty of being held in contempt of court and fined or imprisoned.\n\nTher are many other court orders, such as an *injunction* which is generally an order **not** to do something. Different jurisdictions may use different terms for orders with similar effects. The exact name and exact effect of a given order will vary with the jurisdiction, which is not stated in the question at the moment. The needed process to obtain a court order will also vary. Without a jurisdiction, a more specific answer cannot be given.\n\nIt is not unlikely that a subpoena of some sort will be the answer, but the details will depend on the jurisdiction, and on the reason why the information is being sought.

Let's imagine I am in a public place, such as a mall, or some other large gathering of people, when I hear gunshots ring out. Let's say that I am armed with a lawfully acquired and registered firearm, with a concealed carry permit. As I approach the location of the gunshots, I see a man armed with an assault rifle, gunning people down. To be clear, I witness this man killing others. In response, I raise my weapon and fire several rounds at the man while rushing him. He drops to the ground, and I grab his weapon, then go about performing first aid to all of the victims that I can.\n\nAfter is it all over, forensics comes on scene and processes all the evidence. Probably weeks or months later, it is discovered that a pistol round, not a rifle round, is the cause of death for one of the victims, and they match that round to my weapon. Could I be held criminally and/or civilly responsible? Are there any specific laws that cover this specific scenario? If the state matters for the answer, I care about these states in order:\n\n1. Colorado\n2. California\n3. Texas\n4. Florida\n5. New York\n6. Pennsylvania\n7.

To be clear, I am NOT talking about any case in which the person who accidentally shot the bystander is a law enforcement officer, as I know they are covered by different laws. Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Could I be held criminally and/or civilly responsible?\n\nProbably not criminally in Colorado. You would lack the requisite intent (criminal negligence which verges on recklessness) for even the lowest level homicide offense (negligent homicide), and unlike when a criminal trying to murder someone accidentally kills someone else, the doctrine of transferred intent doesn't create criminal liability because your primary target was one you were authorized by the defense of other statute to use deadly force against.\n\nFor civil liability in Colorado, the standard would be \"negligence\", which means, did you take the care of a reasonable person under the circumstances (engaged in the lawful business of defending others with a deadly weapon) to not hit bystanders. This would probably go to a jury and the claim would be covered by your homeowner's or renter's insurance in all likelihood. You would be a very sympathetic defendant in front of a jury.\n\nA case like that would be fact intensive and could go either way. It is a case in which the quality of lawyering would probably matter a lot. A ricochet off a hard surface to hit a bystander who was not in your line of fire would probably not be sufficiently foreseeable to impose liability (or would limit your liability to a very low percentage of the total). So would a victim you didn't see because the victim was in rapid motion or hidden behind an opaque but not bullet proof object. Other scenarios could conceivably be more culpable, for example, if the active shooter was holding the bystander in a hostage situation.\n\nAlso, the jury would allocate 100% of the liability between you and the criminal as a \"non\\-party at fault\" and that would probably significantly reduce your liability even if the jury found that you had some civil negligence. Maybe the active shooter would be found 90% at fault, and you 10% at fault, for example, if the jury thought that a reasonable person would have taken more care not to hit bystanders. But, since the victim would probably be 0% at fault, the odds of a full exoneration are lower than in cases where the victim is at fault, since it the victim is majority at fault there is no liability.\n\nThe civil liability analysis would different if a law enforcement officer had deputized before you took action (which could be done orally). If that had happened, you would probably be immune from civil liability entirely."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado, a civilian with a concealed carry permit responds to an active shooter situation in a public place.

However, they could potentially face civil liability based on a negligence standard. The case would be fact-intensive and would likely go to a jury, who would determine if the civilian took reasonable care under the circumstances.

Therefore the shop could sue you for any damage this causes (maybe you took something the shop did not want to sell, or the person at the information desk was not an employee and ran away with the money).\n\nHowever, whether this constitutes a crime such as theft will depend on jurisdictions.\n\nGermany\n-------\n\nIn Germany, for example, it would probably not, because by definition a theft requires \"intention to take posession in violation of the law\" ([StGB \u00a7242](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__242.html)). You could argue that you did not intend to violate the law, because you paid the required amount, and only gave the money to the wrong person by mistake.

According to the information provided, both in Germany and England/Wales, the action of leaving money at an information desk and taking goods without proper checkout might not be considered theft due to the lack of dishonest intent. In Germany, theft requires \"intention to take possession in violation of the law,\" which could be argued against if the person believed they were paying correctly.

Once quorum is met, members may make motions and the assembly may conduct business.\n\nNow your question concerns the minimum required for passing a motion, and you are correct some motions require more than majority, such as 2/3 vote.\n\nThe problem in your analysis is that rules of procedure assume that the majority or supermajority is met from the members present and voting, not from the total number of members.\n\nLet me show you some examples so you can fully understand.\n\nLet's say there's an assembly with 21 members, with the standard quorum requirements of majority of the members.\n\nThe minimum number of people required for quorum show up, which is 11 (more than half is majority).\nIn order to pass a motion, you only need majority of the members present and voting.

According to the documentation, a minor can own copyright and enter into contracts that are genuinely in their interest.

Many early episodes have plot points centering around Constitutional issues and Presidential powers that Americans will remember from their school days (e.g. the ability of the President to federalize units of the National Guard). Based on those early episodes, it's clear the show is *attempting* to be accurate in its depiction of existing US law, and not just making stuff up wildly or in an alternate reality with different laws.\n\nIn S1E11 of the show, police officers have surrounded a building where they believe a terrorist is hiding. They are on US soil, and believe that the occupant of the building is the person who attempted to assassinate the president several hours earlier. It is unclear if they know the nationality/citizenship status of the terrorist.\n\nThe (Acting) President of the United States has an open line of communication to the on\\-scene police commander from a bunker in the White House. Other characters explain that standard procedure is for police to attempt to take the alleged terrorist into custody so that criminal charges may be brought, and for police to not fire their weapons unless attacked. The President gives a preemptive order for police to kill the suspect even if a non\\-lethal option is available. His advisors object, but he overrules them, explicitly commanding them to \"shoot to kill.\"\n\nThe show set things up to feel sort of like a Commander\\-in\\-Chief giving orders to a military unit in a war zone overseas, but ultimately, the scenario was a domestic police operation. So, is this something a President can actually do, from a legal standpoint? Or did the show decide to ignore reality in the service of the plot this time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The show ignored the existing legal framework.\n\nAlmost all U.S. police officers are employed by state and local governments and do not report directly to the President, even in an emergency. \n\nA small number of law enforcement officers are federal employees with a direct line of command to the President (e.g. the Secret Service and the security guards in the General Services Administration and TSA officers), but a law enforcement officer, unlike a member of the military or a CIA officer, does not simply follow the orders of the civilians to whom his superiors are responsible without the intervention of their law enforcement superiors based solely upon that civilian's whims and directions the way that a soldier would.\n\nThe Secret Service has some limited authority to direct and even deputize local law enforcement officers in pursuit of their missions, but that would probably not extend to the kind of national security kill order contemplated in this episode.\n\nThis said, lots of law enforcement officers are ex\\-military, most law enforcement agencies has a quasi\\-military organizational structure, and in the extreme circumstances of *Designated Survivor*, it wouldn't be shocking for law enforcement officers to follow their natural military chain of command intuitions rather than the law that actually applies in these situations. Law enforcement officers are personality types that are very deferential to authority which is a natural counterpart to support for their hierarchical view of the world that endows them with their own authority. There is no one in the loop to play devil's advocate for the suspected terrorist.\n\nBut, strictly speaking, the proper protocol within the U.S. would be to have a CIA agent make the strike (because the military is prevented by the posse comitatus act from doing so, unless these events counted as an \"insurrection\" which they very well might in which case the military could be involved), rather than a law enforcement officer.\n\nIncidentally, the U.S. Supreme Court has basically held that the citizenship of the suspected terrorist is irrelevant, even though policy makers in all of the Presidential administrations since 9\\-11 have not been very comfortable with that state of the law and have sought to distinguish U.S. citizens from non\\-U.S. citizens in their own policies."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the TV show \"Designated Survivor\", the President orders police to \"shoot to kill\" a suspected terrorist on US soil.

Option A is incorrect because the President does not have direct authority over local police. Option B is partially true but oversimplified, as even federal law enforcement agencies typically require proper chains of command.

What is the idea behind that? I expect that the reason may vary depending on the country where it does exist.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The simple legal answer is that the President has this power because the law gives it to them.\n\nHistorically, the right of the head of state to grant pardons is a legacy of autocratic monarchical rule: this was a power that kings and queens had over their subjects. In France, this power ended with the monarchy during the French revolution but was reinstated by Napoleon, himself an autocratic monarch, and it has remained in the various incarnations of the French legal system ever since. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon) is an examination of the concept in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe concept of [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers) is a much more recent concept. In particular, the tripartite separation into administrative, judicial and legislative power can be traced to [Montesquieu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montesquieu) in his [The Spirit of the Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_of_the_Laws) in 1748\\. This Enlightenment point of view crept into many political systems, however, the specific expression of it reached full flower in the establishment of the United States. It is worth noting, that pardons at both state and Federal level are part of US law vesting in the Governor (or some other member of the executive) and the President respectively.\n\nThe tripartite separation is supposed to provide checks and balances with each arm of government serving to limit the power of the other two. In this context, it is perfectly reconcilable that the executive branch should have the power to intervene and correct \"mistakes\" made by the judiciary just as the legislative branch does by being able to change the law in the light of judicial interpretation of existing law. In effect, the executive can correct \"mistakes\" in individual cases looking backwards and the legislature can correct \"mistakes\" in general going forward (the do in fact have the power to make laws retrospective \\[backwards looking] and specific but they tend not to do so)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between presidential pardons and the concept of separation of powers?\n\nA) Presidential pardons are a modern invention designed to counterbalance the power of the judiciary.\n\nB) The power of presidential pardons contradicts the principle of separation of powers and has no justification in modern democracies.\n\nC) Presidential pardons are a historical legacy that can be seen as part of the system of checks and balances within the separation of powers.\n\nD) The concept of separation of powers was developed specifically to justify the existence of presidential pardons.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Presidential pardons are indeed a historical legacy, originating from the power of monarchs to grant clemency. However, in the context of modern democracies with separation of powers, they can be viewed as part of the system of checks and balances. The executive branch (represented by the president) has the power to intervene in judicial decisions through pardons, which serves as a way to correct potential \"mistakes\" made by the judiciary. This is similar to how the legislative branch can change laws in response to judicial interpretations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because presidential pardons are not a modern invention, but rather a historical legacy.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while presidential pardons may seem to contradict separation of powers at first glance, they can be justified as part of the checks and balances system.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the concept of separation of powers, developed by Montesquieu in the 18th century, was not created to justify presidential pardons.

He'll say he didn't see it, and besides, all those inspection records were thrown out ten years ago. The condo association may or may not have had oversight of the construction.

Take photos and get a licensed plumber to take a look at it and give you an estimate for separating the water systems. That will document that the two systems are not separate. (Either call your own plumber or ask the condo association for the name of someone).\n\nThen, start with the condo association. They may be responsible for the inspections before the sale. At very least, the condo association may have to check off on the repairs.

Their right to enforce what you can and can't do doesn't come from radio\\-spectrum law; it comes from property and contract law.\n\nYou are on their property subject to a license that they give you to be there. One of the terms of that license is that you won't set up or operate a wireless network. No doubt there are other things you are not permitted to do; for example, you may not be able to sell goods and services. If you breach the terms of the license then you are trespassing and they are within their rights to have you removed.\n\nIn addition, if you are a student (or staff), this is probably one of the terms of your contract with the university. If you breach it, they can terminate your candidature (employment).\n\nContracts can impose obligations on you that goes beyond what the law obliges you to do. Indeed, there is no contract if it only requires what is already required."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A university has a policy prohibiting students from setting up their own wireless networks on campus.

As the owner of the property, the university can set conditions for being on campus. Additionally, students likely agree to abide by university policies as part of their enrollment contract. This gives the university the legal right to enforce such policies, even if they go beyond what is strictly required by law. The other options are not the main legal basis for enforcing this specific policy - FCC regulations don't prohibit personal networks, First Amendment rights aren't directly relevant, and federal education regulations don't typically cover wireless network policies."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91512/what-identification-must-police-officers-provide-to-compel-someone-to-follow-the", "docs_id": 91512, "title": "What identification must police officers provide to compel someone to follow their orders?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand it, in the USA it is the law that if a police office gives one a lawful order it is a crime to not comply with that order. What does the police officer need to do to identify them as a police officer for this law to apply? Is any statement that they are police sufficient, and people are required to believe anyone who says they are police? Is there a specific form of words they must use, perhap similar to the [UK arrest requirements](https://www.gov.uk/police-powers-of-arrest-your-rights)? Is it a question of the state of mind of the subject of the order, perhaps similar to the legal standards of preponderance of evidence or beyond reasonable doubt?\n\nThe case that made me think of this was the [case of a child who was shot by a police office who was in the back seat of the car](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65197857). In this case it would be impossible for the subject to see the officer, so would have no way of knowing if the speaker was police.

There are also many movies in which the undercover police protagonists will wave a gun and a badge around and expect people to do what they say. In all these cases it would appear to be legitimate doubt as to the identity of the police officer. What are the requirements of a member of the public in such a situation? At which point does it become a crime to not comply with orders given by someone who is not obviously a police officer but claims to be?\n\nThe United States is the most prominent country with such a law, and the one I am most interested in. The situation in other countries with similar laws would also be interesting, especially if they contrast with the USA.\n\nThis is different from [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/360/how-can-you-tell-if-you-have-to-follow-a-police-officers-instructions) as that is about how do I tell if an order given is a legal order.

In these states, if a person is uniformed (AK,CA,PA) or wearing a badge (AK,OR), or if the defendant \"knows\" that the person is an officer, they are penalized if they do not obey the order. In other states, you are simply penalized if the person giving the order is a police officer. In those states where there is no statutory limit on police power to give commands, it depends on what the courts have ruled. In North Carolina, following [Glenn Robinson v. Acker](https://casetext.com/case/glenn-robinson-v-acker) there is a burden on off\\-duty officers to establish their authority, and\n\n> an officer may not assume that others will know he is a police officer\n> where he simply states as much and flashes \"something,\" while wearing\n> civilian clothing, working off\\-duty, and acting \"out of control.\"\n\nBut in Alabama, following [Sly v.

Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Oregon,\nPennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas and Utah grant that power with no restriction, and Alaska, California, Florida, Michigan,\nMontana, Nevada, New Jersey, North\nCarolina and Vermont limit police command power to specific circumstances (traffic or emergencies). [This article](https://www.yalelawjournal.org/pdf/MooneyComment_6w54gon8.pdf) lists various cases in states that bear on the question \u2013 there is no clear and uniform law on the matter in the US. Some courts have limited the power to traffic related matters, others (where it is not part of the statutory law) have extended the power to outside of traffic stops. For example, in Ohio which is in the majority \"can issue traffic tickets\" set of states, [State v. Thigpen](https://casetext.com/case/state-v-thigpen-13), 62 N.E.3d 1019 ruled that\n\n> nothing in the plain language of R.C. 2921\\.331(A) limits it solely to\n> orders or signals of police officers actively engaging in traffic\n> direction, control, or regulation.\n\nIt is more likely that if the statute refers to *willfully* failing to comply, that creates some obligation for the officer to identify themselves.\n\nTo simplify this, here are a few ordered generalizations. In 4 states, there is some requirement to be identifiable as a police officer via a uniform or badge, as noted above. In some states, it is a crime to *willfully* fail to comply \u2013 not complying with an officer whom you have reason to believe to be a LEO (e.g. he is wearing his uniform).

There are very limited circumstances in which a government program may be race\\- or sex\\-aware. As the *New York Times* said in the story [\"A Covid\\-19 Relief Fund Was Only for Black Residents.

Private individuals may create scholarships restricted by race, sex, or other criteria that the US government may not use.\n\nGovernment programs may be limited by race when the program is narrowly tailored to improve diversity in an institution that has been and remains less diverse than the population, in some cases.\n\nThe recent AP story [\"Court rules against using race, sex to allocate federal aid\"](https://apnews.com/article/tn-state-wire-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-courts-business-c95f6b6c8819a66d80219cc3fca01e0b) said:\n\n> The U.S. 6th Circuit Appeals Court issued a 2\\-1 opinion Thursday that said the government cannot allocate limited coronavirus relief funds based on race and sex.

According to the information provided, evidence sufficient for an arrest warrant does not automatically allow for searching a suspect's property. A search warrant requires its own probable cause, specifically that evidence of a crime will be found at the location to be searched.

So if, for instance, you go to sign a document before the notary, they will enter into their journal information such as your name, the date, how they verified your identity, and the type of certification they provided.\n\nSection 8209 of the California Government Code specifies how those documents get passed on when something happens to the notary:\n\n> (a) If any notary public resigns, is disqualified, removed from office, or allows his or her\n>  appointment to expire without obtaining reappointment within 30 days, all notarial records and\n>  papers shall be delivered within 30 days to the clerk of the county in which the notary public\u2019s\n>  current official oath of office is on file. If the notary public willfully fails or refuses to deliver\n>  all notarial records and papers to the county clerk within 30 days, the person is guilty of a\n>  misdemeanor and shall be personally liable for damages to any person injured by that action\n>  or inaction.\n> \n> \n> (b) In the case of the death of a notary public, the personal representative of the deceased\n>  shall promptly notify the Secretary of State of the death of the notary public and shall deliver\n>  all notarial records and papers of the deceased to the clerk of the county in which the notary\n>  public\u2019s official oath of office is on file.\n> \n> \n> (c) After 10 years from the date of deposit with the county clerk, if no request for, or reference\n>  to such records has been made, they may be destroyed upon order of court.\n\nSo if the notary quits being a notary while still alive, they send their journal to the county clerk. It doesn't get given to another notary. If they die first, the notary's personal representative (typically their [executor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor)) is responsible for doing so. If the journal needs to be examined, e.g. as evidence that you signed your document on a particular date, you would be able to get a copy of the journal page from the county clerk.\n\nThe journal does not necessarily have to be kept for more than 10 years after the notary's death, resignation, etc, so there is no guarantee that those records would be available in perpetuity."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In California, what happens to a notary public's journal if they pass away?\n\nA) The journal is immediately destroyed to protect confidentiality.\nB) The journal is passed on to another active notary public.\nC) The personal representative of the deceased notary must deliver the journal to the county clerk.\nD) The journal becomes the property of the notary's heirs.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to California Government Code Section 8209(b), in the event of a notary public's death, their personal representative (typically the executor of their estate) is responsible for promptly notifying the Secretary of State about the death and delivering all notarial records and papers, including the journal, to the clerk of the county where the notary's official oath of office is on file. This ensures that the records are preserved and can be accessed if needed. The journal is not destroyed immediately (A), not passed to another notary (B), nor does it become the property of the notary's heirs (D). After 10 years, if there have been no requests for or references to the records, they may be destroyed upon court order."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55376/whats-the-impact-of-this-late-fee-typo", "docs_id": 55376, "title": "What&#39;s the impact of this late fee typo?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My landlord has a late fee clause in our lease, which says that if the lessee is late with the rent, the lessor must pay a (poorly defined) late fee.\n\nWhat would be the effect of this clause?\n\n1.

If the literal reading of the contract is crazy, the California Civil Code's rules for the [*Interpretation of Contracts*](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&division=3.&title=3.&part=2.&chapter=&article=) tells its courts: *ignore the crazy reading.*\n\nHere is what the statute says:\n\n> \u00a7 1636 A contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the **mutual intention** of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.\n\nTo win under this section, you would need to claim that both you and the landlord **intended** that the landlord would pay the late fee. No judge would believe this.\n\n> \u00a7 1637 For the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the parties to a contract, **if otherwise doubtful,** the rules given in this Chapter are to be applied.\n\nTo win under this section, you would need to claim that there is **no doubt** that both you and the landlord intended that the landlord would pay the late fee. Again, no judge would believe this.\n\n> \u00a7 1638 The language of a contract is to govern its interpretation, if the language is clear and explicit, and **does not involve an absurdity.**\n\nTo win under this section, you would need to claim that it was **reasonable** that the landlord would pay the late fee. Again, no judge would believe this.\n\n> \u00a7 1640 When, through fraud, **mistake**, or **accident**, a written contract **fails to express the real intention** of the parties, such intention is to be regarded, and the **erroneous parts of the writing disregarded.**\n\nTo win under this section, you would also need to claim that both you and the landlord **really** intended that the landlord would pay the late fee. Since no judge would believe this, any judge would rule that the wording was a mistake, and should be disregarded.\n\n> \u00a7 1643 A contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful, operative, definite, **reasonable,** and capable of being carried into effect, if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.\n\nDitto."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A lease agreement contains a clause stating, \"If the lessee is late with rent payment, the lessor must pay a late fee of $100.\" According to California contract interpretation laws, how would a court likely interpret this clause?\n\nA) The clause would be enforced as written, requiring the lessor to pay themselves $100 for the lessee's late payment.\nB) The clause would be considered void for absurdity, and the entire lease agreement would be nullified.\nC) The court would interpret the clause to mean the lessee must pay the lessor a $100 late fee, disregarding the erroneous wording.\nD) The clause would be struck from the agreement, but the rest of the lease would remain valid and enforceable.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to California Civil Code sections on contract interpretation, courts are instructed to interpret contracts to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties and avoid absurd results. Section 1638 states that contract language should govern interpretation unless it \"involves an absurdity.\" Section 1640 allows courts to disregard erroneous parts of writing that fail to express the real intention of the parties due to mistake or accident. Section 1643 requires contracts to be interpreted in a way that makes them reasonable and capable of being carried into effect.\n\nIn this case, it's absurd to think that both parties intended for the landlord to pay themselves a late fee for the tenant's tardiness. A court would likely determine that this wording was a mistake and interpret the clause to mean what was clearly intended: that the lessee (tenant) must pay the lessor (landlord) a $100 late fee for late rent payments. This interpretation aligns with common practice and the probable mutual intention of the parties at the time of contracting."}, "53": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61988/is-it-illegal-to-carry-an-improvised-pepper-spray-in-the-uk", "docs_id": 61988, "title": "Is it illegal to carry an improvised pepper spray in the UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Civilian possession of pepper spray is banned in the UK, due to its use in self\\-defence.\n\nThere are, of course, many household items that can have a similar purpose.

An example is [42\\.56 RCW Public Records Act](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/Rcw/default.aspx?cite=42.56&full=true). Generally, you have to make available any public record.

The agreement is recorded on a voice recorder but not written down. Dr. Smith performs the surgery successfully, but Johnson refuses to pay, citing the lack of a written contract. What is the most likely legal outcome?\n\nA) The contract is void, and Johnson is not required to pay.\nB) The contract is valid and enforceable, and Johnson must pay $50,000.\nC) The contract is valid but unenforceable, so the court cannot compel Johnson to pay.\nD) The contract is now fully valid and enforceable due to Dr. Smith's performance, and Johnson must pay $50,000.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of valid but unenforceable contracts and the effect of performance. The oral agreement is valid but would typically be unenforceable due to lack of written evidence. However, since Dr. Smith fully performed his part of the contract by completing the surgery, the contract becomes executed and can no longer be rescinded under the Statute of Frauds. This makes the contract fully valid and enforceable, requiring Johnson to pay the agreed amount. Option A is incorrect because the contract is not void, just potentially unenforceable before performance. Option B is incorrect because without performance, the court might not enforce an oral contract for such a large amount. Option C would be correct if Dr. Smith had not yet performed the surgery, but becomes incorrect once he completes it."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28993/just-how-different-is-the-legal-situation-in-germany-under-gdpr-compared-to-prev", "docs_id": 28993, "title": "Just how different is the legal situation in Germany under GDPR compared to previously with respect to running a website?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A frequent statement with respect to making German websites GDPR\\-compliant is that barely anything has changed in Germany with DSGVO (the German version of GDPR) and the previously applicable national law (BDSG).\n\nAt the same time, while many aspects of GDPR are still considered unclear or disputed, there seems to be pretty much a consensus in Germany that any website owner1 whose site is hosted on the server of a 3rd party will have to sign a [contract for processing on behalf](http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-28-processor-GDPR.htm) with the webhoster.2 This appears the case even if the webhoster merely handles visitors' IP addresses such as for security logging purposes.\n\nWhile I concede companies and people as a whole used to be sloppy about former privacy laws and very late at starting to prepare for GDPR, the requirement for those specific contracts with webhosters are generally implied to be something new. Webhosting companies have started to offer the respective contract templates only recently as a part of their GDPR preparation, and articles point out these contracts as something to take care of to make one's site GDPR\\-ready, especially including non\\-commercial fan sites, blogs, and similar.\n\n**Was there3 a requirement to have such a contract with one's webhoster for non\\-commercial/hobbyist websites before GDPR?** (If so, was it simply widely ignored, especially on sites hosted abroad, where hosters wouldn't know about (and be unwilling to sign?) such contracts?\n\nEDIT: The only thorough essay on the topic I have found so far is a [blogpost on CR\\-online](https://www.cr-online.de/blog/2018/05/16/ds-gvo-es-aendert-sich-doch-gar-nicht-so-viel/) (in German). It specifically addresses the situation of non\\-commerical and/or small services (coming to the conclusion that from the point of view of these services, the claim that \"not much has changed\" is a \"myth\") and points out that the obligations for internal documentation have been considerably extended. However, it does not concretely discuss any particular setups such as \"running a website\".\n\n---\n\n1: Except for websites maintained as a part of a [\"purely personal or household activity\"](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/), but it seems disputed whether any publicly accessible website can meet these criteria at all.\n\n2: My understanding is that the website owner ensures towards visitors the visitors' personal data will not be used for anything beyond what is stated in the site's privacy note, and the contract for processing on behalf is the website owner's legal handle to also ensure the webhoster does not exceed the boundaries of the privacy policy (or informs the website owner in time so they can update their privacy note).\n\n3: Either from BDSG itselt, or based upon some EU\\-wide regulation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 2009 edition of BDSG in [section 1](https://dejure.org/gesetze/BDSG_a.F./1.html) describes the BDSG specifically not to apply for computerized data being collected, processed or used exclusively for personal or family activities:\n\n> Dieses Gesetz gilt f\u00fcr die Erhebung, Verarbeitung und Nutzung\n>  personenbezogener Daten durch \\[\u2026] nicht\\-\u00f6ffentliche Stellen, soweit\n>  sie die Daten unter Einsatz von Datenverarbeitungsanlagen verarbeiten,\n>  nutzen oder daf\u00fcr erheben oder die Daten in oder aus nicht\n>  automatisierten Dateien verarbeiten, nutzen oder daf\u00fcr erheben, es sei\n>  denn, die Erhebung, Verarbeitung oder Nutzung der Daten erfolgt\n>  ausschlie\u00dflich f\u00fcr pers\u00f6nliche oder famili\u00e4re T\u00e4tigkeiten.\n\n(BDSG 2009, \u00a71, 2\\.3\\)\n\nDepending on one's interpretation, there is some overlap between \"personal or familiy activities\" and \"non\\-commercial/hobbyist\", but other than this, German website owners are very likely to be bound to BDSG 2009\\.\n\n[Section 11](https://dejure.org/gesetze/BDSG_a.F./11.html) has been enacted in September 2009 and is named \"Erhebung, Verarbeitung oder Nutzung personenbezogener Daten im Auftrag\" (Collection, processing or use of personal data on behalf) and describes data storage and processing via a contractor.\n\nDrastically shortened and oversimplified: if you're asking someone else to store or process data on your behalf, you're still responsible to enforce data protection of the stored/processed data and you'll need to have a written contract with your contractor to address this topic. This contract should outline how and which data is to be stored/processed, how (technical and organizational means) this data is being protected, that your contractor will notify you for data protection violations by the contractor or their employees and that any data is being deleted when the contract has been finished.\n\nDepending on a few circumstances, your current web hosting contract or T\\&C with your web host may already be sufficient to satisfy both BDSG and GDPR requirements.\n\nAt least from a German perspective, you and your web host have demonstrated implied conduct (\"konkludentes Verhalten\") of storing personal data according to BDSG: by offering web site storage, usually access to server log files and some email service as well, a German web host does offer contractor services according to BDSG and are most likely about to store personal information (server logs, email messages). Most web hosts also do describe their infrastructure in detail, so you've also some outline of their technical measures to protect your data. \n\nSo: if you as a German resident did sign a contract with a German web host company after September 2009, you've both most likely agreed by implication to have that web host company to store, process and use personal data as regulated by BDSG.\n\nIf\n\n* your legal advisor does not follow this idea of implied conduct to be \"safe enough\",\n* your specific contract may be too old to correctly meet BDSG 2009 requirements or\n* you've made your contract with a foreign web host who didn't consider to be possibly impacted by some German law,\n\nyou may want to have a specific agreement with your web host in order to satisfy BDSG and/or GDPR requirements.\n\nMost web hosts are used to inquiries regarding which standards or regulations they are compliant with and how those do relate to one's specific product (for example, a web host may be PCIDSS\\-compliant to handle credit card information in a safe way, but this won't cover your self\\-written PHP script running on their shared web hosting server farm. While those confirmations are certainly less than a \"written contract\", they do give you some idea of how serious the web host does take their job to secure your data. \n\nAs you've already noticed, web hosts today do offer a free \"data processing contract\" as an amendment to your existing contract to legally assure how they're storing and processing data.\n\nSuch a contract usually doesn't imply any obligations to you, but still may be important. Why: according to BDSG and GDPR, you're still responsible regarding your user's data. If your web host experiences a data breach and loses your user's data, your behavior of NOT having a written contract might be seen as \"reckless\" in a legal dispute. A written contract saves you from that and also offers you the opportunity to file a complaint against your web host for violating that contract in order to redeem for damages.\n\n**So in summary:** BDSG from 1st of September 2009 does already address your specific topics in a very similar way than the GDPR does, asking for a written contract. As the GDPR has been presented in January 2012, the BDSG did already address your specific topic before the GDPR has been enacted or even been presented.\n\nThe website requirements have to be met by website owners, regardless of where they're hosting their site. If website owners did silently ignore those requirements or implicitely agreed via implied conduct is hard to answer and only known to each website owner. There are also many more, often very specific factors like the age of the contract and the corresponding applicable law. So that part of the question is hard to answer and probably will never come to a profound conclusion."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) of 2009, which of the following statements is correct regarding the requirement for a contract between a website owner and their web hosting provider for processing personal data?\n\nA) The BDSG 2009 did not require any form of agreement between website owners and web hosts for personal data processing.\n\nB) The BDSG 2009 required an explicit written contract between all website owners and their web hosts, regardless of the nature of the website.\n\nC) The BDSG 2009 required some form of agreement for data processing, which could potentially be satisfied through implied conduct in certain circumstances.\n\nD) The BDSG 2009 only required contracts for commercial websites, exempting all non-commercial and hobby websites.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The BDSG 2009, particularly Section 11, addressed the collection, processing, and use of personal data on behalf of others. While it did require a form of agreement, this didn't always necessitate an explicit written contract. In some cases, especially with German web hosts after September 2009, the agreement could potentially be satisfied through implied conduct. The law applied to both commercial and non-commercial websites, with some exceptions for purely personal or family activities. However, the interpretation and implementation of these requirements could vary, and many website owners may have been unaware of or ignored these obligations, especially when using foreign web hosts."}}
