Purposes (1\\) and (2\\) are known as *injunctive relief* and *declaratory relief*, respectively.\n\nInjunctive relief is arguably more drastic and is intended for situations where *irreparable loss* is imminent or very likely.

While the co-owner's work schedule is a valid concern, the property manager's business hours and responsibilities must also be taken into account. The law does not give absolute preference to either party's convenience. Therefore, the most appropriate action would be to negotiate a mutually agreeable time that accommodates both the co-owner's need to access records outside of typical work hours and the property manager's operational constraints."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50441/rights-to-deal-with-tresspassing-livestock-new-zealand", "docs_id": 50441, "title": "Rights to deal with tresspassing livestock (New Zealand)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a herd of sheep which keep coming onto my land, \"fertilising\" the ground and killing my fruit trees \\- and despite my efforts I have been unable to locate the owner of the sheep (The property they are meant to be on is rented, but the sheep dont belong to the tenants and the owner has not contacted me despite asking those tenants for help. \n\nI am at the point where I need to take further action.

While there may not be a specific law mandating the repair of a stopcock, the landlord has a responsibility to maintain the property in a safe condition. Knowing about a non-functioning stopcock and failing to address it could be seen as negligence. If water damage occurs that could have been prevented by a working stopcock, the landlord might be held liable for the damages.

Even if not directly asked, there's an implicit assumption that the returned item is in its original condition. This omission prevents the seller from making an informed decision about the return and potentially impacts their ability to resell or refurbish the item.

By hiring family members (like a son) as actors and paying them inflated salaries, the company can transfer illegal funds to individuals in a way that appears legitimate. The recipient (in this case, the son) can then use the money for personal expenses (like college tuition) after paying income tax, effectively laundering the money from its illegal origins into a seemingly legal source of income.

The current law does not prevent a polygamist or someone who practiced polygamy in the past or expresses a belief in polygamy from being eligible for an immigrant visa.

When Congress passed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251, the purpose was to indicate that the jurisdiction described in Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 would no longer be exclusive. Congress used the word \"parties\" and that has not been found to be less inclusive than what is covered by Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 (but simply because the case that would tease out the distinction has not arisen).\n\nPerhaps there is some circumstance where the property interest of a non\\-party ambassador might be affected such that the Supreme Court would have original jurisdiction, but 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b)(1\\) would not operate to give concurrent jurisdiction to other courts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the interpretation of Article III, Section 2, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(b)(1), which of the following scenarios would most likely fall under the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction?\n\nA) A civil lawsuit where a foreign ambassador's property is indirectly affected, but the ambassador is not a party to the case\nB) A criminal case against a U.S. citizen for assaulting a foreign consul, where the consul is not a party but a witness\nC) A dispute between two U.S. citizens over a contract, where a foreign minister's testimony is crucial but they are not a party\nD) A case where a foreign ambassador is directly suing a U.S. state for breach of contract\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the correct answer because it involves a foreign ambassador as a direct party to the case, which clearly falls under both the constitutional provision of \"affecting Ambassadors\" and the statutory language of \"to which ambassadors... are parties.\"\n\nOption A, while potentially \"affecting\" an ambassador's interests, does not make the ambassador a party to the case.

He breaks a date (to screw another woman instead) and sends his identical twin, Harry, in his place. Ginny has such a good time with Harry that she tries to convince him to come back to her place for sex.

Draco agrees because he\u2019s really just using Ginny for sex anyway.\n\nAfter three years of marriage, Draco thinks Ginny is getting suspicious, and coming between him and Harry. Draco resolves that Ginny has to go. Draco tries to shoot Ginny, but Harry steps in at the last minute and shoots Draco in the head, saving Ginny\u2019s life (and the life of her unborn child, and a police officer Draco has left for dead in the bathtub upstairs).\n\nHarry confesses their entire scam to the police.

Even without Ginny, the prosecutor would bring charges of rape. Whether a jury would deliver a guilty verdict is another matter.\n\nUnder s76 of the Sexual Offences Act 2006, it is possible to commit rape by gaining consent through deception. \n\nThe Riddle of Rape\\-by\\-Deception and the Myth of Sexual Autonomy says that \"rape by deception is almost universally rejected in American criminal law.\" But this is England.\n\nAnd Mr Justice Stephens said, \"the only sorts of fraud which so far destroy the effect of a woman's consent as to convert a connection consented to in fact into a rape are frauds as to the nature of the act itself, or as to the identity of the person who does the act.

There are some doubts from my perspective which I would like to clear out with the discussions that arise from this questions.\n\n1. Do we need a user's consent when being contacted by a contact form?\n\nMany (almost all to be exact) lawyers advise companies to seek consent from the user on the contact form. This sounds ridiculous, as what happens when the user sends you a direct email (without using contact form) with a bunch of his personal data (which you, as a business, did not ask from the user)? How could you know what data the user might send? He might even send the data on purpose and sue your company for not having included in the privacy policy that your business is processing the data that the user has sent. How does this make sense? Isn't the action of voluntarily sending an email to anyone a direct consent (you are aware that you sent the email from your own email address and you yourself have decided to reveal some or all of your personal data to the person/business you are sending an email to)?\n\n2. Managing consent\n\nIf the answer to the first question is \"YES\", that how do we manage the consents? Consents must be fully manageable so the user can withdraw it at any time. So, do we store each and every email in a database? Storing it in an Excel table would not be a wise way according to the GDPR, as you literally cannot protect Excel worksheet from being read (yes, for all those around who think that protecting the workbook with a password is enough, no it is not, there are hundreds of tools that will crack the password and open the workbook). And then again, GDPR is not meant to drive the business to its own doom. It is not meant to harden that way that the business does its own core business, but it is meant to protect the data of the subjects.\n\n---\n\nI suppose the information above is enough for a start of good discussion as to whether the user's consent should be asked when filling out a contact form.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My interpretation of the GDPR when it comes to a contact form is as long as your privacy notice states that what data you collect in the contact form and what legal basis that data is used for you are fine.\n\nSomeone submitting a contact form in my opinion is their consent to reply back to them regarding the data in which they have submitted.\n\nAnother good clause to have in your privacy policy is to basically state if the user submits information about another natural person that they have consent from that natural person for that data and what it would be used for.\n\nThe internet is the internet. People have been trolling it for years. People have also submitted false information for years. The best a business can do is simply outline what their site does, what data is collected and what it will be used for. That along with what legal basis it\u2019s processed for and following it makes you GDPR compliant in that regard. As to withdrawing consent and the rights given by the GDPR that\u2019s all specific to what infustructure a business has in place.\n\nAs a developer I know the headaches of the GDPR. Most of it resides in the fact data is not centralized and thus can\u2019t easily be retrieved, modified, or removed.

And, child support orders are binding even if the person obligated to make child support payments doesn't live in the same state as the state issuing the child support order.\n\nUnder those guidelines child support is based upon the father's income, the mother's income, the number of nights the child spends with each parent, and certain extraordinary expenses or in kind payments in lieu of child support. The definitions of income used, generally speaking, track those of federal tax law, which are incorporated by reference in state child support statutes, rather than state specific property and income concepts. But, there could be isolated cases where most income is derived from the property of a married person, where state community property laws could modestly tweak the amount of a parent's income.\n\nProperty ownership is not a factor in the amount of child support that is owed (in all but the most extraordinary cases that justify a departure from the child support guidelines, typically with uber\\-wealthy families), so it doesn't matter if the state has community property or not.\n\nThe laws of the child's \"home state\" as determined under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and Parental Kidnapping Protection Act governs which state's law governs child support determinations and which state's courts have jurisdiction to enter child support orders regarding a child.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A child support order is issued in State X, which is not a community property state.

Child support orders are binding across state lines, and the original issuing state's laws generally continue to govern the order. The fact that the non-custodial parent moved to a community property state does not significantly impact the child support calculation or enforcement. State Y's courts would have the authority to enforce and potentially modify the order, but would typically apply State X's laws in doing so. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because child support calculations generally do not consider community property laws or new spouse income. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because existing child support orders do not become void when a parent moves to a new state. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because community property laws typically do not provide grounds for reducing child support obligations, as child support is based on the individual parent's income, not marital property."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22081/can-restaurants-call-cops-on-customers-who-leave-fake-jesus-money-as-tip", "docs_id": 22081, "title": "Can restaurants call cops on customers who leave fake &quot;Jesus money&quot; as tip?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been reading that in the US there's a thing where certain kinds of people leave fake bills with just a corner showing just the dollar amount and the rest hidden under a napkin or peeking out of the check holder, but upon closer inspection turns out to be not real money.

In this scenario, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed facts. In such cases, appellate courts generally defer to the trial court's factual findings if they are supported by admissible evidence in the record. The appellate court would likely review any legal conclusions or interpretations de novo, but would not re-weigh the credibility of witnesses or overturn factual findings supported by evidence.

Did I misunderstand? This whole thing seems pretty fishy! Is it even necessary?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends upon how the property was titled at your dad's death.\n\nIf the property was titled as joint tenants with right of survivorship, the title transfers to your mom by operation of law, and you would ordinarily record a certified copy of the death certificate along with an affidavit establishing that the person named in the death certificate and the person whose name appears on the deed are one and the same person, in the real property records. This makes it clear on the face of the public record that the transfer by operation of law upon his death has occurred. It would be better practice to pay the quite low price an attorney would charge to make sure that this is done right.\n\nIf the property was titled as a tenancy in common (which is true unless the words \"with right of survivorship\" or \"JTWROS\" appear on the face of the deed placing them in title together), then the ownership of your dad's undivided percentage ownership interest in the house must be done via the probate process which is governed by his will, if he had one, and by the laws of intestate succession, if he did not have a will. The person named in a will, if there is one, would have priority to be named as executor, and would seek that appointment in a petition filed with the appropriate court in Florida with probate jurisdiction. If there is no will, your mom is probably the person with priority to be appointed, but can waive that in favor of her children (any sibling with have to waive priority or be jointly appointed). Once the executor is appointed by a court and issued a document called \"letters\", they execute an executor's deed (which is a special form) from the decedent to the person entitled to inherit it. Either way, you should have an attorney handle the probate court filing.\n\nIt is highly desirable to clear up the record title in one way or the other, as this must be done before any sale to a third party and before any new mortgage is obtained, it will simplify inheritance at your mother's death if she still owns it at that point, and it will prevent property tax bills from being issued to your deceased father potentially creating a complicated probate case.

To clarify this transfer in public records, the correct procedure is to record a certified copy of the death certificate along with an affidavit in the real property records.

The key case might be [Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo 418 US 241 (1974\\)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1973/73-797). In this case, it was deemed unconstitutional that *a newspaper would need to host speech* of a political candidate the newspaper didn't like in the same amount it had used to disparage that candidate.\n\nWhile the Miami Herald brought the newspaper into the line by the action of the newspaper, [Wooley v. Maynard 430 U.S. 705 (1977\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/430/705/) held that the state could not force *any* citizen to host its motto.

Pp. 71717\\.\n\nForcing a public web page to host advertisement or speech from any government \\- or under the threat of the government action \\- is compelled speech and violates the rulings of Miami Herald, Wooley and other cases.\n\nHowever, there is a little light for the government under PruneYard, Turner Broadcasting and Rumsfeld. However, all of them don't cut here: Turner Broadcasting was about a service provider for radio that did not host its own speech. PruneYard is a shopping center that doesn't host its own speech and is only useful in California as there is a California constitution issue.

That is why many young couples convert to a single religion to get married quickly.\n\n#### Inheritance\n\n* If one's ancestors identified with a specific religion, and one identifies with another religion, then that could affect one's inheritance.\n* The inheritance of a person, especially a woman, could also be affected by them marrying outside their religion or state.\n\nSo, if one decides to become the first generation atheist in a family (against the wishes of the family or the larger religious community), their inheritance and their rights (especially if they are engaged in agriculture) could be severely affected. This becomes all the more difficult, if the business of their family is not incorporated as a company under the Companies Act.\n\nIf you are professional or a first generation business owner, then you shouldn't have legal challenges but primary and secondary social challenges.\nPrimary social challenges could be people not ready to deal with you or engage with you if you declare publicly that you are an atheist. Secondary social challenges, would be to be able to find a lawyer (in your town and whose services are affordable) who can address these challenges.

Could you have the second by itself, or does it require the first?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two terms going on. Putting them into plainer English (and imagining an argumentative lawyer and a hidebound judge!) will show why they are there.\n\nOne says that if a single term of the contract is found to be prohibited and against the law to have in a contract, the rest of the contract is not to be affected (the defective term won't make the whole contract illegal and unenforceable), just that one term is affected. \n\nThe other says, if the term only became illegal/unenforceable because of something \"going too far\", then it won't be struck out at all, it will be replaced with whatever the court considers \"as far as it could go and still be valid\".\n\nExamples (extreme but should help explain!):\n\nYou agree to borrow $500 for rent against a pawned ring, and to repay on the following terms (no idea why but anyhow!):\n\n1. You are charged interest at $200 a day until repaid\n2. If you don't repay me by the due date you have agreed to become my slave, kill the president, and forego any human rights you may have.\n\nThe court says the 2nd of those terms is illegal \\- you can't give up human rights or make a legally binding contract to murder even if you tried to agree to do so. But because the clause is \"severable\", the rest of the contract isn't made illegal just because that one term is, so you still have to repay me, I still have to give you back your pawned ring if you do, etc.\n\nThe court also says the 1st of those terms is illegal, because the law in this state prohibits loan interest over 30% p.a. without a doctors certificate of sanity. The judge rules that while interest is legal, $$200 a day breaks the law and is excessive (unlike the other clause which was illegal and couldn't be fixed by \"tweaking\" it in this kind of way). The illegally high $200 a day is replaced by the legal (but still high) 30% p.a. rather than just being removed from the contract (which would, unreasonably, leave you without any obligation to pay any interest at all).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A contract contains the following severability clause:\n\"If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, and if limiting such provision would make the provision valid, then such provision shall be deemed to be construed as so limited.\"\n\nThe contract also includes a term stating that the borrower must pay a $500 late fee for any missed payment. Local law caps late fees at $100. How would a court likely interpret this situation?\n\nA) The entire late fee provision would be struck from the contract, leaving no late fee.\nB) The court would reduce the late fee to $100 in accordance with local law.\nC) The entire contract would be deemed unenforceable due to the illegal late fee.\nD) The court would have to maintain the $500 late fee as written in the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The severability clause in this contract allows for \"limiting\" an unenforceable provision to make it valid. In this case, the $500 late fee exceeds the legal limit of $100. Rather than striking the entire provision or deeming the whole contract unenforceable, the court would likely reduce (or \"limit\") the late fee to the maximum allowable amount of $100.

However, on this point states will be broadly quite similar. The \"strap down\" part is the Class C felony [false imprisonment](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.40.040) (knowingly restraining another person). Nakedness does not add anything. Cutting anything off is the Class A felony [first degree assault](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.36.011) (assault by means likely to produce great bodily harm). [Great bodily harm](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.110)\nincludes bodily injury which causes a significant permanent loss of any bodily part. The law does not define what is \"significant\". Painkillers do not change what the crime is, nor does the specific body part. 1st degree assault covers a wide range of actions, since it also includes assaults that could have resulted in great bodily harm, but did not actually.\n\nThe penalty for a class A felony is a maximum of life imprisonment and $50,000 fine.

The doctrine can be seen in mid 20th century Supreme Court decisions; the 1959 cases of Abbate v. United States and Bartkus v. Illinois ruled in affirmation of the doctrine.\n\nLets say the Supreme Court rules that double jeopardy rules should apply even if the crime is prosecutable under both federal and state laws. In this case, how could the federal and state governments possibly agree on who gets to prosecute a given crime? Are there examples of other countries solving a similar issue in their jurisdiction?\n\nAs an example, lets say Washington state wants to protect its marijuana industry against federal prosecution. It then creates a law mandating a $500 fine for anyone found violating federal marijuana laws.

It freezes and potentially transfers funds directly from the debtor's account.\n\n2.

What you describe is theft, as defined under RCW 9A.56\\.020, and that is a crime. Defenses are available only in case of an open taking made under a good faith claim to title to the property (\"it's my money\"), or an irrelevant defense related to pallet theft from a pallet recycler. There is no exception arising for goods \"in the possession of a criminal organization\".\n\nThere is also no applicable attainder process for declaring an organization to be a \"criminal organization\" to which such an exception could be referred, in Washington or any other state that I am familiar with. At the federal level, [18 USC Ch. 96](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-96) does not have a provision for declaring some organization to be a \"criminal organization\", but it does prohibit using proceeds from \"a pattern of [racketeering activity](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-1935430617-1438920309&term_occur=5&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:96:section:1962)\" that a person or organization participated in, to support a business engaged in interstate or foreign commerce. There is an extensive but specific list of trigger crimes, which are all federal crimes. Supposing that a state wanted to make it legal to steal from criminals, there would have to be a suitable definition of \"criminal\". Compare the various sex offender laws, where under dell\\-defined circumstances, a person is legally declared to be a sex offender required to register.\n\nIf the property is in fact the proceeds of a criminal activity (not merely \"in the possession of a criminal\") or is used to support criminal activities, it might be seized under [civil forfeiture](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21291/why-hasnt-civil-asset-forfeiture-been-ruled-unconstitutional) statutes. However, those statutes only allow the government to seize the property \u2013 vigilante civil forfeiture is still theft, a crime for which you can be prosecuted.

According to the documentation, taking money that belongs to someone else, even if it's a criminal organization, is still considered theft under the law. There are no exceptions for stealing from criminals or criminal organizations. The individual's intention to report the criminal activity does not justify or legalize the act of taking the money. Civil forfeiture laws only allow the government to seize assets, not private individuals. Additionally, publicly declaring stolen money does not protect one from prosecution for theft.

Suppose that the intended paintings are stylized paintings of popular celebs.\n\nWould doing so be an infringement of copyright? What legal issues might be involved?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Maybe\n=====\n\nPermission may or may not be needed under two different kinds of laws, depending on the specific jurisdiction (not stated in the question), and the specific facts.\n\nRight of Publicity\n------------------\n\nIn some, but not all, US states, and in some, but not all non\\-US jurisdictions, there is such a thing as a [\"*Right of Publicity*\"](https://www.inta.org/topics/right-of-publicity/) also known as a \"*right of personality*\" or \"*right to prevent appropriation of identity*\". This right allows a person to control how his or her likeness or appearance, and also the person's name, are commercially exploited. This right covers the use of a person's image for advertising. In some but not all jurisdictions it also covers selling images of the person. It is most often invoked by celebrities, but can be invoked by anyone whose image could be so exploited. However it does not cover the use of an image for news reporting (at least not in New York State).\n\nIf the artist works in a jurisdiction that recognizes this right, permission to use the subject's appearance must be obtained. Otherwise the subject could sue for damages. Permission may be denied, or granted on whatever terms the subject chooses, and may involve a fee or royalty.\n\nIf the artist works in a jurisdiction that does **not** recognize this right, permission for such use is not required.\n\nIn some jurisdictions any Right of Publicity ends with the subject's death, in others it lasts for a limited time (often 5\\-10 years). See the article linked above.\n\nTrademark protection\n--------------------\n\nSome celebrities register their names and/or images as trademarks for additional protection. This would prevent anyone from lawfully using the mark to advertise or endorse goods or services, but probably would **not** protect against a stand\\-alone image not used to advertise anything nor to identify any goods or services. Note: most people, even most celebrities, do not register such a trademark.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nIf a picture is created (drawn, painted, or in any other medium) based on an existing work that is protected by copyright, such as a photograph or video, it will be a *derivative work* of the original, and the permission of the copyright holder would be required. The holder may refuse permission or charge any fee or royalty s/he pleases and can get the artist to agree to.\n\nHowever, copyright does not protect **ideas**, including the idea of a particular person's image. If an artist is able to observe a particular person directly, the artist may depict that person without any permission being required (at least in the US). If an artist uses several different source images from different creators, and does not base a new image primarily on any one of them, the image is probably not a derivative work, and no permission will be needed. If the artist is in the US, and the derived work is different in purpose and function, and does not compete with the original, it **may** be fair use. (For example, a painting based on a person's appearance in a broadcast news report.) Fair use can be tricky, and always depends on the specific facts of the case. It is well beyond the scope of an answer here to predict if a particular use will be held to be a fair use. The only way to know for **sure** is to be sued and have a court decide, although an opinion from an experienced copyright lawyer would be reasonably persuasive.\n\nAlso fair use is a specifically US legal concept, and does not apply anywhere else. Other countries have other exceptions to copyright, some quite narrow and specific (such as an exception for news reporting) and some rather broad (such as the \"fair dealing\" exception in the UK). What will fall under any exception must be determined in light of the law of a particular country, and of the specific facts of the matter.\n\nTorts\n-----\n\nIt should be noted that violations of the right of publicity, infringements of trademarks, and infringements of copyrights are all ***torts***. That is, they only way in which they are enforces is through the private suits of rights\\-holders. If the rights\\-holder in any particular case does not know of the violation, or does not choose to sue, perhaps beause it might be more costly in time or money than the damages would justify, then there will be no enforcement. This is not something potential infringer ought to rely on, but it should be taken into account.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nIn short, what permissions are needed depend on the jurisdiction in which the artist works (country and state or province in some countries) and on how any picture is derived from a source. There cannot be any final answer about personality rights without knowing the jurisdiction, and there cannot be any final answer about copyright without knowing details about how an image would be creates, as well as the jurisdiction.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An artist in California wants to create and sell stylized paintings of famous celebrities on Etsy.

Right of Publicity: California has strong right of publicity laws that allow individuals, especially celebrities, to control the commercial use of their likeness. The artist would need to obtain permission from the celebrities to use their images commercially.\n\n2.

Affirmation: I solemnly affirm that the evidence that I shall give, shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\n\nIt seems to me that anyone willing to say that with a straight face is not a credible witness for a range of reasons.

Is there any standard? Or any penalty for not meeting the standard, if a standard exists?\n2. human memory and perception are limited. Are those caveats implicit in the process? The oath doesn't say \"to the best of my knowledge and as accurately as I can recall\" it says \"truth\" unconditionally. Using the cliche \"do you know what colour this pen is?\" question, the only truthful answer must be \"no\", since colour perception is both limited and biased, as well as the actual colour being a matter of opinion (viz, reasonable people can disagree).\n3. What does \"whole truth\" mean? It's obviously insane to require every witness to begin their testimony at the first instant of the big bang. But to permit otherwise means leaving something out. How and where does the law draw the line between \"only tell us what you want to\" and \"tell the whole truth\"?\n\nHow do legal systems resolve those questions? Are the terms just taken to be legal jargon and redefined in non\\-obvious ways? I can't find those re\\-definitions, so presumably it's all so obvious that only an idiot would need it made explicit. Count me as that idiot...\n\nEdit: to make it explicit, I'd like links or references that lay these \"obvious\" things out. Examples would be handy.

The truth, essentially, is the set of facts that you believe to be true.\n2. Yes.\n3. It means that you will not lie by omission, and that you will provide the relevant facts. No, you don't need to recount history since the first instant of the big bang.\n\nOnly *expert* witnesses may answer by giving their opinion or evaluation. This is presumed accurate by their experience and where it is not accurate, the other side may present opposing expert witnesses to contest their conclusion or evaluation.\n\nLaypeople are permitted to answer only with their recollection of facts. Lawyers may not ask them what their opinion is, although by your definition every question is about opinion, since perception and memory is limited. But the question \"What colour was Mr Smith's house?\" and \"What architectural style informed the facade of Mr Smith's house?\" require different amounts of expertise and opinion.\n\n\"Truth\" isn't jargon, or even technical language here. I generally aim to be truthful, and so when someone asks me what time it is, I don't feel compelled to answer to the nano/picosecond. Would you call me a liar? Am I lying by omission?\n\nSimilarly, if someone asks me what colour a car is, I don't feel compelled to say \"I can't possibly know, because my perception may differ from yours.\n\nIf you honestly feel that when someone asks you to be truthful about something, then you must either be lying, or lying by omission if you don't start your answer with the first instant of the big bang, your problem is not one of law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal interpretation of the witness oath, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the concept of \"truth\" in court testimony?\n\nA) Truth is an absolute, objective reality that witnesses must perfectly convey regardless of their personal limitations.\n\nB) Truth refers only to facts that can be scientifically proven beyond any doubt.\n\nC) Truth is the set of facts that the witness sincerely believes to be true based on their recollection and perception.\n\nD) Truth is a flexible concept that allows witnesses to freely interpret events according to their personal opinions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legal system takes a practical approach to the concept of \"truth\" in witness testimony.

A person often cannot claim self defense if they are already committing a forcible felony (but it depends on the circumstances)\n2. A person cannot claim self defense if they are the aggressor in a fight or took aggressive actions toward another person who then attacked them.\n\nSo, with that in mind, let's assume that Person A has a valid deadly self\\-defense claim against Person B. When considering self defense, the question is whether a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have feared death or grievous bodily harm. So, the exact sequence of events matters. Consider the following four scenarios:\n\nC watches B attack A and then A shoots B, C pulls out his gun and points it at A before A turns to him and points his gun in response\n\nC watches B attack A and then A shoots B, A then points his gun at C and C pulls out his gun in response\n\nC doesn't see B attack A and only sees A shoot B, C pulls out his gun and they stand off\n\nC doesn't see B attack A and only sees A shoot B, A then points his gun at C and C pulls his in response\n\nIn some of these situations, A may be considered the aggressor against C even though he had a valid self\\-defense claim against B. In others, a jury may find that a reasonable person in C's position would not expect A to shoot them just because they shot an attacker, and therefore C is the aggressor by drawing on A. This all assumes a hypothetical where these people exist in a void, things like their relationship, the situation around the three subjects, and any other relevant facts could be introduced and considered in the analysis.

However, the state Health Department considers 10 to 14 days to be a reasonable time in which a practitioner should respond to such a request.\n\nSo, while a timely response is desirable, a week is less than the legally enforceable period under HIPPA.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under HIPAA and New York State regulations, what is the maximum time frame a healthcare provider has to respond to a patient's request for access to their medical records?\n\nA) 7 business days\nB) 10 calendar days\nC) 30 calendar days, with a possible 30-day extension\nD) 14 calendar days\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nAccording to HIPAA regulations, a covered entity must act on an individual's request for access no later than 30 calendar days after receipt of the request. If unable to act within this timeframe, the entity may have up to an additional 30 calendar days, provided they give the individual a written statement explaining the delay within the initial 30-day period.\n\nWhile New York State considers 10 to 14 days a reasonable time for practitioners to respond to such requests, this is not a legally binding timeframe. The state regulation allows 10 days for providing an opportunity to inspect records, but does not specify a strict deadline for providing copies.\n\nOption A (7 business days) is incorrect as it's too short and not mentioned in either regulation.\nOption B (10 calendar days) is close to the NY State recommendation for inspection, but not the maximum allowed time.\nOption D (14 calendar days) is at the upper end of what NY State considers reasonable, but is not the maximum allowed by HIPAA.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as it accurately reflects the maximum time allowed under HIPAA regulations."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89135/if-a-rift-expands-the-surface-of-ones-land-e-g-resulting-from-an-earthquake", "docs_id": 89135, "title": "If a rift expands the surface of one&#39;s land (e.g., resulting from an earthquake), who owns the new land?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Looking at the geological pictures of the 2023 Turkey\u2013Syria earthquake made me wonder: If a rift expands the surface of one's land, who owns the new land (i.e., the rift)?\n\nI'm mostly interested in the United States.\n\n[Example of a rift that significantly expanded someone's property](https://www.turkiyegazetesi.com.tr/fotogaleri/deprem-sonrasi-dehsete-dusuren-goruntu-koca-tarla-ikiye-bolundu-32968?p=8#image-8):\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYcE6.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sYcE6.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [california](/questions/tagged/california \"show questions tagged 'california'\")\n\nThe relevant parties may go to court for an equitable solution.\n\nSee the [2010 California Code of Civil Procedure\nChapter 3\\.6\\.

(Even patients whose health insurance does not require a referral for the appointment to be covered?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Is there some reason you think they can't?\n\nIn general, anyone is free to do business, or refuse to do business, with anyone else.\n\nThere are a few restrictions on this. For example, certain businesses can't refuse to serve clients based on their membership in a protected class such as race or sex. I don't know how either federal or Massachusetts law treats medical practices with respect to anti\\-discrimination statutes, but it's fair to assume a \"whites only\" medical practice could find itself in hot water under certain circumstances.\n\nApart from the protected reasons, people are generally free to refuse to do business with anyone, for any reason. Someone couldn't come to your web design business and demand that you design their web page, and if you had a policy that you only accepted business on a referral basis, they couldn't sue you. And if you had a restaurant with a \"customers must wear pants\" policy, you could refuse to serve a pantsless patron. For the most part, a medical practice is no different.\n\nIt's possible a doctor might have signed a contract with a third\\-party payor (for example, your insurance company) saying that he or she has to accept that payor's policyholders without referrals. But absent any such consideration, a doctor is as free as anyone else to do business, or refuse to do business, with anyone he or she sees fit.\n\nThis only applies to nonemergency care, of course, which your question specified you were asking about. The question gets more complex in urgent/emergency situations, where there are specific laws about who is entitled to what treatment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, USA, under which of the following circumstances could a physician legally refuse to see a patient?\n\nA) The patient belongs to a protected class based on race or sex.\nB) The patient is not wearing pants in the physician's office.\nC) The patient requires urgent emergency care.\nD) The patient's insurance company has a contract with the physician requiring acceptance of all policyholders without referrals.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) Incorrect. Refusing to see a patient based on their membership in a protected class such as race or sex could be considered discrimination and may be illegal.\n\nB) Correct. Generally, physicians, like other businesses, can refuse service for reasons not related to protected classes. A dress code policy (such as requiring patients to wear pants) would be a legitimate reason to refuse service.\n\nC) Incorrect. In emergency situations, there are specific laws regarding who is entitled to treatment. Physicians typically cannot refuse urgent emergency care.\n\nD) Incorrect. If a physician has signed a contract with an insurance company agreeing to accept all policyholders without referrals, they would be bound by that agreement and could not refuse to see patients on this basis.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the general principle that physicians can refuse non-emergency service for most reasons, except those prohibited by anti-discrimination laws or contractual obligations."}}
