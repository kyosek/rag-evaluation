(They can arrive and ask to enter, as can your neighbors whether or not you own your home, but you are not required to acquiesce in either case).\n\nA landlord can view the publicly viewable portions of the property at their leisure, as can their agents, or any member of the public for that matter. \n\nA landlord could possibly be notified of a tenant's actions in a number of ways: such as viewing the public portions of the property, being notified (or billed) by utilities or public agencies, or receiving complaints from the neighbors.\n\nA neighbor has no more, and no less, legal ability to spy on you if you owned your home vs if you rent your home. So, they would have no more right to, say, spy at your house with a telescope than if you owned the property yourself, but no less right to complain if you have a loud (or audible) party or a large number of guests; the only difference being they can complain to someone who could potentially do much more than they could if you owned the property yourself.\n\nThus, the answer to your question depends on what is meant by \"spying\".\n\n\\*This assumes that this is a separate property; a landlord who rents out a room in their own home often has far greater rights.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A landlord suspects their tenant is violating the lease agreement.

A landlord, like any member of the public, has the right to view the publicly visible portions of the property from public spaces (e.g., the street) at any time. This does not infringe on the tenant's privacy or rights.\n\nThe key principle here is that while landlords have certain rights and responsibilities, they must respect the tenant's privacy and right to peaceful enjoyment of the rented property.

For myself, I'm sticking to traditional IT services and digital marketing. However, I was talking to a friend and he's not at all into technology (that's why I'm asking this question for him here, aside from my own curiosity). After I told him what I was doing, he was thinking of doing a similar business with bookkeeping and general legal services. We found some white label providers of these services (US\\-based), but he was concerned about legal issues since those are regulated industries.\n\nMy question is: is this sort of arbitrage legal for those kinds of industries?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Both law and accounting are subject to state regulation, so, at a minimum, work done remotely by non\\-licensed persons must be reviewed substantively and blessed by a local admitted professional before being shared with a client, and there are limits on what contacts with the client the back office can have.\n\nIn a legal context, the back office is limited to what a paralegal can do, and that varies considerably from one U.S. state to another, especially with respect to real property matters.\n\nMere \"book keeping\" as opposed to accounting is rarely a regulated profession under state law, but as in the case of legal services, the distinction between accounting that requires a license and activities that do not require a license varies from state to state (although less dramatically).\n\nThe notion of selling \"forms\" is well recognized, but what crosses over the line from selling a \"form\" to selling legal or accounting advice varies and can be treacherous.\n\nI don't know off hand if this is true for accountants in most states, but in most U.S. states non\\-lawyers are prohibited from having an equity or profits based interest in a law firm, and referral fee compensation is also subject to significant professional ethics regulation. Non\\-competition clauses involving lawyers are also subject to heavy professional ethics regulations not common to non\\-legal professional activities.\n\nWithout a more concrete example of what the dropservicing business model would entail, it is impossible to do a very definitive analysis. Your model seems to be based upon obtaining services from a third\\-party and re\\-selling those services. For the most part, that isn't a workable business model from a regulatory perspective in the U.S. Instead, you need licensed \"white label\" providers as the face of the business and you may potentially provide services behind them in the back office.\n\nThere are some services along this line currently in existence with varied business models involving somewhat similar concepts:\n\n* Legal forms companies like the recently succeeded [Bradford Publishing](https://cle.cobar.org/BradfordPublishingRelease).\n* [Hyatt Legal Services Plans](https://www.bbb.org/us/oh/cleveland/profile/legal-services/hyatt-legal-plans-0312-16002631/complaints)\n* Private legal services insurance such as [Legal Shield](https://www.legalshield.com/business-plan/get-legal-help-now?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=G_LS_US_SMB_Search_Non-Brand&utm_term=contract%20attorney&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksONPbKuZwehsd-XOD4b_pgPSB1Vk3gW05it6IgWJLAT4fki6Xbybx8aAqQYEALw_wcB).\n* [H\\&R Block](https://www.hrblock.com/) and also tax services.\n* The legal services provided by the [JAG Corps](https://www.goarmy.com/jag.html) to military service members.\n* [Nolo.com](https://www.nolo.com/)\n* Union sponsored legal services plans such as [Union Plus](https://www.unionplus.org/benefits/home/legal-help).\n* Title insurance companies such as [First American Title](https://www.firstam.com/) and related transaction execution companies.\n* The legal defense provided incident to a liability insurance policy by companies such as [Allstate](https://www.allstate.com/landingpages/lsp/auto-brand-general-desktop.html?CMP=KNC-T1-NA-DSK-GG-AU-MISC-B-070805-200515:allstate&TFN=&CAMPAIGN=444490000070805&affcode=p10430065301&ds_rl=1261774&s_kwcid=AL!9024!3!101473088408!e!!g!!allstate&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksMop9TAgLl19b9qP07uHnq4zVzjs2uDavRsOVi4d_khHyVl6qdq90kaAsZUEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).\n* Governmental shared risk pools such as [CIRSA](https://www.cirsa.org/).\n* Donation driven non\\-profits such as [the ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/give/fund-every-fight-ahead?cid=7014A000001Zs9uQAC&initms_aff=nat&initms_chan=sem&utm_medium=sem&initms=200114_evergreenun_sem-402136072447-85034109043-aclu%20national-b_segmenta_ggl&utm_source=ggl&utm_campaign=evergreenun&utm_content=200114_sem-402136072447-85034109043-aclu%20national-b_segmenta&ms_aff=nat&ms_chan=sem&ms=200114_evergreenun_sem-402136072447-85034109043-aclu%20national-b_segmenta_ggl&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksOAvU4sb4pLf_ZYFsLxpkOUKCIEWJ-5DlUwiy2ThfgtWJfDdtbDDccaAqsEEALw_wcB&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksOAvU4sb4pLf_ZYFsLxpkOUKCIEWJ-5DlUwiy2ThfgtWJfDdtbDDccaAqsEEALw_wcB).\n* The [Ann Arbor Tenants Union](https://www.facebook.com/a2tenantsunion/).\n* Temp agencies providing paralegals to companies such as [this one](https://national.hireanesquire.com/freelance-paralegals/?kw=%2Btemp%20%2Bparalegal&cpn=1938616217&utm_term=%2Btemp%20%2Bparalegal&utm_campaign=Freelance%20paralegal&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_tgt=kwd-535810181190&hsa_grp=70181947909&hsa_src=g&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_mt=b&hsa_ver=3&hsa_ad=414275841311&hsa_acc=7490703806&hsa_kw=%2Btemp%20%2Bparalegal&hsa_cam=1938616217&gclid=Cj0KCQjw6575BRCQARIsAMp-ksM1RFiSA3ilecmAa1MAEh0XbtVtKlX59HcNuPNjE7VA2LduHk7l5JYaAp-gEALw_wcB).

This, to a layman, seems like a (nearly) bulletproof defence.\n\nThe one exception I can see is if a future President (e.g. President Biden) unilaterally reclassify the document at a higher level, now that President Trump no longer possesses his powers of classification under the Presidential office.\n\nThis leads to two related questions:\n\n1. If the classification level of a document has been reduced \\- so exposing this to a larger audience \\- can it later be reclassified to a higher level?\n2. Can the President or delegated power capriciously classify any document in the possession of a political rival, without him or her knowing, and cause the rival to be in breach of law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The DOJ has [a handy FAQ about declassification on their site](https://www.justice.gov/archives/open/declassification/declassification-faq). There are statutory and E.O. provisions for automatic declassification of information (I think the most common one in practice is \"historically important information after 25 years\"). Though this is subject to review and may be rejected in particular situations, dictated by much the same provisions. As for reclassifying automatically declassified information, the FAQ says:\n\n> CAN INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN AUTOMATICALLY DECLASSIFIED BE RECLASSIFIED?\n\n> Yes. Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the FOIA, Presidential Records Act, 44 USC 2204(c)(1\\), the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of E.O. 13526, only if such classification or reclassification meets the requirements of E.O. 13526, and is accomplished on a document\\-by\\-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official. Information may not be reclassified after declassification and release to the public under proper authority.\n\nSimilar provisions were detailed in [E.O. 12958](https://www.archives.gov/about/laws/appendix/12958.html).\n\nA \"proper authority\" would not include, say, leaks, like those due to Snowden. Note that, as for Trump's situation, while he most surely counted as a \"proper authority\" while President, there is no indication whatsoever that the information was also released to the public under his or any other proper authority.\n\n[A recent and somewhat controversial example of reclassification began in 1999 under the Clinton administration, as a result of aforementioned E.O. 12958, and lasted for several years after](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB179/index.htm).\n\n> To justify their reclassification program, officials at CIA and military agencies have argued that during the implementation of Executive Order 12958, President Clinton's program for bulk declassification of historical federal records, many sensitive intelligence\\-related documents that remained classified were inadvertently released at NARA, especially in State Department files. Even though researchers had been combing through and copying documents from those collections for years, CIA and other agencies compelled NARA to grant them access to the open files so they could reclassify documents.\n\nA separate article from the same link provides:\n\n> ...security officials at DOE had become concerned that the implementation of EO 12958 had led to the inadvertent release in State Department and other agency records at NARA of \"unmarked\" restricted and formerly restricted data on nuclear weapons. In the fall of 1998, Congress formally authorized the Department of Energy to remove from public document repositories any and all sensitive nuclear weapons design\\-related information pursuant to Section 3161 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, entitled \"Protection Against Inadvertent Release of Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.\"\n\nThe argument the agencies seemed to advance for this reclassification is that prior declassifications had not undergone the proper equity considerations: meaning that agencies other than the ones who declassified them had an interest and say in their classification, which should not have been overlooked. While some complained about the reclassification of information that had entered the public domain\u2014the material had been on the public shelves for years, and some of it had even been published and a good deal more of it sifted through by various parties\u2014this did not seem to matter to the agencies.

Further, many will lie and claim they have nothing to do with the charges and that it's completely controlled by the 3rd party biller.\n\nDoes the tenant have a right to see the bill and verify that the required payment is correct? What remedies might be available to the tenant in Florida should the first question prove true (and the landlord or management company refuse to provide documentation)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My guess is the answer to this question is going to be in your lease. You likely signed a lease that agreed that you would pay accept this practice and spelled out what ever rights you have to challenge the billings. My guess is they are as limited as the courts will allow in Florida. And the only way to ensure access to those records would be to get the court to compel they provide you with the records. \n\nPerusal of the [Water codes in Florida](https://www.flrules.org/gateway/ChapterHome.asp?Chapter=25-30) does not appear to directly engage this practice(I could have missed it). However it appears that there is code regulating the management of electrical limits the billing to no more than the actual costs to the customer of record(probably your real estate management company.)\n\nAccording the the [NCSL](http://www.ncsl.org/research/energy/utility-submetering.aspx) (This refers to electrical service. I am assuming there is similar language used elsewhere for plumbing, or that the intent of the law is uniformity of these codes in all utility billings.\n\n> Where individual metering is not required and master metering is used\n>  in lieu thereof, reasonable apportionment methods, including\n>  submetering may be used by the customer of record or the owner of such\n>  facility solely for the purpose of allocating the cost of the\n>  electricity billed by the utility. The term \u201ccost\u201d as used herein\n>  means only those charges specifically authorized by the electric\n>  utility's tariff, including but not limited to the customer, energy,\n>  demand, fuel, conservation, capacity and environmental charges made by\n>  the electric utility plus applicable taxes and fees to the customer of\n>  record responsible for the master meter payments. The term does not\n>  include late payment charges, returned check charges, the cost of the\n>  customer\\-owned distribution system behind the master meter, the\n>  customer of record's cost of billing the individual units, and other\n>  such costs. Any fees or charges collected by a customer of record for\n>  electricity billed to the customer's account by the utility, whether\n>  based on the use of submetering or any other allocation method, shall\n>  be determined in a manner which reimburses the customer of record for\n>  no more than the customer's actual cost of electricity.

The policy shall have uniform\n>  application and shall be nondiscriminatory (Fla. Administrative Code \u00a725\\-6\\.049\\).\n\nNow here is where the 3rd party comes in. The 3rd party is the one levying fees for the management on your landlord. Granted if you follow the strings ill bet you find that the billing company is owned by the same company that owns your rental management firm. So your landlord can collect no more than what it costs to provide you with the service, but part of providing the service is employing this 3rd party utility management firm.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to Florida regulations on utility submetering and billing practices for apartment tenants, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) Management companies can charge tenants any amount they want for utilities, regardless of the actual cost.\n\nB) Tenants have an unrestricted right to view the original utility bills from the municipality.\n\nC) Third-party billing companies can add unlimited fees on top of the actual utility costs.\n\nD) Management companies can only charge tenants for the actual cost of utilities plus certain authorized charges, even when using third-party billing services.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the Florida Administrative Code cited in the passage, specifically \u00a725-6.049, any fees charged to tenants for electricity (and by extension, other utilities) \"shall be determined in a manner which reimburses the customer of record for no more than the customer's actual cost of electricity.\" The code allows for \"reasonable apportionment methods\" and submetering, but explicitly states that the charges are limited to those \"specifically authorized by the electric utility's tariff\" plus applicable taxes and fees. While third-party billing companies may be used, their fees are considered part of the cost of providing the service, but the overall charges to tenants cannot exceed the actual costs incurred by the landlord or management company.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they suggest unlimited or arbitrary charging, which is not allowed under the regulations. Option B is incorrect because while tenants may have a right to verify charges, there's no mention of an unrestricted right to view original bills, and the question implies that management companies often refuse to show these bills."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53241/how-can-nintendo-cartoon-captain-n-use-video-game-characters-owned-by-different", "docs_id": 53241, "title": "How can Nintendo cartoon Captain N use video game characters owned by different companies without those companies appearing in the show&#39;s copyright?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Captain N was a late 80s cartoon which uses characters and settings from several games that are playable on the Nintendo Entertainment System console.

I'll provide a traditional and modern view of each.\n\nThe intermediate view and to a lesser extent the modern view, also give more weight to individualized evidence of the intent of the parties on a case by case basis, while the traditional view would be rather indifferent to the actual intent of the parties.\n\n> How do you qualify that fishing right? Is it an easement,\n>  profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre; is that a full fledged fee simple or a mere\n>  interest arising out of a contract?\n\nThe traditional view would be that this would be a profits\\-\u00e0\\-prendre, also known as an \"easement in gross\" which is a property interest (since it is permanent or at least indefinite). The modern view would see it as having more similarities to an easement (or more precisely to a generic \"servitude\"). This assumes, of course, that it was not merely an expressly designated or orally created \"license\" as opposed to a property right.\n\n> Is it alienable/assignable?\n\nThe traditional view is that it is not alienable or assignable. The intermediate view is that it is alienable or assignable only if it expressly so provides. The modern view is that it is alienable or assignable unless the instrument creating it expressly provides otherwise.\n\n> Does the right outlast the life of the original grantee/holder?\n\nThe traditional view is that it does not. The intermediate view is that it only does so if it expressly so provides. The modern view is that it presumptively survives the life of the original grantee/holder.\n\nThe traditional view would also terminate the right upon the death of the grantor, at least if it does not expressly provide otherwise.\n\n> Can there be apportionment of the right?\n\nThe traditional view is no. The modern view is that the right can be apportioned only if this can be done without increasing the burden that the rights holder (the dominant estate) imposes on the river owner (the servient estate) and does not expand its scope. Depending upon the way that the right is formulated, this may or may not feasible.\n\nAn exclusive right for one person to fish and an exclusive right to fish exercised by thirty people impose a very different burden on the fishery, unless the thirty people are limited to the catch that one person exclusively fishing would have reasonably accomplished.\n\n> I would also like to know which American states still have a\n>  noncommercial easement in gross which is assignable, based on past\n>  precedent i.e. states which have not yet integrated Restatement\n>  (First's) in that respect (i.e. in so many words still have profits \u00e0\n>  prendre independent of the modern easement).\n\nShort of a full fledged law review article this is pretty much impossible to answer. Based on searches of similar kinds of legal issues that I've done in the past, I would guess that 40%\\-60% of states have no clear precedents on the issue one way or the other, and another 10\\-20% of the states have some precedents but those precedents are ambiguous or are so stale that it is not obvious that they would be applied if the issue was litigated today.\n\nThe remaining states would probably be split fairly evenly between the traditional and modern rules.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where a riparian land owner (A) trades an exclusive right to fish in a portion of a river to someone (B) through a deed of exchange, which of the following statements is most accurate according to the modern view of property law?\n\nA) The fishing right is considered a profits-\u00e0-prendre and is not alienable or assignable.\n\nB) The fishing right is viewed as a generic \"servitude\" and is presumptively alienable and assignable unless expressly stated otherwise.\n\nC) The fishing right automatically terminates upon the death of the original grantee/holder.\n\nD) The fishing right can be freely apportioned without any restrictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the modern view presented in the passage, the fishing right would be viewed as having more similarities to a generic \"servitude\" rather than a traditional profits-\u00e0-prendre. The modern view also holds that such rights are presumptively alienable and assignable unless the instrument creating them expressly provides otherwise. Option A represents the traditional view, not the modern one. Option C is incorrect because the modern view suggests the right presumptively survives the life of the original grantee/holder.

The tenant can appeal the judgment on the grounds that the court made an error of law in not recognizing the mootness of the case.

The meme about under 3\\.5 inches derives from the general statute pertaining to concealed weapons, where [CO Rev Stat \u00a7 18\\-12\\-101](https://law.justia.com/codes/colorado/2016/title-18/article-12/part-1/section-18-12-101/) defines \"knife\" as being over 3\\.5 inches long (and it is a misdemeanor to carry a concealed knife). We'll come back to this.\n\nThe applicable part of the definition of \"deadly weapon\" in the school\\-specific law is\n\n> (II) A knife, bludgeon, or any other weapon, device, instrument,\n>  material, or substance, whether animate or inanimate, that, in the\n>  manner it is used or intended to be used, is capable of producing\n>  death or serious bodily injury.\n\nThis raising a question that I encourage you not to test, whether the school deadly weapon definition excludes knives that are longer that 3\\.5 inches. The definition section for Article 12 starts by saying\n\n> (1\\) As used in this article, *unless the context otherwise requires*\n\nso that means that \"knife\" is redefined in a special way (in terms of length), and that is for the entire article which includes the school weapon section. The actual definition of \"knife\" in the definitions section of Article 12 is\n\n> (f) \"Knife\" means any dagger, dirk, knife, or stiletto with a blade\n>  over three and one\\-half inches in length, *or any other dangerous\n>  instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds*,\n>  but does not include a hunting or fishing knife carried for sports\n>  use. The issue that a knife is a hunting or fishing knife must be\n>  raised as an affirmative defense.\n\nThe modifier \"with a blade over three and one\\-half inches in length\" might be thought to refer to all of the preceding terms, or just the last one \u2013 stiletto. These is a rule of legal interpretation that a modifier should be interpreted as referring to the *last* antecedent, meaning that the length limit pertains to stilettos. The punctuation (lack of comma) supports the interpretation \"stiletto with a blade over three and one\\-half inches in length\", meaning that a knife is a knife. Whether or not a literal knife with a blade under 3\\.5 inches long constitutes a redefined knife, it certainly constitutes a \"dangerous instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing, or tearing wounds\".\n\nIn the context of a specific law restricting the possession of weapons (concealed or not) in schools, the context requires that the definition explicitly mentioned in 18\\-1\\-901(3\\)(e), which is outside Article 12, is being referred to. The reason the law was explicitly written to refer to *that* definition was so that the general definition in article 12 would be overridden.\n\nMy point is that this is a not atypical example of the problem of legal definitions, which can get rather convoluted. If someone has told you that a knife under 3\\.5\" is legally not a knife, you probably now know why they would say that, but also you should know what that's simply not true when it comes to weapons in school.\n\nI omitted one complication, which in this instance is not applicable, namely the kirpan exception.

While there is a 3.5-inch rule for concealed weapons in general (CO Rev Stat \u00a7 18-12-101), the school-specific law (CO Rev Stat \u00a7 18-12-105.5(1)) refers to a broader definition of deadly weapons. This definition includes any knife or instrument capable of inflicting injury, regardless of size. The context of the school law requires using this broader definition, overriding the general 3.5-inch rule.

(Note that if this person is an \"employee\" and not an \"independent contractor\" that it is also important that you obtain worker's compensation and pay withholding taxes for your domestic employee; often this is done via a third\\-party payroll service.)\n\n**Applicable Law**\n\nThe [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, et seq., requires you to pay every hourly employee the federal minimum wage, plus overtime if applicable, from \"Portal to Portal\" (i.e. from showing up to work until leaving work, because commuting time is not counted as work for purposes of the FLSA).\n\nHours worked is defined as follows by the FLSA at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(o), contains no exception for time spent reading a safety manual:\n\n> In determining for the purposes of sections 206 and 207 of this title\n>  the hours for which an employee is employed, there shall be excluded\n>  any time spent in changing clothes or washing at the beginning or end\n>  of each workday which was excluded from measured working time during\n>  the week involved by the express terms of or by custom or practice\n>  under a bona fide collective\\-bargaining agreement applicable to the\n>  particular employee.\n\nThis states with respect to employees in domestic service at 209 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(f):\n\n> Any employee\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) who in any workweek is employed in domestic service in a household\n>  shall be paid wages at a rate not less than the wage rate in effect\n>  under subsection (b) of this section unless such employee\u2019s\n>  compensation for such service would not because of section 209(a)(6\\)\n>  of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 409(a)(6\\)](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title02/0209.htm)constitute wages\n>  for the purposes of title II of such Act \\[42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 401 et seq.],\n>  or\n> \n> \n> (2\\) who in any workweek\u2014\n> \n> \n> (A) is employed in domestic service in one or more households, and\n> \n> \n> (B) is so employed for more than 8 hours in the aggregate, shall be\n>  paid wages for such employment in such workweek at a rate not less\n>  than the wage rate in effect under subsection (b) of this section.\n\nThe referenced Section 206(b) is the currently effective federal minimum wage (currently $7\\.25 per hour).

According to the information provided, Sarah must pay the cook at least minimum wage for the time spent reading the kitchen safety manual. This is because:\n\n1.

The above is a working example, but my general question is whether a clause in a written contract is valid and enforceable, if all parties took regular actions contrary to the clause for a very long time without any dispute. An analogy to the above situation would be a written agreement of parties that monthly, 10$ would be exchanged for a selfie, for a period of 20 years. Then 19 years pass and nobody ever sent a selfie, or 10$ in exchange, or took any action with respect to that agreement, but one party starts sending selfies (many years later) and asks for their rightful 10$.

What do the experts think?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Party A has breached the contract\n---------------------------------\n\nParty A had an obligation that it did not fulfil, providing the section\\-by\\-section overview of the costs.\n\nTo the extent that Party B suffered damage from each breach, for example, because Party A owes a refund, Party B can recover that plus interest subject to any statute of limitations on actions for contract breach. To the extent that Party A suffered damage, tough \\- they don\u2019t get to benefit from their own breach.\n\nParty A might wish to argue that Party B has [waived](https://sklawyers.com.au/dictionary/waiver/) their right to adjust the payment but this would be difficult to prove. It doesn\u2019t appear that there is an explicit waiver but neither is their an implied waiver: Party A would need to show that Party B was aware of and condoned the breach in some way.\n\nYou are right that a contract can be altered after it is entered into and that such a change can be implicit rather than explicit. But that would require showing some action rather than inaction by the parties to effect a different arrangement. In practice, where one party affirms the written contract, without clear and compelling evidence that the contract has subsequently been changed, the written contract will prevail.\n\nFor an example, Yale University periodically collects the interest due on a perpetual [bond](https://news.yale.edu/2015/09/22/living-artifact-dutch-golden-age-yale-s-367-year-old-water-bond-still-pays-interest) originally issued by the Dutch water board Lekdijk Bovendams on 15 May 1624\\.

Of course, practically, crossing the Atlantic to collect 15\u20ac every year is not commercially viable so they do it every decade or so when someone from Yale is going there anyway and then, only for the historical value.

For the arbitration agreement to have expired, the expiration clause would need to be explicit that it includes the arbitration clause.\n\nThe competence\\-competence principle is that the arbitrator has the authority (competence 1\\) to decide if they are allowed to be the arbitrator (competence 2\\). So, at first instance, it is the job of the arbitrator to decide whether there is or isn't a valid arbitration agreement and, therefore, whether they can continue with the arbitration.

According to the competence-competence principle, the arbitrator has the authority to decide on their own jurisdiction, including whether the arbitration agreement is still valid. The severability principle also supports this, as it states that an arbitration agreement is considered a separate contract from the main agreement, even if they are in the same document.

If the lease prohibits illegal conduct or specifically requires the tenant to have a valid license for any business operations, and the tenant has used a fabricated document to deceive the landlord, this would likely constitute a breach of the lease terms, giving the landlord grounds for eviction.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the landlord cannot evict solely based on a fraudulently obtained license, as the government's issuance of the license is generally considered authoritative.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the lease terms are crucial, it oversimplifies the situation by stating the landlord has no recourse at all.\n\nOption C is incorrect because typically, only the government agency that issued the license has the standing to challenge its validity directly. The landlord could report the fraud to the agency, but cannot directly challenge the license's validity themselves."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14494/amazon-have-charged-me-for-prime-membership-without-my-knowledge", "docs_id": 14494, "title": "Amazon have charged me for Prime membership without my knowledge", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently discovered that Amazon have charged me for Prime Membership around 10 months ago.

The law starts by addressing the proscribed act, which is if one (I'll get to \"one\" below, which is the crux of the matter)\n\n> intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any\n>  other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or\n>  electronic communication\n\nThe [definition of \"intercept\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2510) is\n\n> the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire,\n>  electronic, or oral communication through the use of any electronic,\n>  mechanical, or other device.\n\nA robo\\-call is send\\-only, so that action does not acquire anything. Then the question is whether Jarvis is a \"device\". There is a specific exemption from the definition of \"electronic, mechanical, or other device\":\n\n> (b) a hearing aid or similar device being used to correct subnormal\n>  hearing to not better than normal\n\nJarvis is not covered by (b). Part (a) exempts\n\n> any telephone or telegraph instrument...furnished to the\n>  subscriber...being used by the subscriber...in the ordinary course of\n>  its business... or (ii) being used by a provider of wire or electronic communication service\n\nwhich we can assume is not the case with Jarvis (the provider does not supply the device): Jarvis is a device, and Jarvis intercepts.\n\nOne way that such interception can legally be accomplished is via consent. At the federal level, it is sufficient that one party consents, though in some states, such as Washington, all parties must consent. Assume that only the federal law is relevant. The law regarding consent says\n\n> (d) It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for *a person* not\n>  acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic\n>  communication where such person is a party to the communication or\n>  where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent\n>  to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the\n>  purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the\n>  Constitution or laws of the United States or of any State.\n\nA program is not a person, so a program cannot consent. However, if we go to the very top of the law, the prohibition starts:\n\n> Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any *person*\n>  who...\n\nA program cannot violate the law (laws apply to people), at the moment.\n\nIf a program is deemed to be a legal person (either statutorily or by Supreme Court ruling), this all changes, but then Jarvis would have the capacity to consent (unless a program is deemed to be a person incapable of consent, but that would be silly because criminal law is predicated on the assumption that the actor \"consented\" to do the act).

The law states \"Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter any person who...\" which means that a program cannot violate the law as it stands.

It's not.\n\nIt's as if the society as a whole \"approve\" and \"promote\" the bullying by making sure there is no way the bully faced justice. The cops don't get involved. And the only way to get evidence is criminalized.\n\nIf I were a DA, and say I want to get elected, I would throw the bully in jail. And if a bully is thrown in jail, then the \"recording\" event wouldn't have happened in the first place.\n\nI understand that DA does not have obligation to prosecute any crime. However, repeated battery seems like a reasonably obvious crime. If that's not crime, what is?\n\nNow, usually, if people have a few legal options, they pick the one that's the most profitable.\n\nWhat \"profit\" does DA have in prosecuting the mom instead of the bullies.\n\nAs someone beaten up when I was a kid, I am wondering about this for a long time. Why do society more interested in protecting something I perceive as more trivial, like recording, compared to something far more substantial, like beating.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This isn't about bullying at all, this is about Virginia being a \"one\\-party\" state. [Virginia Law 19\\.2\\-62](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title19.2/chapter6/section19.2-62/) outlines that:\n\n> B.2 It shall not be a criminal offense under this chapter for a person to intercept a wire, electronic or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication or one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception.\n\nHowever what is not said in the article is that the daughter didn't know that the recording device was in the backpack. This means that the mother did not get consent from either party being recorded (it isn't clear that a minor could give consent anyway), and is therefore in violation of 19\\.2\\-62\\.\n\nThe (US) law has been quite clear on \"two wrongs don't make a right\", the mother was not getting satisfaction through other channels, but that does not mean she is right in violating the law in pursuit of justice. \n\n---\n\nThis is still very much in the early stages of this particular case, but I'm willing to bet that the mother will see very little if any punishment in this matter.\n\nAs for why the DA doesn't prosecute the children (or their parents) for the bullying, this really depends on what kind of bullying is subject here. If the children are verbally bullying, this may not be a crime (yes, it is morally wrong, but may not be a crime). It isn't to say though that the children in this case haven't been reprimanded according to State law, at least the subject of the bullying has been moved to a different class as a result. Unless the bullying reaches a physical level, most State laws require the schools to deal with the bullying directly (through moving children to different classes, suspensions, expelling, etc), so the DA doesn't typically get involved until physical injury occurs.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a mother secretly recording her daughter's bullies in Virginia, why was the mother charged with a crime instead of the bullies being prosecuted?\n\nA) The bullying was not severe enough to be considered a crime\nB) Virginia is a two-party consent state for audio recordings\nC) The daughter did not give consent for the recording\nD) The DA has a policy of not prosecuting minors for bullying\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The mother was charged because she violated Virginia's wiretapping law by recording conversations without the consent of either party involved. Virginia is actually a one-party consent state, meaning that if the daughter had known about and consented to the recording, it would have been legal. However, since the daughter was unaware of the recording device in her backpack, no party to the conversation had given consent, making the recording illegal.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the severity of the bullying is not the primary legal issue in this case. The focus is on the legality of the recording.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because Virginia is actually a one-party consent state, not a two-party consent state.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while DAs have discretion in prosecuting cases, there's no evidence presented of a blanket policy against prosecuting minors for bullying.

The two parties appear in court and the judge rules that the arbitration agreement is invalid.\n\nThe party seeking to enforce the arbitration agreement appeals the decision to the Appellate Division. However, at the same time they are forced to act in a way that is inconsistent with the enforcement of the arbitration agreement. For example, suppose Party A sues Party B for a breach of contract for $50,000\\. Party B attempts to compel arbitration but the court denies the request. While the case is pending appeal, Party B counter sues Party A for $25,000 for breach of the same contract with the logic that until the higher courts reverse the decision of the lower courts, Party B wants the courts to get a full picture of their version of the story.\n\nCould it be argued that Party B now forfeited their right to appeal by filling a suit in court against Party A and not waiting until the appeal is either accepted or denied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No... I forget the specific term but in court you can bring in multiple points of contradiction that are all contradictory to your other arguments, but would not be contradicting to your case, because they all contradict your legal adversaries case. The example as I heard it is A man is bitten by a neighbor's Pit Bull and the man takes takes his neighbor to court for damages. The neighbor mounts his defense by saying 1\\.) I don't own that dog. 2\\.) If I did own a dog, I wouldn't own that breed of dog. 3\\.) I always keep my dogs on a leash when I take them out of the house and would pull it away before it bit someone. 4\\.) On the day in question my dog was in the kennel.\n\nIn this case, the defense would be valid because the Plaintiff would have to disprove all 4 statements, any one of which would impact the case against the neighbor. In a criminal case, the defendant doesn't have to prove his story is true, he just has to prove that the Prosecution's story isn't. In a civil case, both sides merely have to prove their story is more likely to be true than the other side's. What's more, none of those statements is contradictory, they only seem so (Neighbor doesn't own that dog (he dog sits for his sister). If he did own a dog, it would be a different breed (He doesn't like Pitt Bulls). He never takes a dog out of his house without putting a leash on the dog and maintains control of the dog (Because that's what any dog owner would do). The dog was in the kennel on the day of the incident (because for his own reasons, he can't dog sit for his sister.)).\n\nIn effect, to avoid damage, the argument of \"That's not my dog\" is to argue that the neighbor isn't the responsible party for the dog's behavior. The second argument is that the neighbor would never own a pit bull even if he did own a dog, the third would demonstrate that even when there is a dog that the neighbor is caring for, he does so in a responsible way AND the dog being in the kennel shows that the dog couldn't possibly have been the one who bit the plaintiff.\n\nWhat's more, the defendant can counter sue his neighbor for harassment, who just plain hates Pit Bulls and has been shouting at defendant for daring to care for his sister's dog even on days where the dog is not on the man's property and instantly blamed the Defendant in court without considering the possibility that there could be another Pit Bull owner in the area and their Pit Bull got loose.\n\nIn OP's case, the filing of a countersuit is just \"Hope for the Best, prepare for the worst\". They could be filing because the appellant court's decision may not come out in the window of time they have before they lose the ability to file counter claims. In that case, if the appeal goes in their favor, the suit is dismissed as well as the countersuit and goes to arbitration.

In legal proceedings, parties are allowed to pursue multiple, even seemingly contradictory, legal strategies simultaneously. This principle is often referred to as \"pleading in the alternative.\" Party B can continue to appeal the decision on arbitration while also filing a counter-suit as a precautionary measure. This approach allows Party B to \"hope for the best, prepare for the worst\" by preserving their rights in case the appeal is unsuccessful. The counter-suit does not automatically forfeit the right to appeal, nor are these actions mutually exclusive.

(e.g., The general knowledge, \"In the past, about 5% of the videos uploaded to our site were infringing, and we expect that trend continues into the present, so some of our videos right now are probably infringing,\" is not actionable to specific videos, so it does not quality as \"actual knowledge\".)\n\nThat ruling also clarifies the distinction between *(i)* and *(ii)*, which are respectively termed the \"actual knowledge\" provision and \"red flag\" provision:\n\n> In other words, the actual knowledge provision turns on whether the provider actually or \u201csubjectively\u201d knew of specific infringement, while the red flag provision turns on whether the provider was subjectively aware of facts that would have made the specific infringement \u201cobjectively\u201d obvious to a reasonable person.\n\n---\n\nActual knowledge is different from a notification, which the service operator must respond to according to section (c)(1\\)(C) (whereas your quote is from (c)(1\\)(A)):\n\n> (C) upon notification of claimed infringement as described in paragraph (3\\), responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity.\n\nExpeditious removal is required in *either* event: the operator has actual knowledge of infringement, per (c)(1\\)(A)(i), ***or*** the operator gets a notification, per (c)(1\\)(C).

According to the ruling in Viacom v. YouTube, \"actual knowledge\" must be specific enough to allow a service provider to take action against particular infringing content. The court clarified that general knowledge of infringement is not specific enough to be actionable and does not qualify as \"actual knowledge.\" In this scenario, the general notification that approximately 5% of content may be infringing, without specifying which videos, does not constitute \"actual knowledge\" under the law. Therefore, the website is not required to take any immediate action based solely on this general information to maintain its safe harbor protection.\n\nOption A is incorrect because removing random videos without specific knowledge of infringement would be an inappropriate response and could remove non-infringing content.\n\nOption C, while possibly a good practice, is not legally required based on this general notification and would be an extensive undertaking not mandated by the \"actual knowledge\" standard.\n\nOption D is an extreme overreaction that would unnecessarily disrupt service and is not required by law in response to a general notification."}, "42": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39216/trademark-violation-for-app", "docs_id": 39216, "title": "Trademark violation for app?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've just received an email from a Turkish app developer who believes my app infringes on his trademark.

There are 40\\+ apps on Android alone which share this name as well. There was software prior to both apps with this name.\n\nI admit that both apps have a similar main UI (same color, same input elements) which however noticeably differ in design choices, user experience, and scope.

So let me discuss some general principles here, but details may well be different in Germany and Turkey.\n\nYou're mixing together three very different things: trademark, copyright, and patent. \n\nCopyright protects the expression of an idea, in this case, the exact computer code, images, etc. If you didn't copy his code, the chance that you would coincidentally write identical code is remote. The fact that you both have a line of code that says `x=x+1` wouldn't give him any grounds for a lawsuit. He'd have to show substantial portions of the code were identical. If you didn't deliberately copy his code, this isn't going to happen. Barring some extraordinary and unbelievable coincidence, you can't violate copyright accidentally.\n\nTrademark protects names and symbols used to identify a company or a product. If you decided to call your software company \"Microsoft\", then that other Microsoft could sue you for trademark infringement. Likewise if you copied somebody else's logo or other distinctive graphics. This is very different from copyright. It is quite possible to violate someone's trademark accidentally. Especially if he gave his company or product a rather generic name. Like if someone called his product, say, \"Password Manager\", someone else might make a product with the same name without ever having heard of the original. Ditto if he has some simple logo or other graphics. If you did accidentally duplicate a name or graphic elements, well, in the US a court would likely order you to change your name or graphics and that would be the end of it, unless you refused, in which case you'd end up in court. US Courts have ruled that very generic names have limited trademark protection. An example I saw recently was \"Main Street Auto Repair\". A court said that the owner of that name could prevent someone else from opening a shop in the same town with the same name, but he couldn't sue someone in another town who happened to use the same name. This is why, by the way, companies often use made\\-up words for their product names. In your case, this should be a trivial issue. If he is claiming trademark to the look of the main menu screen, just change the colors or move some buttons around. If it actually went to court, you should be able to argue that the similarity was accidental and when you were informed you promptly changed it, and that should be the end of it. Depending, I guess, on how hard\\-nosed the judge is, etc.\n\nPatents are different still. A patent gives the owner the exclusive right to use an invention or process for a specified period of time. It doesn't matter if you invented the same thing entirely independently. Whoever filed the patent first has exclusive rights. There have been cases where an inventor lost out to someone with a similar invention because he submitted his patent application one day later. If this other person has patents that you are infringing, you are pretty much out of luck.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A German app developer receives a claim of infringement from a Turkish developer regarding an app distributed on the Google Play store. Both apps have similar functionality and main UI design, but were independently created. The Turkish developer holds some form of copyright in Turkey.

Copyright protects the exact expression (in this case, the source code) and is unlikely to be infringed accidentally if the German developer truly created their app independently. However, trademark issues can arise accidentally, especially with similar names or distinctive graphics, even if many other apps use similar elements.

Likewise, an adjudication that someone had no will cannot be made without a probate proceeding. There is no exception for a clear an uncontested will. \"Will\" means \"probate\" pretty much by definition.\n\nThis doesn't mean, however, that the closing of the property has to waive until the probate proceeding including a full administration of the probate estate and closing of the probate estate is required. Often, a will can be admitted to probate and an executor can be appointed to manage the estate in a matter of a few weeks to a few months if there is no contest to either the validity of the will or the appointment of a particular person as an executor.\n\nGenerally, once the executor is appointed in the probate case, the real estate closing can go forward, sometimes with some additional uncontested motion practice. Once the property is sold, the proceeds are put in an estate bank account pending further administration of the estate's assets and liabilities. Indeed, even if the will is contested, as long as a consensus can be reached among the interested parties regarding who the executor should be, the real estate closing could go forward despite the fact that the will is contested.\n\nPowers of attorney are sometimes granted to real estate agents to complete a transaction in the event of a seller's incapacity. But powers of attorney are void no later than the point at which the person with the power of attorney learns of the death. (The common law rule was that a power of attorney was void at the moment of death, even if no one involved in the transaction knew that fact yet.)\n\nThe only person with authority to sign the deed to sell the property, if the property is titled in the name of the seller individually, with no co\\-owner (or with a tenant\\-in\\-common co\\-owner), is the probate estate's executor.\n\nThe real estate contract is a claim in the probate estate, which the probate estate is required to carry out if it is able to do so. But a real estate contract, in and of itself, doesn't transfer the property by operation of law at closing.

In Florida, when a property owner dies before closing on a solely-owned property, the estate must go through probate. The sale cannot proceed until a probate case is opened and an executor is appointed by the court. This is because:\n\n1. Powers of attorney become void upon the death of the grantor, so option A is incorrect.\n2. The buyer cannot sue the heirs directly to force the sale, as the estate must be properly administered through probate, making option B incorrect.\n3.

It means that the executor of the probate estate (in an official capacity), who takes title by operation of law upon appointment, is directed to sell the property rather than to distributed it in kind.\n\n> Will there be legal or financial problems with a foreign executor?\n\nNot necessarily.

The relative competencies of the prospective executors is more important.\n\n> If both offspring agreed, can the overseas offspring easily transfer\n> executorship to the American offspring, or will there be legal or\n> financial consequences?\n\nAssuming that they are the only interested parties in the estate, they can do so. You can't be compelled to serve as an executor just because you are nominated by a will to do so. If one person declines to serve, the person with next highest priority which would likely be the other sibling, may apply to the probate court to be appointed. The main financial consequence is that typically, whoever does the job is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate for their services.\n\n> Would there be legal or financial deed ownership issues, since neither\n> offspring specifically inherited the property?\n\nNo.\n\n> Could a court order the property to be auctioned out from under the\n> offspring?\n\nIf all interested parties agree, they can defy the will. The normal process, however, is for the executor to follow the will and to sell the property in a commercially reasonable manner, typically by engaging a real estate agent to handle the sale. If the executor fails to take action, and an interested party objects, it would be more common for a probate court to remove the executor and appoint another one, than to order a sale at auction, which would typically be a course of last resort.\n\nThis said, under appropriate circumstances, the court of probate jurisdiction would have authority to order an auction of the house. Most commonly, a court order to sell a decedent's house at auction would arise when the decedent (i.e. the dead guy) only owned an undivided partial interest in the house (called a tenancy in common interest) and the non\\-deceased third party co\\-owner of the house (perhaps a brother or ex\\-wife of the decedent) declined to cooperate in selling it.\n\n> If a court determines the overseas executor offspring receives the\n> property deed, the overseas executor wants to remain executor but give\n> deed to American offspring for easier selling of the property, would\n> the property have to go through titling and closing costs for the\n> transfer, and then again for property sale to a third party?\n\nThis question reflects a fundamental misunderstanding about how probate works. Title to the property vests in the estate by operation of law upon the death of the decedent. The executor has authority, once appointed, to take actions such as signing a deed to a third\\-party buyer, on behalf of the estate. There is no intermediate closing and transfer of title to vest title to the property of the decedent in the name of the estate before it goes from the estate to the third party. The net proceeds of the sale to the third party (after costs of sale and prorations of things like property taxes and prepaid insurance) are then placed in a bank account for the estate and paid to the heirs after expenses of administration are paid.\n\nThere is nothing that makes it significantly harder for an overseas executor to close than a domestic one. The title company handling the sale emails the deed (and any other paperwork that needs to be signed) to the executor. The executor prints the documents to be signed, signs the non\\-notarized documents, and signs the deed in the presence of his friendly neighborhood notary in the foreign country where the executor lives, who notarizes the deed. The executed deed, together with a document called an apostille proving that the notary is really a notary, is sent back to the title company (probably with a scanned copy by email and a hard paper copy following by express delivery). Coordinating time zones may be a pain depending on the location of the particular foreign country in question (but the closing does not have to happen for all parties at exact the same time), and if the overseas executor is someplace primitive and remote with no internet access or computers or printers or faxes and no notaries, that could be a problem.

See [this article](https://lop.parl.ca/sites/PublicWebsite/default/en_CA/ResearchPublications/200845E) for some information about the treaty making process:\n\n> In Canada, the treaty\\-making process is controlled by the executive branch of the federal government, while the Parliament of Canada (\u201cParliament\u201d) is often responsible for passing legislation to implement international treaties at the federal level.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Although this entire process is controlled by the executive branch, the federal government does involve Parliament in this stage of the treaty\\-making process by tabling treaties and relevant explanatory documents for debate in the House of Commons.\n\nSo while the executive branch can enter into treaties at will, they can't create or alter domestic laws without legislative approval. For example, if a treaty required that Canada make certain things illegal, then the legislature would have to pass legislation making that thing illegal to make Canada compliant with its treaty obligations.\n\nApproving a new NATO member wouldn't affect domestic law at all, as there is no bill the legislature would need to pass to implement it. It would effect military operations, but the executive branch already has the power to decide military strategy (the King is the commander\\-in\\-chief of the military, he delegated those powers to the governor general, and the governor general by convention only acts on the advice of the Cabinet).\n\nNote that unlike many other countries (such as the US), the Canadian constitution is mostly silent on the topic of international treaties, only mentioning treaties agreed to by the UK on behalf of Canada (at the time the constitution was written, Canada couldn't agree to treaties itself), so there are no constitutional requirements for the legislative branch to approve any treaties.\n\nAlso note that treaty implementing legislation is almost always passed, since the executive branch needs to maintain the support of a majority of the legislature. If the legislature doesn't pass implementing legislation, then the legislature would also be very likely to pass a no\\-confidence motion, which would usually trigger a new election.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Canada, which of the following statements most accurately describes the process of ratifying international treaties and agreements?\n\nA) The legislative branch must always vote to approve any international treaty before it can be ratified.\n\nB) The executive branch has full authority to ratify treaties, but the legislative branch must pass laws to implement any domestic changes required by the treaty.\n\nC) The King of Canada must personally approve all international treaties before they can take effect.\n\nD) The legislative branch has sole authority to negotiate and ratify international treaties without executive involvement.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In Canada, the executive branch (the government) has the authority to negotiate and ratify international treaties without requiring a vote from the legislative branch (Parliament). However, if the treaty requires changes to domestic law, the legislative branch must pass the necessary legislation to implement these changes. This system allows the executive to act efficiently in international affairs while maintaining the legislature's role in domestic lawmaking. The involvement of Parliament in treaty-making is typically limited to debates and discussions when treaties are tabled, but formal approval is not constitutionally required for ratification. The King (represented by the Governor General) is the ceremonial head of state and commander-in-chief but does not personally approve treaties. The legislative branch does not have the authority to negotiate or ratify treaties independently of the executive."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87962/processing-screenshots-of-peoples-browser-windows-on-a-web-server", "docs_id": 87962, "title": "Processing screenshots of people&#39;s browser windows on a web server", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose that a software developer (April) living in the UK,has created a simple browser plug\\-in that takes screenshots of a user's browser windows and allows the user to enhance and \"prettify\" these screenshots in various ways.\n\nThe \"enhancing\" part of the screenshot processing is done on April's server, which means that all screenshots are uploaded from people's computers to April's over the internet. April has no control over the data that people take screenshots of: it can be their personal email messages, or some copyrighted material, or even their nude pictures. And all this data ends up on the web server that April owns and contrtols.\n\nAre there some specific kinds of data processing agreement or privacy policy that April needs to offer to users so that she doesn't end up in any kind of legal trouble (with GDPR or any other privacy laws)? Maybe a disclaimer saying something like \"by installing this plug\\-in, you agree not to take screenshots of any illegal/copyrighted material\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since the developer is also said to be running the website where screen shots to be edited are stored, and is resident in the UK, it would seem that the GDPR\\-UK applies. (The EU version may also apply when a user is in the EU.) This means that the Data Controller (DC) must have a lawful basis under [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)\n\nThe most plausible basis would seem to be point (b) of article 6 paragraph 1\\. That reads:\n\n> (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;\n\nFor this to apply, the DC would need to include in a ToS document or in some other relevant document that a user must accept, contractual language in which the Data Subject (DS) agrees to submit data for processing, and the DC agrees to recive, process, and return it. There would probably be other provisions as well. One of them might be that the content could not itself be unlawful, another that the DS has all needed rights to submit the content for creation of a modified version, yet another that the service could not be used for any unlawful purpose.\n\nHowever, other GDPR provisions would also apply. In particular, [Article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/), paragraph 1 point (e) reads in relevant part\n\n> \\[Personal data shall be] kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed ...\n\nthis suggest that such screen shots should not be retained indefinitely, but rather deleted securely as soon as the modified versions have been transmuted to ther users who have requested them. While 5\\. (b) does permit retention for archiving purposes, it is better practice to retain no more thasn needed. Furthermore, if such information is to be retained as an archive, that should be disclosed to the user under [Article 13](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-13-gdpr/) specifically 13\\.1(c) and 13\\.2(a). Those require disclosing the purpose and lawful basis of procession, and the expected time of retention or the criteria used to determine the retention period.\n\nOthre disclosures liosted in article 13 would also apply.\n\nThe idea of consent on the basis of \"by using this app/site you consent to ...\" is not valid consent under the GDPR.

The agent showed some houses which I had done the research for. **So I had found the house and asked them to show it to me**. Later one of the houses got pulled out of the market which was listed by another agent. I later learned that the seller was going to advertise the home as 'Sale by Owner'. I contacted the seller directly and we negotiated the final price of the house. The seller wanted a letter from my agent stating that she will be waiving off her commission as the house is no longer on the market. I contacted my real estate agent asking for the letter, but she spoke to the seller and upped the home price to include her commission.\n\nI have not signed anything with neither the relocation company nor the real estate agent agreeing to work with them. \n\nIs it still right for the agent to ask for commission since the house has been pulled out of the market since my agent showing it to me.She spoke with the owner, added her commission and came back to us with the new updated higher price.

In real estate transactions, the concept of \"procuring cause\" often determines an agent's right to commission. If an agent introduces a buyer to a property that the buyer eventually purchases, even if the property is later delisted or the sale occurs after the listing expires, the agent may still be entitled to commission. This is because they were the procuring cause of the sale.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because pulling the house off the market doesn't necessarily negate the agent's role in introducing the buyer.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because formal agreements aren't always necessary for an agent to claim commission if they were the procuring cause.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the agent's entitlement to commission isn't solely based on negotiating the final price, but on being the procuring cause of the sale.\n\nThis question tests understanding of real estate commission principles and the concept of procuring cause in property transactions."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64240/in-the-us-what-are-the-steps-that-lead-to-prosecution-or-otherwise", "docs_id": 64240, "title": "In the US, what are the steps that lead to prosecution (or otherwise)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the US, what are the steps that lead to prosecution (or otherwise)?\n\n**By way of example**\n\n> Rep.

Someone (anyone?) complains to the police.\n2. The police are obliged to investigate (?)\n3. The police seek evidence, such as the accused person talking on video\n4. They forward this evidence to someone for a decision on whether the case is strong enough\n5. The case is brought or dropped\n\nAre my guesses correct? What details have I missed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The steps listed in the question are not far off, but not quite correct. A more correct list would be:\n\n1. Indications that a crime has been committed, or is in progress or planned come to the attention of the police. This might be via a complaint, or the report of an informant, or through the police's own observations.\n2. The police decide whether the matter warrants investigation. They are never **required** to investigate, although credible allegations of serious crime will usually be investigated. The police may consult the office of the prosecutor.\n3. The police seek for and assemble evidence, if possible. They may interview suspects and possible witnesses. This may last anywhere from hours to years. They may seek warrants for searches or wiretaps or arrests.\n4. The police decide whether or not to forward evidence to the prosecutor's office, seeking a charge. They may choose not to do so.\n5. The prosecutor's office reviews evidence submitted by the police, and decides whether to file charges. A prosecutor has wide discretion to proceed with or drop a case. The prosecutor may direct the police to make further investigation if additional evidence is needed or wanted. The decision to file charges will be based on the seriousness of the matter, and on the prosecutor's judgement as to whether a conviction can be obtained, and the available resource of the office. Political factors may come into play.\n6. There may be a grand jury proceeding to review the evidence and produce an indictment. The Grand Jury can hear witnesses. Usually its proceedings and the list of witnesses are tightly controlled by the prosecutor. It has been famously said that any half\\-way competent prosecutor can get a Grand jury to \"indite a ham sandwich\". However, the Grand Jury has the power to push inquiry in directions not approved by the prosecutor, although this is quite rarely done in practice. In some states a \"preliminary hearing\" may be held instead. In either case the question is whether there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed, and that the defendant(s) committed it. If the crime is a misdemeanor then the prosecutor can file charges without a Grand Jury or a preliminary hearing.\n7. Charges are filed with the court that has jurisdiction. The defendant(s) may be arrested, or agree to attend court. The defendant(s) will appear to respond to the formal charges, usually with a \"Guilty\" or \"Not Guilty\" plea.\n8. The Judge of the court will set the schedule for further proceedings, including a trial if things get that far. The defense may ask the Judge to dismiss the charges, which the Judge may do if they do not appear to be legally well founded.\n\nThis process could stop at any stage, and several people have authority to determine if it proceeds or not. The senior police officer(s), involved, the prosecutor, and eventually the judge all can halt the process, at one point or another.\n\nAs was mentioned in a comment by Paul Johnson , the supreme court in the case of [*Brandenburg v. Ohio*, 395 U.S. 444 (1969\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) has significantly limited prosecutions for incitement to situations involving speech that is \"directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action\". Otherwise the protections under the First Amendment to the US Federal Constitution protect the speech and prevent any prosecution. Prior to that case the case of [*Schenck v. United States*, 249 U.S. 47 (1919\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenck_v._United_States) allowed prosecution for speech that \"creates a clear and present danger\". The very well\\-known passage is:\n\n> The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic. ... The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.\n\nWhether prosecution in a given case is allowed under the First Amendment is a question of law for the Judge and perhaps for an appeals court. But I doubt that the reported speech would pass the *Brandenburg* test or even the earlier \"clear and present danger\" test. If not, no valid prosecution could be brought.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the correct sequence of events that typically occurs in the US legal system when pursuing a potential prosecution?\n\nA) Police investigate based on a complaint, gather evidence, arrest the suspect, and then forward the case to the prosecutor who decides whether to file charges.\n\nB) A grand jury reviews evidence, issues an indictment, police arrest the suspect, and then the prosecutor decides whether to proceed with the case.\n\nC) Police become aware of a potential crime, investigate at their discretion, gather evidence, forward to the prosecutor who decides whether to file charges, and then a grand jury or preliminary hearing may be held.\n\nD) Anyone can file a complaint directly with the court, a judge reviews the complaint, orders police to investigate, and then decides whether to bring charges against the accused.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C most accurately reflects the typical process described in the documentation.
