For sexual assault, it is 10 years in case of conviction on indictment or 6 months plus a fine for summary conviction \u2013 this relates to [how you are found guilty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_offence#England_and_Wales), with or without a jury (with a jury \\= conviction on indictment).\n\nIt's not entirely clear why assault by penetration and rape are separately defined under this law. In an earlier law, [The Sexual Offences Act 1956](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/4-5/69/section/1/enacted), the law said \"It is felony for a man to rape a woman\", and the meaning of rape is not statutorily given. There was also a crime of [indecent assault](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/4-5/69/part/I/crossheading/assaults/enacted) where again the meaning of indecent assault is not statutorily given. The two current sections could have been merged, and maybe there was debate over whether the punishment should be different (that's a history of politics question).

You (almost always) gain your citizenship (or nationality) in the first instance, at birth, without the agreement or assent of you or your parents. It is thrust upon you.\n2. Usually, your country of citizenship must consent to end your citizenship (or authorize you to do so unilaterally) under that country's laws.\n3. Once you have citizenship or nationality, in practice, in most countries, you can generally only renounce your citizenship if you contemporaneously or already have a citizenship somewhere else. You are at a minimum strongly dissuaded from doing so and are not a sympathetic candidate for relief under laws related to statelessness if you willfully put yourself in this position knowing the consequences. This is a feature of the citizenship laws of most countries in order to implement international treaties designed to prevent statelessness which are widely adopted.\n4. When an adult is naturalized as a citizen of a new country, usually, their old citizenship is revoked by operation of law under the laws of their old country.\n5. In many countries, including the U.S., there are high fees and tax consequences for renouncing your citizenship. Any potential tax liabilities in the future that were not yet due under U.S. law (e.g. capital gains taxes an appreciated assets not yet sold, and estate taxes that would be due if the person renouncing their citizenship had died on that date) are owed immediately upon applying to renounce your citizenship.\n6. **A stateless person is, subject to quite narrow exceptions, still subject to all of the laws of the place where they are located, including almost all of its criminal laws (except treason) and its tax laws (at least on income earned in that country).**\n7. **A stateless person lacks many rights.** They can't travel internationally (there are exceptions under treaty in some cases, but obtaining those rights is cumbersome at a minimum). They can't vote. They typically aren't entitled to domestic welfare state benefits like national health insurance, disability payments, unemployment benefits, subsidized housing, old age or retirement benefits, etc. They can't work in a licensed or regulated profession. They may not even be able to sign a lease. They may not be allowed to own a company or serve as an officer or director of a company or as a trustee of a trust. They aren't entitled to diplomatic assistance.\n\n**There are many fraudulent legal movements such as the \"sovereign citizen movement\" (and the [Moorish Sovereign Citizens](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/moorish-sovereign-citizens)) that assert that citizenship is voluntary and that just by disavowing it in some official feeling way, they can be exempt from taxes, court jurisdiction, and/or other laws.

I also cannot find anyone going to jail for \"usage\"\n\nFor comparisson\n\n<http://www.flevin.com/id/lgso/translations/JICA%20Mirror/english/4868_UU_35_2009_e.html>\n\nIn Indonesian law article 127 says:\n(1\\) Every abusers:\n\n> a. Narcotics Category I for themselves shall be punished with\n>  imprisonment of 4 (four) years;\n>  b. Narcotics Category II for themselves shall be punished with imprisonment of 2 (two) years, and\n>  c. Narcotics of category III for themselves shall be punished with imprisonment of 1 (one) year.\n\nThat explicitly prohibit \"usage\". Of course, most users are not really abusers and are just casual users. However, I don't think the court think that way.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the U.S., Law enforcement favors going after the distribution of narcotics over the use. Going after the users just means dealers will seek out new customers whereas going after dealers means eliminating the supply chain. And Law Enforcement would much rather have a dealer flip on a manufacturer at that. The bigger the fish they bring in, the more damage they can do to the supply chain.\n\nThe U.S. has recently been moving towards treating the use of illicit substances as a disease rather than an crime, especially when the use is tied to addiction. To this end, the current trend is to get the users to clinics that can specialize in breaking addiction rather than jailing a user. Prisons and jails do not have a strong track record for this, but they do have programs for substance abuse.\n\nThe U.S. also favors plea bargins rather than taking every case to trial. 90% of all legal cases are settled out of court with a negotiation between the prosecution and the defense. Usually this acts in a \"you scratch my back\" arrangement where the offender will plea to a lesser charge and in exchange, help the investigators find that bigger fish. This may be testifying against them or giving them the supplier or even acting as a mole. This also benifits the state as the prosecution doesn't have to pay for all the costs of arguing a case a trial. For example, if the cops bust a user, he will be charged with Possession, but they might drop charges if the user can name the dealer and will testify against him. If the cops bust the dealer, the dealer is charged with Possession (with intent to sell), but if he's low on the totem pole, they can ask him to name the supplier he gets his goods and testify against the supplier and in exchange, they drop the charge to Possession. They will be less inclined to bring this fact up, but Possession is easier to prove in court than Possession (With Intent to Sell) because the former requires finding drugs on the person and his property. The later needs to prove that the drugs were not for personal use but instead for distribution to others. Almost universally, anyone convicted on mere possession charges probably did something a lot worse. Law enforcement tends to charge as many crimes as possible... as long as they can prove guilt on one, they can put someone away for a while. Al Capone famously went to one of the most notorious prisons in the United States for Tax Evasion (a very white collared crime that typically results in fines and very minimum jail time. While we're on the subject, the IRS has a 98% conviction rate, and ties with Secret Service (the guys who protect the President) for most successful Federal Law Enforcement Agency, to give you an idea of where the priorities lie in the United States. All Federal Law Enforcement is ridiculously good, to the point that bringing charges against anyone is almost as good as saying they're guilty).\n\nAnother reason Use of drugs isn't pushed is that, well, producing that evidence is difficult. The common user bust is drinking and driving (since alcohol is legal in the U.S., use based crimes are the top level of enforcement. You legally cannot hold a firearm in the U.S. while drunk, even if you could do so while sober). A brethalizer is built to measure the amount of alcohol is in one's system and if it is over the limit for what is safe. Most illicit drug tests don't do this and rather look for chemicals in general and will ping if there's any trace... even if the last use was a month ago. Certain substances linger for a while, especially if they can deposit in hair folicle. You could be six months sober and still ping the test. Other issuses include drugs that contain components of legal substances. Opiods (the big problem drug right now) are manufactured from the Poppy Plant... which also is grown for legal consumable products. There are cases where the Opiod tests pings positive on people who have consumed Poppy\\-Seed Bagels (perfectlly legal and quite common) for breakfast the day of the test. Other tests aren't reliable and will give a false positive from time to time.\n\nEdit: Typically, Possession of a controlled substance assumes you will use it. Reasonable Doubt is harder to make for having the stuff then it is for using it. Someone under the influence could claim they were drugged and law enforcement would have to prove that they weren't to convict (There's actually a known problem where law enforcement agents can get dosed by accident while handling contraband evidence. There was an episode of CSI: Miami where one character had this happen to her... and they realized where the drugs were hidden in a warehouse she served a warrant on but didn't find any evidence. DVD extras featured a police consultant who explained that the whole sequence was thought up because it happened to her for real.). Having the stuff in your possession is much more difficult as they have to show you had it (someone slipping it into your pocket without your knowledge is your job to prove).\n\nIn the U.S., Prosecution Discretion means that the Prosecutor can choose not to press the case for any number of reasons, they don't have the resources to fight it, to they don't think they can win with the evidence they have, to political motives (they don't agree with the law... this can be risky depending on the nature of the crime). Typically a simple possession charge where the amount is clearly small enough that it's only for personal use and no other crimes are charged wouldn't be worth the amount of resources to fully prosecute. TO give an example, while Marijuana is legal in the State of Colorado, it's still illegal under Federal Law, so smoking for recreational use in Colorado is still a crime, but not one enforced by the State of Colorado but the Department of Justice (U.S. Federal Law enforcement department... usually). Remember the Feds generally deal with bigger crimes than someone getting high under the bleachers while listening to Jimmy Hendrix, so it only really comes up if you did something bigger (kidnapping a girl, driving over state lines into Colorado, go to a school to get high under the bleachers while listening to Hendrix would get you a Federal Possession charge... but the real concern is the Kidnapping, not controlled drug use). And most crimes that occur in entirely one state, Feds are content to let those states deal with the problem and rarely get involved.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why U.S. law enforcement tends to focus on drug possession rather than drug use?\n\nA) Drug use is explicitly legal under U.S. federal law, while possession is illegal.\n\nB) It's easier to prove possession in court, and it's assumed that possession implies intent to use.\n\nC) Law enforcement wants to encourage drug use to gather more evidence against dealers.\n\nD) Drug tests are 100% reliable in determining recent drug use, making possession charges unnecessary.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. U.S. law enforcement tends to focus on drug possession rather than drug use for several reasons:\n\n1. Possession is easier to prove in court than use. Having drugs on one's person or property is more straightforward evidence than proving recent use.\n\n2. The law assumes that possession implies intent to use. This makes it easier to secure a conviction.\n\n3. Drug tests can be unreliable or detect past use from weeks or months ago, making it difficult to prove recent use.\n\n4. There's a move towards treating drug use as a health issue rather than a criminal one, focusing more on rehabilitation than punishment for users.\n\n5. Law enforcement prefers to target dealers and suppliers to disrupt the drug supply chain, rather than focusing on individual users.\n\nOption A is incorrect because drug use is not explicitly legal under U.S. federal law.

But each DNS server is run by either a government entity (or semi\\-government, such as a university or a government run corporation) or a private telecom company.

Each DNS server is run by different entities (government, private companies, etc.) with their own Terms of Service.

The company would need to consider not just the DNS servers, but also the policies of all networks and ISPs involved in the test path.

I am working on an ontology and would like to put constitutions under the category of \"codes\", along with regular \"codes\" (like the US Code), since it seems they are both dealing with law and thus can be classified the same (though they are obviously different in some ways). Likewise, after an hour of digging around, I couldn't find really what the similarities and differences were between these 9 or 10 terms really was.

The Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Justinian were both collections of laws, gathered for easy reference. In the US, the US Code (USC) is an almost comprehensive collection of current law, much of which was passed in separate statutes before it was codified. In this contest, to **codify** is to include a law in the code, altering formatting and numbering to make it consistent with the rest of the code. Laws in the US are normally passed and go into effect **before** they are codified.\n\nIn modern usage \"code\" is not normally used for a single law.\n\nThere is also the US Code of Federal Regulations or CFR which is a **collection** of regulations passed by various federal agencies to implement law. They are not laws, but in many respects thy have the force of law.\n\nI believe that several other legal systems use \"code\" or a word that might be translated as \"code\" in a similar way.\n\nIn a wider sense, \"code\" can be used to refer to an entire system of law, as \"the Mosaic code\" or \"the Anglo\\-American code\". It can also be used for the precepts of a non\\-legsal system as \"an ethical code\" or \"the architect's code of practice\".\n\nA bill is a proposed law not yet passed by a legislature.\n\nIn modern US usage, codes **only** include statutes passed by legislatures, not constitutions. This is because codes collect the work of legislatures, but written constitutions come from different and special sources.\n\nThe term \"act\", in modern usage, is a synonym for \"statute\".

There is a dispute between two artists or labels. The plaintiff produced a well known tune and accuses the defendant of copying this work. The defendant says the plaintiff didn't have copyright in that work because it wasn't original in the first place, there is a 1200GB TAR file (compressed file) on GitHub that contains all possible single octave, 8\\-note, 12\\-beat melody combos, which were produced before the plaintiff's work.

In litigating a breach, idiosyncratic private beliefs of the parties would not matter, what matters is what was objectively agreed on. So words are interpreted as having their ordinary meaning, unless there is a special stipulation as to the meaning of a term in the contract. There may be some dispute over what the \"ordinary meaning\" is, which may be resolved by introducing testimony from language experts or by looking at surrounding circumstances.\n\nThe \"ordinary meaning\" of a word or phrase is often so broad with respect to the intended agreement that a *narrowing* of the definition is necessary (or sometime the definition is expanded). Words are not wholly redefined (redefining \"house\" to mean \"cat\"). Many things can be deemed to be \"private use\", and it may be desirable to specifically say that it means \"exclusive use by the party of the first part\". Unless you overtly signal a change in scope of the term, you inherit all of the problems of ambiguity attached to the plain meaning of the term (in some contracts, that specifically works in favor of the other party).\n\nIf you are *not* talking about a contract, then you are socially free to to use \"glory\" to mean \"a nice knock\\-down argument\", at your social peril. If you are talking about what you are to do in light of some government requirement e.g. to pay taxes, it does not matter if you attach a note saying that you define \"income\" to mean \"money that falls from the sky\", income is whatever the government defines it as, even if you are ignorant of or don't agree with that definition. Governmental word definitions pertain to particular Acts. If the term \"wealth\" is defined in a specific way in some act, that does not mean that the term always is assigned that meaning everywhere. However, if the government has defined a term in some context, there is a reasonable chance that *in that context* a contract will be interpreted following that definition. This is because all parties are assumed to know the law and therefore know that \"licensed premise\" has a particular meaning with respect to liquor sales.

When a term has a well-established meaning in a particular industry or legal context (such as \"licensed premises\" in liquor licensing), that meaning is likely to be applied unless the contract explicitly states otherwise. The statutory definition provides strong evidence of the term's ordinary meaning in this context. While parties can define terms differently in their contracts, they must do so explicitly.

It is not difficult to identify a person by its phone number.\n\nSo, sharing the phone number of the people affected should take into account the restrictions of GDPR.\n\nFor instance, the Spanish Data Protection Agency (*Agencia Espa\u00f1ola de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos*, AEPD) established in its Resolution R/03041/2017 that the Town Hall of Boecillo had violated the GDPR because it had created a WhatsApp group of citizens. Those citizens had provided their phone numbers to be informed about town hall activities, but they had not agreed to share their numbers with the other members of the group.\n\nAnd that was a very generic group.

The documentation clearly states that creating a WhatsApp group in this context could very easily lead to a GDPR violation. This is because:\n\n1. Phone numbers are considered personal information under GDPR.\n2. Sharing phone numbers in a group setting, even if participants can't send messages, still constitutes sharing personal data.\n3.

We have no extradition treaties with the above mentioned countries, and generally speaking the US does not extradite except under terms of a treaty (see [discussion here](https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-15000-international-extradition-and-related-matters#9-15.100)), following [18 USC 3184](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3184). There are provisions allowing extradition of those who are not citizens, nationals or permanent residents of the US, and are accused of crimes of violence against nationals of the United States in foreign countries.\n\nIn contrast, there is [no federal law pertaining to enforcement of foreign judgments](http://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1529&context=facpubs) against people in the US, so you have to look at the particular laws of the state, or federal government in case the federal government could have jurisdiction. One vehicle for enforcing foreign judgments is a version of the [Uniform Foreign Money\\-Judgments Recognition Act](http://www.uniformlaws.org/ActSummary.aspx?title=Foreign-Country%20Money%20Judgments%20Recognition%20Act), which is enacted in [various states](http://www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Foreign-Country%20Money%20Judgments%20Recognition%20Act) such as [RCW 6\\.40A](http://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=6.40A&full=true) in Washington. Enforcement of judgments can be blocked or optional according to circumstance, for example it is blocked if \"The judgment was rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law\", and may be blocked if \"The judgment was obtained by fraud that deprived the losing party of an adequate opportunity to present its case\" or \"The judgment or the cause of action on which the judgment is based is repugnant to the public policy of this state or of the United States\".

Specifically:\n\n1. The US does not automatically extradite to countries without extradition treaties, ruling out option A.\n2. Option B is incorrect because the Russian company does have potential legal recourse in the US, primarily through civil lawsuits.\n3. Option C is correct because the Russian company could potentially file a civil lawsuit in a US court.

I am confused as to why this is required.\n\nAs I understand it, all of the activities mentioned above are already criminal offences (blocking a highway, trespass with intention of blocking a highway, criminal damage, etc). I also believe (perhaps incorrectly), that inciting somebody else to commit a crime (e.g. the organisers of one of these groups encouraging their members to behave like this) is also illegal. What is the purpose of injunctions, given that much of this behaviour is illegal under existing legislation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\")\n\nI think the main reason is that in specific prosecutions such behaviour may not be found to constitute any of those criminal offences. While on the face of it the behaviour is illegal, the court is also obliged to take into account the rights to freedom of expression, of assembly and association, in [the Human Rights Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1). But a court's injunction sets out in black and white the restrictions on behaviour *after* considering the human rights aspects of the case, and breach of the order is a contempt of court (not a criminal offence as such, but punishable by imprisonment and/or a fine).\n\nSuch injunctions are an *additional* tool for trying to mitigate or deter the behavior to which you refer and in a sense they are more convenient than criminal prosecutions.\n\nSome considerations and more detail in no particular order:\n\n**Standard of proof differences**\n\nYou mention relevant criminal offences. These necessarily have the criminal 'standard of proof'. The trier of fact (the jury at jury trial; the magistrate or judge at non\\-jury trial), having considered all the relevant evidence, must be sure the defendant is guilty.\n\nHowever, the entity seeking an injunction (the claimant) does not need to meet that standard of proof to obtain an injunction that includes restrictions on behaviour. They need only persuade the court there is a real and imminent risk of a civil wrong for which they merit relief, or that there is a serious issue to be tried at a later date for which they merit relief until the conclusion of that trial.\n\n**Criminal prosecution delays**\n\nFor the past two years to the time of writing this answer, circumstances have been such that if there were a criminal trial (which is by no means guaranteed), it may be scheduled months, perhaps even a year or two, in the future. But the claimant (and the wider public) may want relief 'now' and the defendant(s) might be free to continue their behaviour in the meanwhile, the defendant might not be held in custody pending trial.\n\nDue to delays, [some defendants have been in custody for several months pending trial](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/23/uk-climate-activists-held-in-jail-for-up-to-six-months-before-trial) and this isn't satisfactory either, particularly if they are innocent: \"everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time\" ([article 6 Human Rights Act 1998](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1/part/I/chapter/5)).\n\n**The behaviour may not be found to constitute a criminal offence**\n\nIn this context, the law providing for the criminal offence must be read 'compatibly' with the human rights legislation \\- the qualified [rights to freedom of expression, to assembly and association](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/schedule/1). Meaning, is this criminal justice system reponse to that behaviour provided for in law, necessary and proportionate, in pursuit of a legitimate aim, protecting the rights and freedoms of others, and were there no alternative and less restrictive responses?\n\nNow, some of those elements are a definite yes (e.g. trespass to or obstruction of the highway are provided for in law), others may be arguable. But in any case, the police, prosecution and the court (if it gets that far) must consider those things, must do that weighing up \\- it is not explicitly provided for in the legislation that creates those criminal offences. The courts have not found every protest on a highway to constitute a trespass to ([Director of Public Prosecutions v. Jones and Another](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1999/5.html)) or obstruction of a highway ([Director of Public Prosecutions (Respondent) v Ziegler and others (Appellants)](https://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2021/23.html)).\n\nOn the other hand, when these claimants seek an injunction the court does that weighing up and may consider alternative, less restrictive approaches (the claimant submits a wishlist, the defendant or court may push back). The court will say \"Yes, this is in pursuit of a legitimate aim and necessary to protect the rights and freedoms of the claimant and the wider public, however X is disproportionate, Y is proportionate, the defendants may go in area A but not area B, this time period is disproportionate, that time period is proportionate,\" and so on.\n\nSo the claimant and the police are now armed with that injunction, the claimant will publish it, defendants are aware of its contents and fellow protesters ought to be made aware of it. It's there in black\\-and\\-white what is restricted and anyone breaching the injunction could be found guilty of [contempt of court](https://www.gov.uk/contempt-of-court) (punishable by up to two years in prison and/or unlimited fine or asset seizure; must be proved to the criminal standard).\n\n**Example judgments about injunctions including lists of restrictions**\n\nHere are some examples from the context that include different kinds of restrictions by court order and the court's weighing up of the competing interests of the claimants, the defendants and the wider public.\n\n[Shell UK Oil Products Ltd v Persons Unknown \\[2022] EWHC 1215 (QB) (20 May 2022\\)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2022/1215.html) The claimant sought (and succeeded) to maintain an injunction that was granted on an emergency basis, its restrictions set out at para 20, conclusion at para 70\\.\n\n[National Highways Ltd v Heyatawin \\[2021] EWHC 3078 (QB)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2021/3078.html) \\- see para 7 for restrictions, the court found some protesters breached the so\\-called M25 Order and the court ordered their immediate imprisonment (para 66\\).\n\n[National Highways Ltd v Persons unknown (blocking traffic) \\[2021] EWHC 3081 (QB) (17 November 2021\\)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2021/3081.html) \\- the reasons for the decision to not set aside the ex parte interim injunction made by Linden J on 25 October 2021, some restrictions at para 4\\.\n\n[High Speed Two (HS2\\) Ltd \\& Anor v Four Categories of Persons Unknown \\& Ors \\[2022] EWHC 2360 (KB) (20 September 2022\\)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/KB/2022/2360.html) \\- restrictions at para 188\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, why might authorities seek injunctions against climate protest groups like Extinction Rebellion, even though many of their disruptive activities are already criminal offenses?\n\nA) Injunctions have a lower standard of proof than criminal prosecutions, making them easier to obtain.\n\nB) Injunctions allow for immediate relief while criminal trials may face significant delays.\n\nC) Injunctions explicitly consider human rights implications, which may not be fully addressed in existing criminal laws.\n\nD) All of the above\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D (All of the above) because:\n\nA) Is correct: Injunctions have a civil standard of proof, which is lower than the criminal standard of \"beyond reasonable doubt\".

Say for example I present to my users \"there are \\~1000 people that live in California that have a website\", or \"90% of website owners have visited New York\", or those kinds of things. Then say that an organization leaves the SaaS and wants their data removed. Am I to actually literally update the aggregated data with \\-1 user, or let's say \\-100 organization members, so it's calculations are based on 1 or 100 less users? That way, if 100 users left the SaaS and deleted their data, it would now maybe say \"89% of website owners have visited New York\", or however the aggregate was recomputed.\n\nI ask this because, the way we are generating aggregate data currently is by querying over *anonymized* \"data points\". The location might be kept, or the fact they owned a website, or some financial data point, but the organization or user name (and database ID) is deleted from the anonymized data point. Then we do a SQL query on these points to compute the aggregated statistics. But the question is, if some organization or user asks to \"remove their data\", what are we to do with these \"data points\", since they are anonymized? We can't really delete them because they are anonymized, and we don't know where they came from (since org/user name is deleted on them, for example). So they ask to delete data, but we don't delete this data because we have no way to map it back to their org?\n\nIs that acceptable? Or should we be keeping track of the org/user \"under the hood\", (not showing the personal information in the aggregate reports to customers though), and that way when they ask to delete their data, we can actually delete their data points from our analytics system?\n\nThe problem is, we want to build a data set of some kind, and so are keeping everything anonymized from the get go, but there is no way to actually know how to delete their data if they asked, but we did still technically have gained from their signing up and adding their data points originally.

You can use it for the contracted purpose, or in accordance to law, or with informed and revokable consent, or for some other enumerated purposes. Even with consent, you have to take security measures to avoid the misuse of the data.\n\nRemember the software shrink\\-wrap licenses? \"By opening the package, you agree to the terms inside.\" GDPR makes the equivalent in the cloud world impossible. You have to document exactly what you do with the data, and for any use that is not necessary to perform the service the customer can opt out.\n\nIn the scenario you describe, it is possible that you are not the data *controller* under GDPR but the data *processor*, and that you have a duty to keep the data from separate *controllers* apart.

Is it part of common law, or\n> codified?\n\nThis rule is part of the shared common law heritage of common law countries, that is part of the basic structure of the legal system in these countries.\n\nHistorically it was a common law rule of practice. Many jurisdictions have not chosen to codify it, at least not in full, although I am sure that some countries include it as part of their court rules (indeed, most U.S. jurisdictions obliquely reference and modify parts of the common law rule about the need to file post\\-trial motions to preserve appellate issues in their trial court civil rules).\n\nIn general, it isn't uncommon for common law countries to adopt rules and statutes that state only a modification of a common law rule, without affirmatively stating the underlying common law rule that is being modified.\n\nThis said, there are a number of exceptions to the preservation rule which are probably not uniform in common law jurisdictions, although the deviations and elaborations of the common law rule are probably well defined in each common law jurisdiction in case law (because it comes up in literally every single reported appellate case).\n\nSome of the notable exceptions to the requirement of preservation in the U.S. are for \"plain error\", \"structural error\", subject\\-matter jurisdiction (including standing, mootness, and lack of case or controversy), and for errors that aren't made until the final verdict in a case. In general, error must be preserved at trial in cases that are resolved at trial, but there is an exception in most jurisdictions for \"motions in limine\" which are evidence ruling made prior to trial in lieu of a ruling at trial.\n\nDenial of a dispositive motion (e.g. a motion for summary judgment or motion to dismiss), prior to trial, will generally not preserve error, but a grant of a dispositive motion over objections, in full or in part, prior to trial will preserve error as the the portion of the case that is dismissed based upon that motion with respect to the issues raised in the objections to the dispositive motion.\n\nUsually, matters not apparent from the record and only discovered after the fact of a trial can be preserved by raising them in a post\\-trial motion to set aside a judgment if timely made, but can't be raised on a direct appeal.\n\nOne of the reasons that case law is important to the rule of preservation is that a central issue in many cases is whether a particular statement made in court or in a written filing is sufficiently specific to preserve the issue in the manner that it is presented on appeal, which often involves a certain amount of gray area. Some jurisdictions are more strict than others regarding how specifically the action taken at trial that is alleged to have preserved the issue for appeal has to be to preserve an issue. Generally speaking, one in not limited on appeal to the specific legal authority offered up at trial in an appellate briefing. But if one makes an argument on appeal that is similar but has a different twist to it than the way the argument was articulated at trial, it becomes a judgment call.\n\nFor example, suppose that a claim is thrown out based upon the statute of frauds (i.e. because a contract wasn't in writing). If one argues one exception to the general rule (e.g. partial performance) at trial, can one argue another exception to the general rule (e.g. detrimental reliance or estoppel), that is similar but analytically distinct, on appeal?

For what purpose? How did the person become an Indian citizen?\n\nFor example, if the person became Indian by naturalization, a naturalization certificate would usually be necessary. If a person became Indian by birth then evidence establishing the relevant facts will be needed, and this evidence will typically include a birth certificate.\n\nWe can see that a passport isn't necessary to prove citizenship because a first\\-time passport applicant needs to prove citizenship in the application. Whatever documents are acceptable for this must therefore constitute proof of citizenship.\n\nBut there is always the possibility that an Indian citizen in possession of any document, including a passport, does something that causes the automatic loss of Indian nationality, such as naturalizing in a foreign country. At that point, the former Indian citizen will be in possession of documents that appear to show Indian citizenship without actually being an Indian citizen. Therefore, we can establish that *no document or set of documents can be conclusive proof of Indian citizenship.*\n\nDepending on the context, the person who needs to be convinced of a person's Indian citizenship may or may not need to take into account the likelihood that the person has somehow done something that would cause loss of citizenship. An airline agent boarding a passenger for an international flight to India will be satisfied by the passport. The immigration officer processing the passenger on arrival might however make a brief inquiry into possible expatriating acts. A judge in a court case may go as far as to undertake an intensive legal\\-factual analysis in which documents play a limited role, if any.\n\nThus, the answer to your question\n\n> What is the sure shot way of proving citizenship of India?\n\nis that there is none. There is always the possibility that a good\\-faith attempt to prove the citizenship of an Indian citizen will fail. There is always the possibility of a noncitizen having documents that were issued legitimately and purport to show that the person is an Indian citizen.\n\nIn the 2013 case, it [appears that the passports were issued in error](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/Passport-alone-no-proof-of-citizenship-Bombay-HC/articleshow/22244467.cms).

In that case, plaintiff who was a form of \"minister\" in the church was fired for reasons related to a disability, and she sued on grounds of illegal discrimination. The court unanimously rejected the suit on First Amendment ground, finding that \"The Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment bar suits brought on behalf of ministers against their churches, claiming termination in violation of employment discrimination laws\" (the scope of the ministerial exception is narrowed w.r.t. ministers and employment discrimination laws). Thus the government must \"have no role in filling ecclesiastical offices\", and \"it is impermissible for the government to contradict a church\u2019s determination of who can act as its ministers\" which \"precludes application of such legislation to claims concerning the employment relationship between a religious institution and its ministers\".

Morrissey\\-Berru](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/591/19-267/#tab-opinion-4270873), 591 U.S. finds that the government also cannot define bright lines as to what a \"minister\" is (at issue was a lack of formal training for ministers).\n\nWith this background, what is to stop you is that you will probably get sued by the government, and it may be impossible to present evidence that your practice is analogous to that involving the prior SCOTUS cases.That is, from Guadalups,\n\n> there is abundant record evidence that they both performed vital\n> religious duties, such as educating their students in the Catholic\n> faith and guiding their students to live their lives in accordance\n> with that faith.

That does not mean that a simple \"declaration\" by itself conveys special immunity to you. The court could well conclude that your claim to being a religion is spurious.

For the force to be justified, you have to reasonably believe you are in danger of being harmed, that you need to use force to avoid the harm, and you may only use the minimum force necessary to eliminate the threat. It then is a matter for the jury to decide whether those principles were followed in your particular instance. The reason why it's hard to predict the outcome is that it depends on a subjective evaluation by the jury, as to whether the shooter had a reasonable fear and whether lesser force was a viable option. \n\nThe jury's decision is guided by instructions to the jury (\\#506, \\#506\\) which focus on relevant distinctions.

This evaluation is subjective and guided by jury instructions.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while bank robbery is considered a forcible and atrocious crime, the justifiable homicide defense is not automatically applied and still requires evaluation of the specific circumstances.\n\nAnswer B is too definitive, as the outcome would depend on the jury's evaluation of the circumstances, not a predetermined guilt.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because California does not have \"stand your ground\" laws that would provide blanket immunity in this situation, and the use of deadly force to prevent any felony is not automatically justified."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70894/what-motivated-the-indian-supreme-court-to-legalize-homosexuality", "docs_id": 70894, "title": "What motivated the Indian supreme court to legalize homosexuality?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to the Pew Research Center article [Key findings about religion in India](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/29/key-findings-about-religion-in-india/), 97% of the Indian population is religious.

The decriminalization of homosexuality in India occurred through a Supreme Court decision in the case of Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India. The court ruled that criminalizing consensual homosexual acts between adults violated the constitutional right to equality. This legal change was based on constitutional principles rather than popular opinion or religious doctrine. The court focused on legal questions rather than religious or moral considerations, emphasizing that the state has no right to control the private lives of LGBT individuals and that denying sexual orientation rights is equivalent to denying the right to privacy."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3989/implied-insults", "docs_id": 3989, "title": "Implied insults", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What are the legal differences between an explicit insult, that qualifies as slander, and an implication of the same insult?\n\nI am a German citizen, so I'd prefer answers applicable to Germany.

[Here](http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2870&context=flr) is a thorough but somewhat dated article on the subject.\n\nNew York has recently established an explicit test for defamation by implication:\n\n> To survive a motion to dismiss a claim for defamation by implication where the factual statements at issue are substantially true, the plaintiff must make a rigorous showing that the language of the communication as a whole can be reasonably read both to impart a defamatory inference and to affirmatively suggest that the author intended or endorsed that inference.\n\n*Stepanov v Dow Jones \\& Co.*, 2014 NY Slip Op 03940 (App. Div. May 29, 2014\\). That opinion also discusses the other approaches used in other U.S. states.\n\nUnder that standard, it seems clear that my example statements would be defamatory; any juror would immediately understand both the factual implication and that it was 100% intentional. In practical terms, I doubt any court in the United States would not consider them defamatory.\n\nIn general, defamation is harder to prove in the United States than in other jurisdictions, because of the strong protections afforded to speech under the First Amendment\\-\\-but I don't know enough about German law to speak to that issue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under New York's test for defamation by implication, which of the following statements about a person named Bob would be LEAST likely to be considered defamatory?\n\nA) \"I won't say anything against Bob. But Bill is in the same business, and I happen to know that Bill has never been arrested for fraud.\"\n\nB) \"There are three people you could do business with.

Did you know he lives near an elementary school?\"\n\nD) \"I heard Bob is really good at hiding his financial records. Not that I'm implying anything, of course.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: New York's test for defamation by implication requires that the language can be reasonably read to impart a defamatory inference AND that the author intended or endorsed that inference. Option B is the least likely to be considered defamatory because it doesn't strongly imply anything negative about Bob, nor does it suggest the speaker intended a negative inference.\n\nOptions A, C, and D all more clearly imply negative things about Bob (fraud, potential pedophilia, and financial dishonesty respectively) and suggest the speaker intended these inferences. Option B, while potentially suspicious in context, is the most neutral and least likely to meet the rigorous standard required by New York's test."}}
