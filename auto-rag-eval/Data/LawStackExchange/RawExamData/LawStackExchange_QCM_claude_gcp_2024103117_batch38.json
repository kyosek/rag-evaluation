What are some of the rights that prisoners enjoy as forced labor in the United States if they have any?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary source of minimum wage and hours laws for the United States as a whole is the [Fair Labor Standard Act](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title29/chapter8&edition=prelim). Generally [courts have held that prisoners are not employees within the meaning of the act](https://www.gao.gov/assets/ggd-93-98.pdf).\n\nThe amount paid for prison labor is a matter of state correctional system policy, and some states, such as Texas, pay nothing to prisoners for their labor, while others pay a tiny fraction of the federal minimum wage.\n\nThe main rights of prisoners who are detained pursuant to a conviction is to be free of physical harm arising from deliberate indifference to their well being, or to be free of punishment beyond what they were sentenced to for their crimes.

The amount paid for prison labor is determined by state correctional system policies, leading to significant variations across states. Some states pay nothing, while others pay a small fraction of the minimum wage.\n\nA is incorrect because prisoners are not typically covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act and thus are not entitled to federal minimum wage.\n\nB is incorrect because prisoner labor rights and compensation vary significantly from state to state.

While there is no contractual relationship between Mr. Creditor and Mr. ThirdParty (ruling out option A), there may be potential for a claim based on promissory estoppel. However, this is not guaranteed or easy to win (contrary to option D), and depends on several factors such as clear evidence of a promise, dishonest behavior, a special relationship, and irreversible change of position.

This number varies depending on the type of employer (for example, whether the employer is a private company, a state or local government agency, a federal agency, an employment agency, or a labor union) and the kind of discrimination alleged (for example, discrimination based on a person's race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age (40 or older), disability or genetic information).\n\nAll employers are covered, whether or not a particular regulation covers a particular employer is dependent on the number of employees. For example, age discrimination is covered by employers who have more than 20 employees and Equal Pay Act coverage is for virtually all employers.\n\nFrom the same web site:\n\n> People who are not employed by the employer, such as independent contractors, are not covered by the anti\\-discrimination laws.

The documentation clearly states that exemptions from EEOC regulations are not uniform, but instead vary based on the specific anti-discrimination law in question and the number of employees an organization has. For example, age discrimination laws apply to employers with more than 20 employees, while the Equal Pay Act covers virtually all employers. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because non-profit status alone does not automatically exempt an organization from EEOC regulations. \n\nAnswer B is false because EEOC regulations can apply to various types of employers, not just for-profit businesses, and the employee threshold varies by law. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the exemptions are not uniform across all anti-discrimination laws, but rather depend on the specific law and employer characteristics."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78593/credit-card-charged-but-domain-not-booked-by-a-domain-registrar-where-should-i-g", "docs_id": 78593, "title": "Credit card charged but domain not booked by a domain registrar where should I go against an International Merchant", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sav.com had latency in the month of October.

And the terms of Kickstarter make it clear that it is your legal obligation to deliver as promised (see [Your responsibility](https://ksr-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/creator-responsibility.png)).\n\n> In order to deliver you need to pay for your bill of material, your processing cost, your working time (this is your salary), shipping, a Kickstart fee, maybe office space and so on. Considering all this cost, you define the minimum amount of money you need and set this as your target (see in more detail [What should I consider when setting my funding goal?](https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005134293-What-should-I-consider-when-setting-my-funding-goal-)).\n\nThe salary is dependent on you how much money you want to pay yourself (so you more or less define it). I guess one would pay oneself a typical salary as also paid in a comparable industry.\n\n> In case you collect a lot more than you expected, you might reinvest, improve your product or you can also make a profit (see in more detail [What happens when a project is overfunded?](https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005132473-What-happens-when-a-project-is-overfunded-)).\n\nThis means you could pay yourself an accordingly higher salary.\n\nAfter you paid yourself a salary, you have to pay tax on the salary. The details are dependent on the country where you live, but this is generally how it works.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John launches a Kickstarter campaign for his new board game project with a funding goal of $50,000. The campaign is successful and raises $75,000. John estimates that the costs for materials, manufacturing, and shipping will be $40,000. He wants to pay himself for his work on the project. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding how John should handle the funds and his compensation?\n\nA) John can pay himself the entire remaining $35,000 as salary, as Kickstarter has no restrictions on creator compensation.\n\nB) John should only pay himself a modest fixed fee, such as $1,000, regardless of the amount raised, to avoid legal issues.\n\nC) John can pay himself a reasonable salary based on industry standards and the work involved, but should consider setting aside money for taxes and potential project improvements.\n\nD) John must use all excess funds beyond the $50,000 goal for project improvements and cannot pay himself any salary from the Kickstarter funds.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach is to pay oneself a reasonable salary based on industry standards and the work involved. Kickstarter allows creators to include their own compensation as part of the project costs. However, it's important to consider several factors:\n\n1. The primary obligation is to deliver the promised product to backers.\n2. Costs should be accounted for, including materials, manufacturing, shipping, and Kickstarter fees.\n3. Taxes need to be considered, as the creator will need to pay taxes on their income.\n4. With overfunding, creators can choose to improve the product, reinvest in the project, or potentially increase their compensation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't consider other potential costs or the obligation to deliver the product. Option B is too restrictive and doesn't reflect the reality of compensation for significant work. Option D is incorrect because Kickstarter does allow for creator compensation and doesn't require all excess funds to be used for improvements. Option C provides the most balanced and accurate approach, considering all factors involved in managing Kickstarter funds and creator compensation."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64074/crime-in-one-country-criminal-from-another-whats-the-legal-recourse", "docs_id": 64074, "title": "Crime in one country, criminal from another, what&#39;s the legal recourse?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Consider a hypothetical situation where a USA citizen, present in Sri Lanka either legally or illegally, commits some murders and flees back to the USA. What can be done to bring this person to trial?\n\nSuppose there is no proof that this citizen killed two people. Of course, people saw them doing it, but they don't want to come forward as witnesses, and the family wants justice. Obviously, the police will want witness before issuing a warrant.\n\nIf this family is represented by a lawyer who appeals to the court, what will the court do? I'm not talking about extradition or something. It is more about bringing this person to trial, whether in USA or in Sri Lanka. What is the process after a crime's been committed and the perpetrator flees back to the safety of their country?\n\n### Supplemental Questions\n\n1. If a good lawyer was stating the question above, what would their precise terms be?\n2. Will this whole hypothetical situation fall under the case study of criminal law? Is it a matter of international laws as well?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the police or other authorities of Sri Lanka do not have witnesses or other evidences supporting that this American committed the crime, there is little that can be done. The police of Sri Lanka could ask the police of whatever locality the person is now in to interview the accused, which they might do as a favor, but are not obliged to do. If they do such an interview, the content would probably be sent to the Sri Lankan authorities. It might or might not be of help to them.\n\nIf the Sri Lankan authorities can assemble some evidence, they could apply for [extradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition). That is a matter which depends on the existence of a treaty. According to [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3181](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3181) there is an extradition treaty between the US and Sri Lanka, which became effective on Jan. 12, 2001\\.\n\nExtradition requests are normally subject to review by the courts and diplomatic authorities of the *sending nation*, that is the country that is requested to extradite a person. The request may be refused if there is not sufficient evidence, or if the charge is not a crime under the laws of the sending nation, or for other reasons specified in the law of the sending nation.\n\nIn the hypothetical case in the question, the main issue would probable be whether there was sufficient evidence. If it were claimed that the accused could not get a fair trial in Sri Lanka, or would be likely to be subject to torture there, that could also be a reason for refusal.\n\nIn the US this is handled under [18 USC 3184](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3184) This provides in relevant part that:\n\n> If, on such hearing, \\[the judge or magistrate] deems the evidence sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention, or under section 3181(b), he shall certify the same, together with a copy of all the testimony taken before him, to the Secretary of State, that a warrant may issue upon the requisition of the proper authorities of such foreign government, for the surrender of such person, according to the stipulations of the treaty or convention; and he shall issue his warrant for the commitment of the person so charged to the proper jail, there to remain until such surrender shall be made.\n\nI do not know the details of criminal procedure in Sri Lanka, so I don't know what, if anything, a court might do about such a case. In the US, a court would have nothing to do in such a matter until and unless the prosecutor was willing to present formal charges. Such charges would have to establish that there was *probable cause* to believe that a crime had been committed, and that the accused had comitted it, before a trial could be held.\n\nThe Sri Lankan authorities could also request that a relevant US prosecutor file charges and try the accused in a US court. In some cases the US will try US nationals for offenses committed outside the US. But in the kind of case described in the question, this would not be usual.\n\nIf Sri Lankan law permits, the authorities there could also try the accused *in absentia*. Many countries and many people regard this as fundamentally unfair, but it is sometimes done. In such a case, the person convicted *in absentia* could be arrested if s/he ever came within the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka. Aside from that, Sri Lanka cannot bring the person to court unless they apply for and get extradition, or the person travels to Sri Lanka again and is arrested there.\n\nAs to the specific questions:\n\n> if a good lawyer was stating the question above, what would their precise terms be?\n\nThere are not very many specific terms to be used. The person said to have comitted the murder (or other crime) would probably be refereed to as \"the accused\" or possibly \"the alleged criminal\". If there is a specific term for the particular crime in Sri Lankan law, it would be used. If it were a real case, details such as the time and place of the crime would be given.\n\n> will this whole hypothetical situation fall under the case study of criminal law? I'm thinking international laws as well, but then I don't know for sure what international laws are, so there's that.\n\nYes, this is an aspect of criminal law, albeit one that most lawyers in criminal law practice never have occasion to deal with. In a sense there is no such thing as \"international law\", that is, law binding on countries. What is known as \"international law\" is the complex of treaties and agreements between various countries and the way in which they are given effect. Nations never have to enter into treaties, although there can be great pressure to do so. A nation can always denounce a treaty, although there may be consequences such as political or economic pressure, or in extreme cases, war.\n\n\"international law\" is also the accumulated precedents for how nations have interacted in the past over legal issues, but this is only binding in future cases to the extent that a given country's laws or courts treat it as binding, or that a current treaty makes it so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. citizen is accused of committing multiple murders in Sri Lanka before fleeing back to the United States.

What is the most likely outcome in this scenario?\n\nA) The U.S. will immediately extradite the citizen to Sri Lanka for trial based on the accusation alone.\n\nB) Sri Lankan authorities can directly arrest the accused on U.S. soil and bring them back for trial.\n\nC) The U.S. will try the accused in a U.S. court for crimes committed in Sri Lanka without any request from Sri Lankan authorities.\n\nD) Without sufficient evidence, Sri Lankan authorities will face significant challenges in bringing the accused to trial, either through extradition or other means.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, without concrete evidence or willing witnesses, Sri Lankan authorities would face major obstacles in pursuing legal action against the accused. Extradition requests typically require substantial evidence to be considered, and U.S. courts would be unlikely to proceed without probable cause. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they describe actions that would be highly unusual or impossible given the circumstances described.

In 2008, the CEO of an IT consulting company indicted himself, because his company frequently uses such tools for penetration tests on their customer's systems.

These boards have both regulatory power like any other government agency, and the quasi\\-judicial authority to resolve union\\-management disputes outside of the regular court system.\n\nThe cited document is an opinion of the New York Public Employment Relations Board decided in 1998 and reported in the case reporter \"[Public Employment Relations Board Reports](http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/style-manual/2017/2017-SM.htm#APPENDIX%202)\" in volume 31 as decision number 4021 in that volume, for which the paragraph symbol (\u00b6) is used in their official form of citation (the section symbol is \u00a7).

If no section or paragraph mark were used, the reference would be to a page number in that volume of the case reporter under default rules for interpreting citations. But, since this is a reference to a sequential entry in the case reporter, rather than to a page number, some symbol must be used to identify it. The use of the \u00b6 symbol to break up logical components of a volume parallels the practice for learned legal treatises and legal services which usually break up their logical units by components denoted with the paragraph mark.\n\nThe case name \"(Matter of Freeport Union Free Sch.

In this citation, \"\u00b6 4021\" represents decision number 4021 in volume 31 of the Public Employment Relations Board Reports. The paragraph symbol (\u00b6) is used to indicate that this is a sequential entry or logical unit within the volume, rather than a page number. This usage distinguishes it from standard case citations where numbers typically refer to page numbers. The paragraph symbol serves a similar function to its use in legal treatises and services, where it denotes logical components of a volume.

If the municipal ordinances state that a particular place does not allow parking at certain times, then if you park there you have violated the law and will get ticketed. There is no requirement that there be signs prominently posted saying that you must obey the law in this particular location. A law might itself require there to be postings, for example speed limit law pertaining to school zones typically are stated in terms of \"posted\" boundaries. Assuming that the ordinance doesn't have such a \"as posted\" requirement, you have no legal leg to stand on, and the burden must be shifted to your political leg.\n\nIf, for example, you were in Pennsylvania, [75 PaCSA 3353(d)](https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-75-pacsa-vehicles/pa-csa-sect-75-3353.html) permits local parking ordinances: \n\n> The department on State\\-designated highways and local authorities on\n>  any highway within their boundaries may by erection of official\n>  traffic\\-control devices prohibit, limit or restrict stopping, standing\n>  or parking of vehicles on any highway where engineering and traffic\n>  studies indicate that stopping, standing or parking would constitute a\n>  safety hazard or where the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles\n>  would unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic.\n\nSigns are kinds of traffic control devices. Since PA does not statutorily prohibit overnight parking, any local restrictions on overnight parking would require signage. Thus restriction such as [this one](https://ecode360.com/32271425#32271425) that \"The following vehicles shall not be parked between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. on the streets...\", applying to commercial vehicles among others, would require a sign.

The law states that local authorities may enact such restrictions \"by erection of official traffic-control devices.\" Therefore, without posted signs indicating the overnight parking restriction, the ticket would be invalid under Pennsylvania state law.

An authorized occupant is\n\n> a person entitled to occupy a dwelling unit with the consent of the\n>  landlord, but who has not signed the rental agreement and therefore\n>  does not have the financial obligations as a tenant under the rental\n>  agreement.\n\nA tenant is \n\n> a person entitled only under the terms of a rental agreement to occupy\n>  a dwelling unit to the exclusion of others and shall include roomer.\n\nThere is a third category, guest or invitee which\n\n> means a person, other than the tenant or person authorized by the\n>  landlord to occupy the premises, who has the permission of the tenant\n>  to visit but not to occupy the premises.\n\nSuch people who live there would not be invitees.\n\nClearly, you can have others living with you who are not on the lease, if the landlord agrees. The landlord's main concern regarding credit rating is probably financial responsibility, and if you qualify, having people live with you who have low or no credit rating is unlikely to make any difference. There may be other concerns, such as background checks or increases utility costs).\n\nVirginia law does not specifically allow \"unauthorized occupants\", i.e. occupants *not* approved by the landlord, nor does it specifically disallow such occupants. Leases often include a provision that addresses this matter, prohibiting unauthorized occupants. Supposing that the lease is silent on the matter (not likely) and the landlord wanted to compel the other occupants to leave, the procedure would be to tell the tenant that the unauthorized occupants must leave. Then if you do not comply (do not get them to move out), the landlord could start the procedure of evicting the lot of you, and the question would be whether the court would find that you have a right to let unauthorized other people live with you. I can't find any applicable case law, but it is unlikely that the court would find such a right. Tenants have special statutory rights, as do authorized occupants under the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.

On the other hand, *the first* defendant to actually fight back was able to uncover the hundreds of other cases, and the obvious fraud. The court swiftly ruled that\n\n* Jarek Molski is a *vexatious litigant* and **can file no more lawsuits**, except by asking permission (presenting the facts to a judge and the judge deciding that there's really a worthy case there).\n* The lawyers which represented Molski are likewise barred from representing anyone in an ADA case.\n* Their law firm, likewise.\n\nRighthaven\n----------\n\nAnother group of lawyers set up a law firm specifically to sue the owners of \"BBS's\" / internet forums / Q\\&A sites such as StackExchange, *whose public users* had pasted up copies of newspaper articles into the BBS. They **Bought the \"right to sue\"** from copyright owners such as newspapers \\- Righthaven didn't own the content, just the \"hunting license\" to go after people who infringed on the content \\- with the content owners getting a cut of proceeds.\n\nThey too filed hundreds of \"madlib\" lawsuits. In fact their lawsuit engine was so automated that they ['accidentally' sued journalists *writing about* Righthaven](https://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/the_righthaven_experiment_a_journalist_wonders_if_a_copyright_troll_was_rig) \\- (who quoted material from the entirely public lawsuit papers themselves \\- complaints are public by definition unless sealed by the courts.)\n\nNeedless to say, Righthaven had never heard of DMCA Safe Harbor, or hoped the forum owners hadn't. Again it worked: hundreds \"paid up\".\n\nMolski and Righthaven carefully chose \"settlement offer\" numbers ($5000\\-ish) that would be slightly cheaper than raising a legal defense ($6000\\-10,000\\). In the USA, each party pays their own legal bills \\- there's no concept of \"loser pays\" unless the other party's conduct is *outrageous*. It's so rare that when I had the pleasure of doing so, the court told us to take the standard garnishment forms, cross out \"defendant\" and hand\\-write \"plaintiff\" :)\n\nAnd again, the first defendant to actually stand up to Righthaven in court, asked the court to knock Righthaven to the moon, which [the court gleefully did](https://www.wired.com/2011/09/righthaven-on-life-support/).\n\nRIAA / MPAA\n-----------\n\nBitTorrent is a file\\-sharing network with no central hub. It breaks files into thousands of \"chunks\". Users collect chunks from hundreds of other users until they have the whole thing. Part of the social contract of BitTorrent is that people who download also upload (seed) to share the chunks they have gotten so far. People who refuse to upload are called leeches.\n\nRIAA and MPAA are the trade associations of the music and movie industries, respectively. They searched for BitTorrent (pirated, they claim) copies of their members' music and movies. They then \"leeched\" those copies with modified BitTorrent software that recorded the IP address of the \"seeder\". They took the IP address to the owning ISP, and demanded the customer identity. Then they sent out \"pay\\-us\\-or\\-else\" letters by the tens of thousands, and filed suits by the thousands. The argument was that the seeder had pirated the music, and that the ISP account holder was financially responsible for that activity, neither claim 100% reliable.\n\n[This campaign](https://jolt.richmond.edu/2018/03/15/has-the-riaa-given-up-on-combating-end-user-internet-piracy/) has been supported by the courts, because RIAA/MPAA were very careful of their legal footing. But I only mention this because **another gang of lawyers was paying attention, and they had their own ideas**.\n\nPrenda \"Law\"\n------------\n\nThis gang of lawyers correctly guessed that if users panicked at an RIAA/MPAA demand letter, **they'd *really* panic if the topic was pornography**.\n\nSo they set up a law firm specifically to apply RIAA/MPAA's techniques to porn. (one wonders if they paid RIAA a royalty). **But they were much more outrageous and careless**. For instance, rather than partner or purchase legitimate porn content, they worked with porn stars like Sunny Leone to create shell companies who, unbelievably [made original content](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/its-official-prenda-copyright-trolls-made-their-own-porn-seeded-on-pirate-bay/) *specifically as bait to ensnare BitTorrent users*.\n\nAgain, this situation only works until someone stands up for what's right: then it all falls apart.\n\nThis ended much, much worse than Righthaven or Molski. The civil judges were so offended they referred the matter out for *criminal prosecution*. **The organizers got [19 years in prison](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/prenda-law-porn-troll-saga-ends-with-prison-for-founder/)** between them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the common theme among the cases of Jarek Molski, Righthaven, and Prenda Law?\n\nA) They all involved legitimate claims of copyright infringement that were ultimately successful in court.\nB) They all resulted in immediate criminal charges for the plaintiffs due to their frivolous nature.\nC) They all represented patterns of filing numerous similar lawsuits, often with the intent to extract settlements rather than litigate on merit.\nD) They all involved cases related to violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The cases of Jarek Molski, Righthaven, and Prenda Law all demonstrate a pattern of filing numerous similar lawsuits, often with the primary intent of extracting settlements rather than litigating on the merits of each individual case.\n\nMolski filed hundreds of ADA-related lawsuits against restaurants, many of which were nearly identical. Righthaven filed numerous copyright infringement suits against website owners, often using automated systems. Prenda Law filed many lawsuits related to alleged copyright infringement of pornographic materials.\n\nIn all these cases, the plaintiffs aimed to profit from settlements, typically offering to settle for less than the cost of mounting a legal defense. This strategy worked initially, with many defendants choosing to settle. However, when challenged in court, these tactics were ultimately exposed and sanctioned.\n\nOption A is incorrect because these claims were not legitimate and were unsuccessful when genuinely contested.

If the third party does not sign up within X months, I give the money to charity.\n\nIs this legal according to the law of Minnesota, US? Any advice is greatly appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One way to look at this arrangement is that it would be an enforceable contract. \nAs a contractual matter, there is an agreement between you and the customer, and a separate agreement between you and the artist. In the first agreement, you have to give something of value, and the customer has to give something of value (money). You would be offering self\\-generated good feelings and encouraging something that the customer finds valuable. You would need to be clear about what they must do and what you must do, and assuming that, it would be a valid thus legal contract. (I set aside the question of whether the Spotify TOS might prohibit you from doing this: my answer is not Spotify\\-specific).\n\nTo be a real contract, you ought to be able to say what would be a breach of contract by you or the customer (you don't define breach in the contract, but conceptualizing the matter this way will help clarify the terms). You could breach if you simply refused to pass on the promised percentage, or unilaterally changed the percentage, or surprise customers by refusing to support Bj\u00f6rk or Enya. The customer might breach by e.g. inflating hit\\-rates by some software means, or by paying with fake money (rubber checks, invalid cards, whatever). One thing you cannot reasonably do is promise that the artist will be cooperative, so your promise would have to be clear about the non\\-cooperative artist option. (Suppose a customer listens to Bj\u00f6rk, Enya and Smith in that order, but Bj\u00f6rk declines to cooperate: is the money automatically re\\-distributed to Enya and Smith, or does Bj\u00f6rk's share go to the customer's charity? What is both the charity and artist are uncooperative \u2013 unlikely but not impossible?)\n\nTheoretically you can also form a contract with the artist, where you give something of value (money) in exchange for... and that part is not clear. \"Providing bank details\" might be the thing of value (valuable because it enables your contract with the customer). But there is no obvious reason for you to actually form a contract with the artist, and it is legal to give someone money with no strings attached (though you may have to mind income\\-reporting laws, if you hand over a lot of money). The tax consequences of this scheme should not be overlooked.\n\nAnother way to approach this is that you are running a charity, serving as a clearinghouse. Charities are highly regulated: the Minnesota AG provides [this guidance](http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Consumer/Publications/GuideCharityLaws.asp) on some of the law. If one opts to create a charity, one should hire an attorney. If one opts to not officially create a charity but does something that looks like it is a charity, one should hire an attorney to figure out how to do this so as to avoid prosecution for operating an unregistered charity.\n\nThere is also the potential that this could become a money\\-laundering operation. The federal [Money Laundering Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Laundering_Control_Act) might be relevant. The entire thing as enacted originally is [here](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-100/pdf/STATUTE-100-Pg3207.pdf) (193 pages), the laundering part is Subtitle H. Fortunately, what is outlawed is willful acts, e.g. \"knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\", \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\".

Penney case last month. \u201cEquity gets lost long before the case is filed.\u201d\n> \n> \n> Under U.S. bankruptcy law, shareholders are last in line for any kind of payout \\-\\- behind the lawyers, lenders, and vendors \\-\\- making a recovery for shares unusual. The size and scope of payouts is usually determined by a so\\-called Chapter 11 plan, which creditors vote on and send to a federal judge for approval. Those plans often leave even high\\-ranking creditors getting less than they\u2019re owed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because a company with positive equity isn't bankrupt\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nUsually.\n\n**The simple version**\n\nEquity in accounting terms is a part of the Statement of Financial Position (previously called the Balance Sheet) and represents the value owned by the shareholders. It was called a Balance Sheet because it balances:\n\n```\nAssets - Liabilities = Equity\n\n```\n\nA bankrupt company is one that is unable to settle its debts meaning that its Liabilities (what it owes) are greater than its Assets (what it owns). Therefore equity is negative \\- the equity has been lost before the company files for bankruptcy.\n\nSince shareholders have limited liability, they do not have to contribute to pay the company's debts so their shareholding is worthless. Their shareholding can't be worth less than worthless so in that sense David Jones is right \u201cNo one ever loses equity in a bankruptcy case, Equity gets lost long before the case is filed.\u201d It is the loss of the equity that caused the bankruptcy.\n\n**The more complex version**\n\nThe Statement of Financial Position is a point in time measure of the liquidated value of the entity \\- that is, the value of the company if all assets were sold for their book value and all debts were settled for their book value. This isn't something that can actually happen for all sorts of reasons.\n\nA company that gets liquidated will often not realise the full value of its booked assets because these are accounting measures of value rather than sale under the hammer values at a liquidation auction.\n\nFurther, businesses as [going concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_concern) have a different value than their book equity. An ongoing business will make profits (or losses) in the future and the expectation of these needs to be added (or subtracted) from the book equity. This is why a company with negative equity may still be worth operating and, conversely, why one with positive equity maybe should be closed.\n\nAlso, businesses may have significant off\\-balance\\-sheet assets such as valuable IP and branding that was developed in house and therefore don't create bookable transactions. For example, there is no item in the Coca\\-cola [balance sheet](https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/financial-information/balance-sheet) that represents the value of the brand. This is clearly an item of value that a) isn't on the balance sheet and b) only has value while someone is making cola and using that branding. Kodak, Blockbuster, Panamerican and Concorde were all once valuable brands that now only have nostalgia value.\n\nOne final point is that it is quite possible for a business with positive equity to go bankrupt because bankruptcy can be triggered by insolvency. Insolvency is being unable to pay your debts as and when they fall due. An asset rich but cash poor organisation can be insolvent while still having positive equity. For example, a property developer may have a large portfolio of valuable property and owe a relatively small amount to contractors, however, if they can't come up with the cash to pay these debts they are insolvent and this can trigger bankruptcy.\n\nMany businesses and individuals may be insolvent and recover from it \\- they borrow money from a bank (or by delaying payments to creditors) or inject more funds into the business. It is usually only when a business is of borderline profitability that insolvency will push them into bankruptcy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company has filed for bankruptcy, but its stock is still trading on the market.

In any case, I never received a **formal** extension offer. Perhaps more importantly, because I rejected the \"extension offer\", my employeer will hire a replacement.\n\nNow, is this an unfair request, perhaps asking for myself to renounce redundancy (or other) rights?

This means the end of employment was the employee's choice, not the employer's. In such cases, it is considered a voluntary departure rather than a redundancy or dismissal. Redundancy rights typically apply when the employer chooses to end the employment due to lack of work or elimination of the position.

The state Attorney General might have an interest in fraudulent charities, but without clearly showing that there is actual fraud, the response is likely to be \"Thank you for your interest, unfortunately we don't have the resources to dedicate to your complaint\".\n\n*Caveat emptor* distinguishes between a person saying \"we are a charity that helps people get into heaven\" and \"we are a 501 C non profit corporation that gets people into heaven\".

Can the contrasts between the nature of citizenship before and after the 14th Amendment be briefly summarized?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The primary intention of the 14th, and its largest effect, was of course to confer citizenship on blacks, particularly the former slaves. But it also constitutionalized the rule of \"birthright citizenship\" (aka *jus soli*), and removed any bars based on national origin or ethnicity. \n\nPrior to the 14th, naturalization was a federal matter, and Congress could make what rules it pleased. But citizenship for natives was a matter of state law, or largely of unwritten common law, although after *Dred Scott v. Sandford*, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393 (1857\\) blacks who were former slaves or whose ancestors had been slaves could not be made citizens. \n\nThe common law of England had long held that anyone born in the domains of the king was a subject, and the US followed that rule generally, in most states without ever reducing it to a statute. But state legislatures had the power to change that rule if they chose to.\n\nIn March 1790, Congress passed \u201cAn act to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization,\u201d which established that children born to American men abroad or at sea were still considered \u201cnatural born citizens.\u201d It also provided rules and procedures for those who immigrated to become citizens, providing:\n\n> That any Alien being a free white person, who shall have resided within . . . the United States for the term of two years, may be admitted to become a citizen.\u201d\n\nSuch would\\-be citizens had also to prove possession of \u201cgood character\u201d and swear an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. The details were changed from time to time, but the general nature of the requirements remained unchanged all through the 18th and 19th centuries. \n\nIn the 1844 New York case *Lynch v. Clarke*, a court held that a daughter born in New York state to Irish parents was considered a U.S. citizen, even though her parents returned to Ireland. \n\n> \\[B]y the law of the United States, every person born within the dominions and allegiance of the United States, whatever were the situation of his parents, is a natural born citizen. . . . The term citizen, was used in the constitution as a word, the meaning of which was already established and well understood. The only standard which then existed . . . was the rule of the common law, and no different standard has been adopted since.\n\nSo that rule (*jus soli*) was not in practice changed much by the 14th, but it was made explicit and unchangeable except by later amendment.

It also did not replace the naturalization system (D is incorrect), as Congress retained the power to set naturalization rules.\n\nThe correct answer is C because the 14th Amendment constitutionalized the existing common law practice of birthright citizenship (jus soli) that was already followed in most states. It made this principle explicit and applicable throughout the United States, extending it to all persons born in the U.S., including former slaves and their descendants, regardless of race or ethnicity.

A specific recording or text could be subject to copyright protection, but that site isn't obviously doing that. An analogous case arose in Paramount, CBS v. Axanar, where Paramount attempted to claim copyright ownership of the Klingon language (Paramount apparently saw the wisdom of the counterargument, which is why I use the past tense). A legal brief is [here](https://popehat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/035-1-Brief-of-Amicus-Curiae.pdf), explaining why that premise is \"meq Hutlh\".\n\nIn the case of Droidspeak, it is unclear what the basis of the \"translator\" is. Klingon stems from published grammar and dictionary (plus typeface) created as a work for hire, so there are limits to how much of the grammar and dictionary you can copy. We might assume that Droidspeak was similarly specified, and that this website implements the specification: anyone can then generate Droidspeak utterances, if they have the technical know\\-how. In that case, there is no copyright protection. Or we might assume that the sound derives from actual copying from the movies \u2013 that would be copyright infringement. (That is, original sounds are edited out as \"letters\" and automatically recombined by the program). A third possibility is that the squawks just resemble the movie squawks (and would not be infringing). So the answer depends on what the translator actually does.\n\nFrom the perspective of the person using the translator, the main concern would be whether a particular use is consistent with the terms of service. In this case, there are no terms, so you may do whatever you want with their tool (as long as you can legally do the thing without the website).

For example, a wifi\\-capable router can be sold even if it is \"open\" by default. A Bluetooth device has a shorter range than wifi, but in principle can connect to any other device. An owner's legal liability is not different given wifi vs. Bluetooth.\n\nWhether or not there is criminal liability for a third person who connects to the device also does not specifically depend on whether the device uses Bluetooth technology, as opposed to some other technology. [18 USC 1030](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030) is the general federal law prohibiting \"unauthorized access\". In the case of a bed, two legal question arise: is it a [\"computer\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-599163109-692694671&term_occur=999&term_src=), and is it [\"protected\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=18-USC-695191731-692694672&term_occur=999&term_src=title:18:part:I:chapter:47:section:1030)? It is an electronic high speed data processing device which performs logical, arithmetic, storage and communications facilities, i.e. it is a computer (in the legal sense). It *probably* is not protected, because it is not \"used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication\", that is, it is not connected to the internet (unless it is). State laws tend to be broader, not having the \"interstate commerce\" limitation, so accessing the bed would violate [Washington's](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.90&full=true) analog of the federal law. However, under Washington law, the access is probably not \"without authorization\". That term is defined as\n\n> knowingly circumvent technological access barriers to a data system in\n> order to obtain information without the express or implied permission\n> of the owner, where such technological access measures are\n> specifically designed to exclude or prevent unauthorized individuals\n> from obtaining such information, but does not include white hat\n> security research or circumventing a technological measure that does\n> not effectively control access to a computer.

Since the term \"may include ... allowing a remote person without any privileges to run code\", and since playing music on speakers involves running code, then the remote user may be criminally liable. On the third hand, the language of that paragraph (\"technological access measures are specifically designed to exclude or prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining such information, but does not include ... circumventing a technological measure that does not effectively control access to a computer\") clearly indicates a legislative intent to address deliberately overcoming active access barriers and not accidentally connecting to an unprotected, open system.

See for example Genesis 14:22, or Exodus 6:8\\. Some other times when hands are lifted up in the Bible, it's an expression of power. These concepts are linked in that an oath involves appealing to divine power to witness what is promised (and to punish the speaker if they break it).\n\nThe story that it comes from forcing witnesses or the accused to display brands is false. While branding was used historically to mark certain criminals, these marks were not often on the palm of the hand, but could be on the cheeks or chest or elsewhere. Courts have never asked witnesses to remove their shirts while taking an oath. Even in the era when branding was used, checking for the marks would not be applied to all witnesses, but perhaps just to the accused.\n\nIn contemporary practice, raising the hand is optional, and the oath or affirmation is taken as \"good\" if the court is satisfied that the witness is taking it seriously. Raising the hand might be seen as a gesture of respect for the law and not necessarily any particular religious tradition.

The practice of raising one's right hand before making an oath or affirmation in court originates from Biblical precedent and expressions of divine power. This is evidenced by references in the Bible, such as Genesis 14:22 and Exodus 6:8, where raising hands is associated with making oaths and invoking divine witness.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of this being an ancient Roman tradition to show that a witness is unarmed.\n\nOption C is a common misconception. While branding was historically used to mark criminals, it wasn't specifically related to oath-taking in court, and brands were not always on the palm of the hand.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while Quakers did influence the use of affirmations as an alternative to oaths, they didn't originate the practice of raising the right hand.

Keep your drone within your visual line of sight, or within the visual line\\-of\\-sight of a visual observer who is co\\-located (physically next to) and in direct communication with you.\n6. Do not fly at night unless your drone has lighting that allows you to know its location and orientation at all times.\n7. Give way to and do not interfere with manned aircraft.\n8. Never fly over any person or moving vehicle.\n9. Never interfere with emergency response activities such as disaster relief, any type of accident response, law enforcement activities, firefighting, or hurricane recovery efforts.\n10.

The [most recent proposed update of the law](http://pmg-assets.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/NA_bills2017_bill06B-2017.pdf), slightly clarifies that issue saying (Chapter II)\n\n> (3\\) For purposes of subsection (2\\),\"unauthorised\" means that the\n>  person\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) is not himself or herself lawfully entitled to secure access;\n> \n> \n> (b) does not have the lawful consent of another person who is lawfully\n>  entitled to secure access; or\n> \n> \n> (c) exceeds his or her entitlement or consent, to secure access, to\n>  data, a computer program, a computer data storage medium or a computer\n>  system.\n\nStill, this does not clarify whether account\\-sharing constitutes limited permission to access the data.

While the woman had permission to access the account, it's unclear if this extends to prolonged monitoring via WhatsApp Web without the husband's knowledge. The proposed update to the law attempts to clarify unauthorized access, but still doesn't explicitly address account-sharing scenarios. This ambiguity makes it difficult to determine if her actions would be considered criminal. Additionally, while the evidence might be admissible in civil proceedings like divorce, its use in criminal cases is less certain.
