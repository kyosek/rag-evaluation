While I'm aware it's a routine proceeding for county judges, the judge's grant of my petition means a lot to me personally, and I would like to send a gift of flowers and a card as a token of my gratitude. Of course, I know there are restrictions regarding gifts to judges, designed to address impropriety and influence (or appearance thereof).\n\nI came across [the ABA's Model Code of Judicial Conduct: Canon 3](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_code_of_judicial_conduct/model_code_of_judicial_conduct_canon_3/rule3_13acceptanceandreportingofgift/) and the [Guide to Jucidiary Policy](https://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/vol02c-ch06.pdf); both seem to have exclusions, notably\n\n> \u201cGift\u201d means any gratuity, favor, discount, entertainment, hospitality, loan, forbearance, \n>  or other similar item having monetary value but does not include: \n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> * greeting cards and items with little intrinsic value, such as plaques, certificates, and trophies, which are intended solely for presentation\n\nFurthermore, the Guide to Judiciary Policy also outlines (emphasis mine) that\n\n> A judicial officer or employee who has received a gift that cannot be accepted under these regulations should return any tangible item to the donor, except that a perishable item may be given to an appropriate charity, *shared within the recipient's office*, or destroyed.\n\n### My questions are thus:\n\n1. Would a bouquet of flowers constitute an item with \"little intrinsic value\" and or that is \"intended solely for presentation\"?\n2. If the answer to 1 is not a clear\\-cut and unconditional \"yes\", could I instead address the gift to the judge's *office*?\n\nSuch a bouquet would likely cost around $100, but mitigating factors (as I see them) include the facts that:\n\n1. Flowers are pretty much intended for presentation; according to two examples from the [Cornell Legal Information Institute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/5/2635.203), even though some items might have a \"market value\" that could trigger restrictions, since they are primarily intended for presentation, they are acceptable, and\n2. The gift is being given after the judge's grant, rather than prior to it; I don't expect to be conducting any further business with my county court in the foreseeable future, and these restrictions are specifically applied to gifts from\n\n> \\[...] anyone who is seeking official action from or doing business with the court or other entity served by the judicial officer or employee, or from any other person whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the judicial officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s official duties.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a somewhat tricky one. judges tend to be particularly sensitive to possibly improper gifts, so it is best to err on the side of caution\u2014the low\\-value side. I would think a very pleasant floral gift could be obtained and delivered for much less than $100\\. \n\nIt may well be that a simple card or letter, in which you write a note explaining how much the judge's action meant to you, would actually mean more to the judge than any amount of flowers. Since you don't know the judge personally, after all, you have no idea of his or her taste in flowers. Some people even have allergies. Or you might ask one of the clerks at the court what would be appropriate. \n\nIf your case or issue was still pending before the court, or you expected to appear again soon, such a gift would be a bad idea, in my view, although probably not actually illegal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Judge Smith recently ruled in favor of Sarah in a routine county court proceeding.

At the federal level, a law known as ESIGN provides that electronic signatures are valid, and preempts state laws unless the state has adopted UETA or has its own electronic signature law compatible with ESIGN. \n\nOne requirement of UETA is that both parties have to agree to use electronic signatures. It can't be forced on a party. If you send me a contract electronically and I electronically sign it, the question is whether I meant \"I agree to be bound\" or something else (like \"I read it, this looks fine, send over a paper copy to sign\"). By putting in the agreement \"I agree to use an e\\-signature,\" it's hard to argue that you didn't mean to accept the contract. If you didn't mean to use your e\\-signature to accept, you shouldn't have put it on a contract saying \"an e\\-signature is accepting the contract.\"\n\nHowever, you don't necessarily need to put that in the contract for the e\\-signature to be valid.

These laws require that both parties agree to use electronic signatures, but this agreement doesn't necessarily need to be explicit in the contract. Courts can examine the parties' intent and all relevant evidence to determine if there was an agreement to use electronic signatures.\n\nOption A is incorrect because electronic signatures are not automatically valid in all cases; there must be an agreement between parties to use them.\n\nOption B is overly restrictive.

One of the regulars in this crowd is \"Ursula.\" Ursula has made occasional advances that were gently rebuked by me.\n\nOne night, Ursula says that I'm too drunk to drive, Can she drive me home? She does, invites herself in and I don't resist the obligatory come\\-on. Sure enough, she ends up pregnant, tells me that this was intentional, that she *wanted a child and did not expect anything from me.* She does not want child support and does not want me to be a part of the child's life. Frustrated, embarrassed, I eventually move away (a year later).\n\n16 years later, I've been living my life. Married, divorced, and finally in a good job, making more money than I ever had in my life, before or since. One day\u2014***Poof!*** I get a summons to a court from the next county over (In Arizona now) regarding child support. It actually took me a while to understand that this was Ursula from 16 years ago, who now happened to live in the state that I was currently in. I go to court and the judge orders child support including the maximum 2 years retroactive.  \n\nFine.\n\nSince that time, my pay has been garnished (approx. 40% of takehome pay) for every job I have had. I've had to change jobs relatively often (troubled industry), and am out of work at times, but pay when I have a paycheck with which to do so. No choice for me even if I *were* to resist (which I don't).\n\nCurrently I live in Florida and am out of work.

If you are unable to pay, this is a legal defense to contempt of court and you should not be incarcerated (but you may be anyway if you don't raise this defense or fail to prove it to the satisfaction of the court). You have an affirmative duty to make child support payments even if you aren't currently being garnished.\n\nThe court could also reduce the arrears to a money judgement, if this hasn't already done so, and place liens on your real property and authorize seizure of your personal property to pay the debts.\n\nThe court could also order you to disclose the location of all of your assets and income under oath.\n\nEventually unpaid child support can also cause you to lose professional and occupational licenses and seizures of tax refunds.\n\n> What can I expect when I go to the hearing?\n\nThere isn't enough information in this post to be very clear exactly which stage of the proceedings you are in.

No US copyright infringement suit can be brought until the copyright has been registered. The registration process includes a formal declaration as to who the author is (or authors are). (I believe this statement is made under penalty of perjury.) Once the registration issues, the certificate of registration is admissible evidence of the facts stated in it in a us court. Indeed [17 USC 410 (c)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html#410) provides that:\n\n> (c) In any judicial proceedings the certificate of a registration made before or within five years after first publication of the work shall constitute *prima facie* evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate. The evidentiary weight to be accorded the certificate of a registration made thereafter shall be within the discretion of the court.\n\nIn other countries, the testimony of the plaintiff in a copyright infringement suit is itself evidence that the work was created as stated.\n\nIn either case, it is possible for the defendant to challenge the assertion and claim that s/he is the actual author. Showing when and where the work was first published can usefully corroborate the plaintiff's testimony. Having included a copyright notice in the initial publication may be of value, but if the notice only lists the pen name, it is not of much value. Records of the platform on which a work has been published may help in verifying the identity of the author. So may the testimony of others who saw or read the work, or who were told about it by the author. An author's own copies may be of value, if they carry a timestamp, as computer files generally do. But computer timestamps are not usually secure. Timestamps on email generally are reasonably secure, and could establish that the content existed and had been transmitted on a specified date by a specified person.\n\nBut none of this will matter unless the defendant claims that the plaintiff is lying in claiming authorship. Unless that happens, the plaintiff's testimony will usually settle the matter.\n\nA person whose work seems to have been infringed would usually be wise to consult a lawyer with experience in copyright suits.

The action itself is not considered a crime in country A (i.e. not enshired by any law), however, in country B it is. The reputational damage is what would derive from it, and that is a crime in both country A and B, however, the company of country B has no presence in country A.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So one such breech of law in this situation would be a defamation suit (a civil rather than criminal matter) which, especially in Common Law nations, are usually heard in the court of the plaintiff's jurisdiction as the most severe damage to reputation would be local. However, as this is not a crime (usually, there are some rarely used defamation crime statutes in the U.S. at least) the actual defendant may not need to actually sit in court during the trial and making appearances through lawyers only is not an indicator of guilt.\n\nIn defimation specific cases, the U.S. will refuse to enforce any payment to a victorious plaintiff unless the defamation case could be upheld in U.S. law (the U.S. has some rather high burdens of proof in defimation that other nations (including Canada and England, which are very close in legal system's structures) and as such, a ruling of guilt in an English court might be innocence in the U.S. This would only go to enforcing orders on relief as it pertains to the U.S. and corporations in the U.S. (if the guilty defendant has all his money American Banks, then the U.S. won't compel the banks to hand over assests from his accounts... However, they can't do anything about English courts seizing that man's Scottish real estate to sell for the damages.\n\nWith respect to criminal matters, it largely depends on the nature of the extradition treaty between Nations A and B. Typically, where those treaties exist, Nation A will only extradite the accused for crimes that Nation A and B both agree are crimes and both agree that similar punishments will be given if convicted. Additionally, they typically agree to only try the accused for crimes Nation A is extraditing the accused for. The punishment angle can be overcome during the negotiating between nations (One common example is that the U.S. and Canada do have an extradition treaty, Canada will refuse to extradite someone for a capital offense because they abolished the death penalty. However, because Canada has an interest in not being a haven for U.S. murders, they will often compromise with the prosecutor in charge of the case and extradite with the promise that the prosecutor will not seek death penalty. Just to show it isn't just the U.S. on the losing side, there was an actual case where a U.S. citizen was arrested in Italy for murder, was tried and aquitted. Upon her release, she returned to the U.S. only for Italian officials to learn of another witness and begin petitioning for a second trial. The U.S. refused to extradite, citing the constitutional protection against double jeopardy i.e. a second trial on the same event).\n\nOther nations, like Germany and Russia, have laws that bar the country from extraditing citizens. These protections aren't granted to resident aliens or tourists, visa holders, or illegal immigrants, so any treaties with them may have the other nation stipulate the same restriction despite it not being a law in that nation.\n\nShould Nations A and B not have extradition treaty, Nation B can ask really really politely, but at the end of the day, Nation A isn't bound to honor the request... but they aren't bound to refuse it either. Some nations might honor the request to curry favor with Nation B... while others might refuse because of a host of matters. Often nations without extradition treaties aren't the friendliest to each other, so they could refuse out of spite... but will play their refusal on a moral ground.\n\nIf in the above situation, the accused leaves Nation A for Nation C, Nation B can request C to affect the extradition (They might invoke if they have an extradition treaty with C).

The DA no doubt legally researched this issue exhaustively before presenting the charges to the grand jury and has made out a prima facie case for a felony under the applicable New York State law.\n\n> If Trump is brought to trial, then would it be possible for a jury to\n> return a verdict that Trump was guilty of the misdemeanor offenses of\n> falsifying business records but innocent of doing so with an intent to\n> commit another crime?

The body of law involved in how this decision is handled on a case by case basis is quite involved.\n\nMost of the case law involves homicide cases, assault cases, and property crime cases where there are charges with are identical except for aggravating factors for the most serious charges. But, lesser charges generally aren't presented if based upon the evidence presented at trial, either the more serious charge is established or no charge is proven.\n\nFor example, if the defendant presents an alibi defense, and a witness whose credibility is disputed places the defendant at the scene intentionally committing a crime, a lesser included offense charge would not be appropriate.\n\nBut, if the defendant admits hitting a pedestrian and causing the pedestrian's death, but claims that the pedestrian was at fault in the accident for jay walking, while the prosecution alleges that the pedestrian was intentionally struck as part of a mafia hit, multiple lesser included offenses would probably be charged involving different levels of intent of premeditated intent/aggravated circumstances killing (first degree murder), to a knowing killing (second degree murder), to a reckless killing (manslaughter), to a criminally negligent homicide or vehicular homicide charge.\n\nTypically, the decision on this point would not be made until all evidence was received and the judge in a hearing away from the jury but in the presence of the prosecutors and defense counsel crafted jury instructions based upon the evidence presented at trial and the arguments raised by counsel at trial.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the case of DA Bragg's indictment of former President Trump for falsifying business records, what is the most accurate statement regarding the potential outcomes of the trial?\n\nA) If Judge Mercan dismisses the felony charges, all charges against Trump must be dropped, including misdemeanors.\n\nB) The jury has the option to find Trump guilty of misdemeanor charges even if they find him not guilty of the felony charges, regardless of how the prosecutor presents the case.\n\nC) Judge Mercan will decide whether federal laws can be considered as \"other crimes\" for elevating the charges to felonies, and this decision cannot be appealed.\n\nD) The inclusion of lesser charges (misdemeanors) in the jury instructions depends on factors including the prosecution's willingness, the judge's decision, and the evidence presented at trial.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the complexity of including lesser charges in jury instructions. As stated in the original answer, whether a jury is presented with a lesser included offense charge depends on the prosecution's election to make that option available, the judge's decision, and the evidence presented at trial. The decision is typically made after all evidence is received and involves crafting jury instructions based on the evidence and arguments presented. Options A, B, and C are incorrect or oversimplified. A is wrong because the judge could potentially dismiss felony charges while allowing misdemeanor charges to proceed. B is incorrect because the jury's options depend on how the case is presented and instructed. C is partially correct about the judge's role but oversimplifies the process and incorrectly states that the decision cannot be appealed."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9674/is-it-legal-to-earn-money-via-selling-online-currency-videogame", "docs_id": 9674, "title": "Is it legal to earn money via selling online currency (videogame)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: (Europe/Netherlands)\n\nLet's say I'm a World of Warcraft or Runescape player, in these games there are certain prices for gold, for example a X amount of ingame Runescape money might be worth a Y amount of real money.

It's just I am new to studying law and want to get the vocabulary right. I am mostly a science and math orientated person and I am not good at English language / English litrature, which may be part of the reason I struggle with vocabulary.\n\nIs the word \"enact\" only used for laws passed by Parliament i.e. an Act of Parliament?\nCan you use the word enact for delegated legislation?\n\nAnd are consolidating statutes Acts of Parliament or Acts of Parliament and delegated legislation? I was thinking they may be delegated legislation as sometimes consolidating statutes are just amendments, corrections and minor improvements, which is what statutory instruments often are. It does not seem logical that you should go through the long rigorous law passing procedure of passing multiple readings in the House of Commons and the House of Lords just for amendments, corrections and minor improvements.\n\nAlso I have no professor to ask and the internet is not clear. I cannot seem to find the words *enact* and *delegated legislation* in the same sentence on the net.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **What Does Enact Mean?**\n\n\"Enact\" means that a legislative body has finally passed a proposed law (a.k.a. a \"bill\") or proposed ordinance in a legislative capacity, causing it to become a law (a.k.a. an \"act\") or ordinance, rather than merely a proposal to pass a law or ordinance.\n\nYour local council could enact an ordinance that was proposed to it to raise your rubbish collection fees, or parliament could enact a bill to reinstate the death penalty, or parliament could enact a bill to make an existing law gender neutral in its terminology.\n\nIn the U.S. when a regulation is brought into force to provide an executive branch department's interpretation or specification of something delegated to it in legislature an enactment, it would be customary to say that the regulation is \"adopted\" or \"made\" or \"ordered\" rather than \"enacted\".\n\nBut no one would be confused if you said that it was \"enacted\", in context, and British usage on this fine point might be different or evolving. The fact that your searches don't find \"enacted\" and \"delegated legislation\" in the same sentence, however, suggests that British usage hasn't evolved that far.\n\n**Minor Legislation**\n\n> It does not seem logical that you should go thought the long righorous\n> law passing proceedure of passing multiple reading in the House of\n> commons and the house of lords, for just amendments, corrections and\n> minor improvements.\n\nLogical or not, this is generally what is done. Indeed, the House of Lords largely justifies its existence by finding minor flaws in legislation passed by the House of Commons and sending it back to the House of Commons with amendments, corrections, and minor improvements to pass again.\n\nBut it usually isn't hard to get political support for these kinds of housekeeping amendments and nobody talks about them during Question Time, or makes long floor speeches about them in other floor debates.\n\nThe \"Bill To Correct Typos and Grammatical Errors In The Tax Revision Bill of 2020\" is offered up for consideration on the merits when its turn comes up, and in the absence of objection, it is adopted by unanimous consent, and boom, the Tax Revision Bill of 2020 isn't ugly and doesn't look like it was written by someone who skipped primary school anymore. This makes everybody in parliament look better.\n\nThe logic of this is an \"equal dignities\" idea. It should be as hard to change something enacted by parliament as it was to enact it in the first place. Unilateral executive branch officials shouldn't be able to override a decision voted upon by the entire House of Commons and the House of Lords by himself or herself.\n\n**Delegated Legislation Distinguished**\n\n[Delegated legislation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegated_legislation_in_the_United_Kingdom) is (mostly, at least) what we in the U.S. would call regulatory authority.\n\nDelegated legislation is not delegated because it is unimportant. It is delegated because MPs lack the capacity to articulate what it should say as well as executive branch officials.\n\nA typical example would be in the environmental protection area. MPs know that pollution that is dangerous to people is bad, but they delegate the authority to the agency to decide what that translates to in terms of parts per billion kilojoules of energy produced of lead or particulate matter or CO2\\. These amounts are determined by agency scientists helping the minsters and their underlings in the agency determine the right amount based upon lengthy reports that most MPs wouldn't understand because they did PolySci instead of chemistry in college.\n\nA radically different example that gets across the same idea would be that the parliament might delegate to the Defense Minister responsibility for establishing terms of engagement for British soldiers stationed in Afghanistan (i.e. rules for when they're allowed to shoot people), because the Minster's up to date knowledge of the situation and familiarity with military protocols, further informed by advice from the Ministry's generals and admirals, would allow the Minister to provide a rule that is more appropriate to the situation, that is more understandable from a soldier's perspective, than the House of Commons made up mostly of people who haven't served in the military and aren't familiar with what is going on in Afghanistan lately, would.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the term \"enact\" and legislation in the UK is most accurate?\n\nA) The term \"enact\" can be used interchangeably for both Acts of Parliament and delegated legislation.\n\nB) \"Enact\" is exclusively used for Acts of Parliament, while delegated legislation is typically said to be \"adopted\" or \"made\".\n\nC) Consolidating statutes are always considered delegated legislation and are not enacted by Parliament.\n\nD) Minor amendments and corrections to laws do not need to go through the full parliamentary process and are automatically enacted.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The documentation indicates that \"enact\" is primarily used for laws passed by Parliament (Acts of Parliament). For delegated legislation, terms like \"adopted,\" \"made,\" or \"ordered\" are more commonly used. While it wouldn't necessarily cause confusion to use \"enact\" for delegated legislation, it's not the typical usage. Consolidating statutes are still Acts of Parliament and go through the full legislative process, even for minor changes.

Unless those items are in the public domain, or are exempted via fair\\-use doctrine (see below).\n\n### Devices, Code, Expression...\n\nReverse engineering software is not by itself copyright infringement, though there are some cases relating to \"look and feel\" that might apply to certain features of software or a page but look \\& feel case law seems to get weaker every year. In general software is a \"device/process\" which is more likely to be covered by a patent, not copyright. \n\nCertainly the *specific code* for software *as written* falls under copyright protection. That is, a specific app as purchased, not your \"version\" of it if you wrote it from scratch.\n\nFor a website, copyright applies to the expressive *content*, and likely applies to *some* of the the *actual* code as written for a page (such as a CSS style sheet, and perhaps some specific HTML, classes, scripts). But there is a lot of \"common\" code that is the same for many sites, and is not expressive nor unique, and thus is not protected by copyright.\n\n### f\u2122\n\nThe Facebook logo is covered by *trademark*, not copyright. Trademark is for items used in commerce, just as a logo or slogan. The rules regarding trademarks are a little different than copyright. For instance you can not copyright a title or a name, but you can use trademark protection if it is used in commerce. \n\nFor instance, the title \"STAR WARS\u00ae\" is protected by trademark, not copyright.\n\n### Unique or Eunuch\n\nThe overall design of a facebook page is not particularly unique \u2014 compare the functional elements to the page here at StackExchange. Top sticky bar, left column, right column, center content... That kind of common general layout is not subject to copyright protection. \n\nFB can't say, for instance, that they have the exclusive right to make their sticky bar 43px high and \\#4267B2\\. However, the color can be part of their trademark which features other design elements that make it unique. \n\nSo, **except for the images you pirated**, you could build a page that looks the same using all your own code without infringing copyright, but if you copy a \"functional element\" that is covered by a patent, that might infringe a patent claim. \n\nAlso if you *copy and paste code*, that could be an infringement, just as if you download and use images and sprite sheets will typically be infringement (unless they are PD or under fair use).\n\nFair Use Sets You Free\n======================\n\n**Nevertheless, for your intended purpose of instruction/demonstration, you are pretty much falling under the umbrella of fair\\-use.** And provided you don't actually distribute the images you downloaded, fair use should allow them to be used for example/demonstration for educational reasons.\n\nNevertheless, instead of using the facebook LOGOs, I suggest using parodies of them (you know, like **FACEBLOK** or **FARCEBOOK** or **FA$ETOOK**.)\n\nHere is an analogy using a science fiction story:\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nA young man is on a desert planet, and finds himself battling a galactic evil empire.

I live in the United States in South Carolina.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first passage quoted appears to be from the **North** Carolina General Statutes [section 14\\-269\\.2](https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/north-carolina/nc-laws/north_carolina_laws_14-269-2) (Weapons on campus or other educational property) The roughly corresponding section of **South** Carolina law is [SECTION 23\\-31\\-215](https://www.scstatehouse.gov/code/t23c031.php#23-31-210) (Issuance of permits.) subsection (M) (5\\). It is quite different in both wording and content.\n\nI do not find the second quoted passage in an online search, and I presume it is of the school's own writing.\n\nIf you were in elementary school \"about 10 years ago\" it would seem that you are probably in high school or college now. Rules for those institutions are often quite different from elementary school and from each other.\n\nI have no way to evaluate what the school regulations on such subjects might be, but it is probably safer to leave your empty casing at home, although no rule you have quoted or that I can find online would prohibit it.\n\nAn expended cartridge or casing is not a \"gun, rifle, pistol, or other firearm of any kind\" and so this provision of NC 14\\-269\\.2 would not apply, even in North Carolina.\n\nAn expended cartridge is not likely to be defined as a \"weapon\" either, and so the second quotes passage should not apply, although it is possible that the school regulations define \"weapon\" differently so that an expended cartridge is included.\n\nI have no way to know what other provisions the school regulations might include that would be relevant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A high school student in South Carolina receives a spent 30-08 Springfield casing as a gift from a friend who is a hunter.

See Washington Ethical Society v. District of Columbia, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 249 F.2d 127; Fellowship of Humanity v. County of Alameda, 153 Cal.App.2d 673, 315 P.2d 394; II Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences 293; 4 Encyclopaedia Britannica (1957 ed.) 325\\-327; 21 id. at 797; Archer, Faiths Men Live By (2d ed. revised by Purinton), 120\\-138, 254\\-313; 1961 World Almanac 695, 712; Year Book of American Churches for 1961, at 29, 47\\.\n\nThis was a case where a man was appointed to the office of Notery Public, but Maryland law required him to declare a belief in God to assume the office. The US Supreme court held that this violated the man's rights under the First Amendment's establishment clause, which had been incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth. The man was not, as far as I can tell, himself a Secular Humanist, and Secular Humanism was mentioned in the footnote merely as an example of a belief system that did not include a belief in God. Why Justice Black used the term \"religion\" to refer to it, I cannot say, some of the other groups listed in the footnote are clearly religions, and others are belief systems that for First Amendment purposes are often treated similarly to religions. \n\nWhat might better describe the Court's rulings here than the linked site does is that believers in Secular Humanism, Ethical Culture, and other similar belief systems will have their beliefs protected in just the same way that believers in any religion will. Freedom of Religion includes the right not to have a religion.\nBy the way, the passage from *Everson v. Board of Education*, 330 US 1 which is quoted in *Torcaso v. Watkins* and to which the linked web site probably refers is:\n\n> The 'establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment means at least this: neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or nonattendance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups, and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect 'a wall of separation between church and State.'\n\nBy the way, any site which proclaims that [Hugo Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Black) was a \"Marxist agent\" has lost much credibility in my opinion.

If a simple majority in the legislature decides they want to pass a law which violates the constitution, they could certainly do that if they really wanted to, but will quickly find that they have wasted their time \\- as every court case stemming from the new law will simply end in the relevant section of the constitution trumping the new law.\n\nHowever, in the Netherlands, judges do not practice judicial review (in fact, Article 120 of the Constitution expressly prohibits it). It is my understanding that, even in the event that a law unambiguously violates a constitutionally\\-protected right, the judge will have no choice but to apply the law anyway.\n\nNow \\- assuming that my understanding is correct \\- my question is this: leaving aside its symbolic value, what is even the point of the Dutch Constitution (at least those Articles that confer rights, rather than describing governmental functions)? Or more specifically, what is the point of placing safeguards upon the process of amending it above and beyond those placed on ordinary legislation?\n\nFor example, if I were to command a 52% majority coalition in the legislature and I would very much like to pass a certain law that happens to be blatantly unconstitutional \\- which seems like it is exactly the sort of situation that a constitution is supposed to protect against \\- in what way am I actually stopped? If all the members of my coalition just stick our fingers in our ears while the 48% complain about our bill's unconstitutionality, and we pass it anyway, won't the new law be enforced just as much as it would have if we'd jumped through all the hoops of amending the constitution?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Compliance with the Dutch Constitution is evaluated pre\\-enactment, rather than post\\-enactment as indicated below. \n\n> The Dutch Constitution prohibits the courts from reviewing the\n>  constitutionality of Acts of Parliament.

But, this behavioral claim is not a universal one, it is a function of particular sets of institutional and political cultures.\n\nThe legislative check also has more bite in the Netherlands because it is more of a \"deliberative democracy\" in terms of its political culture (i.e. decision\\-making relies more heavily on the substantive merits of legislation rather than ethic or partisan identity and seeks wide input) (the Netherlands ranks \\#9, the U.S. ranks \\#94\\).

You see the same thing in the U.K. parliament which historically was not subject to any form of judicial review.\n\nThe Council of State and its institutional norms, in particular, are a known quantity, because the [Dutch Council of State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_State_(Netherlands)) has operated continuously since 1531 CE making it one of the oldest continuously functioning state institutions in the world.\n\nLikewise, Dutch judges, when applying the laws and treaties currently in force, are independent, and are arguably less partisan than U.S. courts.

If a particular lie is perjury (thus a violation of law, which defines perjury differently in some different jurisdictions) when uttered to the government, then uttering that lie to an attorney who is an officer of a court of the same government is perjury. This would not be limited to attorneys acting for a government such as prosecutors or private attorneys general. It would not matter whether the lawyer is representing the person who thus lied, under consideration to provide representation, or neither. It probably would not matter whether the lie is being told in the jurisdiction where the lawyer is an officer of a court, the lawyer was admitted pro hac vice, i.e., for purposes limited to one case, the lawyer does not have an active practice, the lawyer only advises other lawyers and does not represent anyone (such as by performing legal research without a confidentiality privilege), the lawyer is retired (but not diisbarred), the lie involves fraud, or the lawyer tells anyone else the content of the statement that is a lie without the lawyer personally intending to lie (as in \"my client said . . .\"). It probably matters whether the person who is lying knew or should have known that the person to be lied to is an attorney admitted to practice somewhere, or at least is an attorney.\n\nI don't think it's possible to distinguish between lying to the government and lying to an individual who is part of that government, because there is no other way to lie to the government. Even if the lie were told in a letter addressed only to \"Government, State of . . ., \\[capital city, state, and Zip code]\" and a machine opened the letter, scanned it into a computer, and used artificial intelligence to parse it with the AI having been written as free open\\-source software by a nongovernment programmer, if a human being on behalf of the government acts on the letter (including by deciding not to act on it), the lie is to a human who programmed the parsing system and/or to a human who acted on the parsed letter.\n\nUnless there's a law specifically exempting the liar from liability (criminal and civil) when lying to a lawyer (and it would be interesting to theorize about the rationale for such a law), how is it not illegal (unlawful) to lie to a lawyer under the above circumstances?\n\nI have no case involving this possibility. I'm thinking of writing about this, and I've seen various discussions that it's not illegal except for fraud (fraud has at least one additional element that makes it harder to prove than perjury), but none of the discussions I saw cited a source in the law. On the other hand, while I don't follow developments in the law with a practicing lawyer's diligence, I haven't heard of, say, a case against a client for having lied to their lawyer (viz., \"I didn't go to the bank\" while confessing to the police about robbing it in person without recanting the confession), and I imagine a few lawyers would gladly sue people for perjury to them. On the other hand, and this is just my speculation, maybe most lawyers don't think there's much of a problem and that letting the courts decide would create more problems than it's worth.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **No**\n------\n\nA lawyer is considered an \"officer of the court\" in the sense that certain duties to the court are imposed on the lawyer. That does not give the lawyer authority as if the lawyer was part of the court staff, nor a law enforcement officer.\n\nA statement can be prosecuted as perjury only if it is made under oath (or affirmation) in court, or if it is made \"under penalty of perjury\". This is generally done by a statement in a document signed, something like \"I declare under penalty of perjury that all statements in the above document are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.\" It can also be done verbally, with the person making the statement agreeing that it is true and that this is subject to perjury prosecution if it is false. The exact wording will vary, but it must be clear and explicit.\n\nAside from that, false statements to a lawyer are not generally subject to prosecution for perjury, nor otherwise illegal.

I'm currently in the prototyping stage for a product based on that idea. That idea (the solution to the problem of improving that product in certain ways) is patentable according to all the stuff I read about patents. But patents are really expensive: My primary market would be western Europe (member states of the European Patent Convention) and possibly later the US, that would cost a 4\\-digit USD amount upfront and in total a 5\\-digit amount within a couple of years, as far as I can tell.\n\nSo I'm evaluating the possibility of just keeping my invention secret until I'm ready to sell a product based on it and then publishing the full details to make sure no one else can patent it.\n\nQuestion:\n---------\n\nBut when I'm selling such a product: Would competitors need to design a new product based on my idea, involving all the prototyping and too easy to patent but still not trivial problems \\- or would it be legal to take my product apart, put the parts in a 3D scanner and produce the exact same product?

If you publish your findings, anyone can use them.\n\nIt is possible to patent the specific design of your chassis. Design patents, which cover the specific aesthetic design of something, can be less expensive than utility patents, which cover functional aspects. Although your chassis is designed with functionality in mind, it will also embody an aesthetic design.\n\nThat said, enforcement of patent rights (or any other rights you might hope protect your chassis) is orders of magnitude more expensive (typically millions of dollars) than merely obtaining a patent.

Arbitrary nature of the name: \"Google\" is an arbitrary term in relation to search engines, giving it stronger protection than descriptive marks.\n4. Potential for confusion: The similarity of the names and the industry overlap create a significant risk of consumer confusion, which is a primary concern in trademark law.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they oversimplify trademark law, ignoring the nuances of similarity and potential confusion.

Criminal cases involve an action that is considered to\n>  be harmful to society as a whole.\n\nFollowed by\n\n> Individuals, corporations, and the federal government can also bring\n>  civil suits in federal court claiming violations of federal statutes\n>  or constitutional rights. For example, the federal government can sue\n>  a hospital for overbilling Medicare and Medicaid, a violation of a\n>  federal statute.\n\nThat seems strange to me, why wouldn't stealing from the government be considered a criminal case?\n\nI suppose the answer might be, that's just the way the statute is written. In which case, my question would be, why are some things that are wrong involving the government considered to be part of civil or criminal law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Civil litigation involves general causes of action that are available to anyone, including both private parties and the government. Civil courts are designed primarily to provide restitution to the injured party.\n\nCriminal courts exist for governments to exercise their police powers: specific, limited authority held only by the government. The principal purposes of criminal law are...well, they're debated, but broadly speaking, it's to punish and/or rehabilitate the criminal and deter future criminals.\n\nBecause criminal conviction can result in jail time and even the death penalty, there are more stringent procedural protections accorded to criminal defendants than there are to civil defendants. So when the government's goal is to recover damages, it's easier for them to use the less burdensoome civil procedures, just the same as anyone else would.\n\nLet me give you an example. Someone steals your identity and runs up $100,000 on your credit card.\n\nYou call the police, and they find someone they think is the guy. To convict him, the police must convince an entire jury panel that he did it, beyond a reasonable doubt\\-\\-a high standard. He pleads the fifth, and without his testimony, the police may not succeed. If they do, he will be sent to jail, and he may also be ordered to give part or all of your money back. If the case is weak, however, the police may not want to spend their limited time on it\\-\\-and that's their call, not yours. (This also applies to government agencies; only law enforcement can bring a criminal case, not any government agency.)\n\nHowever, you can also file a civil lawsuit. In that lawsuit, depending on the jurisdiction, you may only need to convince some of the jury\\-\\-civil verdicts don't always have to be unanimous. You may even just face a judge, with no jury. And the legal standard is a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" which in layman's terms just means \"more likely than not\"\\-\\-a much easier thing to prove. Because the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply to civil litigation, you may even be able to argue before the jury that the defendant's refusal to testify suggests he's guilty.\n\nIn summary: civil lawsuits use different rules and procedures, which may make it easier to recover money (or get other civil relief, such as an injunction) in cases where that's the goal. These courts are open to anyone, including the government. But if the government wants to use its special police powers to put someone in jail or get other criminal relief, they have to use the stricter criminal rules and procedures.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The federal government is considering legal action against a pharmaceutical company for allegedly overcharging Medicare by $500 million. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the government's options and the implications of pursuing each course of action?\n\nA) The government must pursue criminal charges, as fraud against Medicare is always a criminal offense.\n\nB) The government can only file a civil lawsuit, as cases involving financial disputes are exclusively civil matters.\n\nC) The government can choose either criminal or civil proceedings, but civil action would likely be easier to prove and could still result in financial recovery.\n\nD) The government must pursue both criminal and civil cases simultaneously to ensure both punishment and financial recovery.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The government has the option to pursue either criminal or civil proceedings in this case, but a civil lawsuit would likely be easier to prove and could still result in financial recovery.\n\nCriminal proceedings would require proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, a higher standard of evidence. They would also involve more stringent procedural protections for the defendant. While criminal charges could result in punitive measures like fines or imprisonment, they might be more difficult to prove successfully.\n\nCivil proceedings, on the other hand, typically require a lower standard of proof (preponderance of evidence) and may not require a unanimous jury decision. Civil courts are designed primarily to provide restitution, which aligns with the goal of recovering the overcharged funds. The government, like any other party, can use civil courts for this purpose.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not all fraudulent activities against the government must be pursued criminally. Answer B is wrong because the government does have the option to pursue criminal charges if it chooses.

That would be someone who follows someone around to looks after their legal safety like a conventional bodyguard looks after their physical safety?\n\nI suspect the people and cases where it would be worth the expense to never be cought without legal counsel would be few and far between, but I suspect they do exist.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There isn't a distinct word for this role in modern English, mostly because there aren't meaningful numbers of persons in this role.\n\nFor example, in the [TV series Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)), there are lawyers who act in such a role (accompanying a leading character on his yacht while on vacation, for example) and those people are simply called **lawyers** (a term that emphasizes their legal knowledge and expertise) or **attorneys** (a term that emphasizes their authority to take action on behalf of their clients as agents of their clients in legal matters).\n\nThe concept also has some similarity to the 17th and early 18th century role of a [**factor**](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/factor) (see definition number 2 at the link) before the legal profession became a regulated one, and the term attorney is an outgrowth of this sort of conception of the role.\n\n[Model Rule of Professional Conduct 2\\.1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_2_1_advisor/), the template for the ethical rules for lawyers in all U.S. jurisdictions, refers to a lawyer acting in that role as an **advisor** or **counselor**. A lawyer acting in such a role in U.S. practice is not limited to providing legal advice and can consider the client's needs more generally.\n\nMany organizations (for profit, non\\-profit, and governmental), however, have a **general counsel** or **corporate counsel** or **chief legal officer** or **county attorney** or **city attorney**, who works full time for the organization who is commonly described as [**in house counsel**](https://www.acc.com/sites/default/files/resources/vl/membersonly/InfoPAK/19654_2.pdf) and serves a similar role for the organization. Sometimes this is a full time position, sometimes, it is a part\\-time position.\n\nGoing back even further in history, this also has similarities to a [**courtier**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtier). @NateEldredge's reference to a **[consigliere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hagen)** in the modern sense of an advisor to an organized crime boss (who might be, but isn't necessarily, a lawyer) also isn't far off and traces back to the more legitimate feudal role of a particular sort of courtier. In modern politics, and less savory \"gray area\" activities corporate and criminal alike, a person who does something similar to this, who is sometimes, but not always, a lawyer, is sometimes also called a **[fixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixer_(person))**. @grovkin also suggests in a comment, the title of **handler** which heavily overlaps with the notion of a fixer.\n\nIn federal and state government, such a person would often be a **chief of staff** or a member of a President or Governor's \"kitchen cabinet\", although a **personal lawyer** in addition to the **Attorney General** and attorneys in the Office of Legal Counsel who also serve those roles exist formally as well.\n\nIn the military, sometimes a **staff officer** fills a role similar to this one, especially if that staff officer is a member of the Judge\\-Advocate General's (JAG) corps.\n\nA couple more points not precisely responsive to the question.\n\nFirst, in some science fiction works, including [Kate Elliot's \"The Novels of the Jaran\"](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B00GH2G8BA), the future equivalent of pretty much this precise role is called a **Protocol Officer**, effectively envisioning a merger of law, etiquette, and diplomacy in a more civilized world that is not balkanized and instead has only a single universal political system. (See also, e.g., C3PO, a Protocol Droid carrying out a similar role in the Star Wars saga.)\n\nI believe that similar roles (with job titles that have only Chinese or Japanese or Korean language terminology) were present in some of the heavily Confucian influenced monarchies of East Asia, in roles perhaps most analogous to military staff officers for feudal aristocrats and high officials.\n\nSecond, in most civil law countries (in contrast to common law legal system countries), there are lots of people who earn an undergraduate bachelor's level degree in law without seeking to enter a licensed or regulated profession to become a true practicing lawyer in the common law country sense. Instead, these individuals typically seek managerial professional positions in businesses in much the way that a business major with a specialization in marketing or finance or management might. So, unlike, common law countries, in most civil law countries that is a significant population of people with formal legal training who are not lawyers or paralegals in the common law country sense.\n\nI honestly have no idea what kind of job titles people on that career track typically hold, or just how they use their legal training in the course of their careers. It might be that someone like this would sometimes take on the role described in the question, but I don't know enough to know if that is really the case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In modern legal and professional contexts, which of the following terms most accurately describes a person who acts as a \"legal bodyguard,\" accompanying a client to provide constant legal advice and protection?\n\nA) Consigliere\nB) Protocol Officer\nC) Attorney or Lawyer\nD) Courtier\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C) Attorney or Lawyer.

So that pretty much covers the spectrum here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can be extradited from Country A to Country B even if you are a citizen of neither. What matters is whether B can convince A to do it, which is typically on the basis of a treaty between them as well as provisions of both country's domestic criminal law.\n\nIf you committed a crime in B, then fled to A, your nationality is relevant to the extent that:\n\n* A might not extradite its own citizens, if you are a citizen of A\n* A might have an agreement with C, if you are a citizen of C, that C should have the chance to proscute you instead of B. (This is the *Petruhhin* doctrine in the case where A and C are EU countries and B is not.)\n\nBut you do not have to be a national of B in order for it to have jurisdiction over you in B's domestic criminal law \\- just as if you were *still in B*, they could arrest you in the normal way. They are thus entitled to request A's authorities to arrest you in A, and transfer you to B.\n\nIf your alleged crime was *not* in B, then their claim over you has to be on the basis that their domestic criminal law allows prosecution extraterritorially. This was the case when B was Spain, A was the United Kingdom, and the criminal was former Chilean leader [Augusto Pinochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet); while his status as a former head of state was relevant, as was whether the crimes were extraterritorial offences in the UK as well, his lack of Spanish nationality was not. A more topical example is B being the United States, A the United Kingdom, and the arrestee being [Julian Assange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange), an Australian who is alleged to have committed various crimes under U.S. law (while not necessarily having been present in the U.S. at the time).\n\nWhile all extradition relationships are different, a common thread of the criminal law *in general* is that what matters is the circumstances at the time of the alleged acts. Retroactively making you a citizen of B may not be satisfactory to A, to the extent that A's criminal law disallows making anything illegal retroactively. The supposed nationality grant by B might trigger provision's of A's domestic extradition law concerning requirements of due process, lack of political interference, and so on, and block the action.\n\nBut equally, renouncing your citizenship of B does not extinguish B's claim over you for acts you did *while* you were a citizen of B.

Stat Ch. 83 Part I](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes./index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0000-0099/0083/0083.html). This is statutorily a tenancy at\\-will unless a contrary agreement is in writing signed by the lessor: the duration of the lease is yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly as determined by the periodicity of rent payments. There are various legal conditions related to rent default and causes for removing tenants, also conditions about premises that are wholly untenantable. Unlike residential leases, there are not any special statutory conditions surrounding the landlords presentation of leases.\n\nFlorida law contemplates and allows the possibility that there are no written documents, and for non\\-residential tenancies has very little to say about it (only pertaining to the distinction between at\\-will vs not at\\-will leases).\n\nTherefore, the matter follows the general rules for contractual disputes: whoever makes the best case for their claims wins. If Bob has a scanned copy, that is excellent proof. If Alice alleges and proves that the scanned copy was modified, that disposes of Bob's evidence. If Alice presents a copy of the contract that says otherwise (I do mean copy), then this anomaly has to be explained. Bob can claim that they tore up Alice's original and renegotiated the deal, but he needs to prove that claim. If Alice presents the original contract, Bob's story becomes much less plausible. There are millions of variants of what might happen: the point is, there is no requirement to present the original signed document to support a claim in a contractual dispute.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a non-residential lease dispute in Florida between landlord Bob and tenant Alice, where Bob cannot produce the original signed lease but has an unsigned copy stored in a cloud service, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The absence of a signed lease automatically invalidates Bob's claims and favors Alice's position.\n\nB) Florida law requires Bob to produce the original signed lease for it to be considered valid evidence in the dispute.\n\nC) The unsigned copy, along with other supporting evidence like financial records, can still be used to support Bob's case in the dispute.\n\nD) Non-residential leases in Florida are always considered at-will tenancies unless a signed written agreement states otherwise.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Florida, for non-residential tenancies, there is no strict requirement to present an original signed lease document in a contractual dispute. The law allows for the possibility that written documents may not exist. In this case, Bob's unsigned copy stored in a cloud service, combined with other evidence such as financial records and photographs, can still be used to support his case. The dispute will be resolved based on who makes the best case for their claims.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the absence of a signed lease does not automatically invalidate Bob's claims or favor Alice's position. \n\nAnswer B is false because Florida law does not specifically require the original signed lease for non-residential tenancies.\n\nAnswer D is partially true but not the most accurate answer to the question.

It was large text post talking about technology so it's very likely that DMCA notice was without any merit.\n\nI've interacted with support of said website and only recourse they are offering is for me to file counter\\-notice. I obviously don't want to get into that without first at least understand what copyright I'm supposedly infringing upon.\n\nSo, is it possible to request service provider to send me DMCA takedown notice? Isn't there some part of the law that requires them to serve me with notice after post is taken down? This way I don't even know what I would be disputing in counter\\-notice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first question is, would you have any basis for legal action against a service provider in case they arbitrarily delete your contributions: you might, or you might not (read the terms of service, ask your lawyer). Let's assume that there is a legal reason why the provider should leave your material alone. If you are infringing copyright, the provider *might* also get sued for contributing to the infringement, so there is a law DMCA: [17 USC 512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512)) that says when they are immune to such a suit. The first part of this is that a supposed copyright owner can file a take down notice with the provider, claiming that they are hosting infringing material. But under thatlaw, they must \"take\\[] reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to the material\". Presumably they did that and inform you about the counter\\-notice provision (although your wording is not clear on this: saying verbatim what they notified you of would be useful).\n\nThat counter\\-notice requires you to identify yourself, etc. and provide\n\n> A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good\n>  faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of\n>  mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or\n>  disabled.\n\nThere is no point in the law requiring the provider to reveal anything about the alleged rights\\-holder, just the fact that the material has been taken down. The law does allow the copyright owner to subpoena requesting information identifying the alleged infringer. There is no provision whereby an alleged infringer can subpoena information about the person filing the original notice. That is because the copyright owner has to file a lawsuit against the infringer (if the infringer files a counter\\-notice and the owner does not file lawsuit, the material must be restored). When you get sued, you will know at that point who is suing you.\n\nYou do not need to know who the rights holder is to file a counter\\-notice. The law says that you have to include\n\n> A statement under penalty of perjury that the subscriber has a good\n>  faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of\n>  mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or\n>  disabled.\n\nSuppose for example that you illegally copied and pasted the source code for Windows 10\\. You can't seriously believe that you have the right to post that material, so to avoid perjury charges, you would not make such a false statement. Suppose that you copied two lines of protected source code, as examples of some technical point \u2013 then that would be fair use and not infringement. In such a case, the initial take down notice might be found to be abusive and knowingly false. There could be an intermediate situation, where you post a book that you've written and as it happens there is a graphic contained therein which is beyond the scope of fair use \u2013 but you have no idea that this is what they are talking about (maybe you think the graphic is not protected). Then perhaps you can, in good faith, state that the claim \"this work infringes\" is mistaken. This is where you need to talk to a lawyer, to see if you can in good faith deny infringement.\n\nAs the law currently stands, there is little burden of proof on the person filing the take down notice, until the matter is argued in court.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), when a service provider receives a takedown notice and removes content, what is their obligation to the content creator?\n\nA) They must provide the content creator with the full details of the copyright holder who filed the notice\nB) They are required to take reasonable steps to promptly notify the content creator that the material has been removed or disabled\nC) They must wait for a court order before removing the content\nD) They have no obligation to inform the content creator of any action taken\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the DMCA (17 USC 512), when a service provider receives a takedown notice and removes content, they must \"take[] reasonable steps promptly to notify the subscriber that it has removed or disabled access to the material.\" They are not required to provide full details of the copyright holder, wait for a court order, or allowed to take no action without notification.

I would expect you could replace the whole bike for 370 euros.

This book is not banned in my country. I understand that if I go to his country to deliver it, I may get arrested, because I'm breaking the law of possessing the book. What happens if I just send the book by mail? Bob would break the law for possession of the banned book, but would I be doing something illegal? What are the possible consequences?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As a general rule, most countries have what's called Bi\\-Lateral extradition treaties, which means that Country A (Cedricstan) will only extradite to Country B (Bobtopia) for crimes that were committed in Bobtopia AND are crimes in Cedricstan.\n\nSo, in this scenario, you, a Cedricstan citizen purchase the book \"The Big Book of Banned Things in Bobtopia\" and send it to Bobtopian Bob by international mail. Bobtopian Ministry of Banned Stuff police (BMBS) find Bob in possession of the book and through creative interrogation (cause all countries that ban books are surprisingly creative in interrogation techniques) figure out that you sent it to him. The would file an extradition petition with the Cedricstan Embassy, who then call up the Cedricstan Ministry of Justice (CMJ) and discuss the charges (if there's no extradition treaty, the process is basically the embassy staffer politely taking the note and giving it to the Ambassador, who tries not to laugh too much as he dumps it to the bin. If there isn't even diplomatic relationships, this is the same process, but now it's the Swiss Ambassador laughing instead of a Cedricstan Ambassador).\n\nAnyway, assuming Cedricstan and Bobtopia have an extradition treaty with each other, it's going to be Bi\\-Lateral, meaning Cedricstan will only extradite you for crimes committed in Bobtopia that are also crimes in Cedricstan. So, first off, you did not possess the book while in Bobtopia, so the crime didn't happen in Bobtopia and they have jurisdiction over the crime. The legal ramifications are that of Cedricstan, not Bobtopia, so they apply here. Given you bought the book in Cedricstan, you're likely to not face any legal ramifications (well... more on this in a moment).\n\nSuppose then, we some how get to the point where you are proven to have been in Bobtopia and possessing the book of very naughty knowledge, Bobtopia Ed. In this case, Cedricstan would have to consider if it is a crime here (kinda... more on this as well). Since Cedricstan has Constitutionally protected Freedom of Speech and Press, there is no equivalent crime for possessing Forbidden Knowledge II: Bobtopia Boogaloo, which not only is legal to own, but a Cedricstan Times Best Seller for the 104th week running. So in this case, Cedricstan laughs in Free Speech and refuse to extradite you. There are again, no legal ramifications (well... more on this in a moment... which would be next paragraph).\n\nSo, of course, this assumes you're not going to go to any country ever in the future. Obviously, Bobtopia agents from the BMBS will happily greet you if you ever go to Bobtopia... creatively of course... But you should probably review the diplomatic relationships of other nations with Bobtopia and their laws on banned literature... it could be that their extradition treaties will allow an agent of the third nation to arrest you and extradite you to Bobtopia... if you realize this is about to happen, your best bet is to find a Cedricstan Embassy or Consulate and high tail it there. But otherwise there shoudln't be any issues.\n\nThe other problem here is that nations may have additional rules. For example, the United States does not allow for libel tourism... which is using another nation to sue an American for defamation that doesn't rise to the Defamation under U.S. Law (which is notoriously stricter than most similar nations. Historically, close relations between United States and UK would mean that defamation of a UK person said in the United States could be tried in the UK and the U.S. speaker would be under their jurisdiction... The ban here prevents that by saying the United States would not enforce decisions unless their own courts found the case in a similar way.\n\nOn the other end, Canada will not extradite murderers to the United States, if said Murderer is eligible for the Death Penalty... but a Prosecutor promising to not seek the Death Penalty in sentencing if guilt is found is good enough for Canada to extradite the murderer back.\n\nTL;DR: As long as you stay in your country, you should not be extradited for crimes that are not mutually recognized... be careful when you leave though.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A citizen of Country A sends a book that is banned in Country B to a friend living in Country B.

Curtilage is the part of your property that is so intimately connected with the home that it treated the same for 4th Amendment purposes. Per [United States v. Dunn](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/480/294/case.html) 480 U.S. 294 (1987\\), a fence doesn't mean everything inside the fence is curtilage (but for a small, city dwelling, the fence is probably going to be considered the curtilage boundary). Not having a fence doesn't mean nothing is curtilage.\n\nAs you say, even if you object to the warrantless inspection, they can probably do a lot of the inspection from outside your curtilage and avoid infringing your 4th Amendment rights.\n\nThe inspectors may choose to return with an inspection warrant. An example statute describing an inspection warrant is [California Code 1822\\.50](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CCP&sectionNum=1822.50):\n\n> An inspection warrant is an order, in writing, in the name of the people, signed by a judge of a court of record, directed to a state or local official, commanding him to conduct any inspection required or authorized by state or local law or regulation relating to building, fire, safety, plumbing, electrical, health, labor, or zoning.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A city government conducts routine housing inspections every 5 years.

According to the Camara v. Municipal Court case, the Fourth Amendment does apply to administrative inspections like housing code enforcement. The backyard would likely be considered part of the home's curtilage, which receives the same Fourth Amendment protections as the home itself. If the homeowner objects to a warrantless inspection, the inspector would need to obtain an inspection warrant to legally enter the backyard.

In some cases and some places such a person is free to be armed, in others this would be illegal.\n\nIf one is lawfully present somewhere and is attacked, one is entitled to defend oneself (or another), although there may be a duty to avoid a confrontation by retreating if this is reasonably possible when not in one's own home in some jurisdictions (such as California). But the use of deadly force (such as a gun) is generally not lawful unless there is an imminent threat of death or serious injury. None of this is legally different when one is lawfully on another's property than when one is in a public place.\n\nCalifornia Law\n--------------\n\nCalifornia Penal Code [section 693](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2020/code-pen/part-2/title-1/chapter-1/section-693/) provides that:\n\n> Resistance sufficient to prevent the offense may be made by the party about to be injured:\n> \n> \n> 1. To prevent an offense against his person, or his family, or some member thereof.\n> 2. To prevent an illegal attempt by force to take or injure property in his lawful possession.\n\nIt should be read together with sections 692 and 694\\.\n\n[Judicial Council of California Criminal Jury Instruction \\#505](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/505/) reads:\n\n> The defendant acted in lawful (self\\-defense/ \\[or] defense of another) if:\n> \n> \n> 1. The defendant reasonably believed that (he/she/ \\[or] someone else/\n> \\[or] ) was in imminent danger of being killed or suffering great bodily injury \\[or was in imminent danger of being (raped/maimed/robbed/ )];\n> 2. The defendant reasonably believed that the immediate use of deadly force was necessary to defend against that danger;  \n> \n> AND\n> 3. The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against that danger.\n> \n> \n> Belief in future harm is not sufficient, no matter how great or how likely the harm is believed to be. The defendant must have believed there was imminent danger of death or great bodily injury to (himself/herself/ \\[or] someone else). Defendant\u2019s belief must have been reasonable and (he/she) must have acted only because of that belief. The defendant is only entitled to use that amount of force that a reasonable person would\n> believe is necessary in the same situation.\n> \n> \n> If the defendant used more force than was reasonable, the \\[attempted] killing was not justified\n\nAccording to [\"California Self\\-Defense Laws\"](https://www.shouselaw.com/ca/defense/legal-defenses/self-defense/) (a page posted by a CA law firm:\n\n> California law allows use of force in self\\-defense or defense of others when you reasonably believe that you or they are in imminent danger of physical harm, and that force is necessary to stop the danger. However, you may only use the degree of force reasonably necessary under the circumstances.\n\nThe page [\"California Self Defense Laws\"](https://www.findlaw.com/state/california-law/california-self-defense-laws.html) from Findlaw reads:\n\n> The right to use force \\-\\- even deadly force if necessary \\-\\- to defend oneself is a broadly accepted principle of the criminal justice system. But while all states allow defendants to claim self defense if they can back up such claims, states differ on the scope of what may be considered appropriate use of force and when it may be applied. ... As a general rule of thumb, any force used against an intruder must be proportionate to the harm reasonably feared.\n\nIn [*People v. King* {Crim. No. 20380\\. Supreme Court of California. August 29, 1978\\.}](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/22/12.html) The California Supreme Court held that self\\-defense was a possible defense to a charge of possession of a handgun by a felon, and wrote about the right of self\\-defense in CA law. The opinion reads:\n\n> \\[I]t is apparent that the conviction cannot stand if the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding the right of self\\-defense as it related to the section 12021 charge. ...\n> \n> \n> When enacting section 12021 and its predecessor statute, the Legislature is presumed to have been aware of the several existing statutes giving any person the right to use force, including deadly force in appropriate circumstances, in defense of self or others. This right has been included in provisions of the Penal Code since its enactment in 1872\\. Section 692 provides:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Lawful resistance to the commission of a public offense may be made:\n> > \n> > \n> > 1. By the party about to be injured;\n> > 2. By other parties.\"\n> \n> \n> Section 693 provides:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Resistance sufficient to prevent the offense may be made by the party about to be injured:\n> > \n> > \n> > 1. To prevent an offense against his person, or his family, or some member thereof.\n> > 2. To prevent an illegal attempt by force to take or injure property in his lawful possession.\n> \n> \n> Section 694 extends the right to defend others, providing:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Any other person, in aid or defense of the person about to be injured, may make resistance sufficient to prevent the offense.\n> \n> \n> Although the extent of these rights has been defined and circumscribed by judicial decision (see, e.g., *People v. Ceballos*, supra, 12 Cal.3d 470\\) none of these sections has been amended to restrict the rights affirmed therein since its adoption over a century ago.\n> \n> \n> Civil Code section 50, affirms the same rights, providing:\n> \n> \n> \n> > Any necessary force may be used to protect from wrongful injury the person or property of oneself, or of a wife, husband, child, parent, or other relative, or member of one's family, or of a ward, servant, master, or guest.\n> > It, too, was adopted in 1872, and it was amended in 1874 to expand the right of defense first declared to encompass guests. Similarly the provisions of sections 197 and 198 governing the circumstances in which homicide is justifiable were included in the Penal Code of 1872, and are traceable to the Statutes of 1850\\.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Use of a concealable firearm in self\\-defense is neither a crime nor an unlawful purpose. ... We conclude, therefore, that the prohibition of section 12021 was not intended to affect a felon's right to use a concealable firearm in self\\-defense, but was intended only to prohibit members of the affected classes from arming themselves with concealable firearms or having such weapons in their custody or control in circumstances other than those in which the right to use deadly force in self\\-defense exists or reasonably appears to exist. Thus, when a member of one of the affected classes is in imminent peril of great bodily harm or reasonably believes himself or others to be in such danger, and without preconceived design on his part a firearm is made available to him, his temporary possession of that weapon for a period no longer than that in which the necessity or apparent necessity to use it in self\\-defense continues, does not violate section 12021\\. As in all cases in which deadly force is used or threatened in self\\-defense, however, the use of the firearm must be reasonable under the circumstances and may be resorted to only if no other alternative means of avoiding the danger are available. In the case of a felon defending himself alone, such alternatives may include retreat where other persons would not be required to do so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided California self-defense law information:\n\nQuestion: John, a convicted felon, is lawfully retrieving property from his ex-partner's home under a court order. His ex becomes aggressive and threatens him with a kitchen knife. John notices a handgun on a nearby shelf. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects California law regarding John's rights in this situation?\n\nA) John cannot touch the handgun under any circumstances due to his status as a felon, even if his life is in danger.\n\nB) John can use the handgun in self-defense, but only if he first attempts to retreat from the home, regardless of the level of danger.\n\nC) John can temporarily possess and use the handgun for self-defense if he reasonably believes he's in imminent danger of great bodily harm, but must relinquish it as soon as the immediate threat passes.\n\nD) John can take possession of the handgun for self-defense and keep it afterwards, as the court order allows him to be on the property legally.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the California Supreme Court case People v. King, a felon's right to self-defense can temporarily override the prohibition on firearm possession (Penal Code section 12021) in cases of imminent peril. John can use the handgun if he reasonably believes he's in imminent danger of great bodily harm and has no other means of avoiding the danger. However, this temporary possession is allowed only for the duration of the immediate threat. John must relinquish the weapon once the danger has passed. While John may have a duty to retreat if possible due to his felon status, it's not an absolute requirement before using force in self-defense. The court order allowing John to be on the property doesn't grant him any special rights to possess firearms beyond the temporary self-defense exception."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15139/what-would-it-take-to-replace-the-electoral-college-system", "docs_id": 15139, "title": "What would it take to replace the electoral college system?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It seems electoral college debate comes back every election these days. What would be needed to replace/remove this system? An amendment? ratification?

Sections 2\\-3 of the 14th Amendment would probably have to be rewritten, since they also refer to there being \"electors\". A single constitutional amendment would suffice (and nothing less than an amendment would): the wording would of course depend on what system you wanted to replace it with. In doing this, it should be decided how to deal with the fact that electors cannot vote for both a president and vice\\-president from the elector's state (per the 12th Amendment): that *might* indicate an intent to prevent the president and vice\\-president from being from the same state, or it might mean that the intent was that if that happens, then that state's electors can't vote for their two favorite sons. In repealing the 12th, you can decide what you want now.\n\nThere is a proposal to effectively nullify the Electoral College, the [Popular Vote Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact), which has been enacted in a few states. The basic idea is to make it a statutory requirement at the state level that all electors must vote for the winner of the popular vote at the national level, regardless of the outcome in the particular state. The idea is that when enough states agree to the scheme such that they hold a majority of electors (which can change over time, so to be stable you need more than a simple majority), then they vow to vote for the winner of the national election. However, this also needs to be backed up with more compulsory faithful voting of electors, since compact or no compact, only 1 state seems to be able to actually prevent an elector from voting however he wants.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the process required to replace the Electoral College system in the United States?\n\nA) The Electoral College can be eliminated through a simple majority vote in Congress, followed by the President's approval.\n\nB) A constitutional amendment is necessary to replace the Electoral College, which would require ratification by 3/4 of state legislatures or conventions.\n\nC) The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, once enacted by enough states, can effectively replace the Electoral College without a constitutional amendment.\n\nD) The Supreme Court has the authority to declare the Electoral College unconstitutional and mandate a new system for presidential elections.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because changing the Electoral College system requires more than just a congressional vote and presidential approval.

It almost certainly did, probably at some considerable expense (although the producers may have already owned the rights to many of them) and there were probably some editorial changes in the characters made as a result of the negotiations to replace expensive licensor demands with less expensive characters.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that contracts can be creative and often are in the financing of movies. The license was likely for a percentage of profits rather than a flat dollar amount, which was budgeted to be reasonable.

However, the film adaptation, which visually depicts these characters, almost certainly needed to obtain licenses from copyright holders. This is because visual representation in a film is more likely to infringe on copyrights than textual references in a book. The film producers probably had to negotiate licenses, possibly structuring deals based on profit percentages rather than flat fees to make the process more feasible. They may have also made editorial changes to use less expensive characters when necessary. Option D is incorrect because even characters owned by the production company would need to be cleared for this specific use.
