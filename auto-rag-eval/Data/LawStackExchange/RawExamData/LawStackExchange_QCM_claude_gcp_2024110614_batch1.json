The FAQ is unclear as to whether \"images created by Tagxedo\" refers to material created by the company, or with the software. The former would be perfectly standard. The odd interpretation would be that if you use the program to create an image, you must attribute the image to Tagxedo (i.e. \"was created using Tagxedo\"). That does not give them ownership of the image, though (unless the terms specifically say that whatever you create, they own). This is possible, since it may be in the EULA (if you can link to the actual EULA that would be helpful), and the terms of the EULA govern the permitted usages of software.

The key prohibition is in [section 5363](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5363).\n\nTo fall within the scope of this prohibition, a person must: \n\n(1\\) be \"in the business of betting or wagering\" and\n\n(2\\) accept a payment in connection with the participation of another person in \"unlawful Internet gambling\".\n\nSo you need to look at (1\\) what is betting or wagering and (2\\) what is unlawful Internet gambling.\n\nBoth terms are defined in [section 5362](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5362) and discussed on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlawful_Internet_Gambling_Enforcement_Act_of_2006#Section_5362.2C_Definitions).\n\nAssuming that you are running a video game that is not a thin veneer over a casino, and the users are gambling in\\-game items that are not purchased with actual money, then you are unlikely to be found to be engaged in the business of betting or wagering, especially given the exclusion in section 5362(1\\)(E)(viii) for \"participation in any game or contest in which participants do not stake or risk anything of value.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about online gambling laws in the United States, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup is developing a mobile app that allows users to participate in daily fantasy sports contests for cash prizes.

This could be seen as \"betting or wagering\" under section 5362, especially if the items can be purchased with real money initially. It goes beyond the exclusion for games where participants don't \"stake or risk anything of value\" and introduces a real-money element that could classify the app as being \"in the business of betting or wagering.\"\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically analyze the implications of different features in light of complex legal definitions."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73756/public-figures-patents-and-inventions", "docs_id": 73756, "title": "Public Figures, Patents And Inventions", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there any law or regulation that prevents or regulates the inventions made by public figures?\n\nPublic figures are people with hobbies and maybe some dedicate their free time to research.

Firstly, such an announcement is very likely to be protected by the First Amendment regardless of whether the announcement is made by the President or by any other person, because making an announcement is clearly a form of speech. In some cases, there might be concerns that a particular invention implicates the national security of the United States, in which case disclosure of the invention is unlawful (see [35 USC 181](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/181)), but the President [can unilaterally declassify anything](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2017/may/16/james-risch/does-president-have-ability-declassify-anything-an/), so under [35 USC 187](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/187), the President is very likely exempt from the entire secrecy law altogether. Obviously, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a good idea for the President to ignore the national security implications, but they have the legal power to do so if they wish.\n\nThere are also serious questions about the Constitutionality of 35 USC 181, because it constitutes a prior restraint on speech, and prior restraints are nearly always unconstitutional under well\\-established Supreme Court precedent. See particularly *United States v. Progressive*, which frustratingly never reached a firm conclusion on a closely\\-related issue, due to the government dropping the case. Nevertheless, there is a colorable legal argument that even national security considerations are not an adequate basis to impose a prior restraint on specific people in this fashion. If this argument is correct, then anyone can announce the invention of anything they like, President or not.\n\nAs to whether the President can patent it, it depends on whether they received federal funding to conduct the research, or did it on their own time and with their own money. If they did it on their own time, then the answer appears to be \"yes, they can patent it,\" as far as I can tell. If they did it with federal assistance, then [complicated rules apply](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/part-II/chapter-18) to protect the national interests of the United States.\n\nAs far as conflicts of interest are concerned, the normal way to deal with this problem is to put all of the President's assets (held before they were elected) into a [blind trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_trust), which might or might not then proceed to liquidate and/or diversify the President's portfolio in order to further distance it from any specific company or industry's interests. By design, the President should neither know nor control how, when, and whether that diversification happens.\n\nIt's not common for the President to invent something world\\-changing while in office, because the presidential office is already more than a full\\-time job. As a result, any specific discussion of how this problem would be solved will necessarily be somewhat speculative. I imagine that the President would proceed to create a corporation or other legal entity, give the patent to that entity, and then hand its ownership over to the President's pre\\-existing blind trust. But this is very much uncharted territory, and it's possible that the White House might come up with an alternative means of insulating the President from the conflict of interest. For example, they might form some sort of committee to formally advise the President and provide a paper trail of justifications for the President's actions with respect to their invention.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about inventions by public figures, particularly focusing on the US President, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: The President of the United States has developed a groundbreaking clean energy technology in their private laboratory.

In this specific example it sounds like they have counsel in state already, the relative is not representing them as their attorney.\n\nGiving legal advice often isn't unlicensed practice of law. It could be though. If the lawyer was representing a client in court, taking them on as a client, accepting money for legal services, or preparing a motion it would be a problem.\n\nMany states offer reciprocity to lawyers licensed in some other states, or are part of the uniform bar exam. And if they are only covering federal law, like immigration it is typically not an issue.

The correct answer, C, represents the most balanced approach given the current legal landscape and practical challenges.\n\nOption A, while thorough, would be overly burdensome and potentially privacy-invasive, likely deterring users. The documentation mentions that physical ID inspection is more reliable but not practical for online platforms.\n\nOption B is flawed because, as mentioned in the documentation, many teens have access to adults' credit cards, making this method unreliable.\n\nOption D is clearly insufficient, as it doesn't involve any actual verification effort and wouldn't likely be considered a \"good faith effort\" in legal terms.\n\nOption C combines multiple approaches:\n1. Self-reported age, which is a basic step\n2. Parental consent features, which the documentation mentions as existing in products like Amazon and Microsoft\n3. Behavioral analysis, which can help identify potentially underage users based on their actions\n\nThis multi-faceted approach demonstrates a good faith effort to comply with potential age restriction laws while acknowledging the practical difficulties of online age verification mentioned in the documentation.

However, copyright may be held by the person who hired the creator to create the work, that is, the work may be a \"work for hire\". In the US, this refers to \"a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment\". As you describe it, this is not a work for hire.

Copyright in the pictures *of* the relative might be jointly held by the relative and the person operating the camera. The creative (protected) elements include not just the act of pressing the button, it includes all sorts of setup stuff. Then the relative and the other person may hold joint copyright in the work. Since copyright is about protecting a person's creative work and it is unclear whether the operator contributed creatively to the work, it's impossible to say whether certain of those pictures are \"Copyright Relative and Anonymous\".

Instead, all states have provisions regarding slow-moving vehicles, with the legal convention being that slow-moving vehicles must keep to the right. \n\nThis proposed law would fundamentally alter the existing traffic law framework, which is built around regulating slower traffic rather than permitting faster traffic. It would contradict the current approach where states may restrict driving in the left lane except for passing (as in Illinois) or require drivers not to impede traffic in the left lane (as in Utah). \n\nFurthermore, such a law would go against the principle that speed limits apply to all lanes, as implied by the statement \"No state has a 'fast lane' that allows speeds greater that the legal limit.\" It would also potentially create confusion and safety issues by explicitly permitting speeding in certain circumstances, which goes against the general traffic safety principles.\n\nOptions A and D, while potentially relevant concerns, are not directly supported by the given documentation.

Obviously records to be maintained for ccpa should be separate given the format and laws .\nSecondly for gdpr there is an obligation tell about E.U. authorities that in my non lawyer knowledge is not required for ccpa .\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not an either\u2013or. You may have certain rights under both CCPA and GDPR, but they have rather different mechanisms for determining their scope.\n\n**When does the CCPA apply?**\n\nCCPA applies to certain businesses and consumers. It covers any business (regardless of legal structure) that that does business in the State of California and has a certain scale. A consumer means a natural person who is a California resident.\n\nThese aspects are not influenced by your current location. When you as a California resident travel to the EU, you still have all your CCPA rights against businesses that do business in California. You do not have any CCPA rights against businesses that don't do business in California, for example a national rail company in the EU you've bought a train ticket for.\n\n**When does the GDPR apply?**\n\nWhereas the location of the user/data subject can be a factor in the GDPR context, their residency or nationality does not.\n\nThe GDPR applies to all processing activities by data controllers who are established in the EU, including any businesses, non\\-profits, and individuals. This includes processing activities in the context of an EU establishment of a non\\-EU company. For example, GDPR would apply with respect to processing of personal data by a hotel you're staying at in the EU.\n\nThe GDPR also applies to non\\-EU data controllers in the context of (a) offering goods or services to people who are in the EU, or (b) monitoring behaviour of people who are in the EU. Here, \u201coffering\u201d does not mean \u201cdoing business\u201d, but \u201ctargeting or marketing\u201d. For example, you might have installed a smartphone app that assists with sightseeing while in Paris. If this app monitors your behaviour while you are in the EU (such as by tracking your GPS position to alert you to nearby points of interest), that would fall under the GDPR while you are in the EU. The app may also fall under the GDPR per case (a) if it is marketed to / targeted at people who are currently in Paris.\n\nThat the GDPR applies in such cases comes from the offering/monitoring while you are in the EU, not from your continued presence in the EU. You would be able to exercise your GDPR rights relating to this processing even after leaving the EU.\n\nNote that some service or processing activity can fall under CCPA and GDPR simultaneously.\nFor example, this app would also fall under CCPA if the company also does business in California, e.g. if it also provides sightseeing information for Los Angeles or San Francisco.\nAnd both CCPA and GDPR could apply when an EU company does business in California.\n\n**Under which privacy law would a deletion request be dealt with?**\n\nIn practice, most companies don't have this sorted out properly and results are unpredictable. Ideally, a company would just comply with both laws simultaneously, thus making it unnecessary to determine which law applies. Information that is only required under on law can be provided with conditional statements, e.g. \u201cIf this processing activity is covered by GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in your country\u201d.\n\nAs mentioned above, both laws can apply simultaneously. Whether GDPR applies and whether CCPA applies are independent questions. However, the answer to neither of these depends on your current location at the time of making the request.\n\nIn this answer, any statement about the EU applies equivalently to the UK.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A multinational e-commerce company based in California launches a new mobile app for personalized shopping recommendations.

Which of the following scenarios most accurately represents the company's obligations?\n\nA) The company must comply only with CCPA, as the user is a California resident and the request was made from California\nB) The company must comply only with GDPR, as the app was downloaded and used while the user was in the EU\nC) The company must comply with both CCPA and GDPR, treating them as separate requests with distinct record-keeping requirements\nD) The company can choose to comply with either CCPA or GDPR, whichever provides stronger protections for the user\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario requires analysis of multiple complex factors:\n\n1. CCPA applicability: The company does business in California and the user is a California resident, so CCPA applies regardless of the user's location at the time of app download or data deletion request.\n\n2. GDPR applicability: The app was downloaded and used while the user was in the EU, and it monitors behavior (GPS tracking) of people in the EU.

User's location: The current location of the user when making the deletion request does not determine which law applies.\n\nTherefore, the company must comply with both CCPA and GDPR, treating them as separate requests with distinct record-keeping requirements.

What are some exceptions for the Quiet Hours law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The \"Quiet Hours law\" is part of environmental protection laws: it regulates noise immissions. \n\nIn general, what is allowed differs quite a bit depending on zoning and day vs. night.  \n\nE.g. in a purely industrial area outdoor noise immission may be up to 70 dB(A) any time of the day. Whereas in hospital or nursing home zones only 45 dB(A) during the day and 35 dB(A) during the night are allowed.\n\nIt also depends on the type of noise source, e.g. construction noise has a longer night (20:00 \\- 7:00 compared to 22:00 \\- 6:00 for normal \"commercial\" noise sources) and some penalty for early/late day noise, commercial noise has a penalty\\* for early/late daytime and sundays; sports noise has day, night and quiet hours and they differ working days vs. sundays and holidays. There are no legal limits on noise emitted by children (incl. kindergarden, playgrounds), but neighborhood noise (party) does have restrictions, and machine\\-emitted noise has further restrictions. \n\n\\* penalties: some of these regulations use [weighted sound pressure levels](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bewerteter_Schalldruckpegel) that upweight certain particularly disturbing characteristics of the noise (information content of noise, particular tones sticking out, impulse\\-type\u00a0\\[sudden] noise, ...). \n\nFestivals and events are covered by the \n\n* \"recreational noise directive\" ([Freizeitl\u00e4rmrichtlinie](https://www.lai-immissionsschutz.de/documents/freizeitlaermrichtline_1503575715.pdf), state law) \n\n\t+ puts emphasis on communal planning as in don't put hospital and fair grounds or outdoor recreational swimming pool next to each other, keep some distance between the local skateboard ramp and residential housing.  \n\n\tAlso, the town market place (where fairs are held) would be an urban zone (or \"core\" zone) which has higher noise limits than a purely residential zone.\n\t+ Exceptions can be granted for rare (up to 18 days/year) events and festivals that are tightly bound to a particular location (\"hohe Standortgebundenheit\", e.g. [Kieler Woche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiel_Week), [Oktoberfest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest) or the annual village fair, but also \"moving\" festivals like the [Hessentag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessentag)) or socially adequate and accepted.  \n\n\tThese exceptions can include moving the night hours up to 2 hours (usually only for Friday or Saturday evenings or evenings before public holidays).\n\n\tThe higher the (expected) noise level and the more often, the more strictly the exception has to be evaluated. Also, not more than 2 weekends in a row are supposed to be subject to such rare events, and the neighboring residents have to be told (usually \\>\\= 2 weeks in advance).\n\n\tThere are also technical measures such as focusing sound on the festival area and making sure loud speakers do not emit sound in other directions more than necessary.\n* \"sports grounds noise directive\" ([Sportanlagenl\u00e4rmschutzverordnung](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bimschv_18/BJNR015880991.html))\n\n\t+ again, higher immission levels are allowed for rare events, rare being up to 18 days/year\n\t+ exceptions can be granted for sports events of major national or international importance, so when the soccer world cup came to Germany, residents had to put up with that.\n* sometimes exceptions are granted by directive, e.g. [public viewing during the 2018 soccer world cup](https://www.bmu.de/fileadmin/Daten_BMU/Download_PDF/Laermschutz/wm_2018_laermschutz_bf.pdf)\n* Pubs are commercial businesses and subject to the [TA L\u00e4rm](http://www.verwaltungsvorschriften-im-internet.de/bsvwvbund_26081998_IG19980826.htm), but sometimes somewhat less strict rules be used (e.g. [see here for NRW](https://www.umwelt.nrw.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Broschueren/laermschutz_in_biergaerten.pdf)). A pub thus cannot be in a *purely* residential zone: where you have a pub, you are at least in a general residential zone which has higher noise limits.  \n\nDiskotheken (night clubs) are often in industrial zones.\n* A private party is so\\-called neighborhood noise (Nachbarschaftsl\u00e4rm) and imission here is governed by [state law, plus possibly communal bylaws and last but not least binding clauses in e.g. the rent contract](https://www.mietrecht.com/ruhezeiten/).\nIf there isn't any particular law (AFAIK, e.g. Hesse does not have a state law on this), there's the catch\\-all [\u00a7117 OWiG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_owig/englisch_owig.html#p0697) on Inadmissable Noise: \n\n> (1\\) Whoever, without a justified reason, or to an inadmissible extent, or to an extent avoidable under the circumstances, causes noise which is suitable to create considerable disturbance to the general public or to the neighbourhood, or to inflict harm upon the health of another, shall be deemed to have committed a regulatory offence.\n\nA common rule of thumb would be that between 22:00 \\- 6:00 and on Sundays or holidays you shouldn't do anything that can be heard outside your flat ([Zimmerlautst\u00e4rke](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmerlautst%C3%A4rke)). \n\nA typical *practical* approach is to tell your neighbours that you'll have a party and will they please excuse if there's some noise? Bonus points if you invite them. This doesn't change anything about legal noise levels, but it usually does the trick in terms of no neighbours complaining/not disturbing them.\n\n---\n\n* There are so\\-called [silent holidays](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesetzliche_Feiertage_in_Deutschland#Stille_Tage) (again state law, e.g. [NRW](http://www.lexsoft.de/cgi-bin/lexsoft/justizportal_nrw.cgi?xid=166902,7)) with particularly heavy restrictions (no sports events, no markets/fairs/circus, no recreational events, ...)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Germany's Quiet Hours law, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A small town in Germany is planning its annual summer festival, which traditionally includes live music performances until midnight. The festival is scheduled for a Saturday and Sunday in July. Given the Quiet Hours law and its exceptions, what is the most appropriate course of action for the town officials to ensure compliance while maintaining the festival's tradition?\n\nA) Move all loud activities to before 10 PM on both days to comply with standard quiet hours\nB) Apply for an exception to extend quiet hours by 2 hours on Saturday night only\nC) Relocate the festival to an industrial zone where noise limits are higher\nD) Cancel all nighttime activities on Sunday due to stricter regulations for holidays\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the Quiet Hours law and its exceptions. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states that exceptions can be granted for rare events (up to 18 days/year) that are tightly bound to a particular location, such as annual village fairs. This festival qualifies under this criterion.\n\n2. These exceptions can include moving the night hours up to 2 hours, but usually only for Friday or Saturday evenings or evenings before public holidays. Since the festival includes a Saturday, this exception could apply.\n\n3. The question specifies that the festival traditionally includes music until midnight, which aligns with the 2-hour extension (from 10 PM to midnight) mentioned in the exception.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because it unnecessarily restricts the festival without considering available exceptions.\n\n5. Option C is incorrect because relocating to an industrial zone, while potentially allowing for higher noise levels, would likely conflict with the festival's traditional location and community aspect.\n\n6. Option D is incorrect because while Sundays do have stricter regulations, the documentation doesn't suggest that all nighttime activities must be cancelled. Instead, it emphasizes the need for careful evaluation and potential restrictions.\n\n7. The correct approach balances compliance with maintaining tradition by applying for the available exception for Saturday night, which is explicitly mentioned in the documentation.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically analyze the best course of action given the legal framework and practical considerations."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66604/does-fair-use-of-copyright-apply-to-educational-youtube-channels", "docs_id": 66604, "title": "Does Fair Use of copyright apply to educational youtube channels?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm not an official school and I'm not registered or related to any university or any governmental education system.

Or does it apply automatically without doing any paperwork?\n\nIf it's okay to use some parts of other copywriter videos? What are the limitations? Eg. Max copyrighted video length, Attribution,...etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fair Use\n--------\n\nFair use (in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") which is the only jurisdiction where it applies) is defined by [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107). It does not matter whether the user is a formal educational institution nor not. It will matter whether the use is educational or not, but that alone will not determine whether a use is a fair use or not. There is no set limit of length below which a use is a fair use. In general the more of the source that is used, the less strong the case for fair use is, but in some cases the use of the entire source can be a fair use, and in others the use of even a small fraction has been held not to be a fair use.\n\nThat a use is on a Youtube channel does not determine whether it is a fair use or not.\n\n### The Four Factors\n\nThe actual law specifying the factors to consider reads:\n\n> The fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> \n> \n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nCourt cases have said that no one of these factors is final \\- each must be considered. Some cases have emphasized one factor, some have emphasized another. In addition the law permits a court to consider other factors, not listed specifically in 17 USC 107\\.\n\n### The factors analyzed\n\nThe effect of the factors is, roughly:\n\nFactor (1\\) favors fair use when the use is for educational purposes. It also favors fair use when the use is not for profit. Note that this is not the same as no fee being charged. Profits made by advertising can also be considered. And a non\\-profit user may still charge a fee to cover costs.\n\nFactor (2\\) favors fair use when the original is basically factual, such as a textbook or a news report, and weighs against fair use when the original is a creative work, such as a work of fiction, a poem, or a song.\n\nFactor (3\\) favors fair use when only a small part of the original is used, and weighs against fair use when much or all of the original is used. There is **no** absolute standard for how much, either in terms of word count or duration, is allowable.\n\nFactor (4\\) favors fair use when the actual and potential market for the original is not harmed by the use. It weighs against fair use when the use might tend to reduce the paid market for the original. If an individual use would have only a minimal effect, but if many people were to make similar uses that would have a sizable negative effect on the market, that would weigh against fair use. If there is a potential market that is not being exploited currently, but which the copyright holder might exploit in future, and the use might harm such a potential market, that would weigh against fair use. In the use would tend to substitute for the original, so that people would be less likely to seek out the original, that would weigh against fair use.\n\nFair use cases often use the term \"transformative\". A use is transformative when it uses the work is a significantly different way from the original. For example, a poem may be published to cause an emotional effect on the readers. But a poetry text may use the verse as an example of a technique of poetic composition. That would be a transformative use. Being transformative is sometime thought of as a fifth factor, but more often as a way to analyze factor (1\\). In any case a transformative use is much more likely to be held to be a fair use.\n\nUS Registration\n---------------\n\nUnder current US law, any copyrightable work is protected teh moment it is \"fixed in tangible form\". This includes bein written down, and beign saved as a computer record, as well as an executed sculpture or pictorial work. (A copyright notice and Registration was required prior to 1978\\.) This matches the law in almost every other country.\n\nHowever, one must file for and obtain a certificate of registration before one can file suit in a US court for copyright infringement. In addition, unless one registers a work with the US copyright office before the infringement occurs, or within three months after the work is first published, certain rights under US law are forfeited. Specifically, the right to statutory damages, and the right to costs and attorney fees. Statutory damages can be assessed on proof of infringement, with no need to prove the amount of financial harm done or any profit by the infringer. They can range anywhere from $750 to $30,000 per work infringed, or up to $150,000 if the infringement is found to be \"willful\".

The correct answer is C because it's the least likely to be considered fair use. Here's why:\n\n1. Purpose and character of use: While the channel is educational, showing a full episode without additional commentary doesn't transform the original work significantly.\n\n2. Nature of the copyrighted work: TV shows are typically creative works, which are more strongly protected than factual works.\n\n3. Amount and substantiality: Using an entire episode is substantial and weighs against fair use.\n\n4. Effect on the market: Showing full episodes could potentially substitute for the original, harming its market value.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are more likely to be considered fair use because they use shorter clips, provide educational context or commentary, and are more transformative in nature.

Copyright law does not distinguish the various chronological states of a work as it is developed, whereby you might say that the text is really a series of 100 versions, each one being a derivative of the previous one. Instead, you have one whole work, the final product (the version of record). If you then want to recycle the text or graphics of that paper (beyond what is covered by fair use), you would need permission from the (new) rights\\-holder. You would need to scrutinize the language of the transfer agreement, but it is unlikely that any agreement also transfers copyright in earlier drafts, or elements of earlier drafts.\n\nIf an earlier version had a clearly different drawing which you also created, the courts would probably not find that you had transferred the rights to that drawing as part of the rights transfer of the version of record (assuming no explicit \"and all previous works\" clause). But if earlier versions had a minimally different drawing, it is reasonable to think that the courts would find distribution of that earlier image to be infringing. One of the main questions asked in an infringement case is whether the works are substantially similar. If your earlier version of the text has \"But\" where the published version has \"However\", the versions would be so substantially similar that the earlier version would be found to be infringing, despite not being a verbatim copy of the published version.

The change in circumstances and relationship could be seen as an implicit revocation of that permission.\n\n4.

An EU paper on GDPR states the following (page 11, 12 of\n[Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_3_2018_territorial_scope_after_public_consultation_en_1.pdf)):\n\n> The separate question then arises of whether the processor is processing in the context of its\n> establishment in the Union.

The data controller is the person or entity responsible for the data processing. They determine the purposes and means of this processing. A data processor merely performs data processing on the controller's behalf.\n\nThe processor must not process data for their own purposes, but can make low\\-level decisions about the means of processing. For example, a controller may specify the purpose of ensuring the security and integrity of the services, or the purpose of creating basic statistics. The processor might implement this in part through the means of keeping a logfile. Often, such purposes are agreed upon via a data processing agreement or the terms of service, leading to the legal fiction that the processor was instructed by the controller.\n\nIn your scenario, the controller is presumably not subject to the GDPR1, and therefore does not need a clear purpose or a legal basis for their processing activities. However, the EU\\-based data processor is bound by the GDPR, and can only process data as instructed by the controller. The processor has to comply with the GDPR with respect to *how* they carry out the processing activities, but the processing activities themselves don't have to be GDPR\\-compliant. Thus, it might be perfectly fine for an EU\\-based hosting provider to keep logfiles with IP addresses, even if those logfiles wouldn't be GDPR\\-compliant.\n\n1: Whether GDPR applies to a non\\-EU data controller depends not on whether processing occurs in the EU, but on whether the controller is offering goods or services to people in the EU, or observing behaviour of people in the EU \u2013 see Art 3(2\\) GDPR.\n\nThe cited guidelines continue to enumerate which provisions of the GDPR would still apply to EU processors working on behalf of non\\-EU data controllers (pages 12\u201313\\). These requirements are about how the controller and processor work together and relate to internal compliance of the data processor, but they do not affect the processing activities themselves.\n\nYou mention that you would link to the hosting provider's privacy policy and direct data subject requests to the hoster. This misunderstands the role of the data processor. The data controller is the single point of contact for data subjects. The data processor is not a data controller in this scenario. They cannot issue a privacy policy for the controller's processing activities, and cannot respond to data subject requests. Their only relationship is with the data controller. If the hosting provider were to post a privacy policy for these processing activities, they would act like a controller (possibly a joint controller) and could bring the processing activities within scope of the GDPR \u2013 not what you are intending.\n\nHowever, since GDPR does not apply to the processing activities in this scenario, the data subject rights in the GDPR do not apply. As far as GDPR is concerned, no privacy policy is needed and no data subject requests have to be answered.

By pursuing a 4-year bachelor's program (4 years) followed immediately by a PhD program (which can last up to 4 years: 3 years of study plus 1 year for thesis writing), the individual could potentially defer service until age 28. \n\nOption A is incorrect because working as a research assistant after completing a master's degree would not necessarily qualify for further deferment. \n\nOption C, while providing a long period of study, would likely not extend beyond age 27 for someone starting at age 20. \n\nOption D is incorrect because transferring to another bachelor's program would not restart the deferment period; the law focuses on continuous education rather than multiple degrees at the same level.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the given information, apply it to a real-world scenario, and identify the strategy that best achieves the stated goal within the legal framework."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77434/does-the-united-states-constitution-allow-the-president-to-refuse-to-enforce-a-l", "docs_id": 77434, "title": "Does the United States Constitution allow the President to refuse to enforce a law on the basis that they don&#39;t agree with it?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Article 2 section 3 of the United States Constitution states, in part:\n\n\"\\[The President] shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\" (Source: [https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII\\-S3\\-1\\-3\\-1/ALDE\\_00001160/\\['impeachment']](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S3-1-3-1/ALDE_00001160/%5B%27impeachment%27%5D))\n\nAt issue here is not whether the President can de\\-prioritize enforcement of a law, but whether the President can outright refuse to enforce it simply because they don't agree with it.\n\nFor example, were President Biden or anyone with authority over Immigration and Customs Enforcement to issue a memorandum that says \"United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement is hereby permanently prohibited from making any more arrests for violations of immigration law\" would that memorandum be enforceable under the Constitution, or would ICE be legally allowed, or even required, to disregard the memorandum?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends who has discretion to enforce the law\n------------------------------------------------\n\nIn common law jurisdictions the enforcement of law is at the discretion of the executive arm of government.\n\nHowever, that does not mean that that discretion vests with the President: it might vest with the Attorney General, or local Federal prosecutors, or the Director of the FBI, or the LEO on the scene, or more than one of these. However, whoever it vests with must be free to exercise that discretion \\- they cannot be told what to do by someone else. So if the discretion vests solely in the President, she can state that she won\u2019t be doing X because *she can always change her mind*, however, discretion rarely vests solely in a single office.\n\nFor the example you cite, it\u2019s likely that a number of people down the line from the President have discretion and **telling** them what to do is likely unlawful (whether anyone would sue or who might have standing is another question). However, stating that this is no longer government policy and letting that inform their discretion is perfectly fine.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: The President issues a directive to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stating, \"All deportation proceedings for non-violent offenders are to be immediately and indefinitely suspended.\" A group of ICE agents believes this directive contradicts existing immigration laws. Which of the following best describes the constitutional implications and potential outcomes of this situation?\n\nA) The directive is unconstitutional, and ICE agents are legally required to disregard it and continue enforcing all immigration laws as written.\n\nB) The directive is a valid exercise of executive discretion, and ICE agents must comply with it regardless of their personal views on existing laws.\n\nC) The constitutionality of the directive depends on whether discretion for immigration enforcement rests solely with the President or is distributed among various officials.\n\nD) The directive is constitutional as long as the President frames it as a policy recommendation rather than a binding order to ICE agents.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the complex interplay between executive power, constitutional obligations, and the discretionary nature of law enforcement. The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced reality presented in the documentation.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. The Constitution requires the President to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" which creates tension with broad non-enforcement directives.\n\n2. In common law jurisdictions, law enforcement is discretionary, but this discretion doesn't necessarily rest solely with the President.\n\n3. The constitutionality and enforceability of such a directive depend on who has the legal authority to exercise discretion in immigration enforcement.\n\n4. If discretion is distributed among various officials (e.g., ICE directors, individual agents), a blanket order from the President may be seen as overstepping constitutional bounds.\n\n5. The framing of the directive (as policy vs. order) may impact its legality, but doesn't definitively resolve the constitutional question.\n\nOptions A and B are oversimplifications that don't account for the complexity of discretionary enforcement and separation of powers. Option D touches on an important point about framing but overstates its impact on constitutionality. The correct answer, C, accurately captures the central issue of where enforcement discretion lies, which is crucial for determining the directive's constitutionality and the obligations of ICE agents.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply constitutional principles to a real-world scenario, integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, and analyze the implications of executive actions on law enforcement practices."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72793/international-law-sanctions", "docs_id": 72793, "title": "International law: sanctions", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am analyzing the United Nations Charters, specifically focusing on sanctions.

I presume it was some kind of franchise arrangement that allowed this as opposed to an employee arrangement.\n\nI am now back with A and happy with the new (old) arrangement but for 2 weeks B collected rent and believes that they are entitled to payment for their efforts.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Even though the property owner did not directly authorize Company B, if Company A (or its employees) represented to Company B that they had the authority to transfer the management, Company B likely acted in good faith.\n\n2.

Employers can dictate when employees take rest breaks, as long as the break is taken in one go somewhere in the middle of the day and workers are allowed to spend it away from their workstation.\n3.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Frustration (option A) is not applicable here. As mentioned in the documentation, frustration requires the contract to become impossible to perform, not just more onerous or expensive. The lockdown makes the work temporarily unfeasible, not impossible.\n\n2. Unilaterally suspending payments (option B) would likely breach the contract, as there's no force majeure clause or other provision allowing for this action. This could expose the company to legal liability.\n\n3. Negotiating a contract modification (option C) is the most pragmatic and legally sound approach. It acknowledges the binding nature of the original contract while seeking a mutually agreeable solution to the unforeseen circumstances. This aligns with the advice given in the documentation to negotiate with the neighbor.\n\n4. Continuing payments and seeking damages from the government (option D) is impractical and likely ineffective. There's no indication that the government would be liable for such damages, and this approach doesn't address the immediate issue with the neighbor.\n\nOption C requires critical thinking about contract law principles, the specific circumstances, and practical problem-solving.

If the advisor is an expert in the field he or she is advising about?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most important consideration is whether you're giving advice \"as\" something special. An example would be claiming to be a medical doctor and advising people to do something clearly harmful such as \"take 10 Tylenol and call me next week\". In such an extreme case, there could be criminal charges. Less severe would be an accountant giving grossly wrong and incompetent tax advice to a client, in which case the accountant could be civilly liable. (For instance, telling a client \"you don't have to declare royalties for textbook sales\"). In such cases, a client depends on the professional to give competent advice, and you rely on him to work according to a certain professional standard of care. There is a difference between the standard of care that an ordinary \"reasonable person\" owes to any other person, and the standard of care owed by a professional in an area. What would be excusable bad advice that I might give on how to build a wall would be inexcusable if given by an engineer.\n\nThe basic idea is that if you interact with a person (even indirectly, manufacturing something that a 3rd party buys), you have a certain duty to be cautious. If this is just an ordinary\\-person on ordinary\\-person interaction, then the parties (both parties) are expected to exhibit the degree of caution that a \"reasonable person\" would exhibit (attempts to pin down what a \"reasonable person\" would do have proven impossible, though juries always know subjectively what a reasonable person would do). However, your duty to not give bad advice is offset by the advice\\-taker's duty to not take bad advice \u2013 that is, if a reasonable person would know that taking 10 Tylenol is a bad idea (thus I, as a non\\-physician might have some duty to not give such stupid advice), then the person who stupidly took 10 Tylenol was contributorily negligent in taking the 10 Tylenol.\n\nAs far as I can tell, if you do not represent yourself as a member of a technical guild (lawyer, doctor, accountant, many others) giving technical advice in that capacity, and you are not directly contracting with a person (i.e. they hire you to give them advice on how to keep your yard from falling over the cliff), then you can say stuff like \"If X, then you should Y\", and not have to pay if someone does that Y and they suffer a loss.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A popular fitness influencer with 500,000 followers posts a video on social media demonstrating a new workout routine they claim will \"burn fat 5 times faster than any other exercise.\" A viewer follows this advice and sustains an injury.

The correct answer (C) significantly increases liability because the influencer is explicitly representing themselves as a licensed healthcare professional (physiotherapist) specializing in the relevant field (weight loss).

Option B introduces a degree of expertise but without claiming professional status, which wouldn't necessarily increase liability to the same extent as C.

Are there any known examples of a grand jury \"going rogue\" as they describe?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Traditionally, anyone could bring a bill of indictment to a grand jury. [This article](http://www.constitution.org/lrev/roots/runaway.htm) from Creighton Law Review provides some historical context. Government prosecutors are the overwhelming norm now, but private prosecution used to be more common. Indeed, New Jersey still has limited authorization for private prosecution (Court rule [3:23\\-9(d)](http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/r3-23.html)). The New Jersey rule governing the grand jury is [3:6](http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/rules/rule_3_6.pdf), and rule 3:6\\-8(a) on return of indictment says:\n\n> An indictment may be found only upon the concurrence of 12 or more\n>  jurors and shall be returned in open court to the Assignment Judge or,\n>  in the Assignment Judge's absence, to any Superior Court judge\n>  assigned to the Law Division in the county. With the approval of the\n>  Assignment Judge, an indictment may be returned to such judge by only\n>  the foreperson or the deputy foreperson rather than with all other\n>  members of the grand jury. Such judge may direct that the indictment\n>  shall be kept secret until the defendant is in custody or has been\n>  released pending trial and in that event it shall be sealed by the\n>  clerk, and no person shall disclose its finding except as necessary\n>  for the issuance and execution of a warrant or summons.\n\nNote that the jurors decide on an indictment and return the indictment to a judge, not the prosecutor. In the rules governing grand juries, the prosecutor is allowed to be present and to speak, but has no official controlling role, other than whatever leadership is granted by the foreman. I don't know whether it is universal that grand juries do what the prosecutor tells them to, such as indicting a ham sandwich, but at least theoretically they have the power to act independently. The rules actually do not say who can ask questions of a witness, which could lead one to conclude that of course it is the prosecutor (and that the prosecutor does everything, except vote on the indictment).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Question: A citizens' group has gathered evidence of potential misconduct by a high-ranking government official and wants to pursue criminal charges. Given the information from the documentation about grand juries in New Jersey, which of the following approaches is most likely to result in a valid indictment while adhering to proper legal procedures?\n\nA) Present the evidence directly to a sitting grand jury without involving a prosecutor\nB) File a private criminal complaint and request the court to convene a special grand jury\nC) Lobby the prosecutor's office to present the case to a grand jury\nD) Publicly release the evidence and call for grand jury members to summon witnesses\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the grand jury process in New Jersey and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. While the documentation suggests that grand juries theoretically have the power to act independently, it also notes that government prosecutors are the \"overwhelming norm\" now.\n\n2. The expert quoted in the article states that a grand jury \"going rogue\" would be \"very unlikely\" and unprecedented, indicating that working through official channels is more likely to succeed.\n\n3. The New Jersey court rules (3:6) allow the prosecutor to be present and speak during grand jury proceedings, suggesting they play a significant role even if not officially controlling the process.\n\n4. Option A, while theoretically possible based on the historical information provided, would be highly unusual in modern practice and likely face procedural challenges.\n\n5. Option B misinterprets the limited provision for private prosecution in New Jersey, which doesn't extend to convening special grand juries.\n\n6. Option D, while dramatic, doesn't follow proper legal channels and could potentially interfere with grand jury secrecy rules.\n\n7. Lobbying the prosecutor's office (Option C) to present the case combines the citizens' evidence gathering with the established legal process, making it the most likely path to a valid indictment.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply them to a real-world scenario, and critically evaluate different approaches based on both the letter of the law and practical considerations."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43349/excluding-yourself-from-a-class-action-lawsuit-and-then-suing-based-on-the-settl", "docs_id": 43349, "title": "Excluding yourself from a class action lawsuit and then suing based on the settlement in small claims?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The equifax class action lawsuit seems to have been settled, [but it seems clear that people aren't going to get the expected payout.](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748981/ftc-equifax-settlement-payout-125-dollars) If I really wanted to stick it to Equifax for what I consider negligence; could I sue them in small claims court? Does it matter if my state (Colorado) was or was not part of the team that sued them as part of the class?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can sue them in small claims court if the court has jurisdiction. If they have any presence in the state, that might be sufficient. If they have no presence in the state, then you can't sue them in any state court in your state.\n\nAbsent presence in your state, you would have to file in a state where they have a presence. (You can't file in federal court because the federal court would not have subject matter jurisdiction.)\n\nIf you didn't agree to be a member of the class, then you have preserved your right to sue. It doesn't matter if your state was or was not a member of the class.\n\nI'd have to look at the particulars, which I don't have. So I'm making some assumptions.\n\nTo file a suit against an entity, the court in which you're filing must have jurisdiction. To have jurisdiction, the entity must have at least a threshold level of presence in your state. The tiniest office will suffice. An employee in the state who works from home might do. But if the entity has no presence in the state, you have two choices.\n\n(1\\) You can file a diversity suit in federal district court, but that requires that the case has a reasonable expectation of award of more than $75,000 or presents a federal question of law.\n\n(2\\) You can file in a state court that has jurisdiction over the defendant\n\nThere's something called forum shopping, where the defendant has a presence in multiple states, albeit the headquarters is in one state, and the plaintiff seeks to sue in the state where the plaintiff is most likely to win and receive the greatest award. Courts don't like this. I'm not sure how they handle it. But surely they would want the plaintiff to justify choosing the particular forum.\n\nIt might be reasonable, for example, if the defendant's HQ is in NY, the plaintiff is in CO, the defendant doesn't have a presence in CO, but does have a presence in KS reasonably close to plaintiff. The reasoning would be that neither party is suffering a hardship. Of course, it might matter if the defendant's only KS location was a 5'x5' storage unit in Kansas City.\n\nThere may be laws that further limit where the suit may be filed. There may be a relationship between the parties that limits where the suit may be filed. There may be some arbitration thing, arising from law or relationship.\n\nThe courts may impose limitations on the options available to those who decline to join.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I AM NOT A LICENSED ATTORNEY.

The correct answer is A because it satisfies two crucial conditions:\n\n1. The resident opted out of the class action settlement, which preserves their right to sue individually. As stated in the documentation, \"If you didn't agree to be a member of the class, then you have preserved your right to sue.\"\n\n2. Equifax has a physical presence in Colorado (a small satellite office in Denver). The documentation emphasizes that to file a suit in a state court, the entity must have \"at least a threshold level of presence in your state. The tiniest office will suffice.\"\n\nOption B is incorrect because being part of the class action settlement typically waives the right to sue individually. Additionally, whether Colorado was involved in the original lawsuit is irrelevant to an individual's right to sue.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, although the resident opted out of the class action, Equifax having no physical presence in Colorado would prevent the state court from having jurisdiction. As stated, \"If they have no presence in the state, then you can't sue them in any state court in your state.\"\n\nOption D is incorrect for two reasons: the resident was part of the class action settlement (likely waiving individual suit rights), and Equifax's headquarters location is irrelevant to the jurisdiction of a Colorado court.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of jurisdictional requirements, the implications of class action participation, and the application of these legal concepts to a specific scenario."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39322/does-gdpr-cover-the-collection-of-data-by-websites-that-crawl-the-web-and-resell", "docs_id": 39322, "title": "Does GDPR cover the collection of data by websites that crawl the web and resell user data", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have found that a lot of my personal info is now available on a bunch of websites that collect data and resell it.\nI'm talking about those 'find anything about anyone' websites.\n\nA lot of the data is also inaccurate.\n\nSince a lot of these companies are American and I have lived my life half US / half EU and I'm now an EU resident, I was wondering:\n\n* does the GDPR applies to them?\n* does the GDPR applies to data they claim was 'public', but I see that this is not really true?\n* What's the responsibility of search engines, like Google, in indexing and promoting that content. As they seem to have a 'contact the webmaster' approach to it, is it possible to get the content (at the minimum the inacurate one) removed from their index?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR applies to such sites if they offer services in the EU/EEA. If they clearly wanted to avoid being subject to the GDPR, they should block visitors from the EEA. For the GDPR, only location matters. Other concerns like residence or citizenship are generally irrelevant.\n\nPersonal data does not turn non\\-personal just because it was public. So the GDPR still applies when the data was collected from public sources. However, the data controller (who determines the purpose of processing) often has to balance your rights and interests against other interests (e.g. when using *legitimate interest* as a legal basis for some processing). For the purpose of publicly displaying your data, only showing data that was already public anyway makes it easier to argue that this is fine.\n\nBut when the GDPR applies, you have data subject rights. Relevant rights include:\n\n* a right to access, to see all the data they have about you\n* a right to rectification, to correct wrong data they hold about you\n* a right to restriction, effectively an opt\\-out\n* a right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)\n\nThese rights apply both against the website and against Google Search (arguably, both are doing the exact same thing). Google correctly points out that they can't remove information from the Web, but they can hide information from search results.\n\nIf you feel that your requests have not been resolved correctly, you can issue a complaint with your country's data protection authority.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate approach because:\n\n1. The GDPR applies to the US-based company if it offers services in the EU/EEA, regardless of its location.\n2. The fact that data was collected from public sources doesn't exempt it from GDPR protections.\n3. Under GDPR, individuals have the right to erasure (right to be forgotten), which applies to both the website and search engines like Google.\n4.

Neither of the exceptions apply, as 22100\\.5 is about U\\-turns at traffic lights, while 22101 is about turns controlled by markings or signs.\n\nAdditionally, since you describe the route as a \"curve to the street and turn right out\", it's probably in violation of [Section 22105](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22105.): \n\n> No person shall make a U\\-turn upon any highway where the driver of such vehicle does not have an unobstructed view for 200 feet in both directions along the highway and of any traffic thereon.\n\nSince the driver didn't make a complete right turn, it's likely that the forward view of oncoming traffic was partially blocked by the car's A\\-pillar or even the passenger seat, while the backward view of traffic was limited because none of the car's mirrors was pointed in the correct direction.\n\nIt's certainly in violation of [Section 22108](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&sectionNum=22108.):\n\n> Any signal of intention to turn right or left shall be given continuously during the last 100 feet traveled by the vehicle before turning.\n\nThe side road's not a hundred feet wide.

However, the judge declares that Ahok is guilty anyway.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. Indonesia Law uses Civil Law structures which use an Inquisitorial Trial. The chief difference is that in the United States (which has a Common Law Structure) the judge usually does not decide the case, but interprets the law (Trier of Law) and with a few exceptions, will determine the sentence once guilt is found. The Jury decides the case (Trier of Fact) and pronounces guilt (It is the right of the defense to request a Bench Trial, which gives the Judge both roles. The prosecution cannot object to this request).\n\nIn a Civil Court, the big difference is that their is no Jury and the Judge has both roles (Trier of Law, and Trier of Fact). As the name suggests, rather than two sides fighting each other (adversarial), the two sides are answering questions posed to them by the Judge or usually a panel of Judges are used and the Judge may initiate further investigation in the evidence.\n\nThe United States does use Inquisitional Trials from time to time, but they are often seen in misdemeanors, traffic courts, and small claims courts. The latter is a popular daytime TV genre (think Judge Judy) while misdemeanors and traffic court decisions are often time funny and make great Youtube videos. There are not many great Adversarial media as many throw out rules for time sake (real U.S. trials have many long boring periods during testimony) and story/drama sake. I would recommend \"My Cousin Vinny\" which was written by two lawyers who were fed up with Hollywood messing up how court room drama works and is hilarious to boot.

The prosecutor has presented evidence suggesting the defendant's guilt but recommends a lenient sentence. The judge, however, appears inclined towards a harsher verdict. Based on Indonesia's legal system and the information provided, which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur?\n\nA) The judge must follow the prosecutor's recommendation for a lenient sentence, as in an adversarial system.\nB) The case will be referred to a jury for a final decision on guilt and sentencing.\nC) The judge can independently determine both guilt and a harsher sentence, regardless of the prosecutor's recommendation.\nD) The case will be automatically appealed to a higher court due to the discrepancy between the prosecutor's and judge's views.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of Indonesia's legal system and its comparison to the US system. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Indonesia uses a Civil Law system with an Inquisitorial Trial structure, unlike the US's Common Law and adversarial system.\n2. In Indonesia's system, there is no jury. The judge (or panel of judges) acts as both the Trier of Law and Trier of Fact.\n3. The judge has the authority to independently investigate evidence and make decisions on both guilt and sentencing.\n4. The example of the Ahok case demonstrates that Indonesian judges can indeed find a defendant guilty and impose a harsher sentence than what the prosecutor recommends.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it describes an aspect of an adversarial system, which Indonesia does not use. Option B is wrong because jury trials are not part of Indonesia's legal system. Option D is incorrect because while appeals may be possible, they are not automatic in this scenario and would not be triggered simply by a discrepancy between the prosecutor's recommendation and the judge's inclination.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of different legal systems, the roles of various parties in these systems, and the application of this knowledge to a realistic scenario, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18769/what-is-the-purpose-of-signing-some-contracts", "docs_id": 18769, "title": "What is the purpose of signing some contracts?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that a contract doesn't need to be signed to be legally binding.

To what extent to they substitute for a signature?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally in the U.S., states have laws that require some contracts to be signed by a party in order to enforce the contract against the party. These requirements are generally set out in a law commonly known as the Statute of Frauds. *See* the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_frauds). Although the exact details will vary from state to state, the following types of contracts generally would be unenforceable without a signature: contracts in consideration of marriage (e.g., prenuptials, postnuptials); contracts that cannot be performed within a year; real estate contracts; contracts for goods above a particular threshold, such as $500; and surety contracts.\n\nEven if a contract does not require a signature, it is generally wise to do in order to prove the parties agreed on the terms of the contract.

A failure to return the object for 1000 days means the entire amount due is payable, in addition to the fee for replacement.

The correct answer is C for the following reasons:\n\n1. The contract duration was for 365 days, and the videographer did not inform RentTech of the damage until the end of this period. This mirrors the situation in the documentation where B did not inform A of the damage until the end of the rental period.\n\n2.

The videographer's failure to notify RentTech promptly about the damage means they remained responsible for the full rental period, even though the item was unusable.

The crux of the procedural dance is their receipt of official notices and counter notices, and their responses. The trigger is a sworn statement by the copyright holder: in the scenario that you describe, there is no such take\\-down notice. A take\\-down notice is directed at a specific infringement (delivered to Youtube), and the required remedy is that the content host must remove the copied material. This was done in the particular case, so there is no further issue.\n\nThe copyright owner would have to separately serve notice on MeTube or FreeTube for distributing the same work. SE or similar platform is not even close to the liability ballpark until it gets served with notice. YouTube, on the other hand, could be liable if they restored the content after taking it down (this is covered via the counter\\-claim and put\\-back provisions). The copyright owner's whack\\-a\\-mole department has to dilligently find all of those infringers.\n\n\"Infringing\" boils down to copying, not to \"referring to\", and in the cases you are asking about, there is no copying of the content \u2013 there is a reference (link) to allegedly infringing material. The case [Intellectual Reserve, Inc. v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry, Inc.](https://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/cjoyce/copyright/release10/intres.html), 75 F. Supp. 2d 1290 gives indications of what actions *other than* actual copying might be deemed \"contributory infringement\". The court points out that browsing anything requires copying \u2013 \"in making a copy, even a temporary one, the person who browsed infringes the copyright\" \u2013\nalthough if the person browsing \"was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages\". So yes, there is always potential for end\\-users to be sued for infringement, and usually an escape hatch for innocent infringers.\n\nThe other question raised in this case, about the platform's liabilities, is somewhat mooted by the apparent age of the would\\-be infringement which sees to predate DMCA. But the case does include an element of infringement\\-by\\-link, and the court found in that instance that \"defendants have actively encouraged the infringement of plaintiff's copyright\", citing various facts where the host overtly directed users to infringing sites, for example \"Please mirror these files . . . . It will be a LOT quicker for you to download the compressed version . . . Needless to say, we need a LOT of mirror sites, as absolutely soon as possible\".

Companies which do not trade are known as dormant companies and are defined at [Section 1169 of the Companies Act 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1169). It is perfectly legitimate to create and own a dormant company for as long as you wish, so long as you comply with annual filing requirements. That includes the duty to [file an annual confirmation statement](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/853A) and to [file annual (dormant) accounts](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/441).\n\n> I also found Ownr which let's me pay CAD $49 (one time fee) to\n> register a sole proprietorship\n\nA sole proprietorship is not a company; it's merely you as an individual operating as a business.

Do I need to worry about filing taxes even if I don't\n> get any revenue/expenses as I won't really be doing any business\n> activities?\n\nYes, there is a pitfall. The parties to the contract will be the service provider, and your company. Therefore your premise that there are no \"*revenue / expenses as I won't really be doing any business activities*\" is wrong. It will be the company purchasing the services and then reselling them (or gifting them) to you. Accordingly, your company will no longer be dormant and will be subject to the usual accounting and tax rules that apply to trading companies.\n\nThere are ways around this; for example the company can act as your agent for the purposes of entering into the contract and, provided that you pay for the services from your personal funds, the company may still be able to remain dormant. You would probably also need to inform the service provider of the agency arrangement as undisclosed principals can result in a deemed contract between the service provider and the agent.

A cheaper inheritance process when there is wide confidence debts are low compared to goods and rights? A way for creditors to mate with notaries in order to trick naive inheritors not using inventory benefit? Both?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a tradeoff between the delay and administrative costs associated with the Spanish equivalent of a probate proceeding, and the limitation of liability for the debts of a decedent that the proceeding can provide.\n\nIf you take the assets \"pure and simple\" you have to assume all of the decedent's debts with them, even if it might turn out that those debts exceed the value of the assets that you inherited. This is much cheaper and faster.\n\nBut, if you do not, and insist on an inventory and formal administration, if the estate is insolvent (i.e. if it is not able to pay all of the decedent's debts with the proceeds of the decedent's assets), then the worst case scenario for the heir is that you get no inheritance and the creditors of the decedent don't get paid to the extent that the decedent's assets aren't sufficient to pay them in full.\n\nIf you know that the estate is insolvent, or if the insolvency is a close thing or the insolvency is hard to evaluate because the debts of the decedent are unliquidated (e.g. a potential lawsuit for a personal injury the decedent caused) or complex (e.g. for a decedent with complex business deals), you would not want to take \"pure and simple\" and risk being exposed to those debts unless you felt a personal moral obligation to pay those creditors from your own funds anyway.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided legal documentation:\n\nQuestion: A wealthy businessman dies, leaving behind a complex estate with numerous assets and potential liabilities. His son, the sole heir, is unsure about the full extent of his father's debts and business obligations. Given this scenario, what is the most prudent course of action for the heir, considering the legal implications and potential risks?\n\nA) Accept the inheritance purely and simply to avoid delays and administrative costs\nB) Immediately repudiate the entire inheritance to avoid any potential liabilities\nC) Accept the inheritance at inventory benefit and request a formal inventory\nD) Partially accept only the known assets and reject any potential liabilities\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Accepting the inheritance at inventory benefit (a beneficio de inventario) is the most prudent course of action in this complex scenario. This approach, as outlined in Articles 1010 and 1023, provides several key advantages:\n\n1. Protection of personal assets: As per Article 1023, the heir's liability for the deceased's debts is limited to the value of the inherited assets. This prevents the heir's personal assets from being at risk if the estate's debts exceed its value.\n\n2. Preservation of rights: The heir maintains any rights or claims they had against the deceased, which would be lost in a pure and simple acceptance (Article 1023, 2\u00ba).\n\n3. Separation of assets: The heir's personal assets are not commingled with the inherited assets for legal purposes (Article 1023, 3\u00ba), providing further protection.\n\n4. Right to deliberate: Article 1010 allows the heir to request an inventory before deciding to accept or reject the inheritance, providing time to assess the estate's true financial situation.\n\n5. Flexibility: As per Article 1007, the heir can choose this option even if other heirs choose differently.\n\nOption A (pure and simple acceptance) is risky given the unknown liabilities and could expose the heir to personal liability beyond the estate's value (Article 1003). Option B (repudiation) might unnecessarily forfeit a potentially valuable inheritance. Option D is not legally valid, as partial acceptance is not provided for in the given articles.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple articles, application to a real-world scenario, and consideration of risk management principles, thus testing higher-level cognitive skills."}, "64": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15741/can-non-employees-ask-prohibited-questions-of-a-job-candidate", "docs_id": 15741, "title": "Can non-employees ask prohibited questions of a job candidate?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [This answer](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/81341/20300) on Academia gave rise to a legal question.\n\nSituation:\n\n* Academic employer is hiring for a position\n* As part of formal process of hiring they allow **students** (not employer's employees) to ask the candidate questions.\n* **Students** ask questions which \u2013 if asked by a real interviewer \u2013 would be in violation of protected status (gender, family status, pregnancy, etc.).\n\nDoes the fact that the question is asked by students (albeit ones participating in formal hiring process) protect the employer from being sued for hiring discrimination, the way they could be if an official interviewer employed by the employer asked the same question?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, there are separate regulations pertaining to different forms of discrimination for employment, thus there is no one\\-size answer.

Thus the question is lawful only if there is a legal underlying interest. Suppose the question were \"As a man, would you be able to able to effectively empathize with your nursing students?\": this does not serve a legally allowed purpose, and only serves to indirectly restate a sexually discriminatory premise. This [University of New Hampshire guidelines pages](https://www.unh.edu/hr/sites/unh.edu.hr/files/media/pdfs/conduct-interview-legally.pdf) summarizes the basic interview prohibitions succinctly.\n\nNotice that the language of the regulation is stated purely in terms of the existence of such an inquiry \u2013 it does not restrict such inquiries \"as made by the CEO\", or \"as made by the hiring committee\". It simply says that such an inquiry is not to exist.

As part of the process, they allow students to participate by asking questions to candidates.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The regulation (29 CFR 1604.7) states that any pre-employment inquiry that expresses directly or indirectly any limitation, specification, or discrimination as to sex is unlawful, unless based on a bona fide occupational qualification.\n\n2. The language of the regulation focuses on the existence of such inquiries, not on who specifically asks them.\n\n3. The question about family planning is clearly related to sex and is not a bona fide occupational qualification for an academic position.\n\n4. The documentation emphasizes that it is the university's obligation to ensure that all participants in pre-hiring interviews, including students, know what kinds of questions are legal versus illegal.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. The university could indeed be held liable for allowing a discriminatory pre-employment inquiry to occur during their formal hiring process, even if it was asked by a student. The fact that students were permitted to ask questions as part of the formal hiring process means the university has a responsibility to ensure all questions comply with employment law. \n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they mistakenly assume that the university's responsibility is limited to official employees. Option B is incorrect because liability isn't solely based on how the information is used, but also on allowing the discriminatory question to be asked in the first place.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. Federal law, specifically 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, does not prohibit discrimination based on religion in franchising contracts. As stated in the documentation, \"discrimination on the basis of religion in franchising contracts is not prohibited by federal law.\"\n\n2. However, the documentation also mentions that religious discrimination in franchising \"is prohibited by state law in some states.\" This means that while the policy may be legal under federal law, it could potentially violate state laws in certain jurisdictions.\n\n3. Option B is incorrect because the Civil Rights Act of 1964 primarily applies to employment discrimination and public accommodations, not franchising contracts.\n\n4. Option C is a common misconception addressed in the question. Private companies are not exempt from all anti-discrimination laws simply because they are privately owned.\n\n5.

This says that statehood doesn't depend on recognition by other states; it merely requires four things:\n\n* A defined territory\n* A permanent population\n* An effective government\n* The capacity to enter into relations with other states.\n\nYou immediately run into issues around the defined territory (you don't really have one) and the capacity to enter into relations with other states. But let's ignore those for a second. Meeting these requirements in some abstract world doesn't mean you get *treated* like a state. If no one else agrees with your claim to statehood and they act inconsistently with it, you have little recourse. You might get them not caring enough to do anything about it, but if they decide you're not a country you're out of luck.\n\nYou have some misconceptions about statehood as well. A country is allowed to forbid trade with any foreign country, even ones it recognizes as sovereign states. See: US embargo on Cuba. It is also entitled to deny foreign ships access to its ports. Ships flying the flag of a sovereign state are entitled to innocent passage through territorial waters of another state, but not to the use of that state's ports.\n\nA country can certainly allow people to be killed and still be a country. See: the US, which has the death penalty for certain crimes. But if you're killing nationals of a foreign country, that foreign country is likely to take a keen interest in your activities. If the killings are judicially\\-ordered executions based on violations of your penal laws, that's one thing \\-\\- Australia might consider it awful that an Australian citizen was shot by Indonesia for drug smuggling, but they recognize that Indonesia is a real country with its own laws that it has a right to apply. If it's just lawless there, the keen interest might culminate in a travel warning.

Option D is the correct answer because it most closely aligns with the Montevideo Convention criteria for statehood, which includes a defined territory, permanent population, effective government, and capacity to enter into relations with other states. Additionally, it addresses the practical aspect of defending the territory, which is crucial for maintaining de facto sovereignty.\n\nOption A fails to meet the requirement of a permanent physical population, which is essential for statehood. Option B, while innovative, does not address the fundamental requirements of statehood and would likely face significant legal challenges from existing space law frameworks. Option C focuses on a unique ethical stance but neglects the core requirements of statehood and overestimates the importance of UN membership in establishing sovereignty.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates an understanding that while meeting the technical criteria for statehood is important, practical recognition and the ability to defend one's claims are equally crucial in the international arena.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the documentation which states that the House can impeach the President for the \"high crime and misdemeanour\" of not doing their job.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Constitution does not give Congress the power to directly limit Presidential vacations.

The correct answer is C because the documentation clearly states that one of the criteria for registering a trademark is originality. Since the logo is based on an open-source design, it lacks the required originality for trademark registration, even with slight modifications.\n\nOption A is incorrect because being the first to use it commercially doesn't override the originality requirement. The logo's open-source origin means it has been used before, albeit not necessarily commercially.\n\nOption B goes too far; while the logo can't be registered, there's no legal requirement to abandon it entirely, especially given its open-source nature.\n\nOption D is a common misconception.

What matters is when it was *delivered*. The rebuttable presumption is that the notice is effective when it would have been \"delivered in the ordinary course of post\" (e.g. next day for first class, etc.). To rebut that, the burden of proof shifts to the recipient, who must prove (on balance of probabilities in a civil case) that it was delivered late or not at all. In practice that will be extremely difficult in the majority of cases.\n\nYou might try to make an argument that \"letter containing the document\" implies an envelope. However, in my view, the ordinary meaning of the word letter means a piece of paper with some written words on it.

The Act creates a rebuttable presumption that the document was delivered \"at the time at which the letter would be delivered in the ordinary course of post.\" This applies to standard first-class mail.\n\n3.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Stores have the right to refuse service to customers, as long as it's not based on protected characteristics (unlawful discrimination).\n2. The \"rude\" label is a statement of opinion, which is not grounds for defamation.\n3. The \"banned\" label is a statement of fact, but it's true based on the store's decision, so it's not defamatory.\n4. The lack of video evidence doesn't make the ban illegal; stores aren't required to have surveillance.\n5. Customers don't have a legal right to demand removal of a ban, even with an apology.\n\nOption A is incorrect because opinions (\"rude\") are not grounds for defamation.

To the contrary, it has adopted General Recommendations that clarify that the protections apply to particular groups of people without stating which of the listed categories they are best captured by. See [this Introductory Note](https://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cerd/cerd.html):\n\n> CERD has adopted General Recommendations to clarify that the ICERD protections in article 1 include groups not explicitly named but who fall within the Convention\u2019s broad criteria, such as women (G.R. 25\\), indigenous persons (G.R. 23\\), the Roma (G.R. 27\\), Dalits (G.R. 29\\), non\\-citizens including refugees (G.R. 30\\), African descendants, particularly those in the diaspora (G.R. 34\\), Muslims subjected to Islamophobia, and more generally persons whose religious identity has been \u201cracialized,\u201d that is used as a basis for discrimination (G.R. 32\\).\n\nIn fact, the use of the term \"race\" was and is a contested aspect of the convention, as revealed through the [*travaux pr\u00e9paratoires*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travaux_pr%C3%A9paratoires) (Patrick Thornberry, *The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial\nDiscrimination: A Commentary*, Oxford University Press, 2016\\). The UNESCO report, \"[The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000073351),\" was available to the drafters of the ICERD and it asserted that \"\\[t]here is no evidence for the existence of so\\-called 'pure' races.\" Some (e.g. Vieno Voitto Saario) were of the view that \"race,\" \"colour,\" and \"ethnic origin\" \"all meant much the same thing.\" It continues to be argued that CERD should \"repudiate the notion of race.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A country has implemented a policy that restricts access to higher education based on ancestral lineage, affecting a minority group that shares cultural practices but not necessarily physical characteristics with the majority population. Which of the following best represents how this policy would likely be interpreted under the ICERD?\n\nA) It would not be considered racial discrimination as it's based on descent rather than race or color\nB) It would be considered racial discrimination due to the convention's broad definition including descent and ethnic origin\nC) It would only be considered racial discrimination if the affected group also had distinct physical characteristics\nD) It would require a new General Recommendation from CERD to determine if it falls under the convention's purview\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the ICERD's principles in a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B because the ICERD's definition of racial discrimination, as stated in Article 1, explicitly includes \"descent\" and \"ethnic origin\" alongside race and color. The policy described in the question, while not based on physical characteristics (often associated with \"race\" in common parlance), still falls under the convention's broad criteria for racial discrimination.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misinterprets the scope of the convention, which goes beyond just race and color. Option C is a distractor that wrongly assumes physical characteristics are necessary for racial discrimination under ICERD. Option D is incorrect because, as the documentation states, CERD has already adopted General Recommendations clarifying that the protections apply to various groups without needing to specify which category they fall under.\n\nThis question tests the understanding that the ICERD takes a broad and inclusive approach to defining racial discrimination, encompassing various forms of discrimination that might not fit traditional notions of \"race.\" It also requires integrating knowledge about the convention's text, its interpretation by CERD, and the ongoing debates about the concept of race in international law."}, "74": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1762/3-day-notice-to-cure-breach-or-quit-over-a-dirty-bathtub", "docs_id": 1762, "title": "3 day notice to cure breach or quit over a dirty bathtub", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am very frustrated with my landlord.

During the trial, new evidence emerges that significantly strengthens the prosecution's case. The attorney believes a plea bargain would be in the client's best interest, but the client adamantly refuses. In a moment of frustration, the attorney announces to the court that his client wishes to change their plea to guilty. What are the most likely legal and ethical consequences of this action?\n\nA) The court will accept the plea change, as attorneys have implicit authority to make strategic decisions for their clients.\nB) The attorney will face disciplinary action for violating ethical rules, but the plea change will stand if it benefits the client.\nC) The court will reject the plea change, and the attorney will face severe ethical violations and possible disbarment.\nD) The client can sue the attorney for malpractice, but the plea change will be valid if the judge deems it in the interest of justice.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario tests the application of legal ethics and criminal procedure principles in a complex, real-world situation. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. According to Rule of Professional Conduct 1.2(a), an attorney must \"abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered.\" By unilaterally changing the plea against the client's explicit wishes, the attorney has committed a severe ethical violation.\n\n2. The court would reject the plea change because it lacks the client's consent. In the U.S. legal system, the decision to plead guilty is a fundamental right of the defendant that cannot be waived by counsel alone.\n\n3. This action would likely result in disciplinary proceedings against the attorney, potentially leading to disbarment due to the severity of the ethical breach.\n\nOption A is incorrect because attorneys do not have the authority to change pleas without client consent. Option B is wrong because the court would not accept an unauthorized plea change, regardless of potential benefits. Option D is incorrect because while the client could potentially sue for malpractice, the plea change would not be considered valid without the defendant's consent.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple concepts (legal ethics, criminal procedure, attorney-client relationship) and tests critical thinking about the application of these principles in a high-stakes scenario.

They *explicitly* apply *only* to defendants. For instance, the 5th Amendment says: \n\n> No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law...\n\nThe basic idea is that the public is best served by having a fair, impartial trials under law. As Paul Johnson notes in his excellent comment, the general presumption is that the state has much more power than defendants, and hence is more likely to pervert justice for its benefit. The \"fairness\" provisions aim to reduce the power imbalance by requiring the state to follow certain procedures, such as getting warrants, and so on. \n\n**Fairness and prosecutors**\n\nIt is bad when either side perverts justice. That is why even prosecutors have some ability to challenge trial procedures that seem biased in favor of defendants. Thus, prosecutors cannot generally ask for a change of venue, but they can object to particular jurors. The idea, again, is that given its resources, allowing the state to move a trial would hurt defendants. \n\nAs Paul Johnson notes, the analogy of impeachment to regular trials breaks down at this point. The Constitution imposes only a few bare\\-bones requirements on the impeachment process. This lack of structure, when combined with the Constitutional provision that each House can make its own rules, [makes it easier](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46730/in-the-trump-impeachment-process-what-is-the-legal-status-of-notes/46731#46731) for House and Senate to do things that would not be allowed in regular trials, such as delay bringing charges (which would violate the \"[speedy trial](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/sixth_amendment)\" clause), or seat admittedly \"[not\\-fair](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lindsey-graham-not-trying-to-pretend-to-be-a-fair-juror-here/2019/12/14/dcaad02c-1ea8-11ea-b4c1-fd0d91b60d9e_story.html)\" jurors. \n\n**What is fair?**\n\nThe obvious response to charges that the process is \"unfair,\" is to ask, \"Unfair by what standard?\" After, all the rules of impeachment are what they are. It is hard to see how using these rules to one's advantage is unfair. \n\nIt is important to remember, that as in regular trials, both sides are busy trying to put their spin on what is going on. If either side believes they will get more support by talking about \"basic fairness,\" that is how they will talk. But this spin should not hide the reality that the impeachment rules are what they are. As with any rules, whether some tricky manuever within the rules is fair depends on whose ox is being gored.

There's a whole new INDUSTRY around maintaining license compliance.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Large organizations face significant challenges in maintaining software license compliance, often subject to audits by major vendors.\n2. The company's decision is likely based on the need to maintain clear, auditable records of software installations across all company-owned devices.\n3.

Further, a clause that gives custody to the father by default is **also** Sittenwidrig in Germany, and thus void under [\u00a7138 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__138.html). So would be a clause that gives it to the mother by default by the way.\n\nIn a case of controversy, only a court order can assign guardianship. And only the court can take guardianship away. When the kid is born its guardianship gets assigned to the parents as guardians by [\u00a71626 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626.html). While it is possible to give your partner guardianship if you're not married under [1626a BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626a.html) it is **explicitly** impossible to assign guardianship for **any** compensation to either party (e.g. the mother or the new guardian may not receive anything other than the guardianship in the specific paper) under [1626b BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626b.html). Thus a contract that does anything else in addition to guardianship, like a prenup, voids at least the guardianship clauses. And you have to tell the court about that assignment of guardianship under ([$1626d BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1626d.html)). Now comes the kicker: [\u00a71628 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1628.html) forces the parents to apply to the court to solve any problems of huge impact, such as guardianship: So technically, mediation results are fully non\\-binding and you can not mandate it.\n\nAlso, since all marriages are through the state, it needs a formal instrument of the state to be dissolved. The only three ways that the state ever allowed this to be done after WW2 were a) annulment through a court, which only was possible till 1998, or b) divorce through a court, c) death of one of the marriage partners. Yes, it takes a judge to divorce a marriage under [$1313 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__1313.html) or one of the two married to die.\n\nBecause you can't divorce without a filing in court, a clause that demands to divorce in some way that is *not* including \u00a71313 BGB, that clause would be void.

So our Detroid salesman in Florida is violating the law on Price Gouging.\n\n### Non\\-emergency laws?\n\nOnly very few laws are not concerned with an emergency situation and thus more broad and general. The most likely broadest of them is [Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7445\\.903](https://law.justia.com/codes/michigan/2006/mcl-chap445/mcl-445-903.html) (z). It reads:\n\n> Charging the consumer a price that is grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold.\n\nHere, grossly in excess is the requirement, but also the similarity of the products. So, it does not take dissimilar products into account, especially not if the two items cost you very dissimilar to acquire them.\n\nTo take a less emergency example, let's say we have a shop. We sell two types of toilet paper: one is 1\\-ply and costs 10 cents a roll. The other is imported german, extra soft 4\\-ply with Aloe\\-Vera and vanilla smell and we demand 5 USD per roll. The price difference is harsh (50 times!) but the two products are not similar, and we can prove that the import paper did cost us something like 4 USD to get to our shop in the first place. Now, one day we just put the 5 USD label from our import paper onto the cheap one for whatever reason. Only now we grossly overprice our cheap toilet paper and violate that provision: we charge 50 times what the item's fair price is.\n\n#### [When goods don't *appear* dissimilar but are](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84656/alices-restaurant-profiteering-from-those-with-allergies)\n\nA baker might make a pie for 50 USD in basic fixed costs (tools, wages, electricity) to run the shop, and 25 cents per pie in ingredients if he bakes 100 of them. That's 75 USD for 100 pies in costs, or 75 cents a pie. He wants to sell them at 1 USD a piece, that's a 1/3rd markup and a somewhat normal price.\n\nThe same baker can also bake gluten\\-free pies. The ingredients cost him 50 cents a pie and the same basic fixed costs to make a batch. But he also has to clean the shop top to bottom for 3 hours before to get any gluten flour out of it, costing him another 100 USD in wages. He also only has a demand for 10 pies, so those pies cost him 160 USD per batch or 16 USD per pie. To make a profit, he sells them at 21,33 USD, which is again a 1/3rd markup. At first glance, a gluten\\-free pie might appear a *very* similar product, but it isn't even similar under the Michigan law, because manufacturing costs are disproportional higher for the market. Even *if* he could sell 100 pies and then made a 100 pie batch, he'd still pay 200 USD for 100 pies, and the *fair price* for a single pie from a 100\\-item batch would be 2,66 USD. But from the 10\\-item batch, it's 21,33 USD.\n\nBecause the two pies are so dissimilar in manufacturing prices, they can not be used as \"similar\" under Michigan law. You'd need to compare the price of another gluten\\-free pie that is baked in similarly small batches in a bakeshop that makes both normal and gluten\\-free products in the same workshop.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in Michigan operates two stores selling bottled water. Store A is located in a wealthy suburb, while Store B is in an economically disadvantaged area. During a heatwave, the owner increases the price of bottled water in Store A by 20% and in Store B by 200%. A consumer rights group accuses the owner of illegal profiteering. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The owner is guilty of price gouging in both stores, as any price increase during an emergency is illegal.\nB) The owner is only guilty of price gouging in Store B, as the price increase is grossly excessive compared to Store A.\nC) The owner is not guilty of price gouging in either store, as Michigan law doesn't specifically address non-emergency price increases.\nD) The owner may be guilty of price gouging in Store B, but would need to be compared against similar businesses in similar circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of Michigan's price gouging laws and their application in a real-world scenario. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Michigan's price gouging law (Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7445.903(z)) is one of the few that isn't restricted to emergency situations, making it potentially applicable here.\n\n2. The law prohibits \"charging the consumer a price that is grossly in excess of the price at which similar property or services are sold.\" This requires a comparison to similar businesses in similar circumstances, not just between the owner's two stores.\n\n3. The 200% increase in Store B might be considered \"grossly excessive,\" but this needs to be evaluated in the context of the local market and circumstances. The economically disadvantaged area might have different operating costs or market conditions that could justify a larger increase.\n\n4. The 20% increase in Store A is likely not considered price gouging, as it's a relatively modest increase that could be justified by increased demand or costs during a heatwave.\n\n5. To determine if price gouging occurred in Store B, investigators would need to compare the prices to those of similar stores in similar economically disadvantaged areas during the heatwave.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply legal concepts to a complex real-world scenario, considering multiple factors such as location, economic conditions, and the specific wording of the law.

Discuss using the examples above?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ticker symbols are too short to be protected by copyright (and the copyright would in any case belong to the exchange and not the company, since the exchange creates them). It is also not functional, so it could not have a utility patent, and is not secret, so it could not be a trade secret.\n\nSo far as I know, none of the ticket symbols are registered as trademarks under the Lanham Act (the federal trademark law in the United State). But, a company could argue that it acquired a common law trademark in its ticker symbol if it used the ticker symbol in association with the sale of goods or services.\n\nEven if it was a trademark, however, this would not prevent it from being used in the usual way that ticker symbols are used, as a nominative use identifying a company with an abbreviation of its legal name or of a trade name, rather than in a manner that conveys the impression that one is authorized to sell goods and services under the name of the company.\n\nIn the example posed, I don't think that you could determine whether there was an infringement of common law trademark rights in a vacuum.\n\nFirst, it would be necessary to determine if a particular ticker symbol had acquired a secondary meaning (i.e. an association with the company) in the relevant part of the general public. For example, \"A\" without some context identifying it as the ticker symbol for Agilent Technology, would obviously not be entitled to common law trademark protection.\n\nSecond, it would be necessary to examine the manner in which the ticker symbol was used.\n\nThe gravamen and gist of trademark infringement is that one misleads someone to think that you have an affiliation with a company in connection with a use of that trademark in commerce. If one is doing that, I could see a common law trademark infringement case prevailing.\n\nFor example, if one had an email that said \"I.Love.ABC@xyz.com\" and was selling goods competing with those produced by \"Americansource Bergen Corp\" to people who would otherwise have brought Americansource Bergen Corp's goods, I could easily see a common law trademark infringement action prevailing with the domain name suggesting that you were a licensed affiliate of Americansource Bergen Corp who was marketing its goods, rather than the company itself.\n\nOn the other hand, if one had an email that said \"I.Love.ABC@xyz.com\" and you were a neighbor or former employee of Americansource Bergen Corp or a family member of an employee or a customer, then there would be no basis for a common law trademark infringement action.\n\nAnd, there are some cases, such as the \"whathappened.EFX@xyz.com\" email for Equifax which on its face could almost never be construed as an attempt to mislead someone into thinking that you were authorized to sell goods or serves of Equifax.\n\nGenerally speaking, there is no such thing as a \"facial\" trademark infringement except perhaps when a trademark is placed directly on a good not manufactured or licensed by the trademark owner.

However, they are not required to investigate your complaint.\n\nIndependently from a complaint, you could consider suing Wordpress for compliance \u2013 Automattic has a subsidiary in Ireland so this might actually be feasible. I'm not quite sure though that Automattic is indeed the data controller for wordpress*.org*, as opposed to the .com domain \u2013 the privacy policy isn't quite GDPR compliant.\n\nWhile your GDPR Art 17 Right to Erasure might not apply in this case, there's a definite GDPR violation because the data controller failed to respond to your request within a month as per Art 12(4\\). That your posts on the bugtracker were deleted doesn't look like an issue in this context, what does matter is that they didn't respond to emails to the addresses mentioned in their privacy policy.\n\nWhether you have a right to erasure depends on the legal basis for storing your data. In general, you have a right to erasure if:\n\n* the data is no longer necessary;\n* processing is based on consent (because you can always withdraw consent); or\n* processing is based on a legitimate interest *and* they have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing despite your objection (Art 21\\).\n\nThe data is still necessary to identify you for your actions on the bugtracker, but depending on your particular situation you may be able to object successfully and force them to anonymize your posts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A user has been unsuccessfully trying to have their personal data removed from wordpress.org's bugtracker for over a year, citing GDPR compliance. Given the information provided, what is the most effective and legally appropriate next step for the user to take?\n\nA) Continue sending polite emails to various WordPress contacts\nB) File a lawsuit against Automattic in Ireland\nC) Lodge a complaint with the local data protection authority\nD) Create new accounts to post removal requests on the bugtracker\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the situation and application of GDPR principles. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The user has already attempted multiple times to contact WordPress directly without success, making option A unlikely to yield results.\n\n2. While option B (suing Automattic in Ireland) is mentioned as a possibility, it's not the most immediate or efficient step. Legal action should typically be a last resort after other avenues have been exhausted.\n\n3. Option C, lodging a complaint with the local data protection authority, is the most appropriate next step. The documentation specifically mentions this option and even provides a link to the relevant form for the Hamburg authority. This aligns with GDPR procedures for when a data controller fails to fulfill a user's rights.\n\n4. Option D is inappropriate and likely counterproductive, as the documentation states that previous attempts to use the bugtracker resulted in blocking and deletion.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex situation, understand the legal framework (GDPR), and determine the most effective course of action. It requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the user's previous attempts, the lack of response from WordPress, and the available legal recourses under GDPR.

I wonder whether the fact that the booster shot is not authorized by the CDC has any legal ramifications in the US.\n\nIs it legal to get a 3rd booster shot unauthorized by the CDC in the US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The CDC does not authorize shots or vaccine distribution. The FDA authorizes vaccine distribution, or distribution of medicines in general. A medicine is authorized for use in a certain way, which is an \"instruction\" directed at the medical professional. So\\-called \"off\\-label\" use is discussed by the FDA [here](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/understanding-unapproved-use-approved-drugs-label). Such use if legal, it simply stretches the limits of what the FDA was allowed to approve (e.g. was found to be safe and effective for X, was not similarly tested for Y). Patients are free to take whatever medicines they want if they can find them, and if they are not on the Controlled Substances list. Hence it's legal to take DMSO, but it's not legal to peddle it as a cancer cure.\n\nThe prescription regime for covid vaccinations seems to be somewhat relaxed, in that it is likely that many people get a vaccine without a (meaningful) doctor's exam, instead, you show up and get the shot. This is normal with flu shots. The upcoming 3rd shot approval is addressed to doctors, so they can then recommend third shots.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A local pharmacy is offering COVID-19 booster shots to individuals who have already received two doses, despite the CDC not yet recommending widespread use of boosters. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The pharmacy is breaking the law because the CDC has not authorized booster shots for general use.\nB) The pharmacy can legally offer booster shots, but patients receiving them may face legal consequences.\nC) The pharmacy can legally offer booster shots as off-label use, but may face increased liability risks.\nD) The pharmacy must wait for CDC recommendations before offering booster shots to avoid legal issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that the CDC does not authorize shots or vaccine distribution; this is the FDA's role.\n2. Off-label use of FDA-approved drugs is legal, as explained in the FDA link provided.\n3. Patients are free to take whatever medicines they want if they can obtain them legally.\n4. However, offering a medical treatment that hasn't been specifically recommended for widespread use could potentially increase liability risks for the pharmacy if adverse events occur.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it confuses CDC recommendations with FDA authorization. Option B is incorrect because patients are not breaking any laws by receiving available medications. Option D is incorrect because CDC recommendations are not legally binding for medication distribution; FDA approval is the key factor.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the roles of different health agencies, the concept of off-label use, and the legal implications of offering medical treatments beyond current recommendations, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation."}}
