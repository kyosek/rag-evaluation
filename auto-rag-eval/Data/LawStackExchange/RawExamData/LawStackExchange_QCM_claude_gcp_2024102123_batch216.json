Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the patient's legal obligation to pay?\n\nA) The patient has no legal obligation to pay since they didn't explicitly agree to the treatment or costs.\n\nB) The patient is only obligated to pay for the silver fillings, as those were covered by insurance.\n\nC) The patient is legally obligated to pay the full amount charged by the dentist, with no room for negotiation.\n\nD) The patient has an implicit agreement to pay, but the exact amount is subject to negotiation, especially given the lack of prior discussion about options and costs.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. By sitting in the chair and allowing the dentist to perform the procedure, the patient implicitly agreed to pay for the service. However, since the price and options were not discussed beforehand, the exact amount owed is subject to negotiation. The patient can use the lack of communication about different filling options and their costs as a point of leverage in discussing the final bill. The insurance coverage difference between white and silver fillings is a valid point to raise during this negotiation, but it doesn't negate the patient's obligation to pay for the service received.

The defining feature of an ex parte motion is that no notice is given to parties other than those making the motion.

The Foreign Affairs Manual notes that while international law and Supreme Court dicta might suggest non-citizen nationality for inhabitants of other territories, the INA's limited definition of \"outlying possessions\" means there is no current law defining the nationality of individuals born in these other territories who haven't acquired U.S. nationality by other means.

What it means is that this letter cannot be used as evidence of concessions made by you if you (or they) ultimately take legal action unless you both waive your without prejudice right. A document that simply asserts your rights and makes no concessions is not without prejudice even if it is marked as such. A mixed document can be without prejudice as to the concessions but still admissible as to the assertions.\n\nHowever, let's assume that you resolve your dispute along the lines you suggest: you provide a tractor and empties gratis and it all gets sorted out. The fact that there was an agreement and its terms is not and cannot be without prejudice.

Please stay on topic of the question. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such a lawsuit would be unsuccessful in the United States, given the numerous barriers imposed by the First Amendment.\n\n1. First, a plaintiff can only win a defamation case if it proves that the defamatory statement was false. If a statement cannot be proven false, it is legally considered a statement of opinion, which is protected by the First Amendment. [*Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.*, 497 U.S. 1, 19 (1990\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/497/1) (\"\\[A] statement on matters of public concern must be provable as false before there can be liability under state defamation law.\")\n2. Second, statements about public figures or matters of public concern can only be the basis of defamation liability if the plaintiff can prove \"actual malice,\" which means that the defendant either knew what he was saying was false or had a \"a high degree of awareness of . . . the probable falsity\" of his statements. [*Harte\\-Hanks Communs. v. Connaughton*, 491 U.S. 657 (1989\\).](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/491/657/)\n3. Even with actual malice regarding statements of fact, the defamatory statement is considered in context, not in isolation. So a newspaper headline that is incorrect would probably not result in liability if the full article was correct. And the question is not whether that statement of fact, considered in context, is literally false, but rather whether the \"sting\" or \"gist\" of the statement was false. [*Air Wisconsin Airlines Corp. v. Hoeper*, 571 U.S. 237, 247 (2014\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/12-315) (\"A statement is not considered false unless it would have a different effect on the mind of the reader from that which the pleaded truth would have produced.\").\n\nFor example, saying \"John shot his wife\" would probably not be defamatory if John shot at his wife and missed, or if he beat her unconscious with a gun, or even if he stabbed or poisoned her. John's reputation is damaged because he tried to kill his wife, not because of the precise way he did it.\n\nApplied to video\\-game manufacturers, these rules effectively kill a defamation action.\n\nFirst, they have to prove both (a) that it's possible to say whether video games cause mass shootings; and (b) that video games definitely don't cause mass shootings. That requirement probably kills the case already, because that research doesn't exist. Even if it did, the manufacturers would then need to prove actual malice, meaning either that the defendant knew about that research, or that the defendant knew that what they were saying was probably false.\n\nI don't know how anyone could prove all that, and even if they did, they'd still have questions about the \"sting\" and broader context of the statements, making this case a serious loser.\n\nWhile I doubt that video games are causing mass shootings, I also doubt that the people who say otherwise believe they are correct. Generally speaking, the First Amendment protects people who make mistakes. [*New York Times Co. v.

As explained in the provided information, to succeed in a defamation case, the plaintiff (the video game company) would need to prove that the statement is false, which is difficult given the lack of definitive research on the topic.

The OLC opinion could also probably be overridden by Congress in a law (that would probably have to overcome a Presidential veto), as the claim that the OLC decision is one that it is constitutionally required to arrive at is a weak one.\n* This does not preclude individuals or Congress from bringing suit against the President in a civil action, including a contempt of court proceeding in a civil action prosecuted by someone other than a federal government attorney.\n* This does not preclude Congress from impeaching the President and removing him from office.\n\nNonetheless, the Office of Legal Counsel opinion referred to by the Special Counsel certainly does significantly impair the extent to which a President can be punished for violating federal law as a practical matter.\n\n> This seems to directly contradict the \"no man is above the law\"\n>  principle outlined by the 14th amendment of the constitution.\n\nI'm not sure what makes you think that the 14th Amendment is relevant in this case.\n\nSection 1 of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution sets a minimum threshold for citizenship and sets for constitutional obligations that apply to U.S. states.\n\nSections 2\\-4 of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution govern issues particular to the Reconstruction era.\n\nSection 5 of the 14th Amendment gives Congress the authority to pass legislation enforcing the other sections.\n\nThere isn't really a \"no man is above the law\" concept expressly stated in the U.S. Constitution (in contrast, France has had such a provision since the French Revolution).

If they were illegal, **what are the potential legal consequences**? (We can ignore political consequences for this question)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Was International Law Violated?**\n\nWhen it used chemical weapons to kill large numbers of civilians in his own country, Assad's regime in Syria was violating its obligations under the [Chemical Weapons Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention), an international treaty obligation that [the regime acknowledged was binding upon it in 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention#Syrian_destruction) when at U.S. insistence and with Russian supervision, the Assad regime purported to destroy its chemical weapons stockpiles. \n\nIt was also an action violating generally recognized standards of the [customary international law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_international_law) of war that have been recognized since they were first clearly articulated in the [Geneva Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Protocol) of 1925 that took effect in 1928\\. This kind of action has also been recognized as a [crime against humanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity) under customary international law, and this principle is why international criminal tribunals set up after crimes against humanity occur are not considered to be applying *ex post facto* laws.\n\nAlso, since early on in the Syrian Civil War, during the Obama Administration, the U.S. ceased to recognize Assad's regime as the legitimate government of Syria. According to official U.S. policy, since 2012, the [Syrian National Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_Syrian_National_Council), and not Assad's regime, has been the legitimate government of Syria. So, rather than being an attack on a sovereign regime, this was an act in defense of a different sometimes allied regime recognized as legitimate, with whom the U.S. is not at war.\n\nMoreover, given that fact that the U.S. now has a artillery combat ground troop unit deployed in Northern Syria as of earlier in 2017, in support of a Congressionally authorized military action in the same theater of conflict, the U.S. has a legitimate interest in protecting its own troops, as well as those of allies it supports in the part of the conflict that it is involved in under the 2001 AUMF, from chemical weapons attacks in Syria by preemptively disabling the Assad regime's ability to deploy those weapons, even though they were not directed at somewhat nearby U.S. forces in their most recent utilization this week.\n\nSo, while there may not be entirely clear international legal authorization for this particular remedy for the Assad regime's clear violation of international law, there is not a clear prohibition on doing so either, and the general rule is that sovereign states have wide discretion to take military action in support of their perceived interests, particular when violations international obligations of the offender targeted for military action provide a justification for the use of military force under international law.\n\nThis is because the main way of punishing a violation of international war while a conflict is still pending is called a [reprisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprisal) which the Syrian strike fits to a tee. \n\n> A reprisal is a limited and deliberate violation of international law\n>  to punish another sovereign state that has already broken them. . . .\n>  Reprisals refer to acts which are illegal if taken alone, but become\n>  legal when adopted by one state in retaliation for the commission of\n>  an earlier illegal act by another state.\n\n[Article XII(3\\) of the Chemical Weapons Convention](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1997/04/19970429%2007-52%20PM/CTC-XXVI-3.pdf) authorizes those remedies allowed under customary international law of which reprisal is one.\n\n**Did The President Have Authority To Make The Strike Under U.S. Law?**\n\nThis said, the harder issue is whether this strike was legal under U.S. law, and not international law, which really has no meaningful binding enforcement mechanism other than politics, diplomacy and domestic law anyway.\n\nWhile the U.S. does not recognize the Assad regime as legitimate, it is not actually at war with that regime because the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) from 2001 that has been the main legal authorization for the \"war on terror\" against ISIS, pretty clear does not extend to Assad's regime in Syria. ISIS has been declared to be a successor to a branch of the organization the launched the 9\\-11 attack upon which the AUMF declared war. But, the formerly legitimate government of Syria (Assad's regime) is very difficult to treat as coming within that definition.\n\nHowever, while Congress has not authorized the use of military force by the U.S. against the Assad regime in Syria in this manner, Congress has approved appropriations to fund and support anti\\-Assad rebels, even though it may have been a bit of a fiasco, which at least provides some tacit evidence of Congressional consent to some sort of involvement in the Syrian civil war by the United States government against Assad's regime.\n\nIn absence of an authorization of use of military force against the Assad regime, one alternative source of legal authority to make this strike is legislation (whose constitutionality has often been questioned, but has never actually challenged, was determined by the Justice Department to be constitutional in 1980, and which is arguably not justiciable) called the [War Powers Act of 1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution). This Act, on its face, purports to give the President the authority to make limited use of military force for short periods of time. Specifically (per the link):\n\n> It provides that the U.S. President can send U.S. Armed Forces into\n>  action abroad only by declaration of war by Congress, \"statutory\n>  authorization,\" or in case of \"a national emergency created by attack\n>  upon the United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed\n>  forces.\"\n> \n> \n> The War Powers Resolution requires the President to notify Congress\n>  within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action and\n>  forbids armed forces from remaining for more than 60 days, with a\n>  further 30\\-day withdrawal period, without a Congressional\n>  authorization for use of military force (AUMF) or a declaration of war\n>  by the United States.\n\nThe question of whether this incident is within the scope of the War Powers Act is [disputed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution#Syrian_Military_Action_in_2017) with U.S. Senator Rand Paul arguing the conditions triggering its use such as an attack on U.S. forces or the United States, have not been met. The issues presented by this incident under the War Powers Act are similar to those presented in the missile strike and follow up airstrikes made by the U.S. [in Libya in 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution#Libya_intervention_in_2011).\n\nThere is also legitimate room for dispute regarding where the authority of the President as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces under [Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution](http://constitutionus.com/) ends, and where the power of Congress to declare war and to enact other legislation pertaining to the U.S. military under Article I, Section 8 of the United States Constitution begins.\n\nArguably, directing U.S. forces to make an isolated military strike from a location where they are already lawfully deployed in support of an AUMF authorized military mission in the region, in exigent circumstances, against a military force that is not recognized by the United States as the legitimate government of Syria, does not constitute a true act of war and is instead merely day to day management of the operations and discipline of the United States military that is within the Commander in Chief's authority, particularly when Congress has already tentatively recognized the Syria's Assad regime is an enemy of the United States in legislation short of an authorization for use of military force.\n\nMoreover, given that President Trump surely has majority support in both houses of Congress for this strike, the possibility that Congress may end up granting forgiveness rather than making much of the fact that he didn't ask for permission, may be mostly a formality in this case. \n\nGenerally speaking, even if this issue is justiciable (i.e. amenable to resolution through the court system), court action to enforce separation of powers questions must be authorized, at least, by a resolution of a majority of one of the two houses of Congress. Generally speaking, taxpayer standing or just plain U.S. citizen standing, does not exist to enjoin or seek a remedy from a separation of powers violation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status of the U.S. airstrikes on Syria in 2017?\n\nA) The airstrikes were clearly legal under both international law and U.S. domestic law, with full Congressional authorization.\n\nB) The airstrikes were illegal under international law but authorized under U.S. domestic law through the 2001 AUMF.\n\nC) The airstrikes were potentially justifiable under international law as a reprisal, but their legality under U.S. domestic law was disputed due to lack of explicit Congressional authorization.\n\nD) The airstrikes were clearly illegal under both international law and U.S. domestic law, with no possible justification.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The airstrikes could potentially be justified under international law as a reprisal against Syria's use of chemical weapons, which violated the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Of course, you can ask the bank (or more precisely, one of its officers) to sign such a contract. But I strongly suspect they won't.\n\nThe bank's standard deposit contract will have been drafted and carefully reviewed by their legal counsel. It would be irresponsible of the bank to agree to be bound to any additional contract, especially one that was drafted by a customer, without similarly having counsel review it. Given the hourly rate that the bank's lawyers likely get paid, the cost of this almost certainly will far exceed the value of having you as a customer (particularly as, by your own admission, you are intending to be a rather unprofitable customer). \n\nSo if you insist on them signing any contract of yours as a condition of you opening an account, I expect they will just politely suggest that you look for another bank to do business with.\n\nI think most people would instead handle this situation by just carefully reading the bank's standard deposit contract, and verifying, to the best of their ability, that it really does obligate the bank to pay out the bonus and let you close the account without further fee. Then, if the bank doesn't do so in the end, they might complain to the bank's management, or to the regulatory agency which oversees the bank. In an extreme case, they might consider suing the bank, but the amount of money at stake here is probably not enough to make it worth the time and expense of a lawsuit.\n\nThere may also be applicable laws in your jurisdiction that forbid the bank from charging a fee to close an account; but you haven't said what your jurisdiction is, so I can't address that.\n\nI personally wouldn't think it likely that there is any \"catch\" here. The bank is probably expecting that most people, once they have had the account open for six months, won't bother to close it. And now that they have a relationship with this bank, they may think of it in the future when they want a mortgage, CD, investment advice, etc. So the bank may not mind if a few customers take the bonus and leave after six months, since this will (they hope) be compensated by the larger number of customers who stick around.\n\nAll that said, if you really don't trust the bank, then perhaps you are better off not doing business with them at all.

It might well also be false advertising, implying that the performer had endorsed the station when s/he has not done so. That would depend on the specific laws of the jurisdiction where the broadcast was made.\n\nA suit over publicity rights or an action for false advertising would probably be simpler than a copyright suit in such a case.\n\nI think that most if not all such announcements are made with the consent of the performers involved, and are probably recorded directly by such performers. (For one thing it is usually in the performer's interest to cooperate with stations and networks that play the performer's work.)\n\nIf such announcements were somehow artificially synthesized, but with the permission of the performer, and of any owner of copyright in any recording used, I don't think there would be any legal problem.\n\nIf an AI was trained to create a good imitation of a person's voice with9ut diretly copying a recording, I am not at all sure if there would be any copyright infringemetn under current law. That may be an area where the law will need to change to respond to the technology. But if such an imitation were used **without permission** to make the kind of statements discussed above, the personality rights issue and false advertising issue would still be there. Those do not in any way depend on whether the announcement uses a copy of a recording or not, those are both about the use of someone's name and reputation without authorization.

I would like to know about the Lanham Act in practice.\n\nMy Question:\n\nAs the Lanham Act is applied today in civil cases, are there more cases where the issue is trademark violation? or are the more cases where the disputed issue has to do with misrepresentation and consumer fraud?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> As the Lanham Act is applied today in civil cases, are there more\n> cases where the issue is trademark violation? or are the more cases\n> where the disputed issue has to do with misrepresentation and consumer\n> fraud?\n\nThe Lanham Act is applied today in civil cases almost exclusively by commercial trademark owners to enforce claims of trademark infringement for trademarks approved to be listed in the primary trademark register by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and in disputes over trademark validity and ownership.\n\nThere are some isolated and narrow provisions of the Lanham Act involving misrepresentation and consumer fraud but these provisions make up a tiny percentage of all Lanham Act litigation. But many lawyers don't even know that these provisions exist. This lack of knowledge is mostly harmless, because other federal laws, and state statutes, usually provide better remedies (e.g. statutory damages) in consumer fraud cases.\n\n> Why should the government be involved with protecting the rights of\n> commercial trademarks?\n\nThis is just weird. Almost no one in modern private law jurisprudence would share that view today. It would be almost like wondering why the government should enforce contracts or property rights or should allow people to sue when injured in car accidents.\n\nMost modern legal scholars see trademarks as a form of intellectual property, and government protection of it as in accord with the general role of government to protect property rights in order to foster a healthy economy.\n\nThis isn't controversial in partisan sense either. Both pro\\-business Republican factions, and neoliberal Democratic party factions have strongly supported enforcement of commercial trademarks. The push to make other countries do so has been an unwavering part of U.S. foreign policy under both Republican and Democratic President administrations for decades.

Does a prohibition on recording in the syllabus trump this? Would the school have any case against me if I did record?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I wouldn't say that it \"trumps state law\". Indeed, the State of Georgia, either expressly by statute or through the common law, establishes that teachers and school administrators have the authority to create rules and regulations governing the conduct of students that are not themselves unconstitutional as applied to students, although, in general these consequences can't resort to criminal punishments.\n\nInstead, typical punishments include detention, suspension (in school or out of school), expulsion, and adjustment of grades for an assignment or a course. Marks in one's disciplinary record and public shaming, forfeiture of eligibility to participate in school sponsored extra\\-curricular activities or honors (including marching at graduation), refusing to release transcripts, and historically (but much less so in recent years) corporal punishments such as spanking, have been options for schools to enforce their punishments.\n\nA prohibition on recording in a syllabus certainly wouldn't result in criminal punishments, and probably wouldn't even give rise to civil liability. Depending upon the purpose for which the recording was being used, it is even conceivable that the school's right to punish someone for violating a school rule could be estopped by First Amendment and whistle blower protection law considerations (e.g. if it was used to document harassment and discriminatory conduct for use in sharing with the school board or law enforcement or publishing on radio or TV or an Internet news source).\n\nBut, the mere fact that conduct is legal outside a school setting does not mean that a school cannot prohibit and punish that conduct in its own rules.\n\nThe closer case, upon which there is more division of legal authority, is under what circumstances a school can legitimately punish conduct away from school, for example, uploading rap lyrics about a teacher to YouTube from home without using any school resources to do so."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A student in Georgia decides to record a lecture without the professor's permission, despite a clear prohibition against recording in the course syllabus.

While the school does have the authority to create and enforce rules, including prohibitions on recording, the consequences are typically limited to academic penalties such as detention, suspension, or grade adjustments. Criminal charges (option B) are not within the school's authority in this case.\n\nAlthough Georgia is a one-party consent state, this doesn't override the school's ability to set its own rules within its jurisdiction (eliminating option A). However, the fact that the recording was used to expose discriminatory behavior could invoke First Amendment and whistleblower protections, potentially limiting the severity of the consequences the school could impose.\n\nOption D is too absolute; while there may be some protections for the student's actions, it's not accurate to say they are fully protected with the school having no recourse whatsoever.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the interplay between state law, school regulations, and constitutional protections in an educational setting."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4230/can-a-traffic-citation-be-issued-solely-off-of-witness-account", "docs_id": 4230, "title": "Can a traffic citation be issued solely off of witness account?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In general, one driver reporting the plates of another is not likely to result in a citation being issued.

But what if multiple people call someone's plates in? I've read that officers are more likely to issue a citation in this case, but it seems there's an obvious exploitation. For example, a group of friends could conspire against a common enemy by all reporting their plates. Or let's say someone in a car with multiple people in it believes they have been cut off. Everyone in the car could then report the accused driver, getting him a ticket by default. Where is the line drawn and how possible are these scenarios to result in convictions?

In the circumstance that you describe the accused could just say the he was not driving his car at the time. If the prosecution is a sham with all your friends saying you all saw this thing, then the defendant can bring all of his friends to say that he was at some other place. The benefit to having a cop on the scene is that the cop will get ID and positive identification. \n\nThe other thing the cop has is expert judgment. If a cop sees unsafe lane movement and writes a ticket, his testimony in court carries more weight than the \"it was **not** unsafe!\" testimony of the accused. Keep in mind, getting all of your witnesses to court on the same day, after continuances and other delays, and getting them all to tell the same story to overcome the presumption of innocence is no small feat. \n\nAll that to say, it's easier with police as witness.\n\nThere are two mechanisms which could get you where you want to go. Private prosecution and citizen's arrest. \n\nPrivate prosecutions are a part of history but not strictly unavailable at the state level. You could write up some charging documents to see if you can get your target indicted. \n\nCitizen's arrest is interesting because the rules are fairly unclear unless governed by a specific statute. There are two necessary parts of citizens arrest and the first part gets the attention. \n\nThe first part is the detention (arrest). The crimes for which a citizen can legally detain a suspect are likely defined by state statute. The second part is giving testimony about the witnessed crime. Let's assume that you see a felony happen and watch the perp walk into a gas station bathroom. You are prepared to arrest, do part number one, and then call the cops, to do part number two. But while you wait for the guy to come out of the bathroom a cop walks up. You explain the felony and the cop goes into the bathroom and arrests the guy. It's purely witness testimony that led to the arrest and the indictment (physical evidence \\- let's say there is none) and even the trial. \n\nYou successfully get the guy indicted and when you show up to testify you tell the story as you witnessed it. Now the accused gets to take the stand. \n\nWhen he takes the stand he says, \"it was the other guy.\" When asked, \"what other guy?\" He says, \"I was in the bathroom and a guy ran in and went into the stall. Then a cop came in and arrested me.\"\n\nReasonable doubt right there. How much more if it's a bunch of friends ratting on some lone driver? Police need evidence. Prosecutors need evidence.

The accused could simply claim they weren't driving at the time, and it would be challenging for the prosecution to prove otherwise without police presence or additional evidence.

Instead, the rules require the aggrieved party to raise the issue privately and attempt to resolve it without court intervention. If that is unsuccessful, the court may issue an order compelling discovery. Rule 37 sanctions are generally only available if the offending party then fails to comply with that order.\n\nSeparate from Rule 37, though, the court also has inherent authority to impose sanctions for litigation misconduct, but you can usually expect it to limit itself to Rule 37 protocols.

That Act provides that, for extradition from England (as opposed to Scotland, etc.) to the United States (an example of a Category 2 Territory), an initial hearing is to take place before \"the appropriate judge\". This is, per [s.139(1\\)(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/41/section/139), a designated \"District Judge (Magistrates' Courts)\". A DJMC sits in a magistrates' court, and is a professional judge as opposed to a layperson like an ordinary Justice of the Peace. The hearing is meant to resemble summary proceedings in the magistrates' court, but it has its own special rules. Those include a special appeals procedure which is different from the ordinary way that criminal cases can be appealed. Some things that could normally happen in a magistrates' court cannot happen here, such as varying an order at a later date (see R (Mann) v Westminster Magistrates Court \\[2010] EWHC 48 (Admin)).\n\nThe way that this is phrased means that the jurisdiction is not conferred *on the magistrates' court* (which happens to have a DJ sitting in it), but *on the DJMC* themselves. The [Criminal Procedure Rules 2014, Rule 17\\.2(a)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1610) are careful to say that when they say \"magistrates' court\" in this context, they are talking about the court that the judge has convened for the purposes of the Extradition Act. These rules are only applicable because the Act specifically provides for them in its s.210; they don't come in automatically as they would for criminal proceedings in a magistrates' court, because this is a special process with its own law, as expounded in the Explanatory Notes to the rules.\n\nIn the Assange case, the DJMC was Vanessa Baraitser, including at Woolwich and the Old Bailey.

Only the particular expression of that information could be. This is the idea\u2013expression dichotomy.\n\nThe underlying data shown in a database is not protected by copyright, since that data is only an idea. You are therefore free to adapt a specific statistic (such as the typical annual salary for management in Arkansas being $75,061\\) to your own purposes.

Virginia*, [388 U.S. 1](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/388/1/) (1967\\), which held that bans on interracial marriage were unconstitutional.\n\nThe Article IV [privileges and immunities clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privileges_and_Immunities_Clause) protects very little (mostly the right to interstate travel and the right for an out of state resident to be licensed in a profession in a state).\n\nThe *Slaughterhouse cases*, [83 U.S. 36](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/83/36/) (1872\\), in the late 19th century gave a very crabbed interpretation to the 14th Amendment privileges and immunities clause, limited that only to rights arising from federal citizenship.\n\nThe logic of the *Slaughterhouse* line of cases spilled over into the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution. The Article IV privileges and immunities clause applies to rights specific to state citizenship to prevent those rights from being denied to out of state U.S. citizens.

This is a somewhat murky area of the law, but in many cases, a majority shareholder has a *fiduciary duty* to do what is best for the corporation as a whole (not just the majority shareholder, but all shareholders), an obligation that logically parallels the obligation of the board of directors (which controls a corporation with much the same effect as a majority shareholder). \n\nIn Delaware, where [most large corporations are incorporated](https://corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency/), a major shareholder or group of shareholders can have less than 50% of the vote can still be considered *de facto* majority shareholder if they have influence over the rest of the shareholders.

This avoids the constitutional restrictions on banning abortions.\n\nAnother controversial topic in the US is gun control. There are similar constitutional bars on laws that restrict the ownership of guns.\n\nCould a state pass a similar law to the Texas law to allow citizens to sue anyone who sells a gun, buys a gun, possesses a gun or similar?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's back up.\n\nIt's premature to say that SB 8 \"avoids the constitutional restrictions on banning abortions\". The constitutionality of SB 8 has not been resolved; the Supreme Court [said so explicitly](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/21a24_8759.pdf) (page 2\\). In fact there is good reason to think that is unconstitutional under existing interpretation of the Constitution per *Roe v. Wade* and the like. (Whether the court will actually follow existing interpretation is another question, of course.)\n\nBut the courts do not determine the constitutionality of laws just because someone asks them; they only do so when it needs to be decided to resolve a particular case. For instance, if a person is charged with a crime, they can challenge the constitutionality of the law under which they are charged, and courts will address that question unless the case is resolved some other way. There are also ways that a person who *wants* to violate the law can pre\\-emptively sue the government to prevent them from enforcing the law, if they can show such enforcement is likely to affect them.\n\nThe issue in SB 8 is that since it wouldn't be the government enforcing the law, it's unclear who an abortion provider can pre\\-emptively sue. In *Whole Woman's Health v. Jackson*, they tried to sue the State of Texas, its courts, and a private party who they thought might be likely to sue them. The SCOTUS majority found that none of those defendants were relevant. However, if and when an abortion provider actually does get sued, there'll be a clear case which has proper parties and is [ripe](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ripe), and courts then will have to consider whether SB 8 is constitutional or not.\n\nSo if your hypothetical gun control statute were treated similarly, the law might avoid pre\\-emptive challenges, with a chilling effect on gun sales. But sooner or later, someone would probably violate the law (maybe deliberately as a test case), and the courts would consider whether it was constitutional or not. Under prevailing interpretations of the Second Amendment, they'd probably find that it wasn't.\n\nA key difference, of course, is that abortions are much more time\\-sensitive than gun purchases; being temporarily blocked from having an abortion is much more consequential in most cases than being temporarily blocked from buying a gun.\n\nThe other subtext is that, although SCOTUS said their decision in *Whole Woman's Health* is not based on the constitutionality of SB 8, it's widely suspected that several of the justices are not all that keen on the constitutional right to abortion found in Roe v. Wade, and might look to overturn Roe when it comes up. As such, they may not be very motivated to look for procedural avenues to block SB 8 in the short term, since they might be inclined to uphold it in the long term. The dissenters in *Whole Woman's Health* certainly thought those avenues were available. But in the case of your hypothetical gun control bill, if a majority of justices were pretty convinced that the law was unconstitutional, they might try harder to come up with grounds to block it pre\\-emptively."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the current status and potential implications of Texas Senate Bill 8 (SB 8) regarding abortion restrictions?\n\nA) SB 8 has been definitively ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court, setting a precedent for similar laws in other controversial areas like gun control.\n\nB) The constitutionality of SB 8 remains unresolved, but its enforcement mechanism may temporarily avoid pre-emptive legal challenges, potentially inspiring similar approaches in other contentious policy areas.\n\nC) SB 8 has been struck down as unconstitutional, demonstrating that such enforcement mechanisms cannot circumvent established constitutional rights.\n\nD) The Supreme Court has ruled that SB 8's approach is only applicable to abortion-related laws and cannot be used for other issues like gun control.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the current status of SB 8 and its potential implications. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of SB 8, explicitly stating that this issue remains unresolved. The law's unique enforcement mechanism, which allows private citizens to sue rather than relying on government enforcement, has made it difficult to challenge pre-emptively. This approach could potentially be applied to other controversial areas, such as gun control, although the effectiveness and ultimate constitutionality of such laws would likely be challenged in court eventually. The other options are incorrect because they either misstate the current legal status of SB 8 or make overly broad claims about its applicability or limitations that are not supported by the information provided."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/554/explain-the-concept-of-filing-a-claim-on-behalf-of-the-government", "docs_id": 554, "title": "Explain the concept of &quot;filing a claim on behalf of the government&quot;", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: An [article on Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703467004575463843289453872) stated that for false patent marking and whistle\\-blower laws:\n\n> ...**Anyone can file a claim on behalf of the government**, and plaintiffs must split any fine award evenly with it...\n\nHow does \"filing a claim on behalf of the government\" *work*? What is it exactly, how does it contrast with the [principle of privity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privity#Contract_law), and how is it **applied**?\n\nAlso, is the concept of \"filing a claim on behalf of the government\" unique to the United States, or are there other countries that have such laws and procedures?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is called a [*qui tam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam) action. It's a concept that's been around a long time in the English legal system (predating the US), to encourage people to help the government enforce its laws. The more contemporary system is to give private parties the right to sue on their own behalf for some wrong (known as a \"private attorney general\" system), which is how things like civil rights claims tend to work; the difference with qui tam is that the government *is* the plaintiff ([source](http://www.jstor.org/stable/796589?seq=9#page_scan_tab_contents))\n\nIt's possible when the law says that a claim under some section may be filed by a private person on behalf of the government; at the time the article was written, the false marking statute ([35 USC 292](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35/292)) stated that \"Any person may sue for the penalty, in which event one\\-half shall go to the person suing and the other to the use of the United States.\" In a qui tam action, the government *is* the plaintiff; it's just that instead of a public attorney handling the case, it's handled by a private party. \n\nThere were three active qui tam statutes in US federal law as of 2009 (source: [CRS](https://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40786.pdf)): the False Claims Act ([31 USC 3730](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/3730)), the patent marking claim, and an Indian protection statute ([25 USC 201](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/201)). The patent marking qui tam provision has been repealed, leaving just the two. For the Indian protection statute, I can't find any reference to any special procedure; for the False Claims Act, there is a special procedure included in the law.\n\nIn the False Claims Act, when an action is submitted, the government is notified and the complaint kept sealed for 60 days while the US government decides what to do. If the government wants to take over the case itself, it can do that; if it wants the private party to run the case, it can do that too; if it wants to dismiss or settle the case it can do that as well. It can also ask for the time to be extended, or for discovery to be delayed to gather evidence or prosecute a separate criminal or civil case. If the government lets the private party run the case, they can still intervene later if they have a good reason.\n\nAfter the case finishes, the private party gets 15\\-25% of the judgment or settlement (if the government took over the case) or 25\\-30% (if the private party ran the case), plus attorney fees. If the facts the case was brought under were publicly known when it was filed, the amount shrinks to 0\\-10% if the person supplied information to the government that wasn't publicly known when it was supplied, and the case is dismissed if the person just learned about it from public sources.\n\nFor the false marking statute, a district court actually [found it unconstitutional](http://ia700409.us.archive.org/4/items/gov.uscourts.ohnd.168384/gov.uscourts.ohnd.168384.18.0.pdf) in part *because* of the lack of the extensive procedure found in the False Claims Act. There, the procedure was just to file the case like normal; the clerk had to tell the Patent Office that a claim had been filed within a month, but one issue was that a settlement could have happened in that time and bound the government. It's possible higher courts would have ruled had that section not been repealed later that year.\n\nAs for other countries, the idea came to the US from England, but the [Common Informers Act 1951](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/14-15/39) eliminated it there. However, private prosecutions (which *do* exist in England) are similar in that the case is on behalf of the Crown, but handled by a private party; they're different in that the private party doesn't get any part of the judgment. While it's hard to prove a negative, I can't find any evidence of qui tam provisions outside the US."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about qui tam actions in the United States is NOT correct?\n\nA) Qui tam actions allow private individuals to file lawsuits on behalf of the government and potentially receive a portion of any damages awarded.\n\nB) The False Claims Act includes a provision for qui tam actions and outlines a specific procedure for how these cases should be handled.\n\nC) As of 2023, there are still three active qui tam statutes in US federal law: the False Claims Act, the patent marking claim, and an Indian protection statute.\n\nD) The concept of qui tam actions originated in England but was eliminated there by the Common Informers Act 1951.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is correct: Qui tam actions do allow private individuals to file lawsuits on behalf of the government and potentially receive a portion of the damages.\n\nB is correct: The False Claims Act does include specific procedures for qui tam actions, including government notification and decision-making processes.\n\nC is incorrect: As of 2023, there are only two active qui tam statutes in US federal law.

In particular BGB \u00a7 862 appears to allow for both money damages and prospective injunctive relief to prevent future violations.\n\nI've looked around quite a bit and have not located any statute other than \u00a7 123 of the Germany Criminal Code that applies (incidentally, it is a section of the German Criminal Code for which [private criminal prosecutions are authorized](https://www.fh-kiel.de/fileadmin/data/sug/pdf-Dokument/Nahrwold/Legal_protection_of_victims_in_Germany.pdf)), although the law prohibiting poaching could prevent hunting on private lands without permission. And, the translation of that section as burglary, rather than trespassing, is really a poor translation choice because in American and English legal language, burglary is trespassing with an intent to commit some other crime, while a violation of \u00a7 123 does not require such a showing. I wonder, however, if \"enclosed\" may be a term of art that could include a sign that says \"stay out\".\n\nIt could be that trespassing in open spaces might have been encompassed within the [former section 361 of the German Criminal Code](http://www.housingrightswatch.org/sites/default/files/2012-12-11_RPT_GERMANY_anti_soc_laws_en.pdf), which criminalized vagrancy and begging as misdemeanors under threat of a fine of up to 500 German Marks or up to six weeks\u2019 imprisonment. It was abolished in 1974\\.\n\nSome conduct that would be barred by criminal trespassing laws in the U.S. would be barred by the [Ordnungswidrigkeitengesetz](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_owig/englisch_owig.html#p0702) (Regulatory Offenses Act) such as \u00a7 113 (failure to disperse from an unlawful gathering), \u00a7 114 (trespassing on military property), \u00a7 117 (noise violations) and \u00a7 118 (public nuisance), or a local police bylaw which would be offenses roughly comparable to municipal ordinance violations in the U.S. and might ban, for example, sleeping in a public park. \n\nBut, none of those offenses correspond to simple trespassing in Anglo\\-American law and it appears that the default rule is that entering onto an open meadow or forest or unenclosed space that is owned by another, by itself, is not a crime in Germany. Given that many Germanic language speaking countries and other countries in the region recognize a \"[freedom to roam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam)\", this may well be an intended result.
