This was about 50 years ago. While all other land was sold off with the houses, this patch of land remained to be owned by the company that build the houses.\n\nAbout 30 years ago the owners dissolved the company. Land registry lists the dissolved company still as the owner, and the owners of the company can no longer be found.\n\nWhat happens to the ownership of this land? Will it now forever be owned by a no longer existing entity or can an official entity (like the local council) step in and take ownership?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the general case, when a company is dissolved any assets still belonging to it becomes *bona vacantia* under [Section 1012 of the Companies Act 2006](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1012) which means that it belongs to the Crown.\n\nThe Crown can then choose to disclaim its rights to the asset under [Section 1013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1013), and typically will do this where there are risks involved (e.g. leasehold land). The effect of dislaimer, per Sections [1014](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1014) and [1015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/section/1015) is that the \"*property is deemed not to have vested in the Crown*\" and it terminates \"*the rights, interests and liabilities of the company in or in respect of the property disclaimed*\".\n\nIn the case of freehold land that is disclaimed, it [escheats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escheat) (transfers) to the [Crown Estate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate) and the freehold interest is extinguished.

The Crown may choose to disclaim its rights to the asset, but even in this case, freehold land would escheat (transfer) to the Crown Estate. The Crown Estate then becomes entitled (but not obliged) to take possession of it. While the Land Registry may still list the dissolved company as the owner, the actual ownership would have passed to the Crown upon the company's dissolution. The local council doesn't automatically gain ownership (eliminating option B), the dissolved company can't continue to own it (eliminating option A), and it doesn't become public property for free use (eliminating option D)."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59600/are-german-police-allowed-to-ask-about-private-contact-information", "docs_id": 59600, "title": "Are German Police allowed to ask about private contact information?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is based on a story that happened a couple of days ago.\n\nTwo friends and I were walking outside. Right now, in Germany there are strict regulations about the number of persons and households that are allowed to meet together. So, as we were seen from a police car passing by, the car stopped and two officers went towards us.\n\nOne of us, a friend who didn't want any contact with the police, instantly ran away, which was seen by the officers. They didn't try to chase him. They then stopped us and started to ask questions about the friend who escaped. Seems like the fact of us gathering wasn't a problem at all, compared to the fact that one person escaped from them.\n\nWe told that we were just hanging around as friends, after which the officers asked if we could call our buddy and ask why he ran away and if he could get back. We told that his phone is dead, after which we should prove it to the police by calling him. After a failed call, police asked us to provide them the contact information, which we obviously had, because we tried to call him.\n\nWe were let go after police got our IDs but it just doesn't feel right that they tricked us to get the phone number of our friend who escaped. I understand that it was our own fault, that we responded to the question if we could call him, but could we just refuse to call him or answer any of their questions in that situation?\n\nWere the officers even allowed to ask if we could call him or to ask us to show our phones to them, so they could get the contact information?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From the German lawyer association (\"Deutscher Anwaltverein\") one can find the [following](https://anwaltauskunft.de/magazin/gesellschaft/strafrecht-polizei/was-darf-die-polizei-bei-einer-personenkontrolle?full=1) (Google\\-translation):\n\n> In the case of a purely preventive identity check, the officers are initially only allowed to determine the identity of the respondent. This means that you can ask for your name, date and place of birth, home address and nationality and have your ID shown \\- by the way, as a German citizen you don't have to always have your ID with you.\n\n> \"You don't have to answer any questions beyond that,\" says lawyer Robert Hotstegs from the German Lawyers' Association (DAV). Of course, police officers often try to gather more information with emphatically casual questions. \"Well, where do we come from\" or: \"And where are we going now?\" Are typical examples. The police are not allowed to insist on an answer. Anyone who, as a respondent, is voluntarily too willing to provide information can harm themselves and possibly even give rise to concrete suspicions.\n\nSo they are allowed to ask such things, but you don't need to answer everything.\n\nHow to handle such situations, again according to the link above:\n\n> \u201cI recommend answering the survey as briefly and politely as possible. This has a de\\-escalating effect and helps to end the unpleasant situation as quickly as possible, \u201dsays Attorney Hotstegs.\n\n> However, you should always answer the questions about yourself.

Using a product or good you actually own that looks to an outsider's eyes just like one in the store, but which you've marked in a discreet place so you are assured you don't accidentally actually take the one that isn't yours, and using your magician skills, you make it look like you were pocketing the wares when you actually didn't.

Prior to obtaining the consent of a personal data owner for the collection and utilization of their data, a data controller must inform the personal data owner of its retention period for the personal data. A data controller also is required to cease all processing of personal data once the retention period has lapsed.\n> \n> \n> Despite the above provisions, the PDP Draft Law is silent on how long a retention period should be. Lawmakers in the House have expressed concern that there will be no legal certainty if the duration of the retention period is not stipulated in the PDP Draft Law, resulting in a hodgepodge of retention period policies among companies. With input from lawmakers, the government may decide to stipulate a specific data retention period in the new law, although as far as we are aware the House has not suggested how long the retention period should be.\n\nThe term PDP Draft Law brought me further to [lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=ad6c624f-975c-4ad0-ae87-78be636fb823), further detailing the proposed law.

While there is a 5-year retention period mentioned for some types of personal data, IP addresses fall under the category of CDR and are subject to the 3-month minimum retention requirement.

It seems to be not unlike the GDPR or CCPA, althoguh different in detail. It requires consent for the collection and retention of personal information, requires that collection not be excessive, and requires that individuals be able to see what information a company holds about that person, and in many cases have it deleted.\n\nSpecifically, Rule 5 (1\\) provides that:\n\n> Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall obtain consent in writing through letter or Fax or email from the provider of the sensitive personal data or information regarding purpose of usage before collection of such information.\n\n(A \"body corporate\" appears to be simply a company or business firm.)\n\n\"sensitive personal data\" is defined in rule 3 to be any of a list of nine kinds of information, of which the first is a password.\n\nRule 5 (7\\) provides that:\n\n> Body corporate or any person on its behalf shall, prior to the collection of information including sensitive personal data or information, provide an option to the provider of the information to not to provide the data or information sought to be collected. The provider of information shall, at any time while availing the services or otherwise, also have an option to withdraw its consent given earlier to the body corporate. Such withdrawal of the consent shall be sent in writing to the body corporate.\n\nIt is not clear to me whether \"letter or Fax or email from the provider\" \\[from the information provider (aka the Data Subject)] could include a message automatically sent when a person using a web site clicks a button clearly indicating consent to collection of such information. It certainly does not require a letter mailed in the post. The provisions of sub\\-rule (7\\) clearly contemplate collection of information online as long as there is active consent and an option to withdraw consent.\n\nI find it hard to imagine that a separate, manual, communication mu8st be sent in advance under rule 5 (1\\), and that does not seem to be how this rule has been enforced over the past 10 years.

For example:\n\n* \u00a7 51 UrhG: publication of citations is legal, if the amount of cited material is justified by the specific context. In particular, including citations is justified in academic works that discuss the cited work.\n* \u00a7 53 Abs 1 UrhG: private copies are allowed, as long as the original was acquired in a manner that was not obviously illegal, and as long as the copy is not used directly or indirectly for commercial purposes. See the German Wikipedia Article [*Privatkopie*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie) for context. Limitation: entire books may only be duplicated by manual transcription.\n* \u00a7 53 Abs 2 UrhG: analogue (non\\-digital) copies for personal purposes are allowed in some additional circumstances.\n* And some specific exceptions for schools, teaching, research, and data mining.\n\nWhat does this mean for taking notes?\n\n* Notes that capture your own thoughts, or a summary of the copyrighted material in your own words, are not derivatives in the sense of copyright. (However, German copyright law doesn't have a 1:1 equivalent to the term \u201cderivative\u201d. Instead, \u201cadaptation\u201d might be a better fit for the German *Bearbeitung*.)\n* If these notes are purely personal, you can likely copy parts of the book into your notes. For example, this might cover a diary in which you write down poems that you like.\n* Quotes/citations can be allowed when necessary to discuss the book in your notes. Remember to clearly cite the source.\n\nPersonally, I keep extensive notes in digital form, for personal and for work purposes, and make extensive use of my right to cite parts of others' works, as necessary for discussion my notes. I generally keep those citations down to a level so that my notes could be published without copyright concerns, even if quoting longer passages could be allowed as an \u00a7 53 private copy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, a student is writing a research paper and wants to include excerpts from a book in their notes.

Would this list be on the web somewhere?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I conclude (contrary to an earlier expression) that there is no such list, nor can there be, because the term \"officer\" is not well enough defined.\n\nThe inferior officers are those officers who are not principal officers (as specified in the Constitution, e.g. ambassadors, cabinet members, judges), since there are only two kinds of officers. There is no constitutional or statutory definition of \"Officer of the United States\", so we have to figure it out from case law. As noted in [Morrison v. Olson](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/487/654/case.html) 487 U.S. 654\n\n> The line between \"inferior\" and \"principal\" officers is one that is\n>  far from clear, and the Framers provided little guidance into where it\n>  should be drawn.\n\nOfficers of the US cannot be appointed by Congress ([Buckley v.

That court also said that\n\n> We think that the term \"Officers of the United States,\" as used in\n>  Art. II, defined to include \"all persons who can be said to hold an\n>  office under the government\" in United States v. Germaine, supra, is a\n>  term intended to have substantive meaning. We think its fair import is\n>  that *any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the\n>  laws of the United States is an \"Officer of the United States,*\" and\n>  must, therefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by \u00a7 2, cl. 2,\n>  of that Article.\n\nTo take a specific example, \"special trial judges\", authorized in [26 USC 7443a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7443A) are an example of an officer. We know they are officers, because [Freytag v. Commissioner](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/501/868/case.html) 501 U.S. 868 says so (since they read Buckley):\n\n> A special trial judge is an \"inferior Office\\[r]\" whose appointment\n>  must conform to the Appointments Clause. Such a judge acts as an\n>  inferior officer who exercises independent authority in cases governed\n>  by subsections (b)(1\\), (2\\), and (3\\). The fact that in subsection\n>  (b)(4\\) cases he performs duties that may be performed by an employee\n>  not subject to the Appointments Clause does not transform his status.\n\nThe Dept. of Justice offers [an analysis](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/attachments/2015/05/29/op-olc-v031-p0083.pdf) of \"Officer of the United States\". The main elements in their opinion are that the position must possess delegated sovereign authority of the Federal government, and the position must be continuing. There are other criteria possibly applicable (things that were invokes at some time) including method of appointment, having been established by law, taking an oath of office, an emolument (not a volunteer), and receiving a commission. Still, Congress authorizes (by law) the hiring of federal employees, and not all employees are \"officers\".\n\nAn earlier memorandum on the topic is [here](https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/1996/05/31/op-olc-v020-p0124_0.pdf). Footnote 54 notes that \n\n> It is at least arguable, however, that the authority \n>  exercised by second lieutenants and ensigns is so limited and\n>  subordinate that their analogues in the civil sphere clearly \n>  would be employees.\n\nWarrant officers and non\\-commisioned officers would likewise have quite limited authority.\n\nSince the definition of \"Officer of the United States\" is up for grabs, there can't be a complete list of inferior officers, especially if all military officers are included. There is a long list of civilian officers under the executive branch published in [United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government_Policy_and_Supporting_Positions), after each presidential election. The so\\-called Plum Book is [on a government web page here](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2012.pdf) in the 2012 version, and [here](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016/pdf/GPO-PLUMBOOK-2016.pdf) for 2016\\.

Whenever any roadway\nhas been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for  traffic  the\nfollowing  rules  in  addition  to  all others consistent herewith shall\napply:\n  (a) A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within\na single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has\nfirst ascertained that such movement can be made with safety.\n\n```\n\n(b and c are not relevant)\n\n```\n   (d)  When  official markings are in place indicating those portions of\nany roadway where crossing such markings would be especially  hazardous,\nno  driver  of a vehicle proceeding along such highway shall at any time\ndrive across such markings.\n\n```\n\nThe last bit, (d), is of interest. Basically, you are allowed to change into the correct lane as long as the pavement markings permit it. The pavement markings at an intersection with a sign like the one you posted are generally solid white lines. These details are governed by the [Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ser-pubs.htm), published by the Federal Highway Administration. Their information on pavement markings is available both in PDF and [HTML format](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/services/publications/fhwaop02090/index.htm). Pertinently, it says:\n\n> A double white line indicates that lane changes are prohibited. A single white line indicates that lane changes are discouraged. A dashed white line indicates that lane changes are allowed.\n\nTherefore, if the lines separating the lanes are, as usual, solid white lines, you are encouraged to get into the correct lane before the beginning of the solid white line, but you are permitted to change lanes across the solid lines. An example of such marking is in the right\\-hand example in the given image:\n\n[![Intersection marking examples from the US Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KZRT.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1KZRT.gif)\n\nOne point of possible contention is that the [New York State Driver's Manual](http://dmv.ny.gov/about-dmv/chapter-4-traffic-control-2#pav-mar) describes the meaning of the solid white line somewhat differently:\n\n> **One solid line:** You can pass other vehicles or change lanes, but you can only do so when obstructions in the road or traffic conditions make it necessary.\n\nI don't see any statutory basis for that description, but I may well have overlooked something.\n\nI suppose you know where the signs are specified, since you probably got the image from there, but for anyone reading this who does not know, they are specified in the publication [Standard Highway Signs](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ser-shs_millennium_eng.htm). This is available as a set of PDF files; the relevant file is the one containing [regulatory signs](http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/SHSe/Regulatory.pdf); the sign in the question is 1\\-33, and it is in the midst of several similar signs.\n\nIf a police officer ticketed you for getting into the lane too late, I suppose you should find a lawyer who specializes in fighting traffic tickets, and ask whether there really is such a thing as \"too late.\" By my reading of the law, there isn't. (Of course, if it's dangerous to change lanes because of other vehicles, you shouldn't change lanes, but if you had, I would suppose the officer should have written a ticket for some other violation, like reckless driving.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In New York City, when approaching an intersection with lanes marked \"straight only\" and \"right/left turn only\", which of the following statements is most accurate regarding lane changes?\n\nA) It is illegal to change lanes once the solid white lines begin before the intersection.\n\nB) Lane changes are permitted across solid white lines, but discouraged once they begin.\n\nC) The latest point to change lanes is determined by the beginning of the arrow markings on the pavement.\n\nD) Lane changes are only allowed when obstructions or traffic conditions make it absolutely necessary.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, a single solid white line indicates that lane changes are discouraged, but not prohibited. The New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law doesn't specify a precise point beyond which lane changes become illegal. While the New York State Driver's Manual suggests more restrictive conditions for crossing solid white lines, this doesn't appear to have a clear statutory basis. The correct answer reflects the federal guidelines which allow lane changes across solid white lines, though drivers are encouraged to make their lane choice earlier. Options A and C are incorrect as they imply strict cut-off points which aren't supported by the law. Option D, while mentioned in the NY Driver's Manual, is not consistent with the federal guidelines or the state law as described."}, "10": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79803/is-blocking-users-to-take-phone-backups-on-external-harddrive-by-apple-not-unlaw", "docs_id": 79803, "title": "Is blocking users to take phone backups on external harddrive by Apple not unlawful?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Over the past few weeks I am having some hard time restoring my backups from external harddrive after my iphone got bricked.\n\nI am using a new iPhone 12 Pro with 512gb space and I keep backing up my phone on external harddrive (since these phone comes with huge space \\- I have not enough space on my MacBook Pro to hold that much data).

Apple provides two \"guaranteed\" methods for backing up iPhones: using iTunes on a Mac (or possibly Windows) and using iCloud.

What is the nature of obligation at international law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Austin's view: the command theory of law\u2014rules of a superior sovereign backed by force\n\nThe idea that law exists only if the rules are those of a superior sovereign and backed by force is an outdated conception whose most prominant proponent was [John Austin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Austin_(legal_philosopher)). This is known as the \"command\" theory of law. This clearly cannot explain obligation at international law. But nor can it explain many of the rules in domestic legal systems that we have no problem conceiving of as law (e.g. the law\\-making process itself, the system of adjudication, rules that confer power, etc.).\n\n### Modern views: internal sense of obligation\n\nThe command theory of law has largely been supplanted by other theories of obligation such as that of [H.L.A. Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._A._Hart). In this view, law does not require rules to be backed by threats of force, or to be imposed by a superior sovereign. Law can exist and sustain itself purely through a group's internal point of view: do the participants (states, in the case of international law) \"*use* the rules as standards for the appraisal of their own and others' behaviour\" and do they see them as imposing obligations?\n\nThis focus on the internal viewpoint is actually part of the test for recognizing a norm as customary international law. For something to be customary international law, it must be accomanied by *opinio juris*. This is a \"'psychological' element'\" (John H. Currie, *Public International Law*, p. 195\\). States need to behave as if a rule has legal obligation. International judicial bodies will look to evidence about how states explain their motives, including how they explain deviations from the rule.\n\nH.L.A. Hart explicitly noted the common question, \"How can international law be binding?\" (*The Concept of Law*, \"Chapter X: International Law\"). His answer:\n\n> there is something very confusing in this favourite form of question; and before we can deal with it we must face a prior question to which the answer is by no means clear. This prior question is: what is meant by saying of a whole system of law that it is 'binding'? The statement that a particular rule of a system is binding on a particular person is one familiar to lawyers and tolerably clear in meaning. We may paraphrase it by the assertion that the rule in question is a valid rule, and under it the person in question *has some obligation or duty*.\n\nHe recognizes that \"one source of doubt on this point is simply the absense from the system of centrally organized sanctions.\" But for all the reasons that this is not the criteria of what makes law law or creates the internal view of obligation, even in domestic systems, this fact does not undercut international law's status as law.\n\nHe describes nation states' expressed attitude towards the rules of international law:\n\n> Yet what these rules require is thought and spoken of as obligatory; there is general pressure for conformity to the rules; claims and admissions are based on them and their breach is held to justify not only insistent demands for compensation, but reprisals and counter\\-measures. When the rules are disregarded, *it is not on the footing that they are not binding; instead efforts are made to conceal the facts*.\n\n### In what sense is international law binding?\n\nWhen one makes the assertion that a rule is *binding* at international law, they are simply describing or predicting that the participants view the rule as generating obligation and duty, likely due to the rule's basis in treaty or customary international law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to modern views on international law, what primarily determines whether a rule is binding in international law?\n\nA) The ability to enforce the rule through military or economic sanctions\nB) The internal sense of obligation among participating states\nC) The command of a superior sovereign entity\nD) The presence of centrally organized punishments for violations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. Modern views on international law, as exemplified by H.L.A. Hart's theory, emphasize the internal sense of obligation among participating states as the primary factor in determining whether a rule is binding. This is reflected in the concept of opinio juris in customary international law, where states behave as if a rule has legal obligation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while enforcement can play a role, it's not the primary determinant of a rule's binding nature in modern international law theory.\n\nAnswer C represents the outdated \"command theory\" of law associated with John Austin, which has been largely superseded by more modern conceptions.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, as Hart points out, the absence of centrally organized sanctions does not necessarily undermine the binding nature of international law.\n\nThe key is that states view the rules as generating obligation and duty, often basing this on treaty or customary international law, rather than relying solely on external enforcement mechanisms."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15328/do-government-incentives-for-males-to-change-gender-violate-human-rights-laws", "docs_id": 15328, "title": "Do government incentives for males to change gender violate human rights laws?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Please note the following:\n\n* I'm not seeking legal advice (already checked with a lawyer), rather I'd love to hear others thoughts/conclusions\n* For the sake of simplification I am using approximate USD at present exchange rates\n* While I am describing this from my perspective (since I'm affected by it) about 40,000 people are affected every year\n* I tried to obfuscate my country as I want to hear how it is handled/seen in your country\n\nThe human rights state:\n\n> All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\n\nMy understanding is that this statement is independent of gender.\n\nI also would like to quote our federal constitution:\n\n> Art. 8 Equality before the law\n> \n> \n> 1 Every person is equal before the law.\n> \n> \n> 2 No person may be discriminated against, in particular on grounds of origin, race, gender, age, language, social position, way of life, religious, ideological, or political convictions, or because of a physical, mental or psychological disability.\n> \n> \n> 3 Men and women have equal rights.

While this is still somehow acceptable (you also would want the ones who are best for the task, not just everyone) the tax for those who are not allowed (!) to do the service in my eyes is not.\n\nLike in my situation, it was that I went to military, but during service I got rejected because of my health.

I'm not a great fan of the law as it is, and it is often disregarded, but that is the law.\n\nAlso, this answer is based upon U.S. law, but there isn't much international variation in this part of copyright law in countries that meaningfully enforce copyright laws in their courts.

When a judge witnesses a crime outside of the courtroom, they are considered as any other witness and would be disqualified from presiding over the case to avoid bias. The judge's eyewitness account does not automatically prevent the defendant from pleading not guilty, nor does it allow the judge to pass immediate sentence (unlike option A, which refers to outdated medieval practices). Option B is incorrect because the defendant still has the right to plead as they choose, regardless of witness accounts. Option D is incorrect because a judge's direct contempt power is limited to misconduct occurring in the courtroom during proceedings, not for crimes witnessed elsewhere.

This is dealing with an NYC public college.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Setting aside everything but the title, the Title IX coordinator does not have a federal obligation to email questions to anyone. They may, however, have an institutional obligation to act in a particular way, which might include always email questions, or never emailing questions (the latter is most likely). Assuming someone filed an institutional grievance against you, you have some right to answer these charges \u2013 it will be spelled out in the institution's rules. The federal regulations are between the institution and the government, and the institution then creates rules to keep themselves in compliance.\n\nThe usual worst\\-case scenario is that someone files a grievance, which is reviewed by the institution. As the accused, you will be informed of the charges against you, and will have the opportunity to defend yourself at least by the \"committee decision\" phase. Prior to that point, the institution can gather any data deemed relevant, and may well require that all questioning be conducted in a face\\-to\\-face meeting. Universities generally have minimal specification of procedural requirements, until they run into a problem and impose rules. To determine a person's authority to require something of you, you can ask them to tell you the university rules that give them that authority. Your attorney can then compare their demand with their authority and advise you whether you must comply, or perhaps strategically should comply, or should refuse.\n\nThe federal regulation which drives this is [34 CFR 105 subpart A](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d94e05d2e1f31c95c2387b077955a23&mc=true&node=sp34.1.106.a&rgn=div6). The logic of this is that the institution cannot discriminate on the basis of sex, if they do, they can be punished, but they can also \"erase\" the discrimination if they \"overcome the effects\" of the discrimination. [\u00a7106\\.8](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8d94e05d2e1f31c95c2387b077955a23&mc=true&node=sp34.1.106.a&rgn=div6#se34.1.106_18) requires the institution to have a coordinator who assures compliance and does what is necessary including investigating. There must also be a grievance procedure:\n\n> (b) A recipient shall adopt and publish grievance procedures providing\n>  for prompt and equitable resolution of student and employee complaints\n>  alleging any action which would be prohibited by this part.\n\nThere is absolutely no further federal specification as to what this coordinator can do, instead the government leaves it up the the institution to come up with procedures. The only requirement is that there be no judgment of discrimination.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A university student has been accused of stalking by another student, and the Title IX coordinator is investigating.

The coordinator continues to email questions to the student.

Instead, each institution is required to develop its own grievance procedures that provide \"prompt and equitable resolution\" of complaints. The coordinator's actions, including how they communicate with involved parties, are governed by these institution-specific procedures rather than direct federal mandates. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no federal requirement for emailing questions. \nOption B is too restrictive, as the coordinator does have investigative authority granted by the institution. \nOption D is incorrect because federal regulations do not prohibit email communication; they simply don't specify communication methods."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17147/presentations-allowed-during-final-argument", "docs_id": 17147, "title": "Presentations allowed during final argument?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have not studied civil procedure in detail.\n\nWhat are the rules concerning presentation of charts and data during final arguments before a jury? Is the rule simply that any such charts must be introduced into evidence before the trial, or can explanatory charts be used in final arguments without having submitted them beforehand?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The kind of chart you are talking about is called a \"demonstrative exhibit\". The rule governing the use of demonstrative exhibits in states that follow the numbering scheme of the federal rules of evidence (which most states do) is Rule 1006 (Summaries) which states:\n\n> The contents of voluminous writings, recordings, or photographs which\n>  cannot conveniently be examined in court may be presented in the form\n>  of a chart, summary, or calculation. The originals or duplicates,\n>  shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other\n>  parties at reasonable time and place. The court may order that they be\n>  produced in court.\n\nBasically, this means that demonstrative exhibits are fine as long as they are supported by the evidence offered at trial, or are admitted in circumstances when the opposing party has an opportunity to review at trial their factual basis. A demonstrative exhibit for use in closing doesn't necessarily have to be introduced into evidence at trial, although it often would be used first in opening, then during trial and again in closing, as a matter of good trial litigation practice.\n\nA complication is that many state court rules (and federal courts) require that demonstrative exhibits be disclosed a certain number of days before trial as part of a trial management order designed to prevent undue surprise. This provisions are sometimes contained in Rules 16 or 26 of rules numbered similarly to the federal rules of civil procedure, and are sometimes set forth in a court specific case management order or trial management order tailored to a particular case or a particular judge's preferences. This would vary considerably from court to court, sometimes even within the same state. These disclosure requirements are less common in courts with limited civil jurisdiction, but are sometimes found even in those courts.\n\nAlso, while advanced arrangements would ordinarily not need to be made with respect to a chart in terms of court facilities, one would want to make sure that an easel was available to put the chart on as one was talking about it. \n\nSome discussion of the use of visual aids in a closing argument can be found [here](http://www.utd.uscourts.gov/judges/Inns%20Presentation--Closing%20Arguments.pdf), although that source is light on the technical steps that must be taken to use them.\n\nIf a more sophisticated arrangement (e.g. a power point presentation or a video) is desired, this can generally be permitted as well, but advanced consultation with the court and opposing counsel to arrange the logistics of getting the projector and screen set up, etc. must usually be made usually via the court's division clerk (i.e. the court clerk assigned to the particular courtroom or judge).\n\nThe main objection to a demonstrative exhibit is that it is not supported by facts offered at trial (if it was not itself admitted as an exhibit at trial with an offer to disclose the underlying facts), either because the facts were not introduced into evidence, or because it inaccurately states the facts offered at trial. Also, certain kinds of statements (e.g. an attorney stating that a particular witness was lying, rather than listing facts that show that the witness was lying, or referring to evidence that was kept out of the record at trial) are prohibited completely in an closing statement in any format.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An attorney is preparing for closing arguments in a complex civil trial.

According to the information provided, demonstrative exhibits like charts can be used in closing arguments if they are supported by evidence offered at trial. They don't necessarily need to be formally entered into evidence, but they must accurately reflect the facts presented during the trial. Additionally, many courts require disclosure of such exhibits before trial as part of case management procedures. \n\nOption A is incorrect because attorneys cannot use just any chart without evidentiary support or prior disclosure. \n\nOption B is too restrictive; the chart doesn't always need to be formally entered into evidence if it's a summary of evidence already presented. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while it's good practice to introduce key exhibits in the opening statement, it's not a requirement for using a chart in closing arguments.\n\nThe key is that the chart must be factually supported by trial evidence and typically needs to be disclosed in advance according to local court rules."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93095/how-can-i-tell-if-a-court-case-exists", "docs_id": 93095, "title": "How can I tell if a court case exists?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As someone without access to pricy legal search engines, how can I tell if a given case exists?\n\nFor context, a lawyer was recently found to have cited a number of cases hallucinated by ChatGPT.

E.g., can they insist that my counsel be a member of the bar in the state where I have been arrested?**\n\nYes. If they don't want you to, you cannot talk to a friend, only a lawyer. If you got an OUI, and you're not being a jerk, they will probably let you talk to whomever you want (within reason \u2013 it's not social hour). However, *they can* keep you from speaking to anyone but a lawyer as that person could gain information from you that can corrupt their investigation. (E.g., they arrest you with 10 lbs. of methamphetamine. They know it's \"fresh\" and likely came from a local lab that they suspect you of running. You cannot be allowed to talk to just anyone, as they could help get the lab broke down, moved, destroyed). In TV shows you see attorneys doing this type of illicit thing, but in reality that is very rare. When you enter the police station to speak with a client, you must present your bar card (license to practice). Friends are not allowed in, even if you value their counsel \u2013 they are not counselors!\n\n**2\\. I want to consult a \"team\" of qualified counselors. Are there legal grounds or regulations to limit the number of individuals I consult prior to interrogation, and who I have present during interrogation?** \n\nNo. You can have your entire legal team with you, while preparing for court, or while being questioned, within reason. They do not need to rent a conference room to fit your 30 person legal team, but if you want 3 or so lawyers in with you, and you can afford paying each $250\\-$500 per hour, then have at it. Most lawyers would counsel you against this, as it creates an undue impression of limitless (hence likely illegal) funds. (But if you're a hedge fund manager, and you can show your money is legally earned, it's really your choice.) I have had occasion to go in to meet a client with co\\-counsel numerous times (especially in early years of practice when there is a lead attorney and second chair, so to speak, even for interrogation (which means silence by the client).\n\nThey can \"impede\" access to some extent, though they typically don't. They can play games with your lawyer and make them wait and make you wait, but not while they are in with you, and only for so long. Once your lawyer arrives they should leave you alone. (Some courts say once you ask for counsel they need to leave you alone, but this only really matters if they get a confession from you (or any evidence) before you've (and this is what they're hoping for) recant your request for counsel and your right to remain silent.)\n\n**3\\. Can my contact with counsel be proscribed in any way? E.g., can the police limit the duration or schedule of contact with counsel? Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?**\n\nOnce you've called your lawyer, they need to to let him or her meet with you for a reasonable amount of time before questioning. This is typically a quick meeting, just long enough to make sure you will not say a word. *Even completely innocent people should keep their mouth shut \u2013 innocent people do occasionally get arrested and convicted!* \n\nNo matter what the police say, there is *no* benefit, ever, from talking to them. Some police, who know it's their last shot to get a confession and know once your lawyer gets there will never talk to you again (and they have enough to go forward without your confession in the event you just start blabbing \"you did it\" before they can get you to invoke your rights) will keep talking to you and tell you not to comment, just to listen, even while your lawyer sits outside. They can say you're being processed, or there's a security issue, any number of reasons for short delays if they need it. They will then go on and on about \"how they can maybe *help you out* if you talk now, but once your lawyer arrives all bets are off.\" These are just tricks to get you to recant/revoke your rights and to obtain your confession. You will usually see your lawyer shortly after arrival.\n\n**Can they impede or delay access to me by someone who claims to be my counsel?** Yes, if your lawyer doesn't have adequate ID or cannot verify he is licensed in that state, or in another state and with local counsel. The police do not have a duty to research your lawyer's credentials, and don't have to go online and look your attorney up in the bar directory to make it easier for him or her to get to you. However, if they know the attorney, and he or she forgot his bar card, they would probably lose the confession if you confessed while they make him go get it. Most lawyers carry their bar card in their wallet, so this is not a typical problem.\n\n**4\\. What do police have to do to facilitate my access to my desired counselor(s)? E.g., how long can I be held after requesting an attorney without being allowed to attempt to contact one?**\n\nYou have a right to contact a lawyer. There is no explicit right to a phone call, although some form of contact is implied. Hence, you can usually be held 3 hours before they have to let you \"contact\" someone, and this is after processing. You can be held until your lawyer gets there or until your arraignment, whatever comes first. If your lawyer doesn't show up, you will be given another opportunity by the court to get your lawyer of choice there for arraignment. If you can't, and you don't want to go forward, a public defender will move to waive your right to a speedy trial and seek a continuance until you can get your counsel of choice there. If this happens, consider getting a new lawyer.\n\n**What means must I be granted to find and contact the counsel of my choice?**\n\nThis actually differs depending on where you are and what you did. Again, you have a right to counsel but they can determine how you get this done. Sometimes there are local laws that say you get any number, or 3, or 1 completed phone call to reach your counsel of choice. If there is an overriding risk that you will call someone to communicate information that could put the investigation in jeopardy or would be adversely impact their evidentiary value in some way, even when these laws exist the police can refuse you direct contact with anyone and may implement a strict \"they call\" policy, where they will call the lawyer and tell them, or call your family to let them know, and they can call the lawyer. They cannot hold you for a protracted amount of time without giving you some way to get word to a lawyer; it must be reasonable. There is not a lot of law out there about what *is not* reasonable, because the police know, and for the most part accept, that once right to counsel has been invoked they are done. There is case law saying that 3 hours is reasonable. What is not reasonable?

I've read some questions about the GDPR on here and information from gdpr.eu and other websites, but it's still very unclear to me what is legal and what is not.\n\nI know that a EU regulation can be implemented and interpreted differently from country to country, and that a single court ruling in Germany doesn't even mean that the national law was correctly applied. From what I've read, I get the impression that this particular ruling was not unlikely to be overturned by a higher instance, if it came down to it. So my question probably both pertains to German law specifically and the EU regulation itself.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> As I understand it, the GDPR does not permit sending of personal information (which includes the IP address) without prior consent by the user.\n\nThat's not exactly true, consent is merely one of six possible legal basis for processing (article 6\\). For example, processing of personal data can also be lawful if it necessary to perform a contract, legally mandatory, or in the public interest.\n\nThe court decision acknowledges that but rules out another basis in this case because it considers that it is possible to serve fonts without relying on a third\\-party (*\\[\u2026] der Einsatz der Schriftarten auch m\u00f6glich ist, ohne dass eine Verbindung von Besuchern zu externen Servern hergestellt werden muss*). Confusingly, it only refers to article 6(1\\)(f) when it seems to me that (b) would also be plausible but maybe this wasn't raised during the proceedings?\n\nIf the data controller cannot invoke any other basis for the lawfulness of the processing then yes, the only thing left is asking for consent, i.e. invoking article 6(1\\)(a). But that doesn't mean that you should expect to be asked for consent each and every time your personal information is being used.\n\n> The consent form on the site also implicitly assumes consent, which I thought was also a violation.\n\nYes, implying consent doesn't really make sense under the GDPR definition (article 4, see also article 7\\):\n\n> \u2018consent\u2019 of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action\n\nEuropean data protection authorities have [issued guidelines](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/files/file1/edpb_guidelines_202005_consent_en.pdf) that detail what that means and clearly reject \u201cbundling\u201d different data processing. The regulation also makes it clear that data subjects should be able to withdraw consent at any time, which does not seem possible with the fonts on golem.de\n\nMy reading of all this is that assuming consent because you are using a service (or even created an account or checked a box at some point) simply isn't valid consent. Either you don't need consent at all in the first place or what you need is freely given, specific consent and \u201cimplying\u201d consent or bundling it with a registration process achieves exactly nothing. But this is still extremely common and it might take some time before enforcement and case law definitively settle this question.\n\nSmart data controllers trying to avoid collecting consent (like Meta) have abandoned any claim that signing up to the their services would constitute consent (because that's transparently not the case) and try to bypass the issue entirely using another basis like contractual necessity. This is also being litigated.\n\n> I know that a EU regulation can be implemented and interpreted differently from country to country, and that a single court ruling in Germany doesn't even mean that the national law was correctly applied.

So my question probably both pertains to German law specifically and the EU regulation itself.\n\nThat sounds more like the way EU directives work. Regulations are supposed to be immediately applicable (no implementation in national law necessary) with minimal differences between countries (except when they explicitely provide for that).

(I live in the UK).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm pretty sure that under GDPR, you can indeed request them to send all data they have on you. If it's a complex request, they may charge you something like \u00a310\\. If they have a lot of data on you, they may list the categories of data they have and ask you to pick one, rather than them having to collect and send everything. They should respond within one month, but iirc in the UK implementation, they can inform you (within that month) that they will respond within three months instead.\n\nFor the rest, I only know current Dutch law. GDPR is not that different from what we already had (in general terms) and in many cases it even extends it. Under our law (WBP), you can also request a correction of the data in case it is incorrect, or deletion if they no longer need it for the purpose for which it was collected and stored. I don't really know how that works out in practice though, as Facebook can of course claim that \"being able to connect you to your friends when you sign up for WhatsApp or Facebook with that number\" is a legitimate purpose (in their eyes).\n\nThey might also not have your full name and therefore not be able to connect your data to your request. Or, perhaps, they have *only* your full name (and there are probably more people with your name), so they'll have a hard time verifying that it's really your data which they would be handing over or deleting. The company is required to verify your identity before acting on your request. How they implement that is up to them. Under Dutch law, if I remember correctly, any data that can be connected to your person *by any party* is personally identifiable information (PII). While Facebook might not be able to find who's behind a phone number, your carrier most certainly can. Therefore, the data falls under PII protection laws and they will have to implement a way to verify you and get you your data.\n\nFinally, whether your local laws apply to Facebook, I don't know exactly. There's lots of information on this though, so you should be able to find it. Generally, countries say that if something happened within their territory (e.g. you signed up for WhatsApp while in the UK), their law applies. Companies, I've read, will instead try to claim that their main office is in SomeCountry and therefore SomeCountry's laws apply. But I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find a Facebook office somewhere where GDPR applies, so that's probably fine.\n\nWhile not an exact answer and while I am not sure about everything, I hope this gave you some pointers to go on!", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under GDPR, if an individual who has never used WhatsApp believes their personal information is being processed by the company due to their contacts using the app, what rights does this individual have?\n\nA) They have no rights as they are not direct users of WhatsApp\nB) They can request WhatsApp to delete all data related to them immediately without any verification\nC) They can request WhatsApp to provide all data they have on the individual, subject to identity verification\nD) They can only request data deletion if they can prove WhatsApp has incorrectly processed their information\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to GDPR, individuals have the right to request access to their personal data, even if they are not direct users of a service. WhatsApp would be required to respond to such a request within one month (or three months for complex cases). However, the company is also required to verify the identity of the requester before providing or acting on the data. The individual cannot demand immediate deletion without going through proper channels, and they don't need to prove incorrect processing to request information or deletion.

If so, how do those rules mesh with federal laws of USA?**\n\n(I'm specifically talking about **formal rules**, NOT social norms where an outsider may simply be made to feel unwelcome enough that they would want to leave on their own).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Reservations aren't of or for a single tribe (meaning roughly \"ethnic group\"), they are for a particular Nation (whether or not that term is used in a specific case \\-\\- it could be \"Confederation\" or \"Band\"). In Washington state, the Yakama Nation is a confederation of people who are Klikitat, Palouse, Walla Walla, Wanapum, Wenatchee, Wishram, and Yakama; the Tulalip Tribes covers the northern Lushootseed tribes made up of the Duwamish, Snohomish, Snoqualmie, Skagit, Suiattle, Samish, and Stillaguamish. Only 2/3 of the recognized tribes have reservations. The key legal concept is not exactly being \"of a certain tribe\", it is \"being enrolled\". Ancestry relates to enrollment (and disenrollment) via individual rules about membership.\n\nFederal Indian law is encoded in [Title 25](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25). Let's just say that a question about what that title says is way to broad to ever answer. Generally speaking, there are two types of reservation land, trust land and fee land. The US government holds trust land in trust, which has various restrictions on transfer, and is exempt from taxation: transfers require higher approval (tribe, BIA). Fee land is land that the individual(s) own outright. In the case of fee land, anyone can purchase that land. The land that would be of interest for this question is trust land. The Yakama reservation, for instance, has open and closed areas, the latter being mostly trust land with use restricted to enrolled members.\n\nOn fee land located within a reservation, that does not mean that one is completely free of tribal rules. After all, off the reservation, you are still subject to the local government's land use rules (zoning restrictions, for example). The ruling of [Brendale v. Confederated Tribes, 492 U.S. 408](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/492/408/case.html) is very complex and says \"yes and no\". Tribes do *not* have authority to zone fee land on the reservation owned by non\\-members, but they do have authority to generally zone fee land on closed areas of the reservation. (Very roughly speaking, fee land is subject to general government\\-planning type restrictions on land use that we are all subject to; but there are limits on how discriminatory those rules can be. Above all, fee land is in fact owned by the individual, and a tribe cannot claw the land back, though they can buy it back).\n\nA Nation can set rules for membership which would be patently illegal in the general context of US law. In [Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/436/49/), the situation was that the rule of the Santa Clara Pueblo nation said that the children of a Pueblo woman who married outside the tribe (e.g. to a Navaho) may be denied tribal membership, but did not exclude children of a Pueblo man who married outside the tribe. The consequence is that the children of a woman lose the right to reside on that land after the mother dies (also can't vote, etc.) The short version is that SCOTUS held that this is legal.

The correct answer is based on the ruling in Brendale v.

The school is not considered an employer in this context, so they don't automatically own the intellectual property. Additionally, creators often have moral rights to their work, which includes the right to be attributed as the author when it's displayed publicly. Even if a student signed away image rights, this doesn't necessarily include intellectual property rights, especially if the student specifically refused to give up intellectual rights in the contract.

I have recently submitted a Subject Access Request to my motor insurer, and as part of that they sent some data that the received from the [Motor Insurance Database (MID)](https://www.mib.org.uk/) and [Equifax](https://www.equifax.co.uk/). The Equifax data included policy numbers and dates over the last few years that I would have had access to at one point but to not know now, and the MID included three identifiers per row, two of which I have not seen before, and an encoded string that I am unable to decode but appears to encode data that I may have had access to. I have also used the internet, and as I understand it this involves a lot of passing around information about me between entities.\n\nWhat exactly triggers the requirement for a data controller to inform the subject under Article 14?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Simply put, Art 14 GDPR is often ignored. But also, it triggers less often than some might think.\n\nWhile Art 14 applies whenever the data controller processes personal data that weren't obtained (directly) from the data subject (see Art 14(1\\)), there are a bunch of exceptions to the notification obligation, such as Art 14(5\\)(a): no notification is necessary if the data subject already has the information in the Art 14 privacy notice.\n\nFor example, your motor insurer likely fulfilled its transparency obligations under Art 14 together with its Art 13 transparency obligations by providing a privacy notice when you signed up to your service, and making updated versions available subsequently. While a privacy notice must be \u201cprovided\u201d, it is not required to force you to actually read and comprehend this document. And it is not necessarily required to specifically notify you about Art 14 processing if you were already provided this information in a privacy notice.\n\nHowever, \u201cproviding\u201d the information implies a more active approach than merely making the privacy notice easily available on a website. The [ICO says](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/the-right-to-be-informed/when-should-we-provide-privacy-information/#when3) that data controllers \u201cmust proactively make individuals aware of this information and \\[\u2026] need to give them an easy way to access it\u201d.\n\nThe lack of notification from the MID or from Equifax must be viewed critically, but it could technically be that they are compliant if you were notified about their privacy notices by the data sources.\n\nSo this approach would be clearly compliant:\n\n* You open a bank account.\n* The bank provides its own privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR.\n* The bank sends data to Equifax.\n* Equifax notifies you about their processing per Art 14 GDPR.\n\nBut so would this:\n\n* You open a bank account.\n* The bank provides its own privacy notice per Art 13 GDPR.\n* The bank notifies you about Equifax' processing per Art 14 GDPR.\n* The bank sends data to Equifax, noting that they've already notified you.\n\nThere are of course some exceptions in Art 14(5\\), in particular that notification can be skipped if it would entail \u201cdisproportionate effort\u201d. There was a high\\-profile case about this [in Poland](https://uodo.gov.pl/en/553/1009):\n\n* A data controller had collected data from public registries, affecting an estimated 6 million data subjects. The data included contact information such as addresses, phone numbers, emails.\n* The data controller did notify those people for which they had an email address (about 90\u2009000 people, about 1\\.5%).\n* The data controller did not notify other data subjects, citing high costs for sending letters.\n* The Polish UODO (corresponds to the UK ICO) found that this wasn't disproportionate effort, and that the data controller failed to meet its Art 14 obligations.\n* If I remember correctly, the data controller decided to destroy the collected data instead of sending out notifications.\n\nA roughly similar UK case was the [ICO's 7\\.5M GBP fine against Clearview](https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2022/05/ico-fines-facial-recognition-database-company-clearview-ai-inc/), though there the breach of transparency obligations was just one of many problems.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A data controller obtains personal data about 1 million individuals from various public registries.

The core prohibition is \u00a7539c, which says\n\n> Any person who is present or who is not present during a private\n> conversation and who wilfully uses any device to eavesdrop upon the\n> conversation without the consent of all parties thereto, or who\n> knowingly aids, employs or procures another person to do the same in\n> violation of this section, is guilty of a felony\n\nAn open faculty meeting is by law not a private conversation (however, a closed meeting is). Per the Open Meetings Act, \"the faculty\" constitute a public body\n(a state \"committee, subcommittee, authority, or council\", empowered by the constitution and statute to perform a governmental function). \u00a715\\.263 directly says \"yes you may\":\n\n> All meetings of a public body shall be open to the public and shall be\n> held in a place available to the general public.

One unsatisfactory remedy would be to sue the university for resulting damages, which would put university counsel in the position of having to defend the university's actions (i.e. what the employees did). It is possible that there already exists an official university document regarding the public meetings act which would resolve the matter. Or, the university attorney's office *might* provide instructive guidance, but it is equally likely that they will refuse to respond if the request does not come from the department chair or other empowered administrator, such as the dean.

We, and several other neighborhood residents, have been doing this for years.\n\nRecently we had an encounter with a nearby resident claiming that we were trespassing on private property as were walking through the wash. We checked the property records, and indeed, there are two parcels of private land through which we were crossing to get back on the main road. Both parcels are vacant, unmarked, not fenced, and not owned by any of the nearby residents.\n\nI'm not overly concerned with this person's claims as we aren't entering their property, but yesterday we found two posted signs in the wash at the park boundary stating: *Private property. No public access.* The signs were apparently installed by the county and seem legitimate with county seal and all.

Criminal trespass in the third degree is a class 3 misdemeanor.\n\nThe words on the sign are clear enough, but can the county speak for the owner of the vacant lots who, as far as I'm aware, don't know or care about what's going on?

However, they do serve as a warning that the area beyond is private property. For criminal trespass charges to be pursued, there would likely need to be additional factors, such as:\n\n1.

Location: California\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no California law requiring you to have a license to make things. Building power lifting racks is not a regulated business so there are no specific certification or licensing requirements (there are, though, general requirements to be licensed, imposed on all businesses, and city hall is your first stop for that). However, you might be liable for damages if the device is constructed negligently. For example, if you solder the joints, and someone is consequently injured, you could be held liable since you didn't exercise ordinary care in making the product. The [jury instructions](https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1200/1221/) for negligence will give you a basic summary of how negligence would be judged, and [this](http://trialattorneysofamerica.com/documents/primer2012.pdf) is a more detail analysis of product liability law.

According to the information provided, there is no specific license required in California to manufacture powerlifting racks. However, John could still be held liable for injuries if his manufacturing process is deemed negligent. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. There is no California law requiring a specific license to make things like powerlifting racks.\n2. Building power lifting racks is not a regulated business requiring specific certifications.\n3.

Probate does not have the equivalent of the \"automatic stay\" in bankruptcy that prevents any creditors, secured or unsecured, from engaging in any collection activity against an estate, and probate estates are not allowed to file for bankruptcy either.\n\nIf you really wanted to play hardball and only needed the apartment for a few days in March, the estate could simply continue to occupy it for that period of time and they pay the landlord the extra month's rent but not the additional security deposit when it was done. The landlord can't begin a foreclosure proceeding until there is a default which can't happen sooner than the last day of February. Even if the landlord is really on his toes, the landlord will be hard pressed to get a notice to vacate served on the estate and then to prepare and serve an eviction lawsuit on the estate and get that case in front of a judge before the estate will be ready to move out anyway. The estate might incur some attorneys' fees in the process if it did that, but the attorneys' fees would be an unsecured claim of the landlord that would have to be collected through the claims process in the probate proceeding which is usually a fairly favorable forum for the estate, instead of the usual court where small landlord\\-tenant disputes are handled. The probate estate could simply deny his claim for attorneys' fees and then, if the landlord wanted them after making a claim, the landlord would have to bring a lawsuit on fairly tight deadlines in the probate court to have the disallowance of the claim overturned.\n\nIf you wanted to be even more aggressive, rather than paying the last month's rent, the estate could just holdover into March without paying rent or a new security deposit (vacating before the eviction process can run its course), effectively forcing the landlord to use the security deposit for March rent, and then forcing the landlord to use the probate claims process for both damages to the property claimed and for an attorneys' fees.

The tenant is not required to share the cost of repairs, and the landlord's arguments about inability to control the dogs or their security role are not relevant under this law."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87751/can-lawyers-ask-judges-questions", "docs_id": 87751, "title": "Can lawyers ask judges questions?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I came across a courtroom exchange [on twitter](https://twitter.com/LiveLawIndia/status/1599642235142025217)\n\n> Adv: I ask this question.\n> \n> \n> J.

What I'd like to know:\n\n1. Would judges in the courts of developed countries like USA, UK, France, Germany, etc. give similar instructions in their own courts? Or is this phenomenon, let's say, \"uniquely Indian\"?\n2. If so, what would be the reason a lawyer can't ask a judge questions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question should not include France and Germany, and should be limited to common law jurisdictions that are similar to India, because the function of judges differs starkly between adversarial vs. inquisitorial systems.\n\nThe adversarial model pits two parties against each other, with the judge serving as the decider (of law, and perhaps of fact). The parties can offer witnesses, who can be compelled to respond to questions, and the attorney asking the question gets to control the question asked (subject to a possible objection by the other party, to be ruled on by the judge).\n\nThe judge can rule on requests (which are not questions) i.e. petitions by either party. Otherwise, the judge sits there more or less mute, soaking up the argumentation being presented. Appellate proceedings are somewhat special in that the justices may address questions to the attorney, in order to better understand the logic of the proffered argument. The burden is on the attorney to make the case. There is *no* direct burden on the justice to \"make a case\". The \"court of public opinion\" may be relevant in a jurisdiction where the justice is an elected office or is appointed for limited time. Or, the contrary opinion of a higher court may have some influence on a justice's rulings \u2013 this is not the case with a Supreme Court.\n\nIn other words, it would be highly dysfunctional within the adversarial system for a party to be allowed to interrogate a judge. Formal petitions are allowed, as long as you follow proper form.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In an adversarial legal system, which of the following best describes the role of a judge during court proceedings?\n\nA) To actively interrogate witnesses and lawyers to uncover the truth\nB) To serve as a neutral arbiter, ruling on objections and deciding on matters of law\nC) To advocate for the prosecution or defense, depending on the case\nD) To engage in direct dialogue with attorneys, answering their questions about legal interpretations\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nIn an adversarial legal system, as described in the passage, the judge's role is to serve as a neutral arbiter. The judge primarily rules on objections raised by either party and decides on matters of law. They do not actively interrogate witnesses or lawyers (ruling out option A), nor do they advocate for either side (ruling out option C). While judges, especially in appellate courts, may ask questions to clarify arguments, they do not typically engage in direct dialogue answering attorneys' questions about legal interpretations (ruling out option D). The passage states that \"the judge sits there more or less mute, soaking up the argumentation being presented,\" which aligns with option B's description of a neutral arbiter."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7562/right-of-way-between-u-turning-and-right-turning-vehicles-at-traffic-lights", "docs_id": 7562, "title": "Right of way between U-turning and Right-turning vehicles at traffic lights", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: At a traffic light controlled intersection, who has right of way between a U\\-turning vehicle and a right\\-turning vehicle?

The right turning vehicle has a green right arrow.\n\nI am most looking for answers for Ontario, Canada, but would accept answers for other jurisdictions with similar traffic laws (at least where they don't outright ban U\\-turns at intersections).\n\n*Note: The Ontario driver's handbook, and applicable laws don't seem to mention U\\-turns much. In particular, it's not explicit that U\\-turns are even allowed at intersections, but they seem to be according to [this Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/2jagd8/are_uturns_at_a_green_light_legal_if_there_are_no/), and according to the no U\\-turn signs present at some intersections.*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: U\\-turns are prohibited in certain circumstances ([*Highway Traffic Act*](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90h08#BK230) Paragraph 143\\). It does not say that U\\-turns are prohibited at intersections controlled by traffic lights. By the principle of *[expressio unius est exclusio alterius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_interpretation#Canons)*, U\\-turns at intersections controlled by traffic lights are generally allowed.\n\nHowever, in determining fault for insurance purposes in Ontario,\n\n> The driver of automobile \u201cA\u201d is 100 per cent at fault and the driver of automobile \u201cB\u201d is not at fault for an incident that occurs, \\[...] when automobile \u201cA\u201d is making a U\\-turn \\[...] ([*Insurance Act*](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900668) Paragraph 19\\.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Ontario, Canada, at a traffic light controlled intersection with no other applicable signage, a vehicle is making a U-turn on a green light while another vehicle is turning right on a red light.

However, according to the Ontario Insurance Act, the driver making a U-turn is considered 100% at fault for insurance purposes in case of a collision.

It depends on whether your visa is \"single entry\" or \"multiple entry\".\n\nFrom the [US State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date.html):\n\n> Depending on your nationality, visas can be issued from a single entry\n> (application) up to multiple/unlimited entries.\n\nIf you have a single entry visa and leave the US for Canada, you will NOT be allowed to renter the US from Candada.

During their stay, they decide to take a day trip to Niagara Falls on the Canadian side. What is the most likely outcome when they attempt to re-enter the United States?\n\nA) They will be allowed to re-enter the US without any issues, as long as their visa is still valid.\nB) They will be denied entry to the US and must return to India to apply for a new visa.\nC) They can pay a fee at the border to convert their single-entry visa to a multiple-entry visa.\nD) They will be granted a one-time exception to re-enter the US, but their visa will be canceled upon entry.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The question specifically mentions a single-entry visa, which is crucial information. According to the US State Department, a single-entry visa only allows one entry into the United States. Once the tourist leaves the US for Canada, they have used their single entry. Attempting to re-enter from Canada would not be permitted, regardless of the visa's validity period. The tourist would be denied entry and would need to return to their home country (India in this case) to apply for a new US visa. This scenario highlights the importance of understanding visa types and entry restrictions before planning international travel, even for short trips to neighboring countries."}}
