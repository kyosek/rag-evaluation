It initiates the process of creating a bureaucracy that will eventually provide loans for down payment and closing cost assistance for first\\-time home buyers (a loan that must be repaid when the house is sold).

It is then the duty of the covenant homeownership program commission to determine what such covenants may have existed, and also\n\n> to what extent existing programs and race\\-neutral approaches have been\n> insufficient to remedy this discrimination and its impacts\n\nThe law simply states that eligibility is based on\n\n> a recorded covenant or deed restriction that includes or included\n> racial restrictions on property ownership or use against protected\n> classes\n> that are unlawful under [RCW 49\\.60\\.224](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.60.224)\n\nwhich would include any covenants against sale to Irish or any other anciently discriminated\\-against Europeans, if such are found to exist.\n\nReferring to [Wynn v.

If (when) this new law is challenged, one of the central questions would be what remedial actions the government(s) took to correct this past discrimination.

The entity employer has vicarious liability for the actions of the employee who broke the law, the employee who broke the law probably has liability, and the direct manager might as well for personally directing an employee to break the law. But the middle manager and top managers probably do not have personal liability for the wrongdoing of the rank and file employee and the direct manager that directed the rank and file employee to break the law.\n\nIn the case of statutory violations, it turns on the language of the statute (although, if a statute creates a private cause of action it is often possible to sue an employee for civil conspiracy to commit a statutory tort that an employer has primary liability under).\n\nThere are some exceptions to the general rule, that usually pertain to \"business torts\" and \"white collar crimes\".\n\nFor example, a notable U.S. Supreme Court case held that if a company makes a false statement of fact in a disclosure submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (for the purpose of reliance upon it by all investors dealing in the company's stock) in the name of the company only, that the attorneys and company officials and employees who drafted the disclosure statement do not have any legal responsibility for the misstatement made on behalf of the company in its authorized statement in its own name (contrary to the usual common law rule that someone who participates in carrying out a fraud on behalf of an employer has joint and several liability with the employer for damages caused by the fraud).\n\nOn the other hand, knowingly putting a false dollar amount on an expense report resulting in an intended overpayment of the employer would probably give rise to common law fraud liability on the part of the employee.\n\nThere can also be exceptions based upon the elements of the crime involved.\n\nFor example, one of the elements of defamation liability is publication of the defamatory material, and merely taking dictation of and mailing a letter signed by the employer containing a defamatory statement prepared at an employer's direction would not normally sufficient to establish publication for purposes of defamation law by the employee typing it up and mailing it. Similarly, the postal employee delivering the letter wouldn't have engaged in a defamatory publication despite delivering the letter to the person to whom the defamatory statement was published.\n\nSimilarly, some environmental crimes and regulatory violations are defined in such a way that only an entity employer can be guilty of them, particularly crimes of omission (e.g. the failure of a licensed point source emitter to file a report of an emission in excess of the amount allowed by an environmental regulation, or the failure of a mining permit company to restore property mined to its original condition).\n\nOne question the OP appears to single out in particular are copyright infringements (and presumably patent infringements and trademark infringements) by an employee on behalf of an employer.

There, black protesters were charged for trespass because they staged a sit\\-in at a diner and refused to leave when police told them to. They argued they couldn't be convicted because the state's trespass statute only prohibited entering land after being told not to, but the courts convicted them anyway, holding that the statute also outlawed remaining on land after being asked to leave, even though the statute said nothing like that.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed the convictions, holding that \"an unforeseeable judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, operates precisely like an ex post facto law, such as Art. I, \u00a7 10, of the Constitution forbids.\"\n\n> By applying such a construction of the statute to affirm their convictions in this case, the State has punished them for conduct that was not criminal at the time they committed it, and hence has violated the requirement of the Due Process Clause that a criminal statute give fair warning of the conduct which it prohibits.\n\n*Bouie v. City of Columbia*, 378 U.S. 347, 350 (1964\\).\n\nBut Kavanaugh's opinion isn't controlling, and *Bouie* isn't exactly on point, so the question remains open. The defendant probably has the more straightforward argument \\-\\- the abortion was legal up until *Dobbs* was decided \\-\\- but there's a pretty good argument for the state, as well: When Roe was still good law, abortion law was quite fuzzy, so it was never entirely clear whether new restrictions on abortion were or were not unconstitutional. Given those conditions, the state laws outlawing abortions were clear enough to provide fair warining, even if there were legitimate questions as to the constitutionality of those laws; if a woman wanted to do something contrary to the law, she should have petitioned the courts to invalidate it, rather than simply breaking it.\n\nSo there's no real way to say what the answer is at this point, but I suspect we'll get a real answer before too long."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Following the reversal of Roe v.

How does this exactly work with many of these states having their own parliaments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contemporary decisions of domestic British courts (e.g. the Supreme Court) are not binding in foreign jurisdictions. They may be persuasive for courts there, because there is a common legal tradition and the U.K. judiciary is often considered to be quite good.\n\nSome countries have preserved a right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (aka \"The Queen in Council\"). This body is basically the same judges as the Supreme Court but sitting in a different room.

Corollary: JCPC decisions are *not* precedential for British courts, unless the JCPC goes out of its way to say so. In these cases, the JCPC applies the law and constitution of the origin country, which can include retained pre\\-independence British laws as well as the common law. That country could pass a subsequent statute or constitutional act overriding the JCPC's decision (as Parliament could in the U.K.), so that country retains ultimate control even though one of \"its\" courts is a shared one sitting in London.\n\nThis arrangement can cause dissonance. For example, some Caribbean countries would like to execute people, but that is prohibited in the U.K.; the JCPC continues to permit executions to go ahead in some cases, even though that would be illegal if the same judges were in a different room hearing a British case.

A court might order DACA applications to be accepted, and if they are not, might rule that deportations or other negative actions are unlawful. A court might hold persons who defy its orders in contempt, and send marshals to jail such persons. But if the executive branch in an organized way defies such orders, there is no judicial power to compel obedience to court orders.\n\nThis is why the judiciary has famously been called the \"least dangerous branch\" of the government: it cannot actually **do** anything without at least the tacit cooperation of the executive.\n\n### Cherokee Case (*Worcester v. Georgia*)\n\nThere was a reference in the comments above to the the Cherokee Indians case, [*Worcester v. Georgia*, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515 (1832\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester_v._Georgia). In that case the US Supreme Court, in a decision written by Chief Justice Marshall held that the Georgia laws purporting to seize Cherokee lands were invalid as violations of Federal treaties. President Jackson was strongly displeased by this ruling. He was supposed to have said:\n\n> John Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it.\n\nIt appears that President Jackson probably did not say that, at least not publicly. But in fact Jackson did not take any steps to enforce the decision, and the decision was in fact not enforced. The lands were seized, and the Cherokee were forcibly relocated across the infamous trail of tears. This event shows that a court ruling (proper or improper) may have no effect if the executive branch refuses to obey or enforce it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of the U.S. government's system of checks and balances, which of the following statements most accurately describes the judiciary's ability to enforce its decisions against the executive branch?\n\nA) The judiciary has its own police force to ensure compliance with court orders.\nB) The Supreme Court can directly remove executive officials who defy its rulings.\nC) The judiciary relies primarily on the executive branch's voluntary compliance and political pressure for enforcement.\nD) The judiciary can unilaterally cut funding to executive agencies that refuse to comply with court orders.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the judiciary does not have its own police force beyond a few court bailiffs.\nB) is incorrect as the Supreme Court does not have the power to directly remove executive officials.\nC) is correct.

Suppose the company and all customers are in\nLos Angeles, California.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On the one hand, there are statutes that prohibit the delivery of instructions which distort or circumvent the official/intended use or safety of a device. For a somewhat related example of this, see [MCL 750\\.540c(1\\)(3\\)](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(j44pfulxvqjfox2egdt1nlq0))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-750-540c).\n\nOn the other hand, the company/manufacturer is unlikely to prevail under contract law no matter how clearly and conspicuously its EULA prohibits the disclosure of discovered weaknesses. That is because the prohibition in the EULA is outweighed by the severe vulnerability to which all other unsuspecting customers are subjected.\n\nFrom the standpoint of public policy, people's awareness of the discovered vulnerability is certainly in the public's best interest. The disclosure will warn both (1\\) *potential* customers not to purchase a product that fails or misses its primary purpose, and (2\\) *current* customers to adopt precautions now that the product's reliability has been disproved. Thus, the effectiveness of broadcasting the discovery of such weakness is in stark contrast with the technical deficits and managerial politics that typically hinder a company's ability (or its will) to respond to the issue.\n\nIf the weakness was known to the manufacturer prior to the disclosure, the release of that product would constitute *fraudulent misrepresentation*. The details of the demonstration in the video supports the argument that the manufacturer knew \\-\\-or should have known\\-\\- about that weakness, since a padlock design is supposed to pass all kinds of tests of breakability and not be disabled by a screwdriver. \n\nIt is hard to deny that the notion that \"the padlock is secure\" *induces* customers to purchase the product. As such, the misrepresentation violates the contract law principle that a contract \\-\\-such as a purchase\\-\\- be entered *knowingly*. See [*Restatement (Second) of Contracts*](https://nylitigationfirm.com/files/restat.pdf) at \u00a7 161\\-167. With respect to the publisher of the weakness, that misrepresentation renders the EULA\\-prohibition void. See *Restatement at \u00a7 164(1\\)*.\n\nRegardless of whether or not the manufacturer incurred misrepresentation, the manufacturer's decision to sue the publisher is only likely to backfire by bringing more attention to the poor design of the product.\n\nIn all, the manufacturer's best option is to do a product recall ASAP and enhance the design."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company manufactures a padlock with a hidden weakness that can be exploited with a screwdriver. A YouTuber discovers this weakness and publishes a video demonstrating how to break the lock.

The company has limited legal recourse against the YouTuber and should prioritize addressing the product defect. This is because:\n\n1. Public interest in safety outweighs contractual agreements that might prohibit disclosure of weaknesses.\n2. The disclosure serves to warn both potential and current customers about the product's vulnerability.\n3. Attempting to sue or silence the YouTuber could backfire by drawing more attention to the product's flaw.\n4. If the weakness was known to the manufacturer, selling the product could constitute fraudulent misrepresentation, further weakening their legal position.\n5. From a public policy standpoint, the disclosure of such vulnerabilities is generally considered to be in the public's best interest.\n\nOption A is incorrect because negligence claims are unlikely to succeed in this scenario, and the weakness is not a protected trade secret. Option B is wrong because public interest and safety concerns typically outweigh contractual prohibitions in such cases. Option D is incorrect because while such statutes exist, they are unlikely to apply in this case where a genuine product weakness is being exposed for public safety reasons."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15604/is-selling-pictures-of-merchandise-illegal-if-you-imply-that-you-are-selling-the", "docs_id": 15604, "title": "Is selling pictures of merchandise illegal if you imply that you are selling the actual merchandise?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 1.

Let's say I text with the guy, we meet up in public, and I buy the item with cash. Then let's say, it turns out it was stolen, the guy gets caught, and confesses to the police/victim and tells them my name/phone number/transaction details.\n\nI have several similar/related questions about this scenario:\n\n1. How would this proceed? It seems like it would be very difficult to prove (short of getting public surveillance footage) that I even bought the item. What if I just said \"sorry, I never ended up buying it.\" Surely they couldn't/wouldn't get a warrant to search my house?\n2.

That's what [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_of_stolen_goods#United_States) section seems to be saying, but that sounds crazy to me, because it would mean basically buying *anything* puts you at risk.\n\nI ask this because I was getting a little paranoid and was thinking about the implications of this: I'm imagining a scam where someone sells me a \"stolen\" item and then the \"victim\" (really their accomplice) says \"I found out that you bought an item stolen from me, but the thief got away\" and presents me with irrefutable evidence (e.g., a receipt for the item with its serial number) that the item was his. He could potentially threaten me to return it to him, and then I've lost my money (since the \"thief\" is in the wind) but they still have their item.\n\nIt's unlikely, I know, but I'm wondering what the legal implications of this would be. Thank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are conflating the crime against the state of [possession stolen goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possession_of_stolen_goods#United_States) with the common law tort against the owner for [conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_(law)).\n\nTo your questions:\n\n> How would this proceed? It seems like it would be very difficult to prove (short of getting public surveillance footage) that I even bought the item.\n\nIf you read the second paragraph of the page you linked it says:\n\n> In many jurisdictions, if an individual has accepted possession of goods or property **and knew they were stolen**, then the individual is typically charged ... If the individual **did not know** the goods were stolen, then the goods are returned to the owner and the individual is not prosecuted.\n\nProof of the crime involves a \"beyond reasonable doubt\" standard of evidence of both the fact that you have the goods and that you knew they were stolen. If you become aware that they were stolen (e.g. the police tell you) and try to keep them then you have just committed the crime.\n\nProof of the tort requires a \"balance of probabilities\" standard of evidence that you have the goods and that they belong to someone else; your knowledge that they were stolen is immaterial.\n\nIn the first instance, the police would probably knock on your door, tell you why they were there and ask if the version of the story they have from the thief is essentially true. What happens next depends on your response:\n\n1. \"Yes, I knew it was stolen; you better arrest me and I will plead guilty.\" This will play out as you expect.\n2. \"Yes, I didn't know it was stolen, I will go and get it for you.\" You return the goods, give a statement and may have to act as a witness in the prosecution of the thief. You are down $1,000 but are now older and wiser.\n3. \"No, I have no idea what you are talking about.\" Well, you have now committed the crime of hindering a police investigation and have also committed the crime of possessing stolen goods \\- you can no longer claim that you didn't know the goods were stolen; the police have told you they are. What happens next depends on if the police believe you or the thief.\n\n> Surely they couldn't/wouldn't get a warrant to search my house?\n\nWant to bet? They certainly have enough to get a search warrant if they want one (probably). Whether they seek one probably depends on the value of the goods, how busy they are and how much you pissed them off.\n\n> Could I be prosecuted if I didn't know it was stolen?\n\nNot if you return it as soon as practicable after being made aware that they were.\n\n> The scam\n\nThis seems like a lot of work for a very small return \\- spend your time worrying about things that are more likely to happen.\n\nGood Title\n----------\n\nAll of this is tied up with the concept of [good title](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Title_(property)&redirect=no). Basically, you cannot gain good title to property from someone who does not have good title themselves; if you buy goods from a thief you do not own them.\n\nFor example, if A has good title to the goods, B steals them and sells them to C who sells them to D then A still owns them and can demand their return from D, D could demand the return of their money from C and C could do likewise with B but as far as A is concerned it doesn't matter that C \\& B have lost money; that is simply too bad for them."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John buys a laptop from a stranger on Craigslist for $800.

There are some minor differences in Northern Ireland. England\\-and\\-Wales are treated as one for most purposes, but there are some slight differences at the very lowest levels but none materially impact a murder case.\n\nIf they are caught in England and Wales they are arrested, interviewed, charged then brought before the next available Magistrates' Court who send the defendant to the Crown Court for trial. As a Magistrate has no power to grant bail for murder the defendant must be remanded in custody until he can make an application for bail before the Crown Court, but the default position is that bail should not be granted for murder unless in very exceptional circumstances. In other U.K. jurisdictions, the names of the courts will differ and there may be some other fine details that aren't the same in the pre\\-trial process but the same general outline applies.\n\nIf they are outside of the U.K. they will be subject to either an International or European Arrest Warrant and extradited to the UK at the request of the U.K. Government under the terms of the relevant extradition treaties. On arrival in the UK they are arrested for murder and the process proceeds in the same manner. (If they are someplace that does not have an extradition treaty with the U.K., the trial may be deferred until U.K. officials have an opportunity to arrest him and are often dogged in attempting to accomplish, perhaps, for example, while the suspect is on holiday somewhere that there is an extradition treaty.)\n\nPrior to the trial, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the defence will prepare their cases and return to court at various times to settle any issues etc before going to the expense of a full trial. Also, at any time the CPS determine the case to be too weak for a realistic prospect of conviction or the suspect is innocent, they are supposed to dismiss or amend the indictment.\n\nThe defendant is then tried for murder before a jury (almost always, but not in every single case, e.g., if the defendant admits guilt and the plea is accepted in appropriate proceedings before a judge). The CPS instruct a barrister to present their case with another barrister acting on behalf of the defendant. The process is for juvenile defendants is pretty much the same as for adults, apart from added safeguards to ensure the juvenile understands the proceedings and is not put at any disadvantage due to their age.\n\nAll of the jurisdictions within the U.K., however, will have a trial that involves presentation of sworn evidence and exhibits and opening and closing arguments from both prosecution and defence counsels to a jury, procedural objections, cross\\-examination, and sometimes offering of additional evidence under the supervision of a single judge; normally with the defendant present. There will be some means of court reporting, and unless the judge orders otherwise (which is only done in relatively exceptional circumstances), the trial will be open to the public and the press to observe.\n\nIf the defendant dies before the legal process to secure a conviction is not completed, the case is dismissed as moot.\n\nIf the defendant is convicted of a homicide offense the trial/sentencing judge will impose a prison sentences, which is \"fixed by law\", with a life sentence in the case of the most serious homicide offense, murder (there are multiple homicide offenses that hinge largely on the intent of the defendant, often a murder prosecution will include less included homicide offenses as options for convictions). Only in exceptional cases this will be a whole\\-life term, in all others the judge will prescribe a minimum sentence according to the judicial sentencing guidelines after which the defendant may be released on licence, which is what an American would call parole. Any offences committed on licence will normally result in a recall to prison.\n\nThe U.K. does not have a death penalty and does not authorise corporal punishment. The vast majority of people who are arrested and tried for murder are convicted, although there are sometimes acquittals or hung juries.\n\nThis conviction may be appealed by the defendant to the Court of Appeal (and again up to the Supreme Court) (the intermediate appellate court may not be the same in all U.K. jurisdictions) which reviews the proceedings to determine if the law was applied correctly and if there was sufficient evidence to support the verdict. If the court finds that this was not the case, it can vacate the conviction and orders an appropriate revised disposition of the case depending upon the circumstances justifying the reversal of the trial court. If the appeal court affirm the trial verdict then the sentence continues to be carried out. Usually, but not always, the defendant will be in prison pursuant to the sentence imposed pending an outcome of any appeal.\n\nEventually, if the sentence imposed upon a conviction is affirmed (and not a whole life term) the prisoner may be released on licence (which includes some post\\-release supervision) and is free and to about living their life again, subject to some collateral consequences based upon their criminal record (e.g. inability to work in certain occupations).\n\nIf the defendant is acquitted, then they go free and cannot be tried again for the same offence, unless the exceptions under the double jeopardy provisions that apply in that jurisdiction apply. The main exception of double jeopardy is for newly discovered evidence of guilt in a case where there was an acquittal.\n\nIf the person convicted is not a British citizen, they will usually be deported at the conclusion of their sentence if international law allows for it.\n\nThere are a few exceptions to these rules that come up in a tiny percentage of all U.K. murders that apply (1\\) in the case of people subject to courts\\-martial such as active duty military service members, (2\\) in the case of foreign diplomats with diplomatic immunity, (3\\) when the murder is classified as an act of terrorism, and (4\\) in the case that the defendant has a title of nobility that calls for special treatment such as, e.g., Prince Charles (the current heir to the throne) or the Queen. These special cases are really too esoteric for the plain vanilla facts stated in the question and involve unique processes that are very different from the usual one described above. The fourth case is one that does not exist in my country (the U.S.) and in other countries that are republics rather than constitutional monarchies like the U.K., although most countries have some special rules for criminal trials of their very highest officials (like Presidents and Prime Ministers)."}, "answer": "Question: In the UK legal system, which of the following statements is true regarding the process for someone who has committed murder and is caught?\n\nA) The defendant is always granted bail by the Magistrates' Court while awaiting trial.\nB) If convicted, the defendant can only receive a whole-life term as a sentence.\nC) The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) instructs a barrister to present the case against the defendant.\nD) Appeals can only be made to the Court of Appeal, with no further recourse to higher courts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the default position is that bail should not be granted for murder unless in very exceptional circumstances, and Magistrates' Courts do not have the power to grant bail for murder cases.\n\nB is incorrect because while a life sentence is mandatory for murder, a whole-life term is only given in exceptional cases.

Section 418(2\\) sets out the circumstances where self\\-defence is available. The questions to be asked by the jury under s 418(2\\) are succinctly set out in *R v Katarzynski* \\[2002] NSWSC 613 at \\[22]\u2013\\[23] which was approved in *Abdallah v R* \\[2016] NSWCCA 34 at \\[61]. Section 419 provides that the prosecution has the onus of proving, beyond reasonable doubt, that the person did not carry out the conduct in self\\-defence.\n\nSelf defence does not have to be raised by the defendant for the jury to consider it \\- it must be eliminated by the prosecution. Where self\\-defence is an issue in the case (i.e. there is evidence that could support a reasonable doubt that the accused acted in self defence) the judge must direct the jury on how to deal with it.\n\nFor a murder case, the direction must include:\n\n1. An acknowledgement that the law allows self defense.\n2. That the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused did not act in self defense\n3. The Crown may prove this by either: (a) the accused did not believe at the time that they were acting in self defence \\- if this is not proved, the appropriate verdict is \u201cnot guilty of murder\u201d, or (b) that the accused\u2019s acts were not a reasonable response to the circumstances *as they perceived them* \\- if this is not proved the appropriate verdict is \u201cnot guilty of manslaughter\u201d. However, if 3(a) is not proved but 3(b) is the appropriate verdict is \u201cnot guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter\u201d.\n4. In determining the issue of whether the accused personally believed that his or her conduct was necessary for self\\-defence, the jury must consider the circumstances as the accused perceived them to be at the time. For example, if the accused had an irrational fear of and belief in ghosts, that is a factor that tends towards self defence for Alice.\n\nPenalties\n---------\n\nThe maximum sentence for murder is life or 25 years imprisonment. The actual sentence depends on the severity of the crime and any mitigating circumstances in accordance with the [sentencing guidelines](https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/murder.html). For the circumstances you describe Alice cold expect 6\\-10 years if convicted.\n\nThere are different categories of [manslaughter](https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/sentencing/manslaughter.html), this one falls neatly into the excessive self defence category. In sentencing, the judge must explicitly decide if the convicted person intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm by their act or not.

Content\\-based speech regulation can be constitutional if it passes strict scrutiny, but in the case of banning swastikas, it would fall under an even narrower subset of content\\-based speech regulation called \"viewpoint regulation.\" I haven't found a case where the swastika or Nazi flag was banned in particular, but we can find reasoning that appears to safely protect the peaceful display of the Nazi flag and ideology from government restriction in [*Police Dept. of City of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92 (1972\\)*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/408/92/), a case in which Chicago banned picketing within 150 feet of a school except in the case of labor disputes related to the school. The Supreme Court found that this amounted to viewpoint\\-based discrimination, writing in the majority opinion:\n\n> But, above all else, the First Amendment means that government has no\n> power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its\n> subject matter, or its content\n\n> Necessarily, then, under the Equal Protection Clause, not to mention\n> the First Amendment itself, government may not grant the use of a\n> forum to people whose views it finds acceptable, but deny use to those\n> wishing to express less favored or more controversial views. And it\n> may not select which issues are worth discussing or debating in public\n> facilities.

Selective exclusions from a\n> public forum may not be based on content alone, and may not be\n> justified by reference to content alone.\n\nAs with all rights restrictions, a particular restriction may be Constitutional if it passes \"[strict scrutiny](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny),\" namely, it:\n\n> is necessary to a \"compelling state interest\";\n> \n> \n> is \"narrowly tailored\" to achieving this compelling purpose; and\n> \n> \n> uses the \"least restrictive means\" to achieve the purpose.\n\nIn general, a ban on the peaceful display of Nazi imagery or promotion of Nazi ideas would fail the first test, as the government does not have a compelling interest to suppress ideas which might be distasteful to some or even the majority of people.\n\nI have seen an argument that because the Nazi regime's stated goal included genocide, that promoting that ideology amounts to advocating violence. Speech which advocates violence or criminality may be criminalized, but only under a specific \"imminent lawless action\" test expressed in *[Brandenburg v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/395/444/)*:\n\n> Freedoms of speech and press do not permit a State to forbid advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\n\nThis case was brought against a KKK member who advocated various violent acts at a rally. The main distinction is that his speech did not call for specific violence, but merely advocated for it in general. This almost exactly mirrors the rationale for banning the Nazi ideology based on its advocacy of violence, and shows that a ban on such grounds would be unconstitutional. \"Imminent\" was clarified in *[Hess v. Indiana](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/414/105/)* to mean that the action must be intended to produce actual lawless action at a specific point in the future, not simply advocate for it in general. Hess was a protester who was being forced off a street by police, said \"We'll take the fucking street later\" and was convicted of disorderly conduct for it, which the court reversed as his statement \"amounted to nothing more than advocacy of illegal action at some indefinite future time\" and was therefore protected by the First Amendment."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small town in the United States passes an ordinance prohibiting the display of Nazi symbols, including swastikas, within city limits.

Based on the principles established in cases like Police Dept. of City of Chicago v. Mosley and Brandenburg v. Ohio, content-based restrictions on speech, especially those targeting specific viewpoints, are subject to strict scrutiny and are generally unconstitutional. The First Amendment protects even highly controversial or offensive speech, and the government cannot restrict expression solely based on its message or content. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, while Nazi ideology promotes violence, merely displaying symbols does not meet the \"imminent lawless action\" standard set in Brandenburg v. Ohio.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while local governments can impose some content-neutral restrictions on speech (like time and place regulations), they cannot engage in viewpoint discrimination.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the \"imminent lawless action\" standard requires a specific and immediate threat, not a general possibility of future harm.

At trial, prosecutors typically win convictions well over 50% of the time (although not too much more, because the more clear cases are either dismissed by prosecutors as unproveable prior to trial or are plea bargained).\n\nThe net effect of the current system is that the severity of the sentence imposed in the vast majority of cases is proportional to the probability of the prosecution prevailing at trial times the likely sentence if it does prevail, as evaluated mutually by the prosecution and the defense. When there is not a sufficient consensus on the fair sentence in light of those factors the rare trial happens (and more often than not the defense rather than the prosecution overestimates its chances).\n\nUnfortunately, this also means that the biggest penalties for going to trial are in the weakest cases in which the prosecution just barely manages to convince the jury and there is a strong probability that the defendant is actually innocent, as opposed to the cases where it is fairly clear that the defendant is guilty. And, people who are actually innocent of everything are most likely to roll the dice and go to trial, since people who are guilty of something know that in any fair resolution that are going to face the significant downsides of having any criminal conviction on their record, while people who are actually innocent may reasonably (although sometimes inaccurately) believe that the system will protect them and allow them to escape all consequences except the costs of defending themselves in court (if they can afford it).\n\nAnother option that prosecutors have in a case where proof beyond a reasonable doubt may be difficult or impossible, is to bring a civil lawsuit or to seek an administrative penalty, which may result in loss of a licenses or payment of a fine or compensation, rather than bringing criminal charges. In these cases, the prosecution only has to prove a case by a preponderance of the evidence in most cases, and usually, the defendant has no right to an attorney at public expense even if the defendant is indigent. These fines (or civil forfeitures) can also help fund the criminal justice system that pays prosecutors and other participants in the process.\n\nBelow that standard, prosecutors can seek search warrants, wire taps and arrest warrants in cases where there is merely probable cause to believe that a person committed a crime, which in addition to setting up future prosecutions can also be used as a form of punishment/harassment of someone prosecutors believe to be guilty of a crime even though they may not even have the evidence necessary to prove a civil suit, but the amount of impact that a search warrant, wire tap, or arrest can have on a suspect is much less than a full blowed prosecution."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of criminal law and plea bargaining, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between the strength of a prosecution's case and the likely outcome?\n\nA) When prosecutors have a strong case, they always insist on going to trial without offering any plea bargains.\n\nB) Prosecutors with weak cases typically offer the most significant concessions in plea bargaining, while those with strong cases offer minimal concessions.\n\nC) The severity of sentences is generally inversely proportional to the strength of the prosecution's case.\n\nD) Plea bargaining rates are consistently low across both federal and state systems, typically below 50%.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

The employee continues working for the company for several years. After a few years the company renews the employees contract for 8 more years at $75 an hour but continues to pay the employee $50 an hour and the employee never demands the higher salary.

One of my music tracks was licensed by a major Hollywood studio, and used in the trailer campaign for a major motion picture, so it received a lot of exposure online. On YouTube it received 21 million views. \n\nA person running a YouTube channel, with a Ukrainian address, ripped my music track from the internet, and synced it to their own video. I found it, and used the YouTube procedure to issue a copyright takedown notice. YouTube asked for proof that the music track is mine, I supplied that proof to them, YouTube accepted my proof, and took the infringing video down. \n\nSubsequently the owner of the video, in addition to sending me multiple abusive emails, has challenged my takedown notice using YouTube's counter notification process. YouTube have now sent me this notification:\n\n\"We have received the attached counter notification in response to a complaint that you filed with us. We're providing you with the counter notification and await evidence (in no more than 10 business days) that you've filed an action seeking a court order against the counter notifier to restrain the allegedly infringing activity. In most cases, such evidence would include a lawsuit against the uploader who filed the counter notification, which names the specific YouTube URL(s) at issue. If we do not receive notice from you, we may reinstate the material to YouTube.\"\n\nYouTube also included this statement from the owner of the infringing video in the counter\\-notification:\n\n\"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good\\-faith belief that the material was removed due to a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. I consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district in which my address is located or, if my address is outside the United States, the judicial district in which YouTube is located, and will accept service of process from the claimant.\"\n\nQUESTION 1\nSo it seems to me, that the video owner has said he will accept the jurisdiction of YouTube, which is the state of Californa So I don't have to try and bring a legal case in the Ukraine, which would be virtually impossible anyway. I could take action in California, which would likely be sufficient for YouTube to uphold my claim, keep the video offline, and uphold the copyright strike that I lodged. Is this correct, that I can take action in California and YouTube will accept that validity, because of the statement the copyright infringer has made about accepting that jurisdiction? \n\nQUESTION 2\nIf the answer to QUESTION 1 is yes, court action could be taken in California because the infringing party has stated he will accept that jurisdiction, is it then possible to inexpensively take the necessary court action that will satisfy YouTube's requirement for having \"filed an action seeking a court order against the counter notifier to restrain the allegedly infringing activity\". Would a small claims court action do the trick? I understand YouTube would be in the jurisdiction of San Monteo for small claims. Does anyone know\na) How much that would cost?\nb) Would the action be accepted by the San Monteo small claims court, if lodged by a company based in the UK?\nc) Would the small claims court accept a case against a defendant in the Ukraine, given the defendant already said they would accept the jurisdiction of the courts in YouTube's location?\nOn the San Monteo small claims court website I looked for an email address for someone to ask these questions to, but couldn't find one.\nThanks!\nR.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not obvious what the answer is. There are two fundamental questions \u2013 what will Youtube do in response to a particular action, and how can you put an end to the infringement? Youtube's response is driven by federal law, [17 USC 512](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512). There is some danger to Youtube that you could sue them for contributory infringement, and this law specifies the conditions under which they can be immunized against such a suit. Referring to the stage of the DMCA take down process that you are at, they will put the material back up\n\n> unless its designated agent first receives notice from the person who\n>  submitted the notification under subsection (c)(1\\)(C) that such person\n>  has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber\n>  from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the\n>  service provider\u2019s system or network.\n\nAs a prelude to filing such an action, the infringer must file\n\n> a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of\n>  Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address\n>  is located, or if the subscriber\u2019s address is outside of the United\n>  States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be\n>  found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the\n>  person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1\\)(C) or an\n>  agent of such person\n\nObserve that the person has to consent to *federal* jurisdiction, not state jurisdiction. \n\nSmall claims court is a state court (copyright small claims court does not yet exist). Under [28 USC 1338](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1338), \"No State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents, plant variety protection, or copyrights\". For the most part, [federal law preempts state law](http://ftp.documation.com/references/ABA10a/PDfs/1_1.pdf), but that guide might point to something about your case (an added right) that overcomes federal preemption. Supposing that that is the case, you might file a suit in state court over that added right: then, it is literally true that you \"filed an action seeking a court order to restrain\".\n\nYou could also just go ahead and file an action in [state court](http://copyrightsandcampaigns.blogspot.com/2009/08/can-you-sue-in-state-small-claims-court.html), because sometimes the court just does what it thinks is right, even if it doesn't have jurisdiction. Even if the suit is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, you will have \"filed an action seeking a court order to restrain\". However, Youtube may not be impressed, the way they would be if you picked Federal District Court.\n\nAt this point, your options (for getting the material taken down) require filing a suit against the infringer. You can file an infringement suit in the UK, but the material will probably be restored on Youtube until they eventually receive a court order demanding that the material be taken down. You can file a suit right now in the relevant federal court in California and notify Youtube, and they should leave the material taken down. Since you are not suing Youtube in small claims court and the infringer is also not in California, you could not sue in small claims court (*somebody* has to be in California) unless you are suing Youtube (and will lose because they cannot be sued, per safe harbor rules)."}, "answer": "Here is a multi-part exam question based on the given legal information:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based music creator discovers their copyrighted track has been used without permission on YouTube by a user in Ukraine.

For one thing, a ToS is probably not binding on the user based on a contract of adhesion such as \"by using this site you agree to...\". A specific act, such as clicking a checkbox that defaults to clicked or activating an \"I accept the terms\" button is probably required to make a ToS binding on the user.\n\nBut a host must do more that obtain an agreement to its ToS. Once it has actual knowledge of illegal content, a host must take action to remove or disable it, or else it may be liable as if it had posted the content itself.\n\nIt also depends what kind of \"something illegal\" is involved. The most common form is perhaps content that allegedly infringes copyright.\n\n### Safe Harbor\n\nIn the EU Article 14 of the EU [Directive on electronic commerce (Directive 2000/31/EC)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32000L0031&from=EN) will apply (note that being a directive, rather than a regulation, 2000/31/EC) depends on implementation in national law, which may vary from one country to another.\n\nArticle 14 reads:\n\n> Hosting\n> \n> \n> 1. Where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, Member States shall ensure that the service provider is not liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that:\n> \n> \n> (a) the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and, as regards claims for damages, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent; or\n> \n> \n> (b) the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information.\n> \n> \n> 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply when the recipient of the service is acting under the authority or the control of the provider.\n> 3. This Article shall not affect the possibility for a court or administrative authority, in accordance with Member States' legal systems, of requiring the service provider to terminate or prevent an infringement, nor does it affect the possibility for Member States of establishing procedures governing the removal or disabling of access to information.\n\nArticle 14 means that when a host obtains actual knowledge of infringing or otherwise illegal content, the host must promptly delete that content or disable access to it. Such knowledge could come via a takedown notice.\n\nAccording to the page [\"Copyright infringement and remedies in Germany\"](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=cef58d76-21a2-4071-9abd-05b001388494):\n\n> One of the main situations refers to platform operators. Once they have been informed about a specific infringement on their platform, they are required to remove the specific infringing content and to implement measures in order to prevent future violations.\n\nSee also the Wikipedia article [\"Notice and Take down\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_and_take_down#European_Union) which discusses Article 14, and points out that it does not define a specific notice and take down procedure, unlike the US provisions of 17 USC 512 (which includes the DMCA notice and take down procedure, and the related Safe Harbor provisions). Since Article 14 clearly envisages some sort of notice procedure, but not specific procedure has been defined in the laws of most EU member states, including Germany, some people use the US DMCA notice format, as describesd in [this article](https://se-legal.de/intellectual-property-lawyer-in-germany/dmca-takedown-notice-in-germany-legal-advice/?lang=en). Such a notice may serve to give a German host \"actual knowledge\" and impose liability if the host fails to respond promptly.\n\nThere have been recent legal cases which affect the procedures in such cases, as reported in [\"Copyright 'safe harbours' for service providers need to be consistent\"](https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/analysis/copyright-safe-harbours-for-service-providers-reform) from Pinsent Masons and [\"Germany: Time To Hit Pause: Copyright Infringement On User Generated Platforms \u2013 When Is The Platform Provider Liable For Damages?\"](https://www.mofo.com/resources/insights/190122-copyright-infringement.html) from Morrison \\& Foerster LLP.\n\nThe Morrison \\& Foerster article reads:\n\n> Previous rulings by the CJEU have addressed both the application of the safe harbor principle set out in the EU E\\-Commerce Directive1 that shields hosting providers from liability for hosted unlawful third\\-party content of which they have no actual knowledge and, separately, the extent of infringement of copyright by hosting of, or linking to, copyright infringing third\\-party content under the EU Copyright Directive. But it is still unclear under which conditions the providers of the various online platforms that store and make available user\\-generated content, can rely on the safe harbor privilege applying to hosting providers to avoid liability, or whether they must not only take down the infringing content when they obtain knowledge of such content but also compensate the rightsholders of such content for damages for copyright infringement.\n\nThe Pinsent Masons article reads:\n\n> \\[A] ruling last year by a German court has highlighted an anomaly in the way 'safe harbour' protections ISPs enjoy under EU law apply in the case of copyright enforcement. It has confirmed that applications for blocking orders and injunctive relief are treated differently, despite the economic effect of those measures being the same.\n> \n> \n> The safe harbour protections stem from the EU's E\\-Commerce Directive. That legislation prohibits service providers from being put under any general obligation to monitor for illegal activity by users of their service.\n> \n> \n> In addition, where the service providers are mere conduits to infringing activity by others, they cannot be held liable for that activity unless and until they obtain 'actual knowledge' of the activity. At that stage, a service provider must act expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information if they are not to be held liable themselves for infringement.\n> \n> \n> However, EU copyright law cuts into these 'safe harbour' protections. It makes clear that rights holders can apply for an injunction against intermediaries whose services are used by a third party to infringe copyright.\n> \n> \n> In Germany, however, changes made to the Telemedia Act in October 2017 have spurred debate over the admissibility and the requirements of blocking injunctions.\n\n### Other unlawful content\n\nOther sorts of illegal content are possible, such as neo\\-Nazi propaganda and Child Pornography, which are criminal under German law. In theory Article 14 applies to such content as well as to alleged copyright infringements. But since these are serious crimes, the degree of promptness expected from a host will probably be greater.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nA hosting provider will need, at the least, to respond to notices alleging copyright infringement or other illegal content, and provide an address to which such notices can be sent. A host might do well to implement the full DMCA takedown procedure. ToS provisions will not provide a shield against liability after a notice is sent to the host.\n\nA host may be required to block future access by those whose previous uploads have been found to be unlawful. This may require soem sort of log\\-in procedure.\n\nThus a simple ToS provision, as described in the question, particularly in the absence of any log\\-in mechanism, and of any enforcement of the ToS provisions, will not be enough to shield the host from liability for unlawful content posted by users."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A German website owner wants to create a file-sharing service where users can upload and share files without an account.

However, once they obtain such knowledge, they must act \"expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information.\" A simple Terms of Service agreement (option A) is not enough to avoid liability.

I declined their \"faster and more reliable internet\" (because it already **is** fast and reliable) and they told me they would keep my service and my bill the same ($42\\.74/mo). They said that as long as I don't change my plan, I'm grandfathered\\-in at the price and service I'm getting, and that there was nothing they could do about it.\n\nYesterday, I received a letter in the mail (from NewWave) stating, \"The internet service I subscribe to is being discontinued, and my service is being moved to a *comparable* service or plan.\" Same thing they tried to tell me before. That *comparable plan* takes me from 1000 GB Data Plan ($42\\.74/mo) to a lower 300GB plan ($55\\.00/mo) and if I go over the 300GB, they will charge me an EXTRA $10/mo for every 100GB I go over. They note that my actual monthly data usage for the Oct\\-Dec months has been 701GB. In what world is that a **comparable plan**? \n\nI called the number on the letter, and they said that NewWave Communications is being bought out by Cable ONE, and that this new company is going to charge me TWICE the amount for a \"new\" plan that I've always had because this new company says my plan doesn't exist. Look, my internet is just fine the way it is. Nobody is coming out to my house and re\\-wiring anything, and I'm not asking for anything more other than to leave me and my bill alone. Shouldn't this \"new\" company honor the price that I've had for years? I mean, AT\\&T and Verizon don't offer unlimited plans to people anymore, but the people who got on those plans before they changed what they offer weren't forced to get another plan, right? They are grandfathered\\-in. When Cable ONE acquires NewWave, don't they have to honor the previous agreements of the people that had them before they bought the company?\n\nI understand that this new company structures their plans differently. Fine. When they get new customers, that's what they'll have to pay, but I am NOT a new customer. I am the same customer, paying the same price (with apparently slower service than the rest of the world even though we can't tell and don't care to to know the difference), and I'm getting the same service I have always gotten. Just because Company A sold to Company B, what gives them the right to all of a sudden charge me double? I didn't ask for any of this, and as an honorable customer in good standing, I do not appreciate being treated like this.

In acquisitions, the acquiring company (Cable ONE) typically assumes the contracts and obligations of the acquired company (NewWave). However, these contracts are still subject to their original terms. If the original contract allows for modification or termination with proper notice, Cable ONE can exercise this right. The key is that they must adhere to the notice period and any other conditions specified in the original contract. This balances the company's right to adjust their business model with the customer's right to be informed and prepared for changes.

Rimini Street, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the court's position on violating website Terms of Service (ToS) in relation to computer access laws?\n\nA) Violating any aspect of a website's ToS is always a criminal offense under state computer access laws.\n\nB) Downloading data using a method prohibited by ToS, when the downloading itself is generally permitted, does not violate state computer access laws.\n\nC) The court ruled that all public endpoints, regardless of authorization requirements, are open for unrestricted use.\n\nD) The ruling definitively established that violating ToS can never be the basis for any legal action, criminal or civil.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The court's ruling specifically addressed the situation where a user downloads data using a method prohibited by the Terms of Service, but where the act of downloading itself is generally permitted. The court held that this does not violate state computer access laws like the California Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA) or the Nevada Computer Crimes Law (NCCL).\n\nOption A is incorrect because the court did not rule that all ToS violations are criminal offenses. In fact, the ruling suggests the opposite for certain types of violations.\n\nOption C overstates the court's ruling. The decision was specific to the case at hand and did not make a blanket statement about all public endpoints being open for unrestricted use.\n\nOption D is also an overstatement. While the court ruled against Oracle on the computer access law claims, it did not establish that violating ToS can never be the basis for any legal action. In fact, Oracle prevailed on other claims in the same case, such as copyright infringement.\n\nThe correct answer, B, accurately reflects the court's specific holding regarding downloading data in a manner prohibited by ToS when the downloading itself is generally allowed."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83497/how-to-legally-publish-a-nes-famicom-rom-wrapped-in-an-emulator-app-for-another", "docs_id": 83497, "title": "How to legally publish a NES/Famicom ROM wrapped in an emulator app for another platform?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say I want to publish a [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) game and I've written the game and it's in [.nes](https://fileinfo.com/extension/nes) [ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROM_image) format (I haven't, but let's pretend hypothetically). And I want this software to run on modern platforms like iOS / macOS / Android / Nintendo Switch / Steam / Playstation / etc. So I write a wrapper app/[virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine)/[emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator) (pick the term you like) that serves to run the ROM and also enable some networked [multiplayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game) functionality and so forth.\n\nWill Nintendo most likely litigate because I used their proprietary (albeit retro/dated/discontinued) format?\n\nAnd if legal issues are likely to crop up, is it best to **(A)** contact Nintendo directly to work out some sort of licensing deal or **(B)** just make some other [8\\-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_computing) format that is very similar to (but just different enough from) the NES format?\n\nFrom a [retro gaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrogaming) purist standpoint, certainly the look/sound/feel of the original NES format would be preferred over a format designed to recreate or approximate it.\n\nI understand that when I phrase a question as \"will... most likely...?\" it invites opinion\\-based answers. But even opinion\\-based answers would be appreciated because this question is based on a hypothetical scenario that has not happened. If someone could answer, for example: \"You're screwed because Nintendo can sue you based on *x* premise.\" or \"You can probably do this safely because of yada\\-yada clause in blah\\-blah law...\" that would still be helpful and I would accept it as an answer.\n\nNote: There is [a question similar to mine](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66646/), and the answer is essentially \"they'll probably sue you *if* you're making money from it\". But I'm not really satisfied with that, so I'm forming a slightly more detailed and more comprehensive question.\n\nIt is possible Nintendo has released some kind of official statement (and possibly even a licensing program) regarding this matter that I am just not aware of. In that case a link to this in the answer would be appreciated.\n\nAlso, should we take into consideration that if the game is published for Nintendo's current console ([Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch)), that Nintendo would stand to gain some profit from the release anyway and be less likely to complain about the intricacies of what technologies were utilized in the game's creation?\n\nFurthermore, modern games are usually made with a [game engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_engine) such as [Unreal Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Engine) or [Unity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)), and a license fee is usually owed to the creators of the engine by the game developers. The .nes format is not exactly the product of a game engine, but more like the product of low\\-level [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). Sure, there are authoring tools like [NESmaker](https://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/) that *might* sort of fall under the category of \"game engine\"... not really sure. And when you consider how low\\-level the coding for the NES is, it's not even clear to what extent the ownership of that technology can really be attributed to Nintendo. It may be the case that any .nes file I create is entirely mine, in the same way that any .psd file I make using [Photoshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop) belongs to me (not Adobe). But this kind of software law stuff is obviously not my area of expertise, which is why I am asking here.\n\nFinally, would releasing the .nes file for free possibly lessen the likelihood of becoming a target for litigation based on the premise that anyone can \"steal\" my game and run it on an emulator, but what customers are paying for with the app is essentially the convenience of running that file on their hardware of choice?\n\nThis is mostly a question out of curiosity, but as someone who appreciates retro games and is considering dabbling in game dev, I would like to know. Thanks.\n\n**Edit:** Come to think of it, there are titles such as [Namco Museum](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/namco-museum-switch/) being released on Switch and obviously were originally written for NES, so wrapping NES games for a modern console is a current practice. Whether Namco had to pay anything extra to Nintendo to release this title is anyone's guess. It is also possible in Namco's case that they had some existing license deal established from when they first released the games decades ago.\n\nRelated links:\n\n[Is It Legal To Develop Homebrew NES Games?](http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=5177)\n\n[Why people are still making NES games](https://www.eurogamer.net/why-people-are-still-making-nes-games) \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Emulators are legal. They've been legal since courts ruled in favor of [Bleem!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleem!), a commercial PlayStation emulator, in the 90s (though the company that made it still went out of business thanks to the lawsuit). Furthermore, [Micro Mages](http://morphcat.de/micromages/), an NES game developed in the modern age that received a physical cartridge release, is currently available on Steam and itch.io as a packaged emulator version. All three releases additionally come with a standalone copy of the game ROM that can be played in an emulator of your choice. There is also nothing illegal about making a game not licensed by Nintendo for such consoles (most famously done by the Christian game developer [Wisdom Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_Tree)); in fact, Micro Mages is not licensed by Nintendo either. Such games cannot use Nintendo trademarks, of course, but the only actions Nintendo has historically been able to take against distributors of such games otherwise is to stop doing or refuse to do business with them.\n\nNote the parody of the [Nintendo Seal of Quality](https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Official_Nintendo_Seal) on the Micro Mages box art: ![Micro Mages box art with parody of the Nintendo Quality Seal](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/51/Micro_Mages.png))"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A game developer creates a new video game using the NES format and wants to release it on modern platforms. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) The developer must obtain a license from Nintendo before releasing any game in NES format, regardless of the platform.\n\nB) The developer can legally release the game with an emulator on modern platforms, as long as they don't use Nintendo trademarks.\n\nC) The developer can only release the game if it's approved and licensed by Nintendo for their current console.\n\nD) The developer must use a different 8-bit format that is similar to but legally distinct from the NES format to avoid litigation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, emulators have been ruled legal since the Bleem! case in the 1990s. Modern NES-style games like Micro Mages have been released on platforms like Steam and itch.io using emulators without legal issues. Developers can create and distribute games for NES-era consoles without Nintendo's permission, as long as they don't use Nintendo's trademarks. The key is to avoid using protected intellectual property while still utilizing the technical format. Option A is incorrect because licensing isn't required for the format itself. Option C is false because approval from Nintendo isn't necessary for releasing on other platforms. Option D isn't required, as using the NES format itself isn't illegal."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30408/probate-must-or-bust", "docs_id": 30408, "title": "Probate Must Or Bust?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: 1.

In Oregon, probate is required for assets that do not have a beneficiary designation or survivorship provision. The house and bank account are considered probate assets and must go through the probate process. However, the life insurance policy has a named beneficiary and is therefore not part of the probate estate. It can be distributed directly to the beneficiary without going through probate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because paying off debts doesn't automatically allow the estate to avoid probate. The presence of probate assets (house and bank account) necessitates the probate process.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Oregon does not have a simplified probate process for estates under $500,000.
