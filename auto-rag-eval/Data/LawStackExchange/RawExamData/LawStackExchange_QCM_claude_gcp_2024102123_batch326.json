I am in Israel but my business is international.\n\nCompany status: Dissolved.\n\nNote that the nature of the business is different for that dissolved company and for me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, trademarks need to be in continued use to be protected, and if the company that used a name is dissolved in the place where it was organized, it is probably fair to assume that it is no longer in use.\n\nBut, to some extent, the legal steps that the company took to protect it's name and brands matters. There are several different regimes of legal protection of intellectual property rights in company names and trademarks.\n\nWhat happened when the company dissolved also matters.\n\nFor example, the Buick automobile manufacturing company hasn't existed as a separate company from General Motors, since General Motors acquired it and the right to use its brand and names roughly a century ago. But even though the Buick company was dissolved, someone else acquired the right to use the name to sell cars, so anyone else trying to use the Buick company name to sell cars could be sued by General Motors.\n\nIf you used their name, could you think of anyone who could claim that they were unjustly harmed by your use of the name to sell the same kinds of goods that they did? If so, there is real legal risk. If not, you are probably in the clear.\n\nSince the nature of the business is, according to the question different, it seems likely that this wouldn't be a problem.",

The nature of the new business is different from that of the dissolved company. Under what circumstances would it likely be legally permissible to use this name?\n\nA) It's always legal to use the name of any dissolved company, regardless of circumstances.\nB) It's only permissible if the dissolved company was based in Israel.\nC) It's likely permissible if no one can claim they would be unjustly harmed by the use of the name, and the trademark is no longer in use.\nD) It's only permissible if the new business operates in the exact same industry as the dissolved company.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, it's generally acceptable to use the name of a dissolved company if the trademark is no longer in active use and if no one can claim they would be unjustly harmed by its use. The key factors are whether the trademark has been maintained and whether any entity acquired the rights to the name during or after the company's dissolution. The fact that the new business has a different nature from the dissolved company further reduces the likelihood of potential conflicts. Options A and B are incorrect as they oversimplify the issue, while D is incorrect because operating in the same industry would actually increase the risk of conflict rather than make it more permissible."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this arrangement?\n\nA) This is clearly illegal and constitutes criminal bribery of a public official.\nB) This is legal as long as Senator Smith doesn't receive any of the money and is unaware of the payment.\nC) This is likely legal, but Alex may be in violation of lobbying registration laws depending on the jurisdiction.\nD) This is only legal if the $5,000 is donated to Senator Smith's official campaign fund.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The scenario described is likely not illegal in most cases, as it doesn't involve criminal bribery (which requires an official action or inaction in exchange for payment). However, Alex's actions could potentially violate lobbying registration laws, depending on the specific jurisdiction's requirements. The arrangement doesn't constitute bribery because Senator Smith is unaware of the payment and is not being asked to perform any official acts. Option B is close but doesn't account for potential lobbying law violations.

In cases where there is a need for immediate action to prevent potential harm, and a full examination of evidence would take too long, courts may issue a preliminary injunction. This temporary measure can be implemented quickly to maintain the status quo until a more thorough legal review can be conducted.\n\nA) Res judicata is incorrect. This principle prevents the re-litigation of matters that have already been judged, which doesn't apply to this situation.\n\nC) Stare decisis refers to the doctrine of precedent in legal decisions, which isn't directly relevant to the immediate prevention of information disclosure.\n\nD) Respondeat superior is a doctrine that holds an employer responsible for the actions of employees, which is not applicable to this media injunction scenario.\n\nThe preliminary injunction allows the court to act swiftly to prevent potential damage (in this case, the release of Philip Green's name) while giving time for a more comprehensive legal examination. This explains how the media could be temporarily restrained despite not being party to the original NDAs."

I could not think of a concise and accurate way to phrase it.\n\nI will phrase this question in terms of charitable trusts, but my question is really about the general principle. I am assuming that the particular statutes which apply to the given situation are silent on this issue.\n\nLet's say we have a charitable trust. It is determined (by a regulator or a court of first instance) that the trust is invalid. Let's call this point A in time. At point A, it is as if the trust has never existed (which means we have a resulting trust back to the settlor). The trustees appeal. If they lose, then nothing changes \\- the trust never existed. If they win, then the trust has always existed. Let's call this point B in time.\n\nMy question is, how do the trustees figure out what their legal duties are between point A and B? What happens if they do something during this time which would be considered a breach of trust if the charitable trust is reinstated? What if they are legally compelled to do so e.g. the beneficiary of the resulting trust asks for his money back. If there is no charitable trust, then the trustees cannot refuse the request. On the other hand, if the charitable trust is reinstated then they have spent charitable funds on a non\\-charitable purpose.\n\nWhat is the general principle? How should you behave when you are in situation X, but the outcome of an appeal could mean that you are retrospectively in situation Y, and you are faced with a conflicting set of rules for a given action during the interim?\n\nIdeally I would like a UK specific answer, but would also welcome more general answers based on common law systems.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Ohwilleke's answer (i.e. 'there isn't a simple answer') covers the general principles clearly. But for your specific situation (England and Wales, appeal to the High Court Chancery Division or Court of Appeal), the answer is \"Do nothing irrevocable if possible; if necessary, apply for interim directions to the Court\". The Chancery Masters are used to this sort of application, and though *somebody* will presumably be diappointed by the decision, the trustees have no liability.",

What is the most appropriate course of action for the trustees during the period between the initial ruling and the appeal decision?\n\nA) Continue operating the trust as if it were still valid, ignoring the lower court's ruling\nB) Immediately dissolve the trust and return all assets to the settlor\nC) Apply for interim directions from the Chancery Masters of the Court\nD) Take no action whatsoever until the appeal is decided\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate action for trustees in this situation is to apply for interim directions from the Chancery Masters of the Court. This approach allows the trustees to seek guidance on how to proceed during the uncertain period between the initial ruling and the appeal decision. The Chancery Masters are experienced in handling such applications and can provide legally binding instructions that protect the trustees from liability. This course of action helps avoid taking any irrevocable steps that could be problematic if the appeal decision reverses the initial ruling. Options A and B could lead to potential breaches of duty depending on the appeal outcome, while option D may not be feasible if action is required during the interim period."

The specific wording comes from EU consumer rights law.\n\nConsumers \\- ordinary members of the public who buy products and services \\- have certain legal rights that businesses don't. The theory is that what's going on when you buy a TV for your house is different from what's going on when you buy 1000 TVs for your hotel chain. The appropriate remedies and processes if you're dissatisfied are different. By asking you to identify yourself as *not a consumer*, the idea is that you wouldn't be able to use consumer rights law in the event you find Google's services to be defective, too expensive, not matching the advertising, etc.\n\nIn the UK's transposition of EU law, the onus is on the trader (Google) to prove that you are not a consumer, in any legal proceedings. If they can point to you ticking a box saying that you are not a consumer, the argument is much easier for them to make.\n\nEU legislation using this phrase, or nearly, includes \\-\n\n* [Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A31993L0013), Article 2\n\n> \u2018consumer\u2019 means any natural person who, in contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business or profession;  \n> \n> \u2018seller or supplier\u2019 means any natural or legal person who, in contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes relating to his trade, business or profession, whether publicly owned or privately owned.\n* [Council Directive 85/577/EEC of 20 December 1985 to protect the consumer in respect of contracts negotiated away from business premises](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A31985L0577), Article 2\n\n> \u2018consumer\u2019 means a natural person who, in transactions covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which can be regarded as outside his trade or profession;   \n> \n> \u2018trader\u2019 means a natural or legal person who, for the transaction in question, acts in his commercial or professional capacity, and anyone acting in the name or on behalf of a trader.\n* [Directive 2011/83/EU on consumer rights](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32011L0083), the main current directive on this topic, Article 2\n\n> \u2018consumer\u2019 means any natural person who, in contracts covered by this Directive, is acting for purposes which are outside his trade, business, craft or profession;   \n> \n> \u2018trader\u2019 means any natural person or any legal person, irrespective of whether privately or publicly owned, who is acting, including through any other person acting in his name or on his behalf, for purposes relating to his trade, business, craft or profession in relation to contracts covered by this Directive\n* [Directive 2019/770 of 20 May 2019 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32019L0770), specially relevant to the Google service, makes the same definitions as in the Directive of 2011\\.\n\nNational legislation implementing these directives uses the same phrases in English. For example:\n\n* the UK's [Consumer Rights Act 2015, s.2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/2/enacted) has \"trade, business, craft, or profession\"\n* in Ireland, the [Consumer Rights Act 2007, s.2](https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2007/act/19/section/2/enacted/en/html#sec2) uses \"trade, business or profession\"; and the [draft Consumer Rights Bill](https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/bills/bill/2022/44/) currently before the Oireachtas uses \"trade, business, craft, or profession\", reflecting the most recent EU wording.\n* in Malta, [Chapter 378](https://legislation.mt/eli/cap/378/eng/pdf) of the consolidated laws also reflects the EU terminology.",

This distinction is crucial because it affects the legal rights and protections available to the user. By confirming they are using Firebase for business purposes, the developer is effectively waiving certain consumer rights that would otherwise apply under EU consumer protection laws. This allows companies like Google (which owns Firebase) to treat the user as a business entity in any potential legal disputes, limiting the user's ability to invoke consumer protection regulations. The wording is specifically derived from EU directives that define the difference between consumers and traders/businesses in the context of contract law and digital services."

Using some other firm's mark would not be trademark infringement if one did not try to sell the item. If the logo was complex enough to be protectable by copyright, copying it might be copyright infringement, but for such personal use it might fall under an exception to copyright, depending on the country. In any case a copyright infringement suit in such a case seems unlikely.\n\nFor a car, registration is generally required, and must accurately specify the make and model.

He removes the Toyota logos and replaces them with BMW logos. He doesn't intend to sell the car or misrepresent its make to authorities. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of John's actions?\n\nA) John's actions are completely legal as long as he doesn't try to sell the car or misrepresent its make to authorities or insurance companies.\n\nB) John's actions are illegal because removing and replacing logos always constitutes trademark infringement, regardless of intent to sell.\n\nC) John's actions are legal with respect to trademark law, but he may be infringing on BMW's copyright if their logo is complex enough to be protected by copyright.\n\nD) John's actions are legal, but he must inform his insurance company of the logo change to avoid potential fraud charges.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, removing a trademark from an item you own is legal, and using another firm's mark would not be trademark infringement if there's no intent to sell the item. However, if the BMW logo is complex enough to be protected by copyright, John might be infringing on BMW's copyright by reproducing it, even for personal use. The answer also correctly notes that John's actions are legal with respect to trademark law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't address the potential copyright issue. Option B is incorrect because removing and replacing logos for personal use is not automatically trademark infringement. Option D is incorrect because John doesn't need to inform his insurance company about cosmetic changes that don't affect the car's make, model, or performance, as long as he correctly reports the actual make and model when required."

For instance, a very common reason for having a joint account is when two people are married. Being married often involves mutual financial obligations, but not because of the joint account. Another reason for having a joint account is if the people involved are in a partnership. Partners are all liable for partnership obligations, but are usually not liable for the obligation of another partner that are not part of the partnership business.\n\nIn short it depends on **why** the joint account exits. merely having such an account will not make one liable, but what ever relationship caused two people to have a joint account **might** also involve shares liabilities, but not just because of the joint account.",

If Sarah and John are business partners, she could be liable for partnership obligations. The joint account itself doesn't create liability, but the underlying relationship might.

What would they accomplish by achieving that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The principal difference between as assured tenancy and an assured shorthold tenancy concerns section 21 (\"no fault\") evictions. ASTs have them; ATs don't.\n\nFor an AT, an eviction can **only** occur if one or more of the grounds listed in [schedule 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/2) is met \\- most commonly, non\\-payment of rent.\n\nThere are other minor differences. For example, [section 22](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/22) allows a tenant to apply to a tribunal if they feel that the rent is too high. This only applies to ASTs. Also for ASTs, there are a number of requirements that the landlord must adhere to before he can issue a section 21 notice, including giving the tenant gas and electricity safety certificates, protecting any deposit in an official deposit scheme, etc.\n\nAs the question states, the landlord can opt to make the tenancy an AT either before or during the tenancy ([schedule 2A](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/schedule/2A), sections 1 and 2, respectively).\n\nAs to why a landlord might do this: I've been unable to find any concrete examples. If we want to speculate: perhaps the landlord has let to a friend, and wants to ensure that the friend can continue to rent the property for as long as they want, even if the landlord sells the property with the tenant still present, or if the landlord dies and the property is inherited by someone else.\n\nUsing an AT would protect the tenant from a section 21 eviction from a future landlord...though a property with a sitting tenant \\- let alone one who can't easily be removed \\- would make it very hard to sell.",

Long story short, it was going to be somewhat straightforward to have the insurance pay out policy limit. So we (the family) did it ourselves and got the policy limit. Based on advice from lawyers (none retained, just consultations) they were pretty unanimous in stating the policy limit was about as good as we could do given likely lack of assets from the elderly driver.\n\nOK, got the settlement check. Now Medicare wants their piece (as expected). We have a couple more weeks to respond to the demand letter. Even though we didn't have legal counsel/fees, it wasn't \"free\" for us to get this settlement. I spent a great deal of hours researching, writing a demand letter, talking with insurance company, etc. So, that was a cost to our family. Is there a preferred/persuasive way to document this to count it in our procurement costs? Right now in the demand letter the procurement costs are \"$0\" since we didn't have counsel/fees.\n\nMy approach is going to be to document the hours I and my wife spent procuring the settlement and then consider some reasonable hourly rate for that effort. We obviously didn't \"charge\" my mother\\-in\\-law, but we also didn't spend all that time to save the 33% legal fees to just turn it over to Medicare.

Family members cannot charge for their time spent on the case, as this could be considered unauthorized practice of law. The documentation mentions that out-of-pocket costs like photocopying and postage charges might be creditable.

The ones who want to disclaim now also want to do so to help the same beneficiary.\n\n**Original Question**\n\nConsider a situation where:\n\n1. There are many beneficiaries for an inheritance.\n2. Some of the beneficiaries disclaim while the grantor is alive.\n3. A decade passes and the grantor dies.\n4. The beneficiaries who did not disclaim earlier want to disclaim now.\n\nDo all disclaimers have to be \"brought up to date,\" or is it OK that the disclaimers were executed over many years, and some while the grantor was alive and some when the grantor is dead?\n\nIf this varies by state, then the state of interest is Utah.\n\nDoes everyone need to **dis**claim within a similar timeframe (such as within 12 months), or can substantial time elapse between disclaimers (such as years or even decades)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What Is A Disclaimer?\n=====================\n\nA disclaimer is an unequivocal and irrevocable rejection of a donative transfer of property, such as a gift or inheritance, without providing any direction or guidance regarding who will receive it in lieu of the disclaimer beneficiary of the transfer.\n\nIn other words, even if someone leaves you something in their will, you can refuse to accept it.\n\nWhy Would Someone Make A Disclaimer?\n====================================\n\nThere are a variety of reasons someone might disclaim an inheritance.\n\n* A disclaimer might reduce the amount of taxes owed related to the property disclaimed in the long run. The specifics of the tax laws that could cause this to be the case are beyond the scope of this answer.\n* The person disclaiming the inheritance might have large outstanding debts that would lead to an imminent bankruptcy, such that the inheritance would just go to their creditors any way.\n* The property inherited might have negative value before, for example, it is a toxic waste site that any owner of the property would have to clean up at the owner's expense.\n* The property inherited might have negative emotional value to the person disclaiming it, for example, a firearm that was used by the decedent to kill their mother.\n* Inheriting the property might disqualify the person receiving it from essential government benefits such as Medicaid coverage for a seriously ill person who could not obtain insurance otherwise and could not pay the medical bills that could have to be paid with the inherited assets since those assets are not worth much or are to illiquid to be sold in time to pay for necessary medical care.\n* Inheriting the property might cause financial aid grants for someone in college to drop so much that almost all of the inheritance would be consumed by increased tuition bills.\n* The person receiving the inheritance might believe that the person who will receive it if a disclaimer is made (i.e. the person who would have received it if the person making the disclaimer had predeceased the decedent leaving the inheritance), needs the inheritance more than the person who is entitled to it.\n\nOnly Property Interests That Exist Can Be Disclaimed\n====================================================\n\nYou can't disclaim the mere possibility that someone might leave you a gift or inheritance in the future, there has to be some presently existing right to give up before it can be disclaimed. (The technical name for a possibility like this is an \"expectancy\".) So, you can't disclaim an inheritance (which is a right that comes into being only when someone dies) while they are still alive, although you could disclaim an interest as a beneficiary in a trust that exists already but only takes effect when someone dies.\n\nSo, a disclaimer of an inheritance made before someone dies is meaningless and basically \"doesn't count\". Describing a timely disclaimer following an ineffective disclaimer made during life as bringing the disclaimer up to date isn't really a very accurate description of what is going on, but yes, disclaimers made prior to death do need to be \"brought up to date.\"\n\nAn Aside: What Is An Inheritance?\n=================================\n\nThe narrow meaning of \"inheritance\" is property received as a result of the death of someone who doesn't have a will, in contrast to a \"devise\" which is property received from someone who died under their will.\n\nBut, often the word \"inheritance\" is used in a broader sense that includes property received both from intestate and testate estates \\- i.e. both from decedents who do and from decedents do not have wills.\n\nA very broad sense of \"inheritance\" includes all major donative transfers even if they take the form of lifetime transfers, beneficiary designations, jointly owned property, or trust distributions, but this very broad sense is less common.\n\nNormally, the terms \"grantor\" and \"beneficiary\" are used to refer to a person who creates a trust and who is entitled to benefits from a trust, rather than in connection with an inheritance. But, the tags \"wills\" and \"probate\" were attached to he question, which would be inconsistent with the existence of a trust. So, it isn't entirely clear what is really meant by the question.\n\nDisclaimer Deadlines For Federal Tax Purposes\n=============================================\n\nMost disclaimers, historically, were done for tax purposes and needed to be made within the nine month deadline from date of death for filing an estate tax return established by the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe IRS deadline is found at [26 USC \u00a7 2518](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/2518) as clarified by [Treasury Regulation \u00a7 25\\.2518\\-2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/25.2518-2).\n\nDisclaimer Deadlines Under State Law\n====================================\n\nMost states followed the IRS lead when they set deadlines for making disclaimers under state law (which governs whether, how and when it is possible to disclaim since a state does not have to allow disclaimers in every situation that the IRS does but can allow disclaimers that the IRS does not recognize as valid for tax purposes to have validity for other state law purposes). The current trend is for states to adopt more flexible rules as, for example, is the case in Colorado.\n\nIn Utah, however, disclaimers are governed by Utah Code \u00a7 75\\-2\\-801, which tracks the IRS requirements for making a valid disclaimer for tax purposes. This lengthy statute has a lot of rules governing the mechanics of how a disclaimer is done, rules about when you can be disqualified from making a disclaimer, and how to count the deadlines, but the primary portions of that statute governing the deadlines which establish the nine month deadline are subsection (2\\)(a) and (2\\)(b):\n\n> (2\\) The following rules govern the time when a disclaimer shall be\n> filed or delivered:\n> \n> \n> (a) If the property or interest has devolved to the disclaimant under\n> a testamentary instrument or by the laws of intestacy, the disclaimer\n> shall be filed, if of a present interest, **not later than nine months\n> after the death of the deceased owner or deceased donee of a power of\n> appointment** and, if of a future interest, **not later than nine\n> months after the event determining that the taker of the property or\n> interest is finally ascertained and his interest is indefeasibly\n> vested.** The disclaimer shall be filed in the district court of the\n> county in which proceedings for the administration of the estate of\n> the deceased owner or deceased donee of the power have been commenced.\n> A copy of the disclaimer shall be delivered in person or mailed by\n> registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to any\n> personal representative or other fiduciary of the decedent or donee of\n> the power.\n> \n> \n> (b) If a property or interest has devolved to the disclaimant under a\n> nontestamentary instrument or contract, the disclaimer shall be\n> delivered or filed, if of a present interest, **not later than nine\n> months after the effective date of the nontestamentary instrument or\n> contract** and, if of a future interest, **not later than nine months\n> after the event determining that the taker of the property or interest\n> is finally ascertained and his interest is indefeasibly vested.** If\n> the person entitled to disclaim does not know of the existence of the\n> interest, the disclaimer shall be delivered or filed **not later than\n> nine months after the person learns of the existence of the\n> interest.** The effective date of a revocable instrument or contract\n> is the date on which the maker no longer has power to revoke it or to\n> transfer to the maker or another the entire legal and equitable\n> ownership of the interest. The disclaimer or a copy thereof shall be\n> delivered in person or mailed by registered or certified mail, return\n> receipt requested, to the person who has legal title to or possession\n> of the interest disclaimed.\n\nAnother Key Limitation On When A Disclaimer Can Be Made\n=======================================================\n\nIn addition to these deadline requirements, under federal law and the law of every state, a disclaimer must be made before the person entitled to receive the gift or inheritance takes any action which is inconsistent with a disclaimer such as receiving an economic benefit from the property that the person making the disclaimer would like to disclaim.",

Would this paperwork be need to sent to a federal agency or remains internal to the managers/shareholders of the LLC?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The LLC is a registered organization with the Commonwealth of Virginia. There is nothing you would do with a federal agency regarding transferring ownership of the LLC.\n\nYou will probably need to see an attorney or use a legal service in order to affect a transfer. The reason for this is that the specific articles of organization of your LLC will determine if and how you would transfer ownership. If you don't have buy\\-sell provisions in your articles of organization then Virginia law would dictate how the transfer would proceed.\n\nSome sites, such as [LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/how-to-transfer-ownership-of-an-llc), talk about how to transfer ownership of an LLC. It may be as simple as creating a bill of sale transferring ownership of the LLC from you to your wife. It may be more complicated based on your operating agreement, if it includes buy\\-sell provisions, and or Virginia law.\n\nOther [web sites](http://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/sell-llc-membership-bill-of-sale.html) talk about how easy it is to transfer ownership. However, they also recommend the use of an attorney.\n\nIf you read [Virginia law](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodepopularnames/virginia-limited-liability-company-act/) and the [Secretary of State's](https://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/dom_llc.aspx) website you will find forms such as the [Articles of Amendment](https://www.scc.virginia.gov/publicforms/329/llc1014.pdf) for an LLC. An attorney can tell you if all you need to do is amend your operating agreement and then do a bill\\-of\\-sale transfer.\n\nBecause the transfer is dependent on so many things that are not obvious, e.g. articles of organization, Virginia law, etc., it would be best to seek the advice of an attorney or some other legal service that specializes in LLCs for your locale.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the process of transferring LLC ownership in this situation?\n\nA) John can simply change the registered agent to his wife's name with the Virginia State Corporation Commission (SCC) to transfer ownership.\n\nB) John needs to file paperwork with a federal agency to officially transfer LLC ownership to his wife.\n\nC) The process for transferring ownership depends on the LLC's articles of organization and may require amending the operating agreement, creating a bill of sale, and potentially filing Articles of Amendment with the Virginia SCC.\n\nD) Changing the registered agent and verbally agreeing to transfer ownership is sufficient to make John's wife the 100% owner of the LLC.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the process of transferring LLC ownership in Virginia depends on several factors, including the LLC's articles of organization and operating agreement. Simply changing the registered agent (A) is not sufficient to transfer ownership. The transfer is a state-level matter, not federal, so B is incorrect. Verbal agreement and changing the registered agent (D) are not enough to legally transfer ownership. The most accurate answer is C, which acknowledges that the process may involve amending the operating agreement, creating a bill of sale, and potentially filing Articles of Amendment with the Virginia SCC, depending on the specific circumstances of the LLC and Virginia law."

I only plan to use these recordings for personal use (i.e. not going to sell it or post on the internet). I understand that Florida is a two\\-party consent state (which means that all parties must consent to recording), but I've also seen sources [\\[1]](https://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2015/09/is-it-legal-to-record-your-teachers-or-professors.html) that say that Florida courts do not apply this law to places with no \"reasonable expectation of privacy.\"\n\n**My questions are**:\n\n* Does a public institution (public school) count as a place without a \"reasonable expectation of privacy?\"\n* The NLRB ruled against banning recording in a workplace[\\[3]](https://www.nlrb.gov/case/01-CA-096965). Does this extend to schools?\n* In my case, can I legally record my professor?\n\n**Sources**:\n\n[\\[1]](https://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2015/09/is-it-legal-to-record-your-teachers-or-professors.html)  \n\n[\\[2]](https://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/934.03) Fla.

United Food and Commercial Workers\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under a \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" analysis, you would probably not run into any problems with respect to the state's wiretapping laws. Professors are speaking to large groups of people, and they probably do so with doors open from time to time, or loudly enough to be heard through the doors, undercutting any expectation of privacy.\n\nBut I suspect you might run into problems in terms of trespassing. I don't know Florida's laws, but they are frequently written to cover people who remain in a place while doing something that they know is against the rules for being in that place. More frequently, this applies to someone who comes gets into a fight inside someone else's house \\-\\- they might have been invited in, but once they started beating the homeowner, they should have known that they were no longer welcome. Your case is not as egregious, but the egregiousness is not the point. You're not allowed to be recording lectures in the classroom, so you're not allowed in the classroom if you're recording.\n\nOf course, beyond the questions of criminal law, there's also the question of complying with school policies, which I would expect to be the more likely avenue for disciplinary action.\n\nBeyond all that is the question of whether the First Amendment permits either kind of criminal penalty, so the fact that this is a public institution *does* make a difference. There's a decent argument that enforcing either of these laws to your situation would violate your First Amendment rights to receive or disseminate information \\-\\- analogize it to recording a police interaction \\-\\- but I supsect you'd have a difficult time turning that argument into anything helpful without the assistance of a lawyer.",

The recording likely doesn't violate wiretapping laws due to the public nature of lectures, but it could potentially be considered trespassing if it violates school rules.

Does the quoted comment hold water?\n\n(In case this is helpful: here is a succinct outline of the context that led to this question: [https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334399/summing\\-up\\-the\\-main\\-issues\\-the\\-story\\-so\\-far](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334399/summing-up-the-main-issues-the-story-so-far))\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is it true that a suit of defamation could require \u201cvery little effort\u201d?\n\nNo. Definitely not. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation#Defamation_per_se) (and understandably the [comment](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334551/an-apology-to-our-community-and-next-steps/334605#comment1096011_334605) on which it is premised) leaves out many details about substantive and procedural law which are essential in US jurisdictions.\n\nFor instance, the \\[Wikipedia] item of \"*1\\. accusing someone of a crime*\" is insufficient for the falsehoods to be considered *defamation per se*. The crime of which one is falsely accused needs to be considered an *infamous crime* or involve moral turpitude. Under \\[US] defamation law, a crime is deemed serious or infamous when it is classified as felony or its punishment could exceed one year of prison. The case law cited in [*Lakin v. Rund*, 896 N.W.2d 76 (2016\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/inmico20161202231) reflects how this criterion is uniform among US jurisdictions.\n\nAnother difficult issue in defamation lawsuits is the need to prove the defendant's mental state known as *actual malice*. Even where there is clear proof of a defamer's actual malice, a plaintiff can be denied justice because of judge's *arbitrary* choice to side with the defendant (just like with non\\-defamation lawsuits). For case law from various jurisdictions regarding defamation law and actual malice, you might want to see the citations in my briefs in the SCOTUS [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1560.html) and [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/17-1576.html). Most of the records in regard to the latter case are available [here](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/viggers-v-pacha_74.html).\n\nDefamation lawsuits are not exempt of having to comply with the procedural laws involved in judicial proceedings either, nor is the discovery, drafting, or legal research any simpler for being a lawsuit about defamation.\n\nIn the context of the comments that prompted your question here, the \"repeated violations\" that SE imputed to former moderator Monica would hardly be grounds for a viable lawsuit against SE for *defamation per se* or otherwise. Here are some reasons:\n\n* Rejecting a policy of gender pronouns such as the one SE seeks to\nimpose is not considered an infamous crime. There is no legislation to that effect, at least yet.\n* An actual refusal to adhere to that policy hardly involves moral\nturpitude. Far from involving corruption (i.e., moral turpitude), the\ncontroversy about gender pronouns touches on some of a person's\ndeepest beliefs. Thus, the \"offense\" of opposing such a policy cannot\nbe said to constitute an act of moral turpitude.\n* The previous two items rule out a viable claim of defamation per se.\nThus, Monica would have to prove that SE's falsehoods about her\n(whatever they are) caused her concrete losses (a typical example is *lost\nincome*) by prompting others to dissociate from her. I am unaware of whether Monica's situation would fit in this scenario.\n* You are right in that a claim of [mental distress](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334551/an-apology-to-our-community-and-next-steps/334605#comment1096005_334605) is not viable\neither. Note from [here](https://www.leagle.com/decision/20011407546se2d86111282) or [here](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170331218) that in a claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)\n\n> (1\\) the conduct must be intentional and reckless; (2\\) the conduct must\n>  be extreme and outrageous; (3\\) there must be a causal connection\n>  between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress; and (4\\) the\n>  emotional distress must be severe\n\n* Any claims of harassment that might be available to Monica would not be\nagainst SE, but against the specific individuals who engaged in\nharassing her directly.\n\nDepending on the methods and severity of the harassment, Monica might be able to obtain injunctive relief \\-\\-typically in the form of restraining orders\\-\\- against those specific individuals. It is noteworthy that not all criticism or heckling at or about Monica would be cognizable as harassment.",

The passage emphasizes that defamation lawsuits are not simple or effortless endeavors. They require substantial work from the plaintiff, including:\n\n1. Proving actual malice in many cases, which can be challenging even with clear evidence.\n2. Demonstrating that the alleged defamatory statement meets specific criteria, such as accusing someone of an \"infamous crime\" for defamation per se.\n3. Showing concrete losses (e.g., lost income) in cases that don't qualify as defamation per se.\n4. Complying with all standard legal procedures, including discovery, drafting, and legal research.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the process and ignores the complexities involved even in defamation per se cases. Option B is not always true, as the need to prove actual malice can depend on the plaintiff's status.

If the recipient has signed an NDA or is under some other sort of individual duty of confidentiality, s/he should normally not publish the letters or disclose their contents, and if s/he does so there will usually be some sort of penalty possible. But in some cases this may not apply. For example, the duty to report a crime will generally supersede a private NDA. So\\-called \"whistle\\-blower\" laws may give additional protection to disclosures when they apply.\n\nIf the letter is protected by Government secrecy classification or some other government regulation, disclosure of the contents may carry a penalty. But this may not always apply. For example, consider the case of [*New York Times Co. v. United States*, 403 U.S. 713 (1971\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States), known as the Pentagon Papers case. According to the Wikipedia article:\n\n> The question before the court was whether the constitutional freedom of the press, guaranteed by the First Amendment, was subordinate to a claimed need of the executive branch of government to maintain the secrecy of information. The Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment did protect the right of The New York Times to print the materials.\n\nHowever, an ordinary letter from a private lawyer will not involve Free Press issues. \n\nIt is also the case that a letter, like any other modern original writing, is protected by copyright. To publish the letter without permission might be a copyright infringement (unless one of the exceptions to copyright applies) and an infringement suit might be filed. But usually the would be little or no economic value to such a letter, and so little or no damages available in a copyright suit. This might mean that such a suit would not be effective in deterring or dealing with such a publication. \n\nIf the recipient reports on the contents of the letter without actually copying it in the report, there would be no plausible copyright issue and the device of an infringement suit would not be available.",

It's not always legal (ruling out A), nor is it only illegal for government-classified information (ruling out B). It's also not universally prohibited (ruling out D). \n\nThe correct answer is C because:\n1. Copyright laws may apply to the letter, potentially making unauthorized publication an infringement.\n2. If the recipient signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or is under another confidentiality obligation, publishing could violate that agreement.\n3. The content of the letter matters. For instance, if it reveals criminal activity, laws protecting whistleblowers might apply.\n4. Government regulations or classifications could affect the legality of publication in some cases.\n5. The method of reporting (e.g., direct copying vs. summarizing content) can impact legal implications.\n\nTherefore, the legality depends on a combination of these and potentially other factors, making C the most accurate statement."

It is up to the holder of the copyright on the original broadcast that is being condensed to decide whether to sue or take other action, such as a takedown notice. Perhaps the holder thinks this is good advertising for its business. They have the right to make that decision.\n\nNow if a person went to the game, and used a personal camera to film it, and posted excepts of **that** recording, the legal issues would be very different. The ticket probably includes a provision prohibiting filming and photography, so this would be a breech of contract. But it would not be copyright infringement. (In practice if this were spotted, the person would be required to stop recording or leave, at least.)",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A YouTube channel creates 10-minute highlight videos of NBA games by showing only the plays that lead to made baskets, in chronological order, without commentary. The footage is taken directly from the original broadcast. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this practice?\n\nA) This is not copyright infringement because the videos are significantly shorter than the original broadcast and could be considered fair use.\n\nB) This practice is legal as long as the channel gives credit to the original broadcaster in the video description.\n\nC) This is likely copyright infringement, but the copyright holder may choose not to take action if they view it as beneficial advertising.\n\nD) This practice is completely legal because showing only successful plays transforms the original work sufficiently to avoid copyright issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, this practice of condensing NBA games into highlight reels using footage from the original broadcast is likely to be considered copyright infringement. The copyright holder (in this case, the NBA or its broadcast partners) has the exclusive right to reproduce and distribute their content. \n\nHowever, the key point is that it's up to the copyright holder to decide whether to take legal action. They may choose not to if they view these highlight videos as beneficial for promoting their product. This decision is at the discretion of the copyright holder.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the length of the video alone doesn't determine fair use, and this use likely doesn't meet fair use criteria.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because giving credit doesn't negate copyright infringement.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because simply showing successful plays doesn't necessarily constitute a transformative use that would avoid copyright issues."

As stated in the documentation, while a terminated agreement is over and done for all time, the same parties can always enter into a new agreement. In this case, while Alex's original license was terminated due to hacking, it's possible for the game company to agree to a new license agreement with Alex in the future.

Option B is incorrect because automatic reinstatement after termination is not typically part of EULAs and contradicts the idea that termination ends the agreement.

For example, McDonalds cannot copyright or trademark the letter \"M\" but it can trademark the \"Golden Arches\" a unique stylized \"M\" that they use as signage to at all their locations. If the name is a brand of a certain product such, then the name can be trademarked but only with respect to that product. For example, if the Acme Wash\\-Master is a dish washing machine they can't sue Ace Wash Master, a unique dog bathing system, for using the name \"Wash Master\" since it's both styled different (Acme uses a dash between words. ACE uses a space) and non\\-competitive product lines (most people would not wash dishes in a dog bathing device... and one would certainly hope that no dog owners ever said to themselves \"Fido stinks and my tub is busted. The dish washer will do in a pinch!\").",

According to the information provided, the title \"13\" can be used by different creators across various media without causing trademark or copyright issues, as long as the works themselves are distinct. This is because you cannot copyright a word or name in itself, and trademarks are typically more specific to stylized representations or particular product lines. The existence of multiple albums, songs, movies, novels, and other works all titled \"13\" supports this conclusion. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest restrictions that don't actually exist for such a simple title. Option B is also incorrect, as being the first to use a title doesn't grant exclusive rights in this context."

The other options are incorrect or misleading:\n\nA) A disclaimer alone does not protect against trademark infringement, especially when using the IP as the core of the product.\nB) Whether the game is free or commercial doesn't determine trademark infringement; using trademarked elements as the core of the product is still problematic.\nC) This is the correct approach, acknowledging the need for proper licensing while recognizing the potential cost barriers.\nD) Incidental use, as in TV shows, is different from using the IP as the core of a game product, which requires licensing.\n\nThe answer emphasizes the importance of proper licensing for trademark use, the potential high costs involved, and the risks of proceeding without permission, especially for valuable IP like Star Trek."

By structuring the long-term capital gains tax as an excise tax, Washington state lawmakers are attempting to circumvent the state's constitutional prohibition on income taxes. This approach aims to divorce the taxation of capital gains from the context of a comprehensive income tax law, which would be unconstitutional in Washington state.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because excise taxes are not limited to luxury goods and services; they can apply to various transactions or activities.\n\nAnswer C, while potentially a benefit, is not the primary legal reasoning behind structuring the tax as an excise tax.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because aligning with federal tax laws is not the main goal here; the primary concern is complying with state constitutional restrictions.\n\nThis question tests understanding of state tax law complexities, constitutional limitations, and legislative strategies for implementing new taxes within existing legal frameworks."

However, stuff that a person writes can be protected by copyright law. You would have to look into the details of how the author used the website. The author may own the website and has simply posted comments for the world to see: any copying requires his permission. He may have posted text on someone else's website, and maybe the terms of use of that other website state that you agree to transfer your copyright to the website owner in consideration for permission to post a comment. That's basically what happens at SE, and most other public forums. In that case, it is, again, between the website owner (probably not the author) and the third party user (Mr. Businessman). The TOS may say \"Anybody can copy anything here for any reason\", or \"Nobody can copy anything\", or there may be some \"non\\-commercial\" condition attached to permission to copy. There is no general answer, except \"Whatever the TOS says\".\n\nPlagiarism is not a legal concept. However, commercial / non\\-commercial is completely orthogonal to plagiarism, as is permission. Instead, plagiarism is all about (a) correct punctuation (things in quotes) and (b) proper attribution. If Smith copies a slogan from a website and uses it, passing it off as his own, then that is plagiarism. If he says that this slogan comes from someone else, it isn't.

If the TOS transfers copyright of user comments to the website owner (which is common for many public forums), then Alice would need permission from the website owner, not the original commenter, to use the content legally. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because attribution alone doesn't guarantee legal use if it violates the website's TOS or copyright laws. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because using someone's words doesn't constitute theft in the legal sense, as it doesn't deprive the original owner of their property. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while using quotation marks might avoid plagiarism in an academic sense, it doesn't address the legal issues of copyright and commercial use.

What are those metrics?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nSort of.\n\nMost particular courts have a chief judge, a position that is paid slightly more than that of a usual judge for a huge additional burden of administrative work managing the court house (e.g. courtroom assignments, policies on implementing case assignments, overseeing the jury system, security measures, hiring court clerk's office and court building staff, reviewing court budgets, deciding whether to close the courthouse for weather or pandemics and the like, etc.).\n\nIn Colorado, there is a state appointed panel for each court that in connection with an outside private contractor evaluates judges periodically and prepares a report recommending or not recommending their retention in periodic retention elections, and there is a separate appointed panel that investigates allegations of judicial misconduct.\n\nIn many other states, some or all judges have to run for re\\-election when their terms end and the voters decide if they should stay in office. Sometimes judges in these states are nominated by the appropriate level of one of the major political parties.\n\nIn the federal courts, since judges serve for life and there is far less discretion to discipline them, Congress is the main supervisor in the sense of having the power to \"fire\" a judge.\n\nTrial court judge's substantive legal decisions are subject to review by courts with appellate authority over their court on a case by case basis. For courts of general jurisdiction, direct review of their cases on appeal is vested in an intermediate court of appeal in all but a few small states. For courts of limited jurisdiction that handle smaller civil disputes and/or misdemeanor criminal cases, direct appellate review is usually vested in the courts of general jurisdiction above it.\n\nIn each state, the state judiciary as a whole has at its pinnacle a highest court, usually called the state supreme court, although a few states call it something else.\n\nIt is the final court of review in the appellate process.\n\nIt also has the authority to intervene in particular judicial decisions that would not ordinarily be ripe to raise in an ordinary direct appeal (e.g. questions about whether allegedly attorney\\-client privileged or other privileged evidence must be disclosed), including the authority, in rare cases to order that a judge in a case that was appealed be removed from a case. The federal court system and some larger states vest this authority in intermediate appellate courts as well.\n\nState supreme courts also have general administrative authority over the judiciary as a whole. The state supreme court (primarily through the chief justice of the state supreme court) in its administrative capacity handles budget issues, formulates court rules, prepares annual reports on the judicial branch, lobbies for state funding, is responsible for auditing lower court finances, makes IT decisions for the state judiciary as a whole, and makes myriad other policy decisions, although it does not directly supervise judges in the way that a line manager in a government agency would supervise that manager's subordinates.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the supervisory structure and performance evaluation of judges in the United States judicial system?\n\nA) All judges are evaluated solely by voter elections, with no internal performance metrics or supervisory roles within the judicial system.\n\nB) Federal judges serve for life with no supervision, while state judges are evaluated by a combination of retention elections, performance review panels, and administrative oversight from higher courts.\n\nC) Every court has a chief judge who directly manages all other judges, setting performance metrics and conducting annual reviews similar to corporate management structures.\n\nD) Judges at all levels are supervised directly by Congress, which sets performance metrics and has the sole authority to remove judges from office.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it most accurately reflects the complex system of judicial oversight in the United States. Federal judges indeed serve for life appointments with limited direct supervision, mainly overseen by Congress in extreme cases. State judges, however, often face a combination of retention elections (in some states), performance review panels (as mentioned for Colorado), and administrative oversight from higher courts, particularly state supreme courts. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not all judges are evaluated solely by voter elections, and there are indeed internal performance metrics and supervisory roles in many state systems. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while chief judges exist, they don't directly manage all other judges in the way described. Their role is more administrative for the court as a whole, not personal management of individual judges.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because Congress does not directly supervise all judges or set performance metrics. While Congress has the power to impeach federal judges, this is an extreme measure and not a regular supervisory role. State judges are not under Congressional supervision at all."

However, after searching on Google/Twitter I noticed that there are many law firms able to provide law help to me, for free.\n\nI have finally got in touch with two law firms and they both told me that I can only work with one of them. It sounds fair enough and I'm okay with that. They both give me one month to make the final decision.\n\nHow could I make the best decision for myself? Is there any public data like how successful a law firm is? Since I've lost a lot of money, I hope to make a perfect decision at my best.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, what the law firms told you is incorrect. People have multiple lawyers all the time. The lawyers just don't want to share the money, which means they probably think there is not a lot of it. If you had a strong $20 million case, I guarantee you they would be willing to split it, but if your claim is weak or for less than $5 million, then the average US or UK firm will not want to share it.\n\nAsking a third lawyer in the same field is one strategy. They might have an opinion.\n\nIn general, the quality of legal service you get really depends on how hard the lawyer works. You are much better off having a bad lawyer that works his butt off on your case, than a good lawyer that does nothing. Most lawyers just phone it in and do as little as they can to get a fee.\n\nIf it were me, I would try to have additional meetings with the candidates. The more time they give you in the meetings, the more likely they are to do a good job on your case.",

They have been approached by multiple law firms offering free legal help. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the client's options and decision-making process?\n\nA) The client must choose only one law firm to work with, as it is illegal to have multiple lawyers representing them in this type of case.\n\nB) The client should base their decision solely on the law firm's public success rate data, which is readily available and accurately reflects the firm's capabilities.\n\nC) The client should prioritize meeting with the lawyers multiple times, as the amount of time a lawyer is willing to spend in initial meetings may indicate their level of commitment to the case.\n\nD) The client should immediately choose the law firm with the most aggressive marketing strategy, as this indicates they will work harder on the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation suggests that the quality of legal service often depends on how hard the lawyer works on the case. It recommends having additional meetings with potential lawyers, as the more time they invest in these meetings, the more likely they are to dedicate effort to the case. This approach allows the client to gauge the lawyer's commitment and work ethic.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that it's not true that clients can only work with one law firm. People often have multiple lawyers.\n\nOption B is misleading because the documentation doesn't mention readily available public success rate data. It suggests that asking a third lawyer in the same field might provide an opinion, but doesn't refer to public data as a reliable decision-making tool.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it oversimplifies the decision-making process. An aggressive marketing strategy doesn't necessarily correlate with the quality of legal representation or the lawyer's dedication to individual cases."

In a short summary of events, one member of MVKS was accused of acting inappropriately and was officially shunned from the community. In retaliation, he sued the MVKS. Now that there's a lawsuit, many people who wanted to remain anonymous are now known to be part of the MVKS.\n\nHow can a non\\-profit community based group even get sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From their [website](https://mvkvancouver.com/about-mvk/):\n\n> Metro Vancouver Kink is an incorporated, non\\-profit society.\n\nThat is, they are a [corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation) and corporations are legal people, capable of suing and being sued just like natural people are.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges [defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation) which a corporate entity can do by making untrue statements that damage someone\u2019s reputation. Based on the linked article, I can\u2019t see that this is \u201cretaliation\u201d; the statements made are, if untrue, almost certainly defamatory and the defamed person is legally entitled to be \u201cmade whole\u201d as far as possible.\n\nIncorporation is a method of shielding the members of the corporation from the corporations liabilities, legal or otherwise. From the article, it appears the allegedly defamed person is also suing the directors of the corporation \\- directors are usually legally shielded unless they have breached their duties as directors.\n\nOne final point, not\\-for\\-profit entities still make profits or losses (called surpluses and deficits) and holds assets and liabilities just like a for profit business. Indeed an entity must at least break even over the long term if it wants to survive and make surpluses if it wants to grow. The difference is that a non\\-profit cannot return those surpluses to its members the way a company can; it has to use them for the purposes for which it was established or for defending lawsuits or paying out damages.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications for MVKS and its members?\n\nA) As a non-profit organization, MVKS cannot be sued and its members are automatically protected from any legal action.\n\nB) MVKS can be sued as a corporation, but its members are entirely shielded from any legal repercussions due to the organization's non-profit status.\n\nC) MVKS can be sued as a corporation, and while members are generally protected, directors may be held liable if they breached their duties.\n\nD) MVKS cannot be sued for defamation because it is a non-profit organization dealing with controversial topics.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As stated in the documentation, MVKS is an incorporated, non-profit society, which means it is a legal entity capable of being sued, just like any corporation. While incorporation generally shields individual members from the organization's liabilities, directors can potentially be held liable if they have breached their duties as directors. This is evidenced by the fact that the allegedly defamed person is suing both the corporation and its directors. The non-profit status of MVKS does not exempt it from legal action or protect its directors from potential liability if they have acted improperly in their roles."

Common alternative legal bases include:\n\n* Art 6(1\\)(b) necessity for performing a contract to which the data subject is party\n* Art 6(1\\)(f) necessity for a legitimate interest\n\nIn your example, the online shop might have a legitimate interest in analytics, gauging interest in products, and managing inventory efficiently.\n\nA legitimate interest requires that you conduct a balancing test: does the legitimate interest outweigh the data subject's rights, interests, and freedoms? This also depends on the existing relationship between controller and data subject \u2013 can the data subject reasonably expect their data to be used in this way?\n\nIn this scenario (inventory management), only very little personal data is being processed: the interesting data is probably not *which customers* indicated interest in a product, but *how many customers* indicated interest. Aggregate statistics might not even be personal data, though calculating the statistic does involve processing of personal data and thus needs a legal basis. On the other hand, if this processing activity requires the creation of per\\-customer profiles (e.g. estimating how likely they are actually going to buy the product, based on their individual history) then it would be more difficult to argue that a legitimate interest outweighs the data subject's rights.\n\nWhen using data that was collected for one purpose and reusing the data for another purpose, you'll also have to perform a compatibility test per Art 6(4\\) GDPR. Similar to the legitimate interest balancing test this is very contextual. However, additional safeguards such as pseudonymization weigh in favour of compatibility. Art 5(1\\)(b) also mentions that processing for statistical purposes will always be considered compatible, but doesn't define \u201cstatistical purposes\u201d any further.",

The retailer can likely rely on the legitimate interest basis (Art 6(1)(f) GDPR) for this type of data processing, especially if they're only using aggregate statistics rather than individual profiles. This approach balances the business need for inventory management with minimal intrusion on customer privacy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because consent is described as a \"last resort\" when no other legal basis applies, which isn't the case here.\n\nOption C is too broad and ignores GDPR considerations entirely, making it incorrect.\n\nOption D goes beyond what's necessary.

Can a text story be obscene under the law?\n2.

Frank Russell McCoy](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca11/13-14350/13-14350-2015-03-12.html) on March 12, 2015\\.\n\nMr. McCoy maintained a website, young\\-stuff.com, from his home. He authored or edited more than 200 graphic stories detailing \"sexual abuse, rape, and torture of young children.\"\n\nMr. McCoy was indicted in June, 2007 and found guilty. The appeals court affirmed the conviction. Both the initial trial court and the appeals court found Mr. McCoy's stories \"lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\"\n\n**Can a web site's host be held liable for the content of a site?**\n\n[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230) says that\n\n> No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\n\nIt also states that no internet entity has immunity from federal criminal law.\n\nSection 230 has been found to apply to intermediaries of third\\-party content. Generally, most assume that when the content is simply hosted and not moderated by the web site then there is no liability for the provider.\n\nThat's not always the case and is determined by whether the host of the web site is considered a provider of interactive computer services or an information content provider.\n\nAny person responsible \"in whole or in part...for the creation or development of information\" is an information content provider.\n\nWhich are you?\n\nIn [Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com](https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/cases/fair-housing-council-san-fernando-valley-v-roommatescom), the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that roommates.com was not immune under Section 230 because they asked questions of their users that helped facilitate a potentially illegal search under the Fair Housing Act. They, therefore, helped create the content the site hosted.\n\nThe question will ultimately rest on whether someone decides the content is obscene enough to be prosecuted and then if you, the site's host, aided in creating the content.\n\nThis definitely requires the assistance of competent legal counsel.",

But I'm not aware of any law that says they have to make it convenient to maintain a receipt or other proof of purchase.\n\nHowever, when a company makes their terms unclear, unexpected, or difficult to comply with it seems there is often a lawyer ready to step up and file a class action lawsuit. [Here's one archive](http://www.consumer-action.org/lawsuits/) to give you an idea of what companies will settle.\n\nIn the United States [the FTC is also empowered by law to \"protect consumers,\"](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/statutes) which means that if \"disappearing\" receipts become a widespread problem for consumers they *could* take action on the government's authority:\n\n> The Federal Trade Commission Act is the primary statute of the\n>  Commission.

According to the information provided, there are currently no specific laws requiring sellers to maintain visible receipts for a certain period. However, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has the authority to \"prevent unfair methods of competition, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\" If disappearing receipts become a widespread issue affecting consumers, the FTC could potentially take action to address this problem.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no mention of a federal law requiring 30-day visibility for receipts. Option B is also incorrect, as the FTC has not yet established such rules, although they have the power to do so if needed. Option D is incorrect because while class-action lawsuits have been filed against companies for various consumer issues, there is no indication that all major retailers have been forced to provide permanent digital receipts as a result."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We are an ISP, allowing our users to write reviews of their educational experience. Normally the users' free speech rights are protected through the Communications Decency Act, Anti\\-SLAPP statutes, first amendment, etc. all that.\n\nLately though, a entity's CEO/Owner filed a DMCA request against us and a very negative review about him and his school in particular, claiming copyright ownership over it. We can claim to be an ISP and gain those restrictions, but as the review is anonymous (we have the IP though), we have no way to contact the author. Furthermore, the DMCA request is clearly false/perjurious \\-\\- for several reasons.\n\n1. The CEO did not write such a scathing negative review of himself in the third person and then decide to submit it to us anonymously, only to request the takedown. Clearly he is not the copyright owner.\n2. The CEO has contacted (harassed) us many times (email and letters) concerning this and other reviews, claiming defamation, slander, trademark infringement, and anything else he could think of. Clearly the review is not his.\n3. We know his IP addresses and the IPs of his staff based upon the emails, of which other false (positive) reviews were submitted.\n4. The review authors grant us copyright to use their reviews, via a disclaimer on the survey itself.\n\nWe normally have a process for the review authors to remove their own reviews, which other reviewers use. We also have a process for entities to dispute the validity of reviews, which other entities use and have used successfully. But we generally reserve the right to decide if a review is valid via process, and this DMCA takedown is putting us into the awkward position of forcing us to choose between being an \"ISP\" or a \"content author/submitter\". If we choose not to play the ISP part in responding, then it seems that we open ourselves up to suit as a defamatory content author.\n\nBasically, can we preserve our DMCA\\- ISP \"immunity\" and still respond on behalf of the review author?\n\nEdit: I guess basically I am asking a sidestep question. What do we do when WE have the information that demonstrates that the content is non\\-infringing, and that the DMCA filer is plainly lying? Apart from signing an affidavit (and releasing his/her identity), the original author has no way to prove that he/she is the original author either. And it is really beside the point, since the entity is trying to get negative reviews removed, not protect a copyright of something they own. I mean, it is clear abuse of the system.\n\nEdit 2: Though my question is pointedly what I am dealing with, perhaps it should be revised to a more simple question. For instance, what do you do if you are an ISP who receives a DMCA for content YOU own, and YOU produced, and YOU exclusively hold the copyright for. Do you have to take down **your own content** until you send a counter notice, and record the counternotice to yourself? So upstream ISPs have forwarded the DMCA to you to handle (because you own all of the servers and power and colocation facility).\n\nThere's this built\\-in assumption in the DMCA which is that the one filing the takedown is actually the copyright holder, and all they have to do is sign a BS lying affidavit, certifying that they believe it to be theirs, which carries very little consequence, and then at that point the onus is upon everyone else to either show they are not involved, or give up the personal information of the owner to a potentially litigiously malicious party. For instance, the information that the DMCA counter notice demands, would otherwise not be provided without subpoena. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Counter notices are described in [17 USC 512(g)(3\\)](http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#512). It starts with the requirement for \"A physical or electronic signature of the subscriber\" (and a statement under penalty of perjury...). Supposing that you can't get anywhere with finding the contributor even via a subpoena, then you're stopped there: you can't swear on behalf of someone else. \n\nParagraph (f) also says that if a person files a false infringement claim, they become\n\n> liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred\n>  by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner's\n>  authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such\n>  misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon\n>  such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material\n>  or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed\n>  material or ceasing to disable access to it\n\nbut it's not immediately obvious that you would suffer damage by taking the material down (not immediately obvious doesn't mean obviously not true). A case could be made, but it's risky. In [Online Policy Group v. Diebold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Policy_Group_v._Diebold,_Inc.), Diebold was hit with substantial damages basically for having made up a theory that certain email discussion was infringing when it was clearly fair use. If a person actually lies about being the copyright owner, that would probably be viewed even more dimly by the courts.\n\nYour 4th argument gives you no traction: if an infringer posts infringing material and transfers copyright on the web page, but they don't *hold* copyright, then that transfer mean nothing. As for the other arguments, your attorney will have to suggest an advisable course of action. S/he might advise that your evidence is so strong that you should just ignore the takedown; or that you should take the content down and then sue for damages; or take the content down and lobby your congressman for a change in the law.\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nI will reiterate my recommendation to get a lawyer. I believe that under the law, the risk to you would be the situation where the person prevails in an infringement suit against you. Outside of the \"mere conduit\" safe harbor, you have to participate in the notice and takedown scheme in order to \"stay safe\" (also you have to do so quickly). You have identified a potentially huge flaw in the system. Theoretically, criminal charges of perjury and paragraph (f) damages would be enough to deter ordinary wrong\\-doers, provided that you can really prove that someone else is the copyright holder. But the cost of litigation is not zero and the chances of winning are not 100%. The law *does* assume that all parties tell the truth, indeed the law requires a \"penalty of perjury\" statement. Since counter\\-notice is also part of the legal dance, I would conclude that you do have to write yourself a counter\\-notice. Then if there is a suit, you have satisfied the requirements of the law.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An ISP receives a DMCA takedown request for content they know to be non-infringing, and they have evidence that the filer is likely lying about copyright ownership. What is the most legally prudent course of action for the ISP?\n\nA) Ignore the takedown request entirely, as they have strong evidence that it's false.\nB) Remove the content immediately and permanently to avoid any potential liability.\nC) Remove the content, file a counter-notice on behalf of the anonymous content creator, then restore the content.\nD) Remove the content temporarily, file a counter-notice on their own behalf, then restore the content after the required waiting period.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most legally prudent course of action. While the ISP has evidence that the DMCA request is false, ignoring it (option A) could jeopardize their safe harbor protections under the DMCA. Permanently removing the content (option B) goes against the ISP's interests and the spirit of free speech. Filing a counter-notice on behalf of the anonymous creator (option C) is not legally permissible, as counter-notices require a signature from the content owner.\n\nBy removing the content temporarily and filing a counter-notice on their own behalf, the ISP complies with the DMCA process while protecting themselves. This approach allows them to restore the content after the required waiting period, maintaining their safe harbor status while also preserving the content they believe to be non-infringing. Additionally, this method doesn't require revealing the identity of the anonymous content creator, which could be problematic without their consent."

On the forum I have 2 accounts \u2014 one 'official' account under the name of my company, used to make official announcements etc, and a personal account under an anonymous username.\n\nOn the forum I had a discussion about a competitor company and made some personal comments about what I think about them. It's a small industry and the competitor company is very influential, so I wanted to keep these comments separate from my official company account and posted them from my anonymous personal account.\n\nWeirdly (and this is what seems questionable to me) the forum owner has figured out that my personal account is linked to my professional account since they share an IP address, and has shared this info with my competitor. (As far as I know the competitor has a relationship with the forum owner because they advertise there regularly.)\n\nNow my competitor knows that the anonymous account belongs to my company and can see my posts about them. The whole thing has caused a stir for me professionally since they are interpreting these comments as the official views of my company.\n\nIt seems like some law must have been breached during the sharing of this information? Does anyone have any insight?\n\nI don't necessarily even want to do anything about this, but am just interested in the legality around it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> It seems like some law must have been breached during the sharing of this information?\n\nPossibly, even probably. The scrutiny of your personal account in order to glean personal data (your IP address) and then using that personal data to match accounts may contravene Recital 50 of the GDPR:\n\n> The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected.\n\nIf the website terms which you agreed to don't include this data matching, then that processing is not lawful.\n\nThe rest of Recital 50 is relevant and worth quoting in full:\n\n> If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further use; the\n> nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data\n> subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations.\n\nIt seems to me that an anonymous account could reasonably expect that the \"further processing\" of data matching is not in the public interest, an exercise of official authority, scientific or historical research or statistical. There is no link between the data matching exercise and the purpose for which IP addresses are normally collected: the operation and physical security of the website.\n\nNow, it may well be that the website terms do allow this data matching to discover links between accounts, or in any case prohibit having two accounts and allow reasonable methods to discover such links. It's also possible that a court has ordered the processing (as [I\u00f1aki Viggers has mentioned](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/58565/577). We don't have that information; but ostensibly one wouldn't normally expect a *personal* account to be examined in this way, and certainly wouldn't expect any link discovered to be relayed to a third party.",

As explained in the documentation, a country's ability to prosecute its citizens for actions committed abroad depends on the specific laws in question. If a French law explicitly states that it applies outside of French jurisdiction (extraterritorially), then France could potentially prosecute its citizen for violating that law, even if the action was legal in the country where it occurred. This is similar to the example given of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which applies to US citizens' actions abroad.

Which of the following statements is most likely correct regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The customer is automatically bound by the new subscription model because they received the email notification.\n\nB) The customer can refuse the new terms and remain on the old prepaid model indefinitely.\n\nC) The legality of the change depends on whether the customer has logged into their account recently.\n\nD) The enforceability of the new terms likely depends on the specific language in the original service contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because the enforceability of the new terms would most likely depend on the specific language in the original service contract. Many service contracts include clauses that allow the provider to unilaterally change terms by providing notice (such as via email). If such a clause exists in this case, the new subscription model could be enforceable. The customer's lack of recent activity on the domain or account login history is less relevant than the actual terms of the contract they agreed to initially. Options A and B are too absolute without knowing the contract details, and C incorrectly focuses on recent account activity rather than the contract terms."

The documentation clearly states that the concept of prima facie is common in both criminal and civil proceedings, and by extension, administrative ones.

It's used by plaintiffs in civil cases as well, as evidenced by the example of defamation cases mentioned in the documentation."

A visa of this type [lasts for 29 days](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/other-visa-categories/crewmember-visa.html), and no one expects that someone who is permitted to stay in the U.S. while in transit for up to 29 days needs to sleep in the bus station or in a tent in a park. \n\nFurthermore, lodging places in the U.S. do not generally evaluate the immigration status of people who stay there.

Whether or not leave is required depends on the statute that governs the matter.\n\nMoreover, in some circumstances, leave to appeal needs to be applied for *to the same level court* where the decision to be appealed was made. Section [56(3\\)](http://legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2016/0048/latest/DLM5759372.html) of the Senior Courts Act 2016 goes:\n\n> No appeal, except an appeal under subsection (4\\), lies from any order\n> or decision of the High Court made on an interlocutory application in\n> respect of any civil proceeding **unless leave to appeal to the Court of\n> Appeal is given by the High Court** on application made within 20\n> working days after the date of that order or decision or within any\n> further time that the High Court may allow.\n\n(emphasis added)\n\nSo, say Bob is suing Rob in the High Court. Rob applied for a direction (for example, he wants to join Alice to the case). Bob objected. Judge Judy made an interlocutory order where the direction that Rob sought is granted. Bob is unhappy and wants to appeal to the Court of Appeal. But to do this, Bob first needs to obtain leave from the High Court. If this is declined, then and only then Bob can apply for leave appeal to the Court of Appeal directly (upon the grant of which he can finally file the appeal itself).\n\nNow this may create an interesting collision. What if the application for leave to appeal filed in the High Court **gets in the hands of the same judge** that made the decision that the appeal is against?\n\nAs per [answers to this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32802/do-judges-get-penalised-when-their-decisions-are-quashed-by-a-higher-court), judges will not enjoy if their decisions get overturned. Therefore, they may be personally interested in rejecting the application for leave to appeal, especially if the decision was made publicly available.\n\nThe High Court has published its Recusal Guidelines [here](https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/about-the-judiciary/judicial%20conduct/2017HCRecusalguidelines1rev.pdf). One possible ground for recusal in this situation goes:\n\n> **5\\. Recusal where opinions earlier expressed**\n> \n> \n> 5\\.1 A judge should consider recusing him or herself if the case concerns a matter upon which the judge has made public statements of\n> firm opinion on the issue before the court.\n> \n> \n> 5\\.2 An expression of opinion in an earlier case or in an earlier stage of a proceeding is not of itself a ground for recusal.\n\nSo, given that judge Judy's decision has been published, does that hit 5\\.1 above in a way that 5\\.2 does not overweight it? Should judge Judy now consider recusing herself from hearing the application for leave to appeal?\n\nCan judge Judy not hear the application for leave to appeal for any other reason?\n\nThis question is not tightly attached to New Zealand \u2014 answers re other comparable jurisdictions are welcome.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes**\n\nIt's not uncommon. In fact I am aware of at least one case where the trial judge referred it to appeal *before* he made his decision on the basis that whichever way he decided the law was so unsettled that grounds for appeal would occur. In that case the court of appeal called up the trial judge to sit on the 3 judge appeal a) because he knew the case and b) because you don't get to not make a decision because it's hard sonny\\-jim.",

In New Zealand, for certain cases (especially interlocutory decisions), leave to appeal must first be sought from the High Court before approaching the Court of Appeal. The same judge who made the original decision may indeed hear the application for leave to appeal. While there are guidelines for recusal, simply having made the original decision is not automatic grounds for recusal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because leave to appeal is not always required, and when it is, it often must be sought from the High Court first, not directly from the Court of Appeal.\n\nOption B is incorrect because there is no blanket prohibition on the original judge hearing the leave application. The recusal guidelines allow for discretion.\n\nOption D is incorrect because judges are not penalized for having their decisions overturned on appeal. This misconception does not factor into the leave to appeal process."

The court granted my motion and the trooper has received it and signed for it, however the trooper did not provide me with a description of his method and, in fact, told me during a pre\\-trial conference that he would not provide me with such a \"narrative\".\n\nIs it my best strategy to simply go to trial and object at the trial that the prosecution has failed to comply with the motion for discovery, or do I need to make an additional pleading ahead of time?\n\nIf I make a pleading, there is the risk the trooper might take the motion more seriously and provide the requested information. However, if I go to court directly, I am concerned the judge might say, \"Well, you needed to file pleading XYZ with the court ahead of time if you wanted complain about the non\\-compliance with discovery.\"\n\nSo, the basic question here is a point of law: if a party fails to comply with a granted motion of discovery in a civil/administrative trial, does an additional pleading of some kind need to be made ahead of time, or will the failure to comply automatically become grounds for dismissal at trial?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Convention in U.S. process is to:\n\n1.

Rules of Civil Procedure (e.g., [FRCP 37](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_37)) typically have strict requirements for filing such motions.\n\nJudges generally frown upon discovery disputes lingering until the beginning of a trial. Which means the outcome of an objection or motion *in limine* on such matters can be abrupt and unpredictable. If the judge is inclined to side with the party requesting the particular discovery:\n\n* He will most likely issue an order compelling compliance and continue the case (i.e., reschedule the hearing for a later date that allows time for compliance with its order).\n* He could also grant or unilaterally impose sanctions if he feels the non\\-responsive party's behavior is \"dilatory, obdurate or vexatious.\"\n* A judge in a very bad mood could conceivably dismiss the case with prejudice or grant a summary judgment against the recalcitrant party.\n\nHowever if the judge concludes that the party requesting discovery was insufficiently diligent, or that the discovery is not reasonable or essential to the trial, he will probably overrule any objection and let the trial proceed.",

Nobody has the authority to make them do anything else. And if they try to vote differently of their own accord, the Colorado Secretary of State may void their vote and replace them with another elector. This happened in the 2016 election, and the voiding of the vote was eventually upheld by the US Supreme Court ([*Baca v. Colorado Department of State*](https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/colorado-department-of-state-v-baca/)).\n\nI suppose the legislature might be able to repeal 1\\-4\\-304, but the governor could veto, and a 2/3 majority of both chambers would be needed in order to override. There would likely also be court challenges as to whether the repeal could affect an election that had already taken place.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado, after a presidential election has taken place, under what circumstances could the state legislature potentially override the popular vote?\n\nA) The legislature can directly choose electors to vote for a different candidate by simple majority vote.\nB) The legislature cannot override the popular vote under any circumstances due to state law.\nC) The legislature could potentially override the popular vote, but only by repealing the relevant state law with a 2/3 majority in both chambers and surviving potential legal challenges.\nD) The legislature can override the popular vote if the governor agrees to sign new legislation allowing it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option A is incorrect because Colorado law requires electors to vote for the candidate who won the popular vote. Option B is too absolute, as the legislature theoretically has the power to change laws. Option D is incorrect because governor approval alone would not be sufficient - a 2/3 majority would be needed to override a potential veto. Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the difficult process that would be required: repealing the existing law (Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1-4-304) would require a 2/3 majority in both chambers to overcome a likely veto, and even then, there would likely be court challenges about changing the rules after an election has taken place. This makes it extremely difficult, but not absolutely impossible, for the legislature to potentially override the popular vote."

It is a kit to build Google Cardboard VR. Kit is imprinted on a existing selling product package. Of course, by selling this product I make money. Google Cardboard kit scheme is free on internet for home assembling and manufacturing. I tried to find the licence of the Google Cardboard kit, but failed. \n\nAccording to which US \\& EU laws, I'm allowed to incorporate this imprint on the package? \n\nIs there a room for law suit for any kind of infringement, even if I just imprint the scheme and let people fold and assemble it themselves? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You said you couldn't find the license, so copyright is assumed.\n\nBy printing it on your packaging, you are distributing their intellectual property without their permission. Furthermore, you are making a profit. That smells like copyright infringement to me, and you are subject to whatever penalties are there, from a Cease \\& Desist, to monetary compensations.\n\nFair use [mostly applies](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/) to commentary and parody, you can't claim it.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to sell a product that includes printed instructions for assembling a Google Cardboard VR headset on its packaging. The company couldn't find a specific license for the Google Cardboard design. Under these circumstances, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal issues?\n\nA) The company can freely use the Google Cardboard design as long as they don't claim it as their own invention.\n\nB) This use would likely be protected under fair use because it's for educational purposes.\n\nC) The company is at risk of copyright infringement for distributing and profiting from Google's intellectual property without permission.\n\nD) As long as the company only prints the instructions and doesn't provide materials, there's no legal risk.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because without finding a specific license permitting use, the Google Cardboard design is presumed to be protected by copyright. By printing the design on their packaging and selling a product that incorporates it, the company would be distributing Google's intellectual property without permission and profiting from it. This action likely constitutes copyright infringement and could lead to legal consequences.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even if they don't claim it as their own, using copyrighted material without permission is still infringement. Option B is wrong because this commercial use doesn't fall under typical fair use protections, which are mainly for commentary, criticism, or parody. Option D is incorrect because simply printing copyrighted instructions without permission can still be considered infringement, regardless of whether materials are provided."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Hope I am in the right place for this type of question. I am a developer that would like to start up a little project that is kind of a social experiment.\n\nThe idea is that I setup a mailing bot with a list of emails (say a few million from a online email dump). This bot will send an email that is somewhat misleading, maybe notifying the user they may have won a prize with a link to collect it. \n\nThe idea being that I can notify the user once the link is clicked that this was a fake mail designed to spread awareness of scam emails/virus emails and how easy it is to be tricked.\n\nI would also like to collect this information and display on a webpage how many emails are sent out and how many people have clicked the link.\n\nWith the information I could collect it anonymously (not linked to the email address) but it would be better to put it against the email so they can visit the site later and see more stats about the project/social experiment.\n\nSo the overall question is... **Is this possible to do without being in any sort of trouble with laws etc?** This will be a worldwide project and poses no threat other than being classed as a spam email.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the US, your experiment is problematic in several respects according to the CAN\\-SPAM Act of 2003 [CAN\\-SPAM Act of 2003 \\- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003).\n\nYou *can legally send unsolicited email*, as long as you have an unsubscribe link in the message, and you have obtained those email addresses in a legal manner.\n\nYour project is problematic because\n\n1\\) you using emails from an online dump, which more than likely came from a spam harvester, and those emails were probably not legally obtained.\n\n2\\) the subject lines (and content) of the emails you send will be deceptive, because you are trying to get people to click on the link to give you data on the people who respond while not telling them the true nature of the email.\n\n3\\) you will be displaying your collected data in a public manner related to those personal email addresses, after deceiving those people to the nature of your emails, and this could possibly be illegal in terms of privacy outside of the CAN\\-SPAM Act of 2003\\.\n\nBeyond the CAN\\-SPAM Act of 2003, in order to send all of those emails in the US, you will need to use internet service provider, which will either be a commercial business, a government entity, or and an NGO. All of those will have terms of service which probably restrict sending mass unsolicited emails using their services.\n\n> This will be a worldwide project and poses no threat other than being\n>  classed as a spam email....\n\nWrong. You will more than likely be violating many email and privacy laws and those of many interest service providers in all of those jurisdictions, and will open yourself up to both civil and criminal liability.",

It violates the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 by using emails from an illegal dump, sending deceptive content, and publicly displaying collected data without consent. It also likely violates terms of service of internet service providers and privacy laws in multiple jurisdictions worldwide. The project's educational intent does not make it legal, and including an unsubscribe link or anonymizing data does not address all the legal issues involved."
