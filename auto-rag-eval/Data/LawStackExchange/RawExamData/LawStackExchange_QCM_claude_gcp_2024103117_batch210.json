Assume there is no malice or racism component to the shooting and that she thought she had the non\\-lethal taser, when in fact she had a lethal firearm.\n\nWhat is the range of charges she would face? What if any defense does ***qualified immunity*** provide in a case of such a serious error?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Federal Civil Rights Liability**\n\nQualified immunity is a doctrine that applies to lawsuits under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking compensation for an intentional violation of constitutional rights under color of state law.\n\nThe qualified immunity inquiry is not reached in the first place if the prima facie case is not established because the conduct allegedly violating a constitutional right under color of state law, even if it is a well established constitutional right (i.e. one memorialized in a reported and controlling appellate court decision that is factually similar), if the action was merely negligent rather than intentional.\n\nThus, most likely, there is no federal civil remedy to the victim, unless even the use of the taser would have been a violation of a well established constitutional right under color of state law. Non\\-deadly force, like a taser, is subject to a lower threshold of justification than deadly force, like a firearm.\n\nOf course, under general Fourth Amendment principles applicable to the states, an attempted arrest which appears to be what the OP describes, must be supported by probable cause that a crime was committed for which an arrest would be authorized. So, if this is the violation of rights alleged, there may be a federal civil rights remedy. But, further examination of the facts show that there was apparently a warrant for the arrest of the person shot outstanding. So the officer probably has a legal basis to use non\\-deadly force to make an arrest pursuant to the outstanding warrant, but probably did not have a legal basis to use deadly force to make an arrest.\n\n**Federal Criminal Liability**\n\nThe most common charge under federal criminal law for excessive use of force by a police officer, is a criminal violation of civil rights. But this, like the civil remedy, requires a showing of an intentional violation of civil rights which the OP tends to suggest is absent unless the officer lacked probable cause to make an arrest.\n\n**State Law Civil Liability**\n\nAt the state level, law enforcement officers acting under color of state law are immune from civil liability except as authorized by state law in an exception to sovereign immunity. Generally, there is no exception to sovereign immunity for a negligent use of force by a police officer.\n\nSo, the police officer probably can't be sued successfully by the victim's estate under state law.\n\n**State Criminal Law Considerations**\n\nFor criminal law purposes, whether or not the law enforcement officer's actions were a crime under state law would dependent upon both the elements of the offense: probably manslaughter or negligent homicide in this case, and the scope of force authorized under state law in the case of a law enforcement officer seeking to arrest a fleeing suspect.\n\nUsually, under state law, the use of reasonable force to make an arrest supported by probable cause is allowed and the use of deadly force to make an arrest support by probable cause is allowed only if there is a threat to the public based upon probable cause to believe that a particularly serious violent felony was committed.\n\nQualified immunity is not applicable to state criminal law liability, although express statutory defenses in a state criminal statute might be similar in some cases.\n\n**Caveat**\n\nOf course, all of that analysis assumes that the story of the officer's motive and intentions was truthful. There is very good reason to be skeptical of this fact and to believe that the use of a firearm was not a negligent mistake, and that race was a motivating factor. Simply saying that one's motives were good is not a free pass and a jury doesn't have to believe the law enforcement officer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer mistakenly uses a firearm instead of a taser during an arrest, resulting in the death of the suspect.

The unintentional nature of the act likely protects the officer from federal civil rights lawsuits, which typically require intentional violations.

This approach considers factors such as the nature of the danger, the immediacy of the threat, and the probability of attack, as outlined in the Utah rule.\n\nRemember, if lethal action is taken, John would need to report it to the division within 12 hours and not remove or reposition the animal without authorization."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30292/difference-between-assigned-and-endorsed-in-this-context", "docs_id": 30292, "title": "difference between &#39;assigned&#39; and &#39;endorsed&#39; in this context?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> Each such notice of redemption shall be irrevocable and shall specify\n>  the date that is the redemption date, the redemption price, the number\n>  of Shares to be redeemed, the place or places of payment and that\n>  payment will be made upon presentation and, to the extent that such\n>  Shares are certificated, surrender of the certificate(s) evidencing\n>  the Shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be redeemed (properly\n>  ***endorsed*** or ***assigned*** for transfer, if the Corporation shall so\n>  require).\n\nI know the basic meanings of both words.

The documentation states that the corporation may require the certificate(s) to be \"properly endorsed or assigned for transfer.\" This indicates that the corporation has the flexibility to accept either method of ownership transfer. Endorsement refers to signing the stock certificate itself in the designated area, which allows for negotiation of the document.

Who would authorize that, if anyone? What are the legal bounds of this organization/militia? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are no laws restricting a number of people forming a group and calling themselves a militia or similar sounding military name. The factors that limit the activities of any militia or similar group are the same that oversee all of us: state and federal laws.\n\nTo begin with, any such militia or group may run afoul of laws if they are perceived to be attempting to confuse the public and state/federal governments of their legitimacy and actual command. And, of course, the federal government will not allow an ad\\-hoc militia group to subvert their own authority. \n\nA self\\-organized militia of ex\\-military types could self\\-assign \"missions\" of any nature, as long as they did not break applicable state and federal laws for firearms, applicable laws that require permits for assembly and parades in public spaces, laws regarding threats and intimidation while in public, and laws regarding [Sedition (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition), among others.\n\nThese \"missions\" could be patrolling cities and reporting crimes and helping old ladies cross the street, like an armed version of the [Guardian Angels (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Angels). But more aligned with current events, some possible examples are the [Oath Keepers (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_Keepers): they gather at request (or by their own mission directive) and \"provide security\" (their description) for other groups \\- during public rallies and demonstrations \\- that have (typically right wing) political views aligned with their own. They appear in military garb and are heavily armed, but are allowed to assemble and \"operate\" (their term), as long as they are within the bounds of state and federal laws. (There are instances of laws being \"bent\" by law enforcement to allow militias to \"operate\" i.e. [Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge); but typically, federal authorities supersede). But a militia could also claim to be non\\-partisan, or even left wing, such as the [Redneck Revolt (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redneck_Revolt).\n\nSuch militias organize and authorize their own \"missions\", much like any group, like the Boy Scouts. The only outside authorizations they may need are legal permits, where required, for their activities, such as assembling and parading in public, among others. If a militia is run as a [501(c) organization (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization) they are also bound by those financial and governing laws.\n\nThe *legal* bounds of how a militia operates in public (and in some cases, within private spheres) are \\- like anyone else \\- the applicable state and federal laws: for firearms (open carry, concealed carry, long guns, automatic weapons, etc.), laws regarding threats and intimidation (since they are usually armed and their modus operandi is intimidation) and assault, as well as any laws regarding assembly and parades, and sedition.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A group of former U.S. Army special forces soldiers forms a militia.

They can self-assign \"missions,\" but these must comply with laws regarding firearms, public assembly, threats and intimidation, and sedition.

As others have stated in the comments above, worse case scenario is the hiring of a driving instructor.\n\nIf you read the written instructions (and I remember correctly), it does state something along the lines of \"must be accompanied by a licensed driver and provide an insured, registered, vehicle\". Which is a bit more formal than the \"bring a friend\". Most people just naturally use more casual terms when speaking. I don't know your age, but it's probably more common to hear \"bring a parent\" than \"bring a friend\" when *speaking* face to face with the DMV staff. \n\nAlso, not all insurance policies are driver limited. Some policies are on the vehicle regardless of driver. **Typically Liability\\-only insurance is vehicle specific, not driver specific**. [\\[\\*1]](http://www.claimsjournal.com/news/national/2014/06/05/249762.htm) You'd have to review the policies or call the insurance agents to confirm this. \n\nYou may even do something as simple as add you to the current insurance for a month or two while you're practicing and testing. Just reimburse your friend for any increase in premiums during this time. Contact the insurance company/agent. The cost may be minimal. \n\nIn addition, there are **[non\\-owner insurance policies](http://www.insure.com/car-insurance/non-owners-policy.html)** which cover you even if you do not own a vehicle.

If this is true how can someone get such permission? Does it cost money?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming that the question is how one creates a site on which to sell apps created by others to the general public, this depends on how the app has been released.\n\nApps are pretty much always creative works, and as such are protected by copyright. The initial owner of the copyright is the developer, or in some cases the developer's employer. However the copyright may be sold, given, assigned, left, or otherwise transferred to another.\n\nThe copyright owner has the exclusive right to make, or authorize the making of, copies of the protected work. The copyright owner also has the exclusive right to distribute the work to the public, or authorize its distribution. In US law these are protected by [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106). In other countries such rights are protected by the various local copyright laws. These rights are also guaranteed by the [Berne Copyright Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) Specifically, Article 9, paragraph 1 of the convention reads:\n\n> (1\\) Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form.\n\nA website that allows the public to download apps, whether for a fee or for free, involves both making copies of the apps, and distributing them to the public. As such it requires permission from the copyright owner. In the absence of such permission, the site operator is engaging in copyright infringement.\n\nSome apps have been released by their owners under permissive licenses which allow others to copy and distribute them for a fee. A site could legitimately host any app whose copyright owner has so released it.\n\nIn the absence of such a permissive release, the distributor must obtain permission. There is no standard method of doing this. One must find some way to communicate with the owner, or some authorized agent of the owner, and ask. If one cannot find the owner, or the owner does not respond, this must be treated as a refusal, and the app may not be distributed. Some owners list contact info in their apps or the documentation.\n\nThe copyright owner may demand a fee for such permission. This could be a fixed advance fee, or a per\\-copy or percentage fee royalty, or both, or some other fee structure. The owner may also require some specific form of attribution, or make other conditions. Any such conditions must be complied with. It is usual for the owner's agreement to be incorporated into a binding contract, but this is not strictly required.\n\nDistribution without permission is copyright infringement, unless an ***exception to copyright*** applies. In the case described above, providing a site for retail purchase of apps written by various others, it is hard to see how any exception would apply. The US concept of ***fair use*** pretty clearly would not apply.\n\nThe owner may bring suit against an infringer. If the owner wins such a suit, the owner may be awarded monetary damages, and a court order against further infringement. In some cases the owner may also be able to collect legal fees and other costs of suit from the infringer. The exact rules for damages vary by country, and the details will vary with the particular case. In the US, under [17 USC 504](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504) the owner may elect to get statutory damages (which can be up to $150,000 per work infringed for willful infringement) or actual damages, which include both losses to the owner, and any profits made by the infringer.\n\nIn some cases copyright infringement may also be a crime, and can be prosecuted by the government. In the US, [17 USC 506](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#506) makes infringement a crime when the infringement is:\n\n* \"purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain\", and\n* of copies with the retail value of over $1,000 during a period of 6 months.\n\nHowever, my understanding is that actual prosecution by the US Justice Department is unusual unless infringement is carried out on a major commercial basis, well over the statutory threshold.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small tech startup wants to create a website where users can purchase and download mobile apps.

According to copyright law, the copyright owner has the exclusive right to distribute their work or authorize its distribution. For a website to legally sell and distribute apps, they must obtain explicit permission from each app's copyright owner. This process may involve negotiating fees (which could be advance payments, royalties, or other structures) and agreeing to specific terms set by the owner. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no standard licensing fee or central copyright authority for app distribution. Each app's copyright is held individually by its owner or their assignee.\n\nOption C is false because mere attribution does not grant distribution rights. While some apps may be released under permissive licenses allowing redistribution, this is not universal and still requires adhering to the specific license terms.\n\nOption D is incorrect because copyright protection applies to both paid and free apps.

The lawsuit would likely be dismissed, and the patent would probably be invalidated due to prior art. This is because:\n\n1. Patent laws generally require that patents be granted only for original inventions.\n2. The software developer's public release of the project six months before the patent filing constitutes prior art.\n3. In a patent infringement lawsuit, the original developer could present evidence of this prior art.\n4. This evidence would demonstrate that the patented algorithm was already known to the public before the patent application, which would likely lead to the patent being declared invalid and the lawsuit being dismissed.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they assume the patent would be valid despite the existence of prior art.

As far as I know, no jurisdiction actively disseminates investigation material, such as recorded interviews with suspects, to the public in the same way that the authorities publish laws and judicial decisions.\n\nWhen evidence of a police interview is adduced in open court, it becomes \u201cpublic\u201d in the sense that the information can generally be published (for example, by a journalist sitting in the courtroom). This freedom can overcome confidentiality obligations that may have applied to the information before it was admitted in evidence.\n\nBut court records are not \u201cpublic\u201d in the sense that they can be easily found on a freely accessible database.

I outlined the test in that other answer and will only summarize here: the question becomes \"[whether the offeror, acting reasonably, would understand that the offeree was assenting to the terms proposed](https://ca.vlex.com/vid/communication-of-acceptance-683505725).\" This is acceptance by conduct.

Onifade*, 2005 S.L.T. (Sh. Ct.) 63](https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/search-judgments/judgment?id=b39287a6-8980-69d2-b500-ff0000d74aa7):\n\n> The pursuers' notice made it plain that their position was that anyone who parked on their property without a permit would have to pay them a fee of \u00a330 per day on that account. The defender, by parking his vehicle on their property without a permit, made it plain that he accepted that position. He signified his acceptance by his conduct in so doing. It is nothing to the purpose for him to maintain that he did not intend to pay because he considered that the pursuers were not entitled to make the charge specified. 'The judicial task is not to discover the actual intentions of each party; it is to decide what each was reasonably entitled to conclude from the attitude of the other.'\n\nSee also [*Imperial Parking Canada Corporation v. Toronto (City)*, 2007 ONCA 649](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2007/2007onca649/2007onca649.html). The signs said:\n\n> Impark is by this sign offering space for public parking. You accept this offer by parking on this lot. Do not park on this lot if you do not agree to these terms and conditions \u2026 If you park and do not display a valid ticket or pass the rate is $69\\.55 per day or portion thereof.\n\nThe judge found:\n\n> the signs posted on Impark\u2019s lots expressly state that Impark consents to the parking of cars without payment in advance and held that the fees that Impark collects are sums owing to it in contract rather than damages for trespass\n\nIn another parking lot example, [*Imperial Parking Ltd. v. Canada*, 2000 CanLII 15612 (FCA)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2000/2000canlii15612/2000canlii15612.html), the Federal Court of Appeal said:\n\n> In my view, the unequivocal conduct which constitutes acceptance of the appellant's offer to provide a parking space occurs when the driver leaves the lot after parking his or her vehicle. This interpretation is reinforced by the text of the large sign posed at the entrance to the appellant's lot. That is the point in time in which an owner can be deemed to have accepted the appellant's offer. **Any time before that moment, a driver can demonstrate his rejection of the appellant's offer by driving away.** Those who purchase a ticket must be deemed to have accepted the appellant\"s contractual terms upon leaving their parked vehicle in the appellant's lot. **As for those who park their vehicles but fail to pay, the act of non\\-payment is more consistent with the intention to breach a contract than a refusal to enter into one.**\n\n### Bob's sign/note/sticker is not likely an effective rejection of the offer\n\nI understand you to be asking whether Bob's sign constitutes rejection of the offer such that Bob's subsequent conduct no longer would be considered acceptance of the contract.\n\nA rejection would terminate the offer, such that it can no longer be accepted. However, *rejection must be communicated to the offeror* (*Chitty on Contracts*, \u00a7 4\\-124\\). In examples where apparent acceptance by conduct is negated by evidence of contrary intention, the offeror was in a position to be aware of the rejector's manifest expression of that contrary intention (see examples in *Chitty on Contracts*, \u00a7 4\\-035\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Bob parks his car in a private parking lot with signs stating \"by parking here you agree to pay \u00a310/hour.\" He places a sign in his windshield that reads \"I AM TRESPASSING\" to indicate his rejection of the parking contract. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of Bob's actions?\n\nA) Bob has successfully rejected the contract offer and is now merely trespassing without any contractual obligations.\n\nB) Bob's sign is irrelevant, and he has accepted the contract by his conduct of parking in the lot.\n\nC) Bob has created a new counter-offer that the parking lot owner must now respond to.\n\nD) Bob's sign creates an ambiguity that automatically voids any potential contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Bob's sign is likely not an effective rejection of the offer. According to the legal principles outlined, acceptance is determined by conduct in this scenario, and the act of parking constitutes acceptance regardless of Bob's subjective intent. The parking lot owner has stipulated that parking in the lot will constitute acceptance, and as the \"master of the offer,\" this condition stands. \n\nCourts have consistently held that parking in such lots, even without payment, is more consistent with breaching a contract than refusing to enter one. Bob's sign is unlikely to be considered a valid rejection because rejection must be communicated to the offeror, and a sign in the windshield may not meet this requirement.\n\nThe correct answer is B because Bob's conduct of parking, despite his sign, would likely be interpreted as acceptance of the contract under the objective standard used by courts in such cases. His subjective intent to trespass, as expressed by the sign, does not override the objectively observable conduct of parking in the lot."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/92528/lost-merchandise-replacement-or-refund", "docs_id": 92528, "title": "Lost merchandise: Replacement or refund", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Bob ordered something on eBay from a seller and wins the auction for \u00a340\\.

Mutual Trust Co.*, [2002 SCC 43 at paragraph 26](https://canlii.ca/t/51s8#par26)); \"the purpose of expectation damages is to put the plaintiff in the same position it would have been *if the contract had been performed* (*Grandeur Homes Inc. v. Zeng*, [2021 ONSC 4005 at paragraph 19](https://canlii.ca/t/jgdx0#par19)). Unless Bob's contract specifies some other entitlement in the case of non\\-delivery, Bob will likely be awarded expectation damages.\n\nAs a starting point, courts are likely to view the market value of the contract (e.g. \u00a340\\) as the floor for expectation damages, but it is open to Bob to prove higher expectation damages by demonstrating the cost of obtaining a sufficiently similar alternative, while reasonably attempting to mitigate damages. That is: Bob should not simply announce a million\\-pound open bid for a similar phone, and Bob should not wait around if the price is increasing, but Bob could enter another reasonably competitive auction. Also, if Bob can prove losses incurred by not having the item in the meantime, those will also form part of the expectation damages.\n\n### Statute: Sales of Goods Acts essentially provide for expectation damages\n\nProvincial Sale of Goods Acts also say this. See e.g. [Ontario's](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90s01):\n\n> The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller\u2019s breach of contract.\n> \n> \n> Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been delivered, or, if no time was fixed, then at the time of the refusal to deliver.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Bob wins an eBay auction for a phone at \u00a340, significantly below its usual market value of \u00a3150.

Which of the following best describes Bob's likely entitlement under common law and statutory provisions?\n\nA) Bob is only entitled to a refund of the \u00a340 he paid, as that was the contract price.\n\nB) Bob is entitled to \u00a3150, as that is the market value of the phone.\n\nC) Bob is entitled to the cost of obtaining a similar phone through reasonable means, which may exceed \u00a340 but is not automatically \u00a3150.\n\nD) Bob has no entitlement, as the failure was not the seller's fault.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Under both common law expectation damages and statutory provisions like the Sale of Goods Act, Bob would be entitled to damages that put him in the same position as if the contract had been performed. This doesn't automatically mean the full market value (\u00a3150), but it also isn't limited to just the contract price (\u00a340). \n\nBob would be entitled to recover the cost of obtaining a similar phone through reasonable means, which could exceed \u00a340 if that's what it takes to get a comparable item.

The actual amount would depend on Bob's efforts to find a similar deal and the current market conditions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't fully compensate Bob for the loss of the bargain. Option B overstates the entitlement by assuming the full market value is always recoverable.

According to the documentation, using Slack (or any US-based SaaS) requires careful consideration under GDPR. Simply signing a DPA or paying for EU data residency is not enough. The company must analyze whether Slack is subject to relevant US laws that could compel data disclosure, and whether supplementary measures can be implemented to protect the data. This may include technical measures like end-to-end encryption, though such measures might be incompatible with Slack's functionality.

What recourse is there?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let's say we have a guy named Jack (Jack is definitely not a pseudonym for me, I swear). Jack is young and healthy, and was happily married to his equally young and healthy wife until recently. Then his wife, Jill, died suddenly from a mysterious infection that two different hospitals and 6\\+ doctors failed to identify.\n\nA few months later, Jack discovers an infectious agent in his house whose symptoms match closely with what killed Jill, and said agent is a fairly common occurrence in their area (basically any home). Jack is also positive that Jill's doctors never mentioned testing for said agent, so he suspects they missed something obvious, as hard as that is for him to believe.\n\nWhat might Jack do to investigate the possibility? Would he want to consult the hospitals first? A lawyer? A third party doctor? What term should Jack use to describe this possibility (malpractice, wrongful death, manslaughter, etc)? Bonus: What could happen to the doctor(s) if Jack's suspicions prove true?\n\nJack and Jill are in the US, for the record.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume you're not asking how to proceed in an actual lawsuit or prosecution, and are just posing this as an information question about law. In this scenario, Jack wants to sue as many people as possible, and to have as many people as possible prosecuted.\n\nJack can sue the involved hospitals and doctors for negligence. The basis of the suit would be that the defendants failed to exhibit the required degree of professional care under the circumstances, resulting in Jill's death. Crucial to the argument is that they did something which they clearly should not have done that contributed to her death, or failed to do something that they clearly should have done. Assume that the infectious agent was *stachybotrys ebola* (currently non\\-existent), that 40% of houses in the county have this agent, and that it can be cured with a two\\-week course of tetracyclin. Patients generally present certain symptoms when they have the condition, and there is a simple test that confirms the diagnosis. In this instance, the patient did present those symptoms and didn't present conflicting symptoms.\n\nThe legally\\-relevant question is, what would the average physician customarily do under these circumstances. Since this is a \"mysterious\" agent, they must have failed to diagnose the condition. Again, we have to be specific about what the doctor(s) did wrong, because failing to diagnose is not *per se* negligence. If the standard strong indicators of the infection is bleeding gums (which the patient did report) and lowered BP, and the doctor didn't look or take BP, that is probably not up to the standard of care that would customarily be given by the average physician in that situation (i.e. walk\\-in clinic doctor, not fictitious TV super\\-sleuth doctor).\n\nJack doesn't have to be positive about the doctors never mentioning such a test, because it's all in the record. Maybe after the fact somebody mentions this infectious agent and he hires a medical sleuth to determine that the agent is present in the house. He gets the idea to sue everybody and subpoenas records right and left, and discovers that (a) although they didn't identify that agent, all of the objective facts clearly indicate that was the cause of the ailment and the cause of death and (b) they had the evidence required to correctly diagnose the situation, but did not use a high enough standard of professional care.\n\nThe described scenario is rather far\\-fetched, because it appears based on the unanimous decisions of 6 independent doctors and 2 hospitals that they all were in fact using the customary standard of care in the profession.\n\nThe legal outcome will depend in part on the state where this took place. There is a \"[two schools of thought](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1909875/jones-v-chidester/)\" doctrine in some states which allows that there might be competing medical theories, so even though 60% of physicians would do X, 40% would do Y, and doing Y is not a negligent action (those numbers aren't part of the legal doctrine, they are there to clarify the kind of situation where this could apply).\n\nJack probably doesn't do anything other than make some phone calls and write some checks. It is extremely unlikely that he would \"discover\" this agent in the house, and more likely he would just call an attorney in the hope of getting something from the doctors. The attorney (experienced in such matters) hires medical investigators that lead to the factual allegations which are the foundation of the lawsuit.\n\nIf the doctors were really that bad, then they could be sued for millions of dollars, and possibly have their licenses to practice stripped, depending on how shocking the neglect was.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, what is the most appropriate initial step for Jack to take in investigating the possibility of medical negligence in his wife Jill's death?\n\nA) Immediately file a lawsuit against the hospitals and doctors involved\nB) Consult with an experienced medical malpractice attorney\nC) Conduct his own investigation into the infectious agent found in his house\nD) Directly confront the doctors who treated Jill with his suspicions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation:\nA) is incorrect because filing a lawsuit immediately without proper investigation or legal counsel could be premature and potentially harm Jack's case.\n\nB) is the correct answer.

The agreement quoted in the question does not mandate the employee continuing to work for the employer for **any** minimum time, not two years, and not six months. (Another provision might specify a required notice period, but that was not quoted and may not be in the agreement.)\n2. The agreement quoted does not prohibit the employee, after s/he leaves the job, from working for a competitor of the former employer, not even for a brief period.\n3. What the agreement quoted **does** do, is prohibit the employee from asking individuals and businesses who were customers of the former employer for orders for the **same** products as are sold by the former employer. This applies to orders on behalf of the employee personally, on behalf of a new employer, or on behalf of a business in which the employee has some sort of ownership stake (such as partner or shareholder). That is **all** that the quoted language prohibits.\n\nThis means that the employee cannot ask those who were customers of the old employer, to buy from or through him, the same products that the old employer sells. It does not mean that the former employee cannot sell such products, if the inquiry comes from the customer.\n\nThis sort of agreement is primarily aimed at preventing a salesperson from taking a client list with him or her to a new employer, and trying to get them to move their business from the salesperson's old employer to his or her new employer or business. If the employee is primarily an instructor and does not also act as a salesperson, this agreement will have almost no effect on him or her.\n\n[This site](https://fortelaw.ca/is-a-non-compete-enforceable/) discusses such agreement an myths about them in BC, Canada. It says:\n\n> Non\\-competition clauses can be enforced by courts in BC. It is true that employers face an uphill battle in getting a judge to agree to enforce a non\\-compete, but it can and does happen. If you are wondering whether your non\\-compete will stick, ask an employment lawyer. Enforceability of a non\\-compete depends on the specifics of the wording of the clause itself and the overall employment contract. Some key considerations are whether the clause is clearly worded, and whether it is limited in time, geography and scope of what is covered.\n> \n> \n> If a non\\-competition clause is enforced by a judge, it will only be applied to prevent the employee from the specific activities listed. If the employer has missed something from the clause, or there is a \u201cloop\\-hole,\u201d that is generally fair game.\n> \n> \n> Many contracts include non\\-solicitation (aka non\\-solicit) clauses, which are meant to prevent the employee from contacting clients. Non\\-solicitation clauses are still an uphill battle to enforce, but slightly easier than a non\\-competition clauses. This is because non\\-solicits don\u2019t dictate where an employee can work, just what business they can seek out. Even if there is no contract, obligations to respect confidential information, and fiduciary duties (in the case of key employees) last beyond the end of employment and can limit competition.\n\n[An online paper on \"Is my Employee\u2019s Non\\-Compete Agreement Enforceable?\"](https://www.canadaemploymenthumanrightslaw.com/2018/02/employees-non-compete-agreement-enforceable/) by Lisa Stam says:\n\n> In Canada, courts have generally been reluctant to uphold agreements that have the effect of restricting an individual\u2019s ability to earn a living or pursue the job of their choice. Indeed, courts take the initial position that restrictive covenants in employment agreements are unenforceable, unless the employer can demonstrate otherwise. A restrictive covenant must jump through several hoops to be deemed enforceable.\n\n...\n\n> A non\\-solicitation agreement will allow a former employee to work for a competitor, but prevent them from soliciting the clients (and possibly the employees) of their former employer for a specific period of time. Former employees may have close relationships with clients. Allowing them to solicit these clients may give them an unfair advantage against the former employer in the marketplace. If the employee does not solicit the client, but the client leaves to follow them anyway, there is little an employer can do.\n\n...\n\n> If a court finds a restrictive covenant clause unreasonable, for example it restricts solicitation for 12 months when 6 would have been reasonable, they will not read it down to fix it. Canadian courts require the employer to get it right the first time and a flawed clause will therefore normally be unenforceable.\n\nIn short, the above quoted agreement may not be enforceable.

You may *not* use the code except under license from the assignee; in particular, you may *not* modify it and use it in your own proprietary program, unless you have permission from the company.\n\nThe default for a simple copyright assignment is that the assignee gains the right to do whatever they want with the code. If they own the copyright, nothing they do could conceivably be copyright infringement. Likewise, the original author often loses any right to do anything whatsoever with their code without explicitly gaining permission. Note, though, that the GPL is not revocable except under certain conditions; the company could at most make *future* versions proprietary. \n\nThat said, these agreements can be more complicated. The FSF copyright assignment licenses the code back to the author for use as the author sees fit; it also imposes conditions on how the FSF may use the code. Copyright assignments are generally standard contracts, and can have all sorts of terms. I'm not sure what the effect is if the FSF violates its transfer, but the specific legal document you have been asked to sign is very important.

The project owners require contributors to transfer all rights and ownership of their code to the company. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the implications for contributors?\n\nA) Contributors retain the right to use their contributed code in any way they choose, including in proprietary projects.\n\nB) The company can only use the contributed code under the terms of the LGPL, regardless of the rights transfer.\n\nC) Contributors lose all rights to their code, but the existing LGPL license for the project cannot be revoked for past versions.\n\nD) The rights transfer allows the company to relicense all versions of the project, including past ones, under any terms they choose.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When contributors transfer all rights and ownership of their code to the company, they essentially lose control over how that code can be used. However, the LGPL license that was already applied to the project cannot be retroactively revoked for existing versions. The company gains the right to dual-license the code and use it in proprietary versions, but they cannot change the license of already-released LGPL versions. Contributors lose the ability to use their contributed code in their own projects without permission from the company. This scenario best matches option C, which acknowledges both the loss of rights for the contributor and the persistence of the LGPL for existing versions."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32802/do-judges-get-penalised-when-their-decisions-are-quashed-by-a-higher-court", "docs_id": 32802, "title": "Do judges get penalised when their decisions are quashed by a higher court?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In New Zealand, court decisions are fairly often taken to a higher court and got quashed / overturned.

The former are far less damaging than the latter. For an example of the former, a judge is applying a relatively new statute for which there have been no other decisions and interprets the legislation in a reasonable way but one the appeal court disagrees with. For an example of the latter, deciding the matter on a basis which neither party put before the court and which the judge did not draw to the parties attention during the trial \\- as a common law country, the New Zealand legal system is adversarial: the court exists to decide the dispute between the parties on the basis the parties argue, not to go on a \"frolic of its own\".\n\nIn addition, appeal courts can only overrule a decision if the judge has made an error of law, not if they have made an error of fact.

In general a dog owner is responsible for taking \"reasonable\" measures to control the dog and prevent harm. What measures are reasonable will depend on the detailed facts. particularly important will be the previous history and actions of the dog. If a dog has a history of attacking people, then the owner is expected to know this, and to take measures which are reasonable **in light of** that history.\n\nThe page [\"Strict Liability Dog\\-Bite Laws\"](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/dog-bite-statutes.html) from Nolo documents states in which an owner may be responsible for any bite. As that page says:\n\n> When a dog hurts someone, the injured person is likely to sue the animal's owner for medical costs and other damages. In more than half of the states, those lawsuits may be based on laws that make the owner automatically liable for most dog\\-bite injuries. These laws are often called \"strict liability\" statutes, because the injured person doesn't have to prove that the animal's owner knew the dog was dangerous (often called the \"one\\-bite rule\") or that the dog owner was negligent (legalese for \"careless\").\n\nThat page goes on to say:\n\n> Also, dog owners may have legal defenses to avoid liability for dog bites. Most dog\\-bite laws include exceptions\u2014typically when the injured person was trespassing or provoked the dog. And many of the laws don't apply if the dog was performing its duties as a police dog when the bite happened.\n\nThe page lists details on the laws for holding dog owners liable in the listed states under a \"strict liability\" theory. The page notes that even when one of the listed exceptions applies, so a strict\\-liability suit cannot be brought, a suit under a negligence theory (failure to take reasonable precautions) may still be possible. A plaintiff may cite both theories in a single suit where the law permits. The page lists 36 states and the District of Columbia as having some sort of strict liability statute for dog attacks as of December 2020\\.\n\nIn a number of states that the person attacked was trespassing is considered an exception to the strict\\-liability rule.\n\nThe page [\"Brief Summary of Dog Bite Laws\"](https://www.animallaw.info/article/brief-summary-dog-bite-laws) published by Michigan State University in 2004 says:\n\n> Liability can be based on a common law theory of negligence of the owner where recovery is based on the action or lack of action by an animal owner /keeper. Common law is the law derived from court decisions and historical traditions rather than explicit statutory provisions. Recovery at law under this concept requires a showing by the injured party that there was a legal duty owed to the injured party by the animal owner /keeper and that the injury arose because of a breach of that duty. This duty can arise from a failing to properly secure an animal or entrusting the animal with someone unfit to restrain the animal. It can also arise independently from violating a local ordinance, such as those ordinances that prohibit dogs running at large or mandatory muzzling provisions. It has been said that one who keeps a vicious dog, with knowledge of its savage and vicious nature, is presumed to be negligent if he or she does not keep the animal secure from injuring others.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> States may also impose a more stringent standard of fault called strict liability . In those states, liability automatically arises when a domestic animal has a known vicious propensity attacks, bites, injures, or even chases someone. There is no necessity to show that the owner was negligent in his or her actions in proving liability. ( Click here for a summary of states that impose strict liability). In addition, owners may face liability based on the legal category of the dog him or herself.\n> \n> \n> Nearly all states have some laws that govern what can be termed \u201cdangerous dog\u201d or \u201cvicious dog\u201d laws. These laws outline what constitutes a \u201cdangerous dog\u201d or even a \u201cpotentially dangerous dog\u201d and under what circumstances an owner will be liable for the actions of such dogs. Moreover, some states impose what is called \u201cstrict liability\u201d on dog owners for any injury resulting from a dog deemed dangerous regardless of any knowledge of the dog\u2019s tendencies. These strict liability laws may also limit the ability of the owner to claim a defense to the action. In other words, the law may state that the owner is liable regardless of whether the person who was bitten was trespassing on the owner\u2019s property or whether the owner knew the dog was vicious.\n> \n> \n> Regardless of whether you are dealing with a strict liability state or not, provocation will be an important factual issue. Provocation simply refers to a situation where a dog is incited, encouraged, or provoked into biting a person. In states where there is strict liability, an owner may use provocation as a defense to the dog bite. This will either reduce the owner's liability based in part (comparative or contributory negligence on the part of the victim) or bar the victim's claim completely. A court will either determine provocation from the perspective of the injured party (i.e., did the person intend to provoke the animal or have knowledge that his or her actions would provoke the animal) or from the perspective of the dog.\n\nThe page [\"State Dog Bite Laws: \"One\\-Bite\" vs. Strict Liability\"](https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/one-bite-strict-liability-dog-bite.html) from AllLaw says:\n\n> Prior to the twentieth century, a dog owner was usually only held liable for injuries when their dog bit someone if the owner had reason to know the dog might bite. This was known as the \"one bite\" rule because it generally meant that a dog was allowed \"one free bite\" before the owner would face legal trouble.\n> \n> \n> In modern times, the one bite rule does not necessarily allow a dog one free bite. If an owner knows the particular breed is dangerous, or if the particular dog might be prone to biting because of its general character or some other factor, he or she could face liability for the dog's first bite.\n> \n> \n> The focus is on whether the owner knew or should have known that the dog might bite, and whether the owner took reasonable precautions based on that knowledge. For example, if a relatively aggressive dog recently underwent surgery and the owner did not warn a house guest not to pet the dog, the owner might be held liable if the house guest is subsequently bitten.\n> \n> \n> As a fault concept, the \"one bite\" rule has much in common with (and often overlaps) the personal injury liability rule of negligence.\n> \n> \n> Many states have enacted \"dog bite\" statutes that create a form of \"strict liability\" for dog bites. Strict liability means that the defendant is held liable if a certain event occurs, regardless of whether the defendant could have done anything to prevent the event.\n> \n> \n> The typical strict liability dog bite statute says that a dog owner is liable if his or her dog bites someone, regardless of whether the owner did anything wrong, as long as the injured person:\n> \n> \n> * was not trespassing or otherwise breaking the law at the time of the incident, and\n> * did not provoke the dog.\n> \n> \n> If a strict liability dog bite statute applies, what the owner did or did not know about the dog prior to the bite is usually irrelevant. Note that strict liability dog bite statutes are not the same in every state that has one of these laws on the books. ...\n\nIn short, the particular law of the state or locality, and the particular facts of the case will both be important in the case of any dog attack.\n\nBy the way, nothing an animal does on its own can be classed as self\\-defense, although where a human orders an animal to attack that might be self\\-defense by the human (using the animal), depending on the facts.

In states with strict liability dog bite laws, there are typically exceptions to owner liability, and trespassing is one of the most common exceptions. As the information states, \"In a number of states that the person attacked was trespassing is considered an exception to the strict-liability rule.\" Since the intruder illegally entered the home, they would likely be considered a trespasser, which would exempt the homeowner from strict liability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while strict liability generally holds owners responsible regardless of fault, the trespassing exception would likely apply in this case.\n\nOption B is incorrect because animals cannot legally act in \"self-defense\" - this concept applies only to humans. The dog's motivation for biting is not relevant under strict liability laws.\n\nOption D is incorrect because under strict liability, the dog's previous behavior is typically not considered.

I thought they would have done employment verification before signing the contract, and that once the contract was signed, that was my salary, period. I'm a little baffled that they can come back now and change my salary.\n\nI actually declined another offer based on signing the contract with the school in question. Without going into the details, reducing the salary of this position may have made me reconsider the position that I declined.\n\nIt is also worth noting that I did not misrepresent anything during the hiring process.

In general, once a contract is signed by both parties, its terms (including salary) are legally binding. The school cannot unilaterally change the terms of the contract after it has been executed, unless there is a specific provision in the contract that allows for such adjustments based on employment verification or other factors.

In this case, the final period starts on May 29th and ends on June 15th, which is 18 days. However, June has 30 days, so we calculate the daily rate based on a 30-day month: (2500 / 30) = \u00a383.33 per day. For 15 days in June, the tenant owes 83.33 \u00d7 15 = \u00a31,250.00.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it arbitrarily assumes half the rent is due.

The classic example of speech that is unprotected is \"[Falsely shouting FIRE in a crowded theater](http://civil-liberties.yoexpert.com/civil-liberties-general/is-it-legal-to-shout-%22fire%22-in-a-crowded-theater-19421.html)\".

The court in that case said, in effect, that if a newspaper had to be sure that its every statement could be proved true in every detail, it would be unwilling to vigorously report on matters of significant public concern (this is a paraphrase, I'll add a quote later).\n\nOpinions are considered legally not to be either false or true. \"President Jone is the worst leader the US has ever had\" Is a statement of opinion, and so is not defamation. \n\nMoreover, in political contexts, attempts to punish false statements of fact that are not defamatory have been held unconstitutional. One example was the \"Stolen Valor\" act, which punished falsely claiming to have been awarded a medal by the US armed forces. This was held to be against the First Amendment. \n\nIn general, regulation of speech (which here includes writing and other forms of communication) must be fairly narrowly drawn and must have good reasons behind them to survive a court challenge.

The document explains that intentionally false speech generally receives less protection than other forms of speech, but it's not entirely unprotected. The level of protection depends on various factors, including the context, intent, and potential harm.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all false speech is fully protected.

Since the first year I didn't understand very much about this topic, I decided to turn to a \"Verein\" that managed my tax\\-declaration.  \n\nDuring the first year I had a lot of contact with the guy working there, therefore I simply asked how could I pay and he gave me an invoice, which I paid.\n\nThe second year I no longer needed the \"Verein\" services and I simply did not ask the guy to submit my tax declaration. Absolutely no communications were sent from both sides.\n\nDuring the third year I received an invoice from the \"Verein\", stating that I had to pay the sum due for the second year, plus a fine, because I didn't pay them before (how was I supposed to? They didn't send me anything \\- and the payment is based on people's income). Since I was not willing to have arguments, I paid and asked to terminate what I found out to be our contract right at that moment.\n\nThe woman I spoke to, told me that it would not have been possible before the end of the third year, and since it already started, and I needed to honor my part of the contract and pay for that year too.\n\nThere is more than one problem with this contract, I don't have any copy, and I am quite positive that if I did receive the invoice on time (2nd year), I would have understood that I was under a binding obligation, and therefore would have asked to terminate the contract as well **before** having to pay for another year.\n\nAm I under any obligation to honor that payment, provided that I never received their invoice for the second year within an acceptable timing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's hard to say what you are obliged to if you cannot check the contract.

Which of the following statements is most likely correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The person is not obligated to pay for the second year because they didn't receive an invoice in a timely manner.\nB) The person must pay for all three years because German law always enforces multi-year contracts with automatic renewals.\nC) The person's obligation to pay depends on the specific terms of the contract, which should be reviewed to determine their responsibilities.\nD) The Verein has no right to charge for the second year since the person didn't explicitly request services that year.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, the person's obligations depend on the specific terms of the contract. Without seeing the contract, it's impossible to determine definitively what the person is required to pay. The documentation mentions that in Germany, contracts with automatic annual renewals do exist and are legal, but the specific terms would dictate whether this applies in this case.

The question is whether the algorithm is subject to copyright protection: if it is, that means that Dr. A has to authorize a derivative work (a translation is a derivative work). An underlying equation (viz. .25\\*A \\+ .25\\*B \\+ .5\\*(A\\\\B)) is not subject to copyright protection. A verbal description of how to compute the score, or of the meaning of variables, or of how to present questions via a program so that values of A, B.... are supplied would be subject to protection. The essential distinction is that copyright law (as opposed to patent) protects the expression, especially aspects of visual presentation and wording. The requirement is that a work which manifests expressive creativity (it need not be a high level of creativity) is protectable. That would include any unauthorized translation of Dr. A's article. If the algorithm is patented, patent (not copyright) issues would arise, but in normal usage you can't \"translate\" an algorithm from one language to another.\n\nThere is an issue of whether permission was received. If A says to B \"Yes you may\" then unless there is evidence of such permission (an email for example), B may be in trouble.

Dr. B's translation would be considered a derivative work, which requires authorization from the copyright holder (Dr. A) even if the core algorithm isn't copyrightable.

The other options are incorrect or misleading:\n\nB is incorrect because anonymous distribution doesn't guarantee protection from legal action. The developer could still be sued for contributory patent infringement.\n\nC is incorrect because the developer could potentially face both patent and copyright infringement claims.\n\nD is incorrect because the lack of commercial use doesn't guarantee protection from legal action.

The company B is international company originally from AU, and it explicitly states that it is GDPR compliant on the dedicated page on its website.\n\nThe company A was from US and had no mention of GDPR in privacy policy before acquisition (Jan 2017\\), so we assume it was not GDPR\\-compliant.\n\nPre\\-acquisition Terms of Use of A: <https://pastebin.com/zXmCdLVQ>  \n\nPre\\-acquisition Privacy Policy of A: <https://pastebin.com/T2EyX7Fb>\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a lot going on in this question, so I'll pick out some individual aspects. Last but not least, I'll discuss if GDPR even applies.\n\nDoes the GDPR require consent for X?\n------------------------------------\n\nAlmost always, no. Consent is only one of many legal bases of processing. A common alternative to consent is a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d where a balancing test is performed between this legitimate interest and your interests, rights, and freedoms. Consent is typically only appropriate if this balancing test fails, for example if you would not reasonably expect this processing activity to occur.\n\nIt's worth noting that it's a reasonably common occurrence that businesses are sold or merged. This is not unexpected. In general, you would not be required to consent to such a transfer.\n\nWhat can a company do with personal data acquired through a merger/acquisition?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR does not provide explicit provisions for this case. But it might be useful to think about the two cases where (a) the new company is a continuation or successor of the original one, and (b) where the data is transferred (\u201csold\u201d) to an otherwise unrelated company.\n\nIn case (a) where the business is continued as normal, there is no change.\n\nIn case (b) where data is transferred to a separate company, things are more complicated.\n\n* The original company would need a legal basis for transferring the data. But as mentioned above, there might be a legitimate interest. Arguably, such a transfer could also be based on Art 6(1\\)(b) if the transfer is *necessary* to continue to provide the service, for example if the original company would otherwise have to terminate service.\n\nOf course, activities like data brokering where access to data is granted to unrelated third parties would generally fail to be covered by contractual necessity or a legitimate interest, and would probably need consent \u2013 but that doesn't seem to be the case here.\n* When a data controller (such as the new company) acquires your personal data from sources other than directly from you, then they are subject to the notice requirements in Art 14\\. They have to actively notify you about their processing activities. But because you received emails that mentioned the transfer, this condition might have been met.\n\nOf course the new company continues to be bound by the purpose limitation principle as detailed in Art 6(4\\) \u2013 they can only use the data for purposes that are compatible with the purposes for which the data was initially collected. Thus, the new company cannot arbitrarily widen processing purposes, though some change in scope is certainly permissible.\n\nHow does the GDPR right to object and to restrict processing apply here?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Art 21 GDPR right to object means that if the legal basis for a processing activity is a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d, then you can ask for an opt\\-out. But in some cases, this objection does not have to be granted. An objection essentially requires the controller to repeat the legitimate interest balancing test, taking into account the \u201cgrounds relating to \\[your] particular situation\u201d that you provided in the objection.\n\nThe Art 18 GDPR right to restrict processing is an alternative to the right to erasure. It applies only in narrow circumstances, for example while an objection is being checked.\n\nIt is likely that you were informed about the transfer to a new company about 1 month in advance, so that you would have been able to prevent this transfer by closing your account prior to the deadline. If the new company conducts processing activities based on a legitimate interest, then their presumably GDPR\\-compliant privacy notice about which you were notified will certainly explain that you have a right to object.\n\nIs the new company GDPR\\-compliant?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThat is impossible to tell, but nothing you've shown so far indicates that they're non\\-compliant.\n\nMy largest issue with this story is that the new company is from Australia, a country with extraordinarily bad privacy protections (as of 2022\\). However, due to the way how the GDPR treats international transfers of data, this doesn't prevent Australian data controllers from being GDPR\\-compliant, although it does make it difficult for other companies to use services based in Australia.\n\nDoes GDPR even apply?\n---------------------\n\nWhether GDPR applies to a non\\-European company depends only on whether they either offer goods or services to people who are in Europe (\u201ctargeting criterion\u201d), and whether the monitor people's behavior that takes place in Europe. Factors such as your citizenship would be irrelevant.\n\nI'll ignore the monitoring criterion, and focus on the targeting criterion. I'll assume that you are in Europe (EU/EEA or UK).\n\nWhether a company is targeting people in Europe depends primarily on the company's intentions. It does not matter whether the service is accessible from Europe.\n\nThus, it is quite possible that the original company was not subject to the GDPR. Then, any questions about GDPR, consent, and data transfers are moot.\n\nIn contrast, the new company clearly mentions GDPR\\-compliance, which would only matter if they intend for people in Europe to use their services. So GDPR probably applies to them, giving you the full suite of GDPR data subject rights as (hopefully) outlined in their privacy notice. And as long as they notified you that they acquired your personal data in accordance of Art 14, I don't seen anything that they might have done wrong in respect to this acquisition/merger.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A user had an account with Company A, which was acquired by Company B.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the GDPR implications of this situation?\n\nA) The user must provide explicit consent for their data to be transferred to Company B, otherwise the transfer violates GDPR.\n\nB) Company B is in violation of GDPR if they do not allow the user to delete their account without connecting to Company B's services.\n\nC) The transfer of user data from Company A to Company B as part of an acquisition likely does not require explicit user consent under GDPR, provided certain conditions are met.\n\nD) Since Company A was based in the US and not GDPR-compliant before the acquisition, GDPR does not apply to this situation at all.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Under GDPR, consent is not always required for processing personal data, including in cases of company acquisitions. Legitimate interests can often serve as a legal basis for such transfers. The acquiring company (B) needs to inform users about the data transfer (which they did via email) and continue to respect the purpose limitation principle. While users have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests, this doesn't necessarily mean the company must cease all processing. As long as Company B is targeting users in the EU/EEA, they would need to comply with GDPR regardless of Company A's previous compliance status. The inability to delete an account without connecting to the new service is not necessarily a GDPR violation, though it may raise concerns depending on the specific circumstances."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43805/do-i-have-a-case-against-my-employer", "docs_id": 43805, "title": "Do I have a case against my employer?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In March 2018, the financial advisor I worked with, trapped me in my cubicle and asked me if a lump in his groin area made his pants fit tighter.

The advisor was given discipline however I was still forced to work with him which made me feel like my employer did not validate the position I was put in. \n\nOn July 15, 2019, I changed job offices and began working with a new advisor. On the first day I started, he showed me pictures of people who he would like to become his clients and he wanted me to actively communicate and socialize with them as well. The pictures were of a fake breasted woman being groped by her husband and of the woman\u2019s license plate which read \u201cMuff Diver.\u201d The advisor proceeded to tell me that the couple in the picture were swingers but that he doesn\u2019t participate in that lifestyle. This was said in front of my immediate supervisor who said nothing.\n\nMy red flags went up immediately. All the same feelings of disgust, crossing boundaries, and anxiety came flooding back at me just the same way as the incident with the first advisor. \n\nI drove to work for a week before my mind and body just refused. My anxiety wouldn\u2019t allow me to get in my car. I was fearful to drive because I was overcome with panic. \n\nI am currently on FMLA.

This is not as high a bar as it used to be, but the courts will not grant relief for \"isolated incidents\" unless they are extremely serious. Such incidents typically involve some kind of forcible, physical, sexual contact, which I don't see here.\n\nThe general rule is that the more severe the harassment, the less frequently it needs to occur, and vice versa. Unfortunately, courts would probably look at the events you've described \\-\\- not physical, not sexually explicit, not threatening, not intimidating, not soliciting sexual conduct, not mocking you \\-\\- and say that they are not particularly severe.\n\nGiven the lack of severity, the court would need to see them happening with pretty regular frequency, but you've described only two events in the course of about 18 months. And with one of those, the employer appears to have taken reasonable corrective action, leaving you with only one incident to complain about in however long you've worked there.\n\nEven if a court agreed that your co\\-workers engaged in unwanted sexual conduct, I'd expect the employer to be able to successfully invoke the *Farragher\\-Ellerth* defense, which permits them to escape liability if they can prove:\n\n1. that the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior; and\n2. that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise.\n\n[*Burlington Industries, Inc. v.

[Arizona Laws 13\\-2409](https://www.lawserver.com/law/state/arizona/az-laws/arizona_laws_13-2409) is I believe the relevant section (emphasis mine):\n\n> A person who knowingly attempts by means of bribery, **misrepresentation**, intimidation or force or threats of force to **obstruct, delay or prevent the communication of information or testimony relating to a violation of any criminal statute to a peace officer**, magistrate, prosecutor or grand jury or who knowingly injures another in his person or property on account of the giving by the latter or by any other person of any such information or testimony to a peace officer, magistrate, prosecutor or grand jury is guilty of a class 5 felony, except that it is a class 3 felony if the person commits the offense with the intent to promote, further or assist a criminal street gang.\n\nIn general, a law that required you to give answers to a police officer during an investigation in English if you understand English and have waived your right to silence would violate your First Amendment right to free speech (as it is in effect \"forced speech\"). However, you would need to be careful not to tell the police officer that you do not understand English if that is not true, as it could be misrepresentation.\n\nPolice officer training likely includes instructions for detaining someone that cannot understand them and the police can detain you and wait for an interpreter to continue their investigation if they determine that is necessary. You may actually be shooting yourself in the foot by doing this, because the time it takes for them to get an interpreter likely extends the amount of time the detainment can last while remaining \"reasonable,\" so you may be waiting by the side of the road longer than you would have if you had simply told the officer that you were invoking your right to silence and followed the officer's instructions without speaking.\n\nAs an aside, as more people are educated on their rights via the Internet and understand why they should always invoke their right to silence when detained, police officers will get more used to people they pull over immediately and politely telling them that they are going to invoke their right to silence. I doubt most police officers will hold it against you as long as you are otherwise cooperative and don't yell at them or berate them.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: During a traffic stop in Arizona, a driver decides to speak only in German to the police officer, despite being fluent in English.

Speaking German instead of English does not necessarily constitute obstruction of justice, as long as the driver does not make false statements or misrepresentations.\n\nB) Incorrect. There is no legal requirement in Arizona for a driver to communicate in English during a traffic stop, even if they are capable of doing so. The First Amendment protects against forced speech.\n\nC) Correct. This approach is legally permissible, as the driver has the right to remain silent or choose the language they speak in. However, it may prolong the traffic stop if the officer needs to wait for an interpreter, potentially extending the \"reasonable\" duration of the detention.\n\nD) Incorrect.

If you turn from the leftmost lane travelling in your direction on one road into the same lame of the new road, you're remaining in your lane. If everyone remains in their lane, traffic can flow smoothly around the corner. If people can change their lanes while turning, then you open the door for traffic chaos as cars weave around each other while turning.

In most jurisdictions, when making a right turn at an intersection with multiple lanes, drivers should turn from the rightmost lane into the rightmost lane of the new road. This practice ensures smooth traffic flow and reduces the risk of collisions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because turning into any available lane can lead to conflicts with other vehicles and is generally not permitted.\n\nOption B is incorrect as it describes an improper right turn from the wrong lane.\n\nOption D is incorrect and potentially dangerous. Changing lanes while turning is typically illegal and can cause traffic chaos and increase the risk of accidents.\n\nThe principle behind this rule is to maintain lane integrity through the turn, allowing multiple lanes of traffic to turn simultaneously without interfering with each other. This approach maximizes safety and efficiency at intersections."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64602/is-it-legal-for-using-the-limited-free-storage-of-google-drive-freely-for-busine", "docs_id": 64602, "title": "Is it legal for using the limited free storage of Google Drive freely for business?

Option A is incorrect because the current terms do not restrict usage to personal purposes only. Option B, while close, is too absolute in stating there are no restrictions whatsoever.
