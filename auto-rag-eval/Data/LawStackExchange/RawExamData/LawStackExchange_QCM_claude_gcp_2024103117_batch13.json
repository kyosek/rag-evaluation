There are [exemptions](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/whd/flsa/screen75.asp) some of which relate to the minimum wage requirements, which I will ignore. Then there are state rules regarding [when minors can work](https://lni.wa.gov/workers-rights/youth-employment/hours-of-work). Age 14 is the lower ends of allowed minor labor without a court order. There are two age brackets, 14\\-15 and 16\\-17, regarding the number of hours per day and week, whether during a school week or a non\\-school week. There are also exemptions where minors (16\\-17\\) are not restricted e.r.t. \"school week hours\" depending on whether e.g. then are married, are parents, are taking college courses, or have a high school diploma or GED, but they are otherwise restricted from fully volunteering their labor.\n\n[Title 49](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49) has the state laws regarding labor. It is challenging to establish that anyone can legally volunteer their labor under state law, even though it is not prohibited at the federal level. If you turn to Chapter 49\\.46 RCW which relates to minimum wage, under the definition of \"employee\" excludes\n\n> (d) Any individual engaged in the activities of an educational,\n> charitable, religious, state or local governmental body or agency, or\n> nonprofit organization where the employer\\-employee relationship does\n> not in fact exist or where the services are rendered to such\n> organizations gratuitously.\n\nThere are no further restrictions on volunteer labor, at least w.r.t. to the issue of being paid (insurance is a separate title).\n\nYou can now put these two parts together. *No* minor can work unlimited hours; a minor *can* work as a volunteer for certain non\\-profits.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 16-year-old high school student wants to volunteer at a local non-profit organization dedicated to environmental conservation.

For 16-17 year olds, there are limits on how many hours they can work during school weeks and non-school weeks. The fact that it's volunteer work doesn't exempt the student from these restrictions. The student would still need to adhere to the hour limits set for their age group (16-17) and cannot work unlimited hours. Additionally, the work must be done for a qualifying non-profit organization, which this environmental conservation group likely is. The need for forms like a Minor Release may still apply, as state laws can vary on such requirements for volunteer work."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16481/can-chelsea-manning-be-sued-in-civil-court-by-anyone-named-in-the-documents-that", "docs_id": 16481, "title": "Can Chelsea Manning be sued in civil court by anyone named in the documents that were leaked?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Since Chelsea Manning's name is in the news, the following question seems interesting: \n\n* Manning leaked a large set of documents\n* Some of them could have clearly had a negative effect on specific persons (e.g. loss of reputation).\n\n**As such, can a person who was negatively affected by the leak sue Manning in civil court?** (assuming they have a reasonable claim that they were indeed damaged by the leaks meaningfully).\n\nBy \"can,\" I mean \"has a reasonable chance of having a meaningful lawsuit that proceeds, instead of it being thrown out by a judge as ridiculous due to obvious legal problems\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming that the documents were either true, or Manning reasonably believed that they were true, [there would be no cause of action for defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation#Truth).\n\nMany of the documents disclosed would have been confidential in some sense, but usually a violation of a confidentiality statute has a criminal sanction associated with it, but does not carry with it a private cause of action \u2013 in part, because conceptually, the party actually harmed is considered to be the government and not the person about whom information is revealed.\n\nIt is also possible that Manning could utilize the [state secrets privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege) as a defense and have such a suit dismissed on the grounds that a full and adequate defense of the claims would require the disclosure of official state secrets. For example, if a covert agent were murdered due to a wrongful disclosure of information, usually official disclosure of the fact of being a covert agent would be required to prove the case, and that evidence would be barred by the state secrets privilege, effectively barring the lawsuit entirely.\n\nConstitutional claims of privacy violations under the 4th Amendment generally relate to the wrongful acquisition of information and not its wrongful disclosure. The constitution bars unreasonable search and seizure, not unreasonable disclosure of information.\n\nThe only privacy tort that might be applicable is \"Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts.\" (A sister privacy tort, Intrusion upon seclusion or solitude, or into privacy affairs, is directed at the collection of data phase and not the dissemination phase).\n\n*See* [Restatement of the Law (Second) of Torts, \u00a7\u00a7 652B and 652D](https://cyber.harvard.edu/privacy/Privacy_R2d_Torts_Sections.htm).\n\nBut, this tort raises serious First Amendment concerns and has not been widely adopted. Realistically, this tort is unconstitutional in the absence of an affirmative contractual or quasi\\-contractual duty not to reveal facts that runs to the person making the disclosure, and in general, Manning would not have that kind of relationship. \n\nThe classic public disclosure of embarrassing private facts case would involve a lawyer's or psychotherapist's revelations about a client.\n\nAlso, in the case of the public disclosure tort the basis for damages is largely personal emotional distress and violation of trust, as opposed to damage to reputation, *per se*. The requirement is that the disclosure be embarrassing or breach of contract, not that it harm someone's reputation since you have no legal right to a reputation that differs from the truth.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Chelsea Manning's document leak, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential civil lawsuits against Manning by individuals negatively affected by the leak?\n\nA) Individuals could successfully sue Manning for defamation if the leaked information damaged their reputation.\n\nB) Those harmed could easily pursue a lawsuit based on constitutional privacy violations under the 4th Amendment.\n\nC) A civil lawsuit would likely be dismissed due to the state secrets privilege or lack of private cause of action for confidentiality breaches.\n\nD) Individuals could readily sue Manning under the tort of \"Public disclosure of embarrassing private facts\" without significant legal hurdles.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate. The answer explains that violations of confidentiality statutes typically carry criminal sanctions but not private causes of action. Additionally, the state secrets privilege could be used as a defense to have such suits dismissed. Options A and B are incorrect because truth is a defense against defamation, and constitutional privacy claims generally relate to wrongful acquisition, not disclosure of information.

If someone were to give you a physical copy of their resume (assuming such a thing would happen in this day and age) then giving this to someone else without copying it is not copyright violation. There may be privacy issues involved but that\u2019s another issue.\n\nFurther, in the United States, there is a [fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) doctrine which allows limited copying without permission in certain circumstances. This is likely to apply in a lot of situations around copying resumes.\n\nFinally, permission does not have to be explicit. For example, if you receive a resume in the course of a job application then permission to make copies *for that purpose* can be assumed to have been implicitly given.\n\n> Can you get sued if the resume finds its way to someone the author did not intend to see it, and the author suffers some harm as a result?\n\nUnder privacy law, possibly. Under copyright law, no.\n\nWhat you can be sued for is *making a copy*. It doesn\u2019t matter where this ends up.\n\n> Is distributing a resume in the context of professional networking considered as implicit consent to allow sharing with anyone under the US legal system?\n\nNo. It\u2019s explicit consent because those networking sites have Terms and Conditions that explicitly deal with copyright.

In this scenario, Sarah can likely make a copy of John's resume to share with her colleague for purposes related to John's job application. This falls under both the fair use doctrine and implied consent in U.S. copyright law. When John submitted his resume for a job application, he implicitly gave permission for it to be copied and shared for that purpose within the company. Additionally, this limited copying for internal hiring purposes would likely be considered fair use. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while John submitted the resume for a job application, this doesn't give the company unlimited rights to share it with anyone. \n\nAnswer B is too restrictive; explicit written permission is not always necessary, especially in job application contexts where implied consent often applies.\n\nAnswer D is also incorrect because while such a statement in the job application would make the sharing permissions clearer, it's not strictly necessary for Sarah to share the resume internally for hiring-related purposes."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67140/do-court-experts-need-to-agree-to-be-appointed-summoned-subpoenaed", "docs_id": 67140, "title": "Do court experts need to agree to be appointed / summoned / subpoenaed?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Court experts are special class of expert witnesses that are appointed / summoned / subpoenaed by the court \u2014 as opposed to being called by the parties.

As an example, New York continues to consider an individual to be domiciled in NY until and unless that individual establishes a permanent domicile elsewhere.\n\nAnd (with few exceptions) if New York considers you to be domiciled in NY, you are considered a resident and must pay state tax on your worldwide income. This is distinct from individuals who have to pay state tax on NY source income.\n\nBottom line: if New York considers you a resident, you must pay state taxes on worldwide income, even if you did not set foot in NY or in any way have a connection to NY during the tax year.\n\nExample: John Q. Smith lives in NY and pays taxes for five years. For all of 2015 he is outside of NY and couch surfs around the US without establishing a permanent domicile. He does not return to NY after 2015\\.

The case is heard in NY, New York state law is the authority cited, Smith gets a state judgement against him and he has no way to appeal it outside of the state's jurisdiction?\n\nAnd the second question, assuming somehow the case gets to federal court or another state's court: Smith argues he had no connection to New York during 2015 and shouldn't have to pay New York state taxes.

If it is successful, it doesn't matter what the state law says. Even if the state court just says, \"Suck it; you're in New York so you pay according to New York law,\" he of course still has the opportunity to appeal that judgment to the U.S. Supreme Court once he's exhausted his appeals in state court.\n\nOn the second question, the basic idea is that you can't be a citizen of the United States without being a citizen of one of those states (or D.C., Puerto Rico, etc.). We determine which state you're a citizen of based on domicile, so until a New York citizen sets up somewhere other than New York, he's stuck with New York citizenship. This concept is fundamental to a lot of different areas of law, and New York's approach is not at all unique.\n\nI don't have a case to cite to at the moment, but this has definitely been tested in court.

To more clearly define the issue I have been collecting data from calibrated decibel loggers placed outside and inside homes along different neighborhood streets. I also launched a survey (peer\\-reviewed to ensure that it is unbiased) on SurveyMonkey. This was launched two weeks ago and to\\-date it has received 500 responses. An invitation to local Home Owners Associations to have members take the brief survey will go out next week.\n\nOur community of 15 square miles is allocated one officer from the County Sheriff's Department. Noise complaints made to the Sheriff's Office are pretty much ignored. \n\n**Noise Levels from Custom Exhaust Systems**\n\nIf the same noise events due to custom exhaust systems on some streets occurred at a work place, this would literally raise red flags with OSHA. For example, on a regular basis, noise levels registering 120 dB or higher are measured at distances of 140 feet or more for periods of 15 minutes or more. \n\n**Retaliatory Behavior**\n\nWarnings issued by apartment managers to drivers of loud vehicles often trigger retaliatory drive byes against the apartment complex. These typically start within one hour of the warning. Over the next five the seven days, the count of noise measurements higher than three sigma decibels higher than the average background noise for the street, more than doubles. (Typically 99\\.7% of all noise measurements for a given street will fall below the average plus three sigma decibels. The measure being used is the count of noise readings higher than 99\\.7% of typical noise measurements for a given street.)\n\n**Survey Results (thus far)**\n\nAfter approximately two weeks there have been 500 responses to the survey. Barking dogs are the number 1 source of noise with vehicles with custom exhaust systems and stereos as number 2\\. (Dogs were number 1 in surveys performed by the US EPA in the 70s and 80s). The top noise sources as of today are:\n\n1 Animals (barking dogs, cockerel)\n\n2 **Vehicular noise (custom exhausts, stereos)**\n\n3 Highway noise\n\n4 Aircraft\n\n5 DIY (power tools, hammering)\n\n6 Household activities (stereos, parties)\n\n7 Commercial/Utility/Emergency Vehicles\n\n8 Trains\n\nVehicular exhaust and custom stereo noise was lower in similar polls conducted by US EPA in the 70s and 80s (prior to the de\\-funding of ONAC).\n\n**Impact on Property Values and Ability to Sell Real\\-estate**\n\nAs one realtor put it, noise is a raw real\\-estate nerve. Data from sources such as Zillow\\-Research show that a single family home in a noisy neighborhood will take 3 to 4 months longer to sell than an equivalent home in a quiet neighborhood. Homes in noisy neighborhoods will typically sell for 10% to 15% less than homes in quiet neighborhoods. The same results have been reported by studies conducted by Booz\\-Allen\\-Hamiltor in the United States (1994 \\- homes near airports) and the Swedish Government. Recorded noise levels in some neighborhoods match noise levels reported near large airports. \n\n**Absence of Legal Recourse**\n\nOur County Law Director insists that probable cause can only be established by a law enforcement officer. I proposed that citizens should be able to submit actionable complaints using three forms: (1\\) A screening form that is scored to determine if the complaint is legitimate or not (2\\) The same form filled out by law enforcement officers and (3\\) a notarized form that acknowledges the consequences of filing a false report. This was rejected due to concerns on workload.\n\nNeighborhoods that have genuine noise concerns essentially have no effective legal recourse. Fines imposed by a General Sessions court will only encourage retaliation.\n\n**Retaliation by Law Enforcement**\n\nOn more than one occasion, reports made to local law enforcement and local government have been met with retaliatory drive\\-byes by officers on motorcycles. This typically occurs between 1:30 AM and 2:30 AM following a complaint. The pattern (and this in on video) is an officer pulls close to the home and revs his bike as loud as he can under the nearest window of the person who filed the complaint. The officer then makes a very loud and high speed pass through the neighborhood, returns the spot under the window and revs his bike as loud as he can. This is typically repeated three or more times. Complaints and videos sent to our county law director generate no response what\\-so\\-ever.\n\nWho does one talk to when a law enforcement officer is the problem? Who does one talk to when local government does not respond to complaints about a law enforcement officer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need is a legal basis for a (legal) complaint. OSHA regulations are set by the federal government, which gets its regulatory power via an interaction between politics, Congress, and the Commerce Clause: OSHA regulations don't apply to your neighborhood. There are often local noise ordinances that restrict noise. I can look up the numbers for my county, which are in a 4x4 table (source vs. destination, 4 zoning classes), and the ordinance describes the required sampling details in engineering\\-grade detail. (Best to read the whole ordinance to be sure there aren't specific exceptions, such as the bell exception \\-\\- bells are apparently unregulated). The ordinance will probably say something about enforcement, e.g.\n\n> The sheriff may administer and enforce this chapter and any rules and\n>  regulations adopted or authorized by this chapter in accordance with\n>  state law. The director may enforce this chapter and any rules and\n>  regulations adopted or authorized by this chapter in accordance with\n>  K.C.C. Title 23 and state law. Upon request by the sheriff or\n>  director, any other county departments and divisions may assist in\n>  enforcing this chapter.\n\nI note that this says \"may\", not \"shall\". Assuming that you have such ordinances, that the noise unquestionably violates the ordinances, and the enforcer refuses to enforce, then you would need to either (a) vote the sheriff out of office or (b) file a suit to compel enforcement of the ordinance. You could sue seeking a writ of mandamus. At this point you would be hiring an attorney, where questions would arise such as whether you have the legal right to compel action, is the sheriff obligated to enforce the ordinance, and so on (can you show that? I don't mean, is there a good reason, I mean in a technical legal sense). The answers reside in your state's case law and ordinances.\n\nIt is possible that your state Attorney General would pursue the sheriff, since what you describe seems like a blatant violation of the law (retaliations especially).

Under U.S. copyright law, ideas, concepts, and general plot elements are not protected by copyright. What is protected is the specific expression of those ideas. While Gattaca shares some conceptual similarities with Heinlein's works, such as genetic selection and falsifying identity to join a space crew, these are broad ideas rather than specific expressions. The overall plots and details of the stories differ significantly. Additionally, copyright law explicitly states that it does not protect ideas, procedures, processes, systems, methods of operation, concepts, principles, or discoveries.

The sidewalk appears to be public, and there are no visible \"No Trespassing\" signs. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal situation?\n\nA) John is legally required to leave immediately, as the resident's word is sufficient to establish trespassing.\n\nB) John can continue walking, as only the property owner or law enforcement can enforce trespassing laws.\n\nC) John should leave to avoid potential legal issues, but can later investigate the property ownership and sidewalk status.\n\nD) John has an absolute right to use the sidewalk regardless of ownership, as all sidewalks are considered public property.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate course of action. While John may have a reasonable belief that the sidewalk is public, continuing to walk after being told to leave could potentially lead to legal issues if the sidewalk is indeed private property. The safest immediate action is to leave to avoid conflict. However, John can later investigate the property ownership through the local assessor's office or by contacting the apartment management to clarify the status of the sidewalk. If it turns out to be public property, John would then know he has the right to use it. This approach balances respecting potential private property rights with asserting one's own rights to use public spaces. Options A and B are incorrect as they make assumptions about authority and property status without verification. Option D is incorrect as not all sidewalks are automatically public property."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16726/does-the-order-barring-entry-of-certain-aliens-into-the-us-properly-apply-to-per", "docs_id": 16726, "title": "Does the order barring entry of certain aliens into the US properly apply to permanent residents?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The President of the United States has invoked his power under the INA to\n\n> proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12\\) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12\\), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and \\[...] suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order \\[...].\n\nThe relevant section of the INA is at 8 U.S.C. 1182(f):\n\n> **(f) Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President**  \n> \n>  Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. \\[...]\n\nThis question is about the phrases \"immigrant entry\" and \"entry as immigrants.\" In particular, there are reports of aliens from these countries, who have already been admitted to the United States for permanent residence, who are in possession of their \"green cards,\" having been denied entry to the US, or at least having been denied boarding by airlines.\n\nThe question, therefore: **Is re\\-entry of a green card holder properly within the scope of \"immigrant entry\"? In particular, has any court ruled on the question?**\n\nI have not found any other part of the executive order that could be read as barring green card holders from entering the US, but I may have overlooked something. **Is there another part of the order that is relevant to the entry of permanent residents?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [The order](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/us/politics/refugee-muslim-executive-order-trump.html) refers in sec. 3(c) to \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12\\) of the INA, [8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1187)\". That section specifically names Iraq and Syria, plus \"points to\" potential areas of concern, as identified by the Sec'y of State and Sec'y of Homeland Security. The full list extends to Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen, and is set forth at [81 FR 39680](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-06-17/pdf/2016-14422.pdf). \n\nThe cited authority is [8 USC 1182(f)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182), a section about inadmissible aliens, which says\n\n> Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any\n>  class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the\n>  interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such\n>  period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or\n>  any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the\n>  entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.\n\nThus he has authority to exclude permanent residents from re\\-entry (they are aliens, and re\\-entry is a subcase of entry), and has done so for 90 days. In the case of Syrian nationals, under sec 5(c) of the order, they are excluded until the order is changed. Sec. 5(c) of the order specifically declares\n\n> Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby\n>  proclaim that **the entry of nationals of Syria** as refugees is\n>  detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any\n>  such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient\n>  changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian\n>  refugees is consistent with the national interest.\n\nThe long\\-term ban on Syrians also specifies \"as refugees\", so \"such entry\" might not be interpreted to refer to entry of refugee or non\\-refugee Syrian nationals who are permanent residents. The 90\\-day ban in 3(c) (\"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens\") does not include any further restrictors, apart from the various government\\-official visas that are exempted, so there would be no basis in the order for excluding permanent residents. Whether this will be strictly enforced is a separate question, though in the period when the order was active (a day), it was applied to permanent residents. Sec. 3(g) allows exceptions \"on a case\\-by\\-case basis, and when in the national interest\". A recent (Saturday the 28th) [White House briefing](http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/legal-residents-with-green-cards-warned-not-to-leave-u-s/) says that green card holders \"will need a case by case waiver to return to the United States\".\n\nThe ban includes immigrants and non\\-immigrants, so it doesn't particularly matter how \"immigrant\" is defined \u2013 what matters is what an alien is. Still, \"immigrant\" is defined in [8 USC 1101 (15\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) as any alien, except a bunch of categories such as diplomats, tourists, business visitors, people in transit, students, and fashion models and similar, working temporarily here. Any permanent resident has an immigrant visa (but at any rate is an alien, and is either an immigrant or a non\\-immigrant).\n\nReturning to the words of the order, neither 3(c) nor 5(3\\) limit the ban to issuance of visas, it refers to entry. Not all entry by foreign national requires a visa. The word \"visa\" is mentioned, so it is possible to construe that mention as contextually restricting the ban to visas, however 3(a) which is entitled \"Suspension of Issuance of Visas and **Other Immigration Benefits** to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern\" orders the review \"to adjudicate any visa, **admission,** or other benefit under the INA\" which indicates that there is no such limitation.\n\n[8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(C)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1101) does say that a permanent resident is not \"regarded as *seeking* an admission into the United States\". Admission itself is defined in 8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(A), when applied to an alien, as \"the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after inspection and authorization by an immigration officer\". While a permanent resident is not *seeking* admission (and is not *applying* for admission), it would still be consistent with the law to forbid admission (legal entry). If you read 8 USC 1101(a)(13\\)(C) as granting permanent residents widest latitude to enter without restriction, then that has the absurd consequence that permanent residents are subject to no scrutiny at all. The absurdity is avoided if \"seeing admission\" is a step prior to and is distinct from \"being admitted\" i.e. \"lawfully entering\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the executive order and relevant U.S. laws, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the entry of permanent residents (green card holders) from the affected countries?\n\nA) Permanent residents are completely exempt from the travel ban and can freely enter the United States without any restrictions.\n\nB) The executive order explicitly bans all permanent residents from the affected countries from entering the United States for 90 days, with no exceptions.\n\nC) Permanent residents from the affected countries are subject to the travel ban, but may be granted entry on a case-by-case basis through a waiver process.\n\nD) The executive order only applies to new visa applicants and does not affect the entry of existing permanent residents in any way.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The order refers to \"immigrant and nonimmigrant entry\" of aliens from the specified countries, which can include permanent residents.

Consequently, no order will be made as to costs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Caveat: This analysis discusses typically and obvious reasons that there might be an agreement as to costs. But, we have know way of knowing the actual reason in particular cases.\n\nIn *Vancouver (City) v. Ward*, 2010 SCC 27, there were three claims in the underlying lawsuit. One was an award of $5,000 for wrongful imprisonment that was undisputed. One was an award of $5,000 for a wrongful strip search which was appealed but ultimately was affirmed. One was an award of $100 for claims related to seizure of a car, which was reversed on appeal.\n\nThe appeal decided by the Canadian Supreme Court was an appeal from a direct appeal to an intermediate appellate court. So, no further legal record had to be prepared at that stage of the litigation (with potentially expensive transcription fees), so the only issue as to costs that was outstanding were the costs for the final appeal, which would have been modest out of pocket, although, of course, attorneys were involved. And, even the legal arguments had already been made once by both sides in intermediate appellate court briefing.\n\nEven if the trial court plaintiff had lost both parts of the appeal brought by the government, he would have been a prevailing party in the litigation as a whole based upon his wrongful imprisonment damage award.\n\nBut, when you have several claims, some of which go for one party and some of which go for another, there is room for debate over who really prevailed.\n\nUnder the circumstances, given the comparatively small amount of dollars at stake, the parties may have simply agreed on a costs resolution (which probably awarded the trial court plaintiff all or most of his costs) to avoid spending more on litigation over how costs are awarded (and equally important, to avoid spending precious words in an Canadian Supreme Court appellate brief arguing that small dollar side issue).\n\nI've entered into similar agreements in appeals of complicated cases in the U.S. for the same reasons.\n\nI don't know if Canadian practice is to file a stipulation of record regarding costs in the trial court, or to simply note in the trial court record or an appellate brief that there is an agreement that has been reached, with a signed copy sitting in each side's files.\n\nAnother possibility is that at the outset of the case, or after an initial mediation, there was an agreement reached about costs (perhaps with both sides waiving a claim to costs) as part of a global agreement regarding procedural matters like limiting the scope of the claims to be pursued, dismissing secondary parties from the suit, or stipulating to key facts and/or to the admissibility of key documents to streamline a trial.\n\nVancouver may well have been motivated in part by appearances. Also, at least in U.S. practice, court filing fees are waived for governmental entities, and neither the lawyers nor the police witnesses give rise to any meaningful marginal cost particular to this lawsuit since the government lawyers and police are both salaried employees of the government, even though the legal fees of the government lawyers are probably recoverable in the proper case. So, waiving a right to collect costs may have been a very minor economic concession to it.\n\nVancouver also has a great strategic interest in having the case resolved in a precedent making case that can guide its future policies and practices going forward in a situation like is likely to recur, so they have some interest in having the trial court Plaintiff go the distance all of the way to the Canadian Supreme Court to resolve the legal issue the case presented. So, there are all sorts of reasons that Vancouver, in a case involving a recurring type issue presented to a governmental entity might want to reach an agreement on costs and would not merely be focused on maximizing its outcome in the particular case.\n\nAlso, while we don't know for sure, it is doubtful that the trial court Plaintiff was personally paying out of pocket to litigate to the Canadian Supreme Court over a $5,100 damages award. Probably some NGO or lawyer with a strategic interest in establishing the precedent financed most of the costs in practice. So, neither side economically felt much of the costs in this case making it an easier issue to negotiate.\n\nBut, in *Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Luk\u00e1cs*, 2018 SCC 2, and *Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi* (Rev 3\\) \\[2015] UKSC 67, which don't involve governmental entities, concerns about public image or a paramount desire to make precedents to guide future transactions of one of the parties are not nearly so great.\n\nIn those cases, a cost\\-benefit analysis in the individual case about the amount of costs at issue v. the amount of money that could be spent fighting over costs is probably more likely to be the main factor, particularly if the cases are complex enough that the amount of work necessary to fully litigate the costs issue could be significant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of legal proceedings and cost agreements, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding pre-existing agreements on costs between parties?\n\nA) Pre-existing agreements on costs are always filed as formal stipulations with the court.\n\nB) Such agreements are only made between governmental entities and individual plaintiffs.\n\nC) These agreements typically result in both parties waiving all claims to costs.\n\nD) Pre-existing agreements on costs can be motivated by various factors, including efficiency, strategy, and public image considerations.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the passage states \"I don't know if Canadian practice is to file a stipulation of record regarding costs in the trial court, or to simply note in the trial court record or an appellate brief that there is an agreement that has been reached,\" indicating that formal filing is not always necessary.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the passage mentions agreements in cases not involving governmental entities, such as Delta Air Lines Inc. v.

The details of the license depend on your use, the licensing agency, and the item being licensed. Online music licensing is a business, and there are a number of options to choose from. One concern would be assuring that the service didn't just become a way to get free music. Whether or not you could find an agency willing to create such a license is, well, not a legal question.\n\nApart from the problem of making the works available online, there is also the matter of copyright and your lesson plans. It is not clear what the content of such lesson plans is, but if you would be inserting substantial excerpts from the lyrics into your text, you need permission (a license) to do that. You can certainly talk about Taylor Swift's \"mean\" in your book and can quote brief passages (under the \"fair use\" doctrine), but you can't just copy the lyrics without permission.

The other countries of the E.U. (as of 1984\\) had rules similar to those of Britain's loser pays rule, although there was significant variation in detail from country to country that made this less of an omnibus statement than it might seem. See Werner Pfenningstorf, \"[The European Experience With Fee Shifting](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3749&context=lcp)\", 47(1\\) Law and Contemporary Problems 37 (1984\\).\n\nMost countries with civil law systems (i.e. those systems based upon the civil code tradition of Continental Europe rather than the common law tradition of England or something else entirely) outside of Europe in Africa and Asia are derived from the French Civil Code (most of West, Northwest and Central Africa, for example), or the German Civil Code (Korea and Japan, for example), and probably have followed in the footsteps on their parent legal traditions on this issue. This is also true of most formerly Communist Eastern European countries.\n\nMost countries in Spanish speaking Latin America, however, have legal systems derived from the Spanish legal tradition (and national constitutions modeled on that of the U.S.), so other countries besides the U.S. and Spain without automatic fee shifting to a prevailing party are probably located in Latin America. Some of these Latin American countries, however. probably adopted fee shifting rules of their own, and many of these countries declared independence from Spain before Spain adopted its civil code, so the extent to which those countries follow the Spanish model may not be as complete as in countries that gained independence later on.\n\nIt is also worth noting that, however, in most civil law countries, the fees that an attorney can charge are usually significantly more highly regulated than in the United States, so the possibility of extremely high litigation fees is lower. Furthermore, civil litigation, in general, involves lower attorney fees on average in civil law countries (and in Islamic law and Chinese style Communist countries) than in the United States, in litigated cases, because the process is less attorney resource intensive due to civil procedure differences.\n\nSo far as I know, fee shifting is also not used in Islamic law countries, where the basic assumption is that the parties are often pro se (i.e. without lawyers) and the institution of a professional legal class post\\-dates the establishment of the relevant legal rules.\n\nI do not know what the situation is in the People's Republic of China or similar legal systems.\n\n**The American Rule**\n\nIt also bears noting that there are many exceptions to the \"American rule\" in U.S. law.\n\nWhile the American rule does not shift attorney fees, fees for out of pocket litigation expenses such as filing fees, copying charges, and expert witness fees are shifted as a matter of course to the prevailing party.\n\nMost professionally drafted written agreements have fee shifting provisions.\n\nMany specific statutes (e.g. civil rights actions and many labor law and consumer rights enforcement cases) also have fee shifting provisions (sometimes one sided, sometimes two sides).\n\nFees can also be awarded in certain kinds of breach of fiduciary duty litigation contexts and in cases involving a dispute over a \"common fund\".\n\nIn divorce cases, litigation costs of both sides are often (really usually) allocated by the court in proportion to ability to pay, as \"winning\" and \"losing\" are ill defined.\n\nThe biggest areas where fees shifting would be unusual in the U.S. would be in common law tort lawsuits, such as negligence cases (e.g. automobile accidents and slip and fall cases), strict liability products liability cases, defamation cases, intentional harm cases, and fraud actions. The American rule also applies in cases of oral contracts or contracts drafted by inexpert non\\-lawyers. Even in those cases various kinds of litigation misconduct can result in fee shifting.\n\nIn U.S. tort cases, defendants usually have their attorney fees paid for by their insurance company, and plaintiffs often have an attorney paid on a contingent fee basis. Furthermore, awards by juries for non\\-economic damages and/or punitive damages often makes it possible for a prevailing plaintiff to receive full or nearly full economic loss compensation in such lawsuits, with the non\\-economic and/or punitive damages awards effectively providing resources to pay the attorney for the plaintiff on top of economic loss compensation for the plaintiff.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about fee-shifting in legal systems around the world is most accurate?\n\nA) All European Union countries follow the British \"loser pays\" rule without any significant variations.\n\nB) The United States is the only country in the world that does not have automatic fee-shifting to the prevailing party.\n\nC) Most civil law countries have highly regulated attorney fees, which generally results in lower litigation costs compared to the United States.\n\nD) Islamic law countries typically employ fee-shifting rules similar to those found in common law jurisdictions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because while many EU countries follow a \"loser pays\" system similar to Britain's, there are significant variations in detail from country to country.\n\nB is incorrect because the information mentions that Spain (as of 1984) had rules similar to the American rule, and suggests that some Latin American countries might also lack automatic fee-shifting.\n\nC is correct.

If the premise is open to the public, restricting access is harder to justify. If the premise is restricted, access can be restricted pretty arbitrarily, apart from infringing on a person's property interest in the facility. A laboratory, for example, may restrict access to a specific list of people, or to a describable class of people. \"A department\" is a pretty big thing and generally does not describe a concrete location, but perhaps you mean \"may not enter the department office\" or \"may not enter any of the following offices\". Hallways in buildings are generally public places, unless there is a particular wing of the building where all access is restricted. \n\nIf there is good reason, a university official may prohibit a person, including a student, from entering a premise, and they can tell a specific person that they may not enter the department office. It is more a matter of university policy and not statutory law to determine who that person is that can issue a stay\\-out order, so it may not be the department chair \u2013 more likely, the dean or higher authority carries the real clout, on the chair's recommendation.

If you do, Wag! can charge your card a $1,000 referral fee and the same applies to the dog sitter.\n\nEDIT\n\nNote that the mentioned contract provision has no expiration. You are subject to $1,000 payment whenever during your lifetime you should happen to ask for a pet care service to someone met through Wag!. Is this legal?\n\nThe provision is akin to a non\\-compete clause where the dog sitter agrees not to start a separate business in competition against their employer. In that case $1,000 qualifies as a compensation for breaching the agreement. However dog sitters (like Uber drivers) are not Wag! employees, and by the way these clauses are not permissible in all jurisdictions.\nThis is might be the reason they use the term 'referral fee', anyway, the fee is many times more the value of the referred pet\\-care services: imagine to pay $10,000 for a second hand car and $50,000 for someone helping finding the seller. It is reasonable to assume nobody would willingly accept to pay such a huge fee and the only reason to enter the contract is the misrepresentation of the associated costs.\n\nAll that given:\n\n1. How such a clause is to be construed (in a court)?\n2. If they charge customers credit cards with a $1,000 referral fee, what type of legal protection will they have?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: About the part where they say that will charge your payment method, when you terminate your relationship with the company, you should send registered mail withdrawing authorization to charge your credit card thereafter, and you should notify the credit card company that further charges are not authorized. This won't change your legal liability, it just changes whether they have to first prove that you are legally liable before collecting the money.\n\nIt is problematic that only the company has the right to terminate the contract, but you can treat that as a harmless omission of wording on their part. Surely they did not intend that you are perpetually bound to the terms of the contract and the obligations in section 11\\. Of course, you have to stop using their services in order to terminate the contract. Given the nature of their service, you can send a notice (registered mail again) to them informing them that you are terminating the contract and will not be using their services.\n\nIf then some time in the future you do hire a pet walker that you met through the service, they might come after you for the $1,000 (although, at their sole discretion, they can increase that amount to $20,000 or anything else, see section 2\\). If you have prevented them from charging your credit card, they would have to get a judgement against you, meaning they would have to go for arbitration. Or, if they did charge your credit card, then you would have to initiate the proceedings to get your money back. That is, unless you opted out of arbitration within 30 days of starting the relationship. Let's assume you did opt out.\n\nThe question would then be whether a perennial \"no\\-compete\" clause would be enforceable against you. Employees are often bound to no\\-compete agreements prohibiting them from doing the same work in the same area for a certain period of time. A lifelong no\\-compete agreement would be unenforceable, at least in court, but a 6\\-month no\\-compete clause could easily be. In [Medix Staffing Solutions, Inc. v. Dumrauf](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/illinois/ilndce/1:2017cv06648/344091/36/0.pdf?ts=1524130353), the court recites standard legal requirements of enforceable no\\-compete agreements, especially that they be \"reasonable and necessary to protect a legitimate business interest of the employer\". In such a case, the court would consider \"the hardship caused to the employee, the effect upon the general public, and the scope of the restrictions\", and the company would have to show that the \"full extent of the restraint is necessary for protecting its interests\". It is in principle possible that the court would find such a clause unenforceable (owing to it imposing a life\\-long obligation on you).

The answer suggests that while such clauses may have some legal basis, courts often consider factors like reasonableness, duration, and necessity when evaluating their enforceability. The lifelong duration and high fee amount could be seen as overly burdensome, potentially leading a court to modify or partially invalidate the clause. The document mentions that lifelong non-compete agreements are typically unenforceable, and that the fee might be considered a penalty clause rather than liquidated damages.

Can Congress essentially pardon a violation of law through legislation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can Congress essentially pardon a violation of law through\n>  legislation?\n\nYes.\n\nCongress has the power to retroactivity reduce the sentence for a crime for which someone has been sentenced. This was done most recently in the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/drug-law-reform/fair-sentencing-act) that reduced excessive penalties for crack cocaine relative to powder cocaine.\n\nIn the same way, when the death penalty is legislatively repealed in a state, the death sentences of the handful of people on death row at the time is often commuted legislatively.\n\nWhile Congress cannot impose criminal penalties on someone legislatively, which is a [Bill of Attainder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder) and constitutionally prohibited, it can single out people for special treatment in a [private bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_bill), which is a constitutional exercise of legislative power at the federal level (not every state allows private bills to be enacted due to Progressive era reforms to state constitutions).\n\nFor example, private bills often eliminate the collateral effects of a criminal conviction upon a person, there is even [a standard procedure for doing so](https://www.shusterman.com/privatebillruleshouseofrepresentatives/), which is functionally equivalent to a Presidential pardon of the crime for that purposes (the vast majority of Presidential pardons are issued after the person convicted has served the sentence for the crime).\n\nA private bill cannot impair contract or property rights, which would be a prohibited *[ex post facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_post_facto_law)* law. \n\nBut no one other than the federal government has a legally protected interest in keeping someone incarcerated or otherwise punishing them for a crime. Crimes are prosecuted in the name of the People and victims of crimes do not have legal rights in those proceedings except as created by statute. So, this would not be an *ex post facto* bill or a *taking* governed by the Fifth Amendment for takings of property interests. And, Congress may, by legislation, determine what the federal government will do in essentially all cases where it is not expressly prohibited from doing so (some argue that there is a minimum of federal authority vested exclusively in the President in the area of foreign affairs and military affairs, but that exclusivity of power does not extend to domestic criminal justice).\n\nBasically, anything that Congress could do for everyone via a public bill, it can do for someone in particular via a private bill, unless a specific constitutional prohibition applies, and there is no such prohibition when it comes to relieving someone from a sentence or the collateral effects of a criminal conviction prospectively via a private bill. This isn't exactly equivalent to a Presidential pardon or commutation, but it is very close to one in practical effect.\n\nFor a fuller, but somewhat outdated treatment of the issue, you can read this [1939 article](https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3734&context=californialawreview) in the California Law Review which acknowledged that legislative pardons were possible under existing law. \n\nThis said, government prosecutors routinely fervently oppose any retroactive criminal legislation that reduces punishment, particularly via private laws (although some countries, such as France, have constitutional requirements to retroactively reduce the sentences of anyone currently serving time for a crime whose punishment is legislatively reduced prospectively).\n\nPrivate bills that constitute legislative pardons are very rare. A [2011 law review article](https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1086&context=clsops_papers) recounts how the tool of the legislative pardon (in parallel with the executive pardon which is also used much less frequency) has fallen into disuse. \n\nPart of the decline is due to the adoption of the right to appeal from a trial court criminal convictions which did not exist in the federal system until the 1890s. Until then, the only judicial relief available from a federal criminal conviction was via a writ of habeas corpus, and that was available only on very limited grounds such as a lack of jurisdiction to conduct the trial, or the non\\-existence of the crime of conviction. Conviction by a jury in a court with jurisdiction of a constitutionally permissible crime was an absolute defense to the extent of the sentence imposed to a habeas corpus petition at that time.\n\n(As a footnote, the term \"private bill\" can be confusing. In many governments with a parliamentary system, a \"private bill\" means one sponsored by an individual legislator rather than the prime minister and his or her cabinet. But, in U.S. terminology, a \"private bill\" refers to a bill with an effect limited to one person or a small number of persons who are either identified by name or by a very narrowly defined situation.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Congress passes a private bill that effectively pardons an individual convicted of a federal crime, despite the President's reluctance to issue a pardon.

The second is whether all civil wrongs constitute crimes and hence can be regarded as illegal acts.\n\nA *crime* is generally defined as *an act or omission that is prohibited by law*. Thus, from what I understand, states will have various statutes that are passed by their respective legislatures defining what acts/omissions constitute crimes in their jurisdiction as well as what their potential punishments will be. For example, California may have a law written in a statute somewhere saying that an individual may not assault someone and that the penalty is no more than 2 years imprisonment etc.\n\nNow suppose someone in California bumps into someone else walking on the pavement (accidently) causing the other to fall and injure themselves. In this case, because the action of bumping into someone had no malice aforethought (it was accidental), we could say that the individual has not in fact committed a crime but instead has possibly committed a *civil wrong* (a *tort*). If this is the case, are there statutes in each respective state defining exactly what acts and omissions constitute civil wrongs? If there are statutes defining these civil wrongs, surely this would mean that all actions/omissions defined by statute to be civil wrongs are also in fact *prohibited by law* ? (since there exists a statute stating that the act/omission carries with it a potential penalty etc). If this is true, all civil wrongs must necessarily be *crimes* as well as civil wrongs since they are prohibited by law because a statute declaring a potential penalty for an act/omission is functionally a prohibition by law.\n\nAm I correct in my thinking here? Is it the case that all civil wrongs are necessarily crimes because they constitute actions/omissions that are prohibited by law (since there exists statutes defining them and their potential penalties)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The detailed answer depends on the jurisdiction that you are asking about (e.g. Saudi Arabia, France, US or specifically California): my answer is about the US. You should note that the term \"crime\" originally comes from Ancient Greek [\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=kri/ma), which means \"decision; judgment\": the word form is pretty stable, compared to the concepts that it is associated with. When the legal system changes, the referent of \"crime\" changes. Some facts about how the words are used are because of historically earlier concepts. At an earlier stage of English law, there was no distinction between crimes and civil wrongs, there were simply wrongs (\"tort\", in French).\n\nIn contemporary American practice, \"crime\" is a sub\\-type of offense against the government, the other being an \"infraction\" (such as a parking ticket). \"Civil wrong\" encompasses breaches of contract, breaches of trust, and \"torts\" such as trespassing and assault, and have in common that they are wrongs against an individual. If you commit a crime, it is you against the government, and one set of principles is adhered to in deciding *guilt*. If you commit a civil wrong, it is you against the individual (though it may be that the government acts as the mouthpiece when e.g. the \"citizens of California\" have been each wronged), and different principles are adhered to in deciding *liability*.\n\nThe distinction can be murky given overlap in certain cases, for example assault is both a crime, as dictated by statutory law and punishable by prison time, and also a tort (sub\\-type of civil wrong) as recognized at common law (traditionally recognized since the 13th century in England), and passed on to modern America. You can sue a person for the tort of assault, but the government prosecutes you for committing the statutory offense of assault. In the case of a lawsuit over assault, you seek compensation for the harm done do you, you do not seek punishment for an offense against society. That is the function of criminal law, to define the acts which may be punished.\n\nMost states in the US have done away with \"common law crimes\", but as far as I know the remnants of common law crime in the US are limited to \"definitions\" \u2013 punishments are set out in statutory law. An example of common law definitional inheritance is \"assault\" under [Washington law](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.36&full=true), where assault includes poisoning, transmitting HIV, and assaulting in various ways (relying on the common law definition of \"assault\"). This common law definition is then transmitted to the juror via a [set of instructions](https://govt.westlaw.com/wcrji/Document/Iefa7d8b5e10d11daade1ae871d9b2cbe?contextData=%28sc.Default%29&transitionType=Default), which summarize the case law that defines \"assault\".\n\nAs you can see, there is a bright line between crimes and civil wrongs, so it is plainly not the case that all civil wrongs are crimes. A number of civil wrongs are statutorily defined (e.g. copyright infringement), and there is in the US a tendency to statutorily encode the essentials of civil wrongs as well as crimes.\n\nYou are probably right that crime is \"generally\" defined as an act or omission prohibited by law, where \"generally\" means \"by most people\", but that is because most people don't have a clear understanding of \"law\", \"statute\" and \"common law\". Here in Law SE, we tend to use \"legal\" in a very broad sense, meaning \"would probably be allowed and not incur any sanction by the courts\". Copyright infringement is not (necessarily) a crime, but it is prohibited by law, thus \"prohibited by law\" is not a good definition of crime.\n\nBecause of the distinction between \"crime\" and \"infraction\", both of which are cases of the individual vs. the government, \"crime\" has to be defined in terms of a specific aspect of the statutory law, the punishment. You can be imprisoned for committing a crime, but not for an infraction, such as a parking ticket. In Washington, [\"infraction\" is defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=7.84.020) with reference to Title 76, 77, 79, or 79A RCW or RCW 7\\.84\\.030(2\\)(b) that \"is declared not to be a criminal offense and is subject to the provisions of this chapter\", such as [fishing with barbed hooks](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=77.15.160).

Some actions, like assault, can indeed be both a civil wrong (tort) and a crime.

The existence of Bob's assault conviction creates a significant challenge for the prosecution in the murder case. This is because it logically introduces reasonable doubt - Bob cannot have been in two places at once, committing both crimes simultaneously. The prosecution would need to explain this discrepancy, possibly by uncovering evidence of wrongdoing in the first case (like forged evidence) or finding an explanation for the apparent contradiction (like a lookalike criminal).

One can only try and log in with a Google account and it will fail if you are not registered, but one can also sign up for an account. When this happens, the app sends me an email with the email address and the name of the person that wishes to register. This information is given to me by Google.

It holds the actual data and has only showed it to you so you can grant or refuse access to your system.\n* You are a processor of data.\n\nYour part as a processor is exempt from GDPR because it is part of the household activities exception.

However, by using Google for authentication, Google becomes the data controller responsible for the personal data (email and name) collected during the authentication process. The homeowner acts as a processor of this data for the limited purpose of granting access, which is still covered by the household exception.

They might even remind the trustees that they act on behalf of all creditors, not just Governnment departments.\n\nBut I can't in good conscience suggest that you take any steps without professional advice: a *pro bono* solicitor, a Citizens Advice Bureau, even a friendly accountant who can say whether these costs are unusual in the circumstances.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Dr. Smith cannot disclose Sarah's medical information to John without her consent, even though he's her husband.

They later find the suspect walking around outside.\n\nCan Police lawfully order all the residents out of their apartments in search of the remaining suspect or would anyone resistant to these orders be in their legal right to deny the order?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of the Miami Police Department searching for suspects in an apartment complex, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of their actions?\n\nA) The police had the legal authority to order all residents out of their apartments without a warrant due to exigent circumstances.\n\nB) Residents had the right to refuse the police orders to leave their apartments, as the police lacked probable cause for each individual unit.\n\nC) The police actions were legal only if they had obtained a search warrant for the entire apartment complex.\n\nD) The police could legally order residents out only if they had reasonable suspicion that the suspect was in a specific apartment.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In this situation, the police did not have probable cause to search each individual apartment, nor did they have a warrant. The Fourth Amendment protects individuals against unreasonable searches and seizures, and ordering all residents out of their homes without specific probable cause for each unit would likely be considered an unreasonable intrusion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because exigent circumstances typically apply to immediate dangers or the risk of evidence destruction, which doesn't seem to be the case here.\n\nOption C is incorrect because a blanket search warrant for an entire complex would be overly broad and likely unconstitutional.\n\nOption D is partially correct in principle, but still overstates police authority. Even with reasonable suspicion, police generally cannot order residents out of their homes without a warrant or probable cause.\n\nThis question tests understanding of Fourth Amendment protections, the limits of police authority, and the rights of individuals in their homes."}}
