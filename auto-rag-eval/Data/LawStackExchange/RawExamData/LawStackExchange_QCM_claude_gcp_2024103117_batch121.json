But let's say that due to financial straits, said person figured suicide in such a scenario so as to escape debt and the bill. But what happens if he/she survived and unconsciously underwent ER?

Is there law or insurance policy compensating for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Any debts that a person has are to be paid by their estate. Whoever administers the estate must, in all states, publish an announcement to the effect that Smith is deceased and all claims must be made by such and such date, probably within 90 days. If (this is a small if) the hospital takes 6 months to make their claim, it is too late for them (provided that notice was properly given).\n\nThere are also limits on how much can be collected, the simplest case being that you can't collect more than what is in the estate. There can also be complexities regarding order of priority \u2013 as you would expect, you must pay debts to the government first. That could include the Medicaid clawback (officially \"estate recovery\"), however, in the circumstance that you describe it doesn't sound like that would be applicable.\nThere may also be exemptions in a state, for example in Florida, your registered homestead (property of a certain size that you have been living in and have filed the paperwork for) cannot be seized to pay debts, even after death.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, who was deeply in debt, got into a severe car accident and underwent emergency surgery while unconscious. He passed away shortly after, leaving behind medical bills and other debts totaling $500,000. John's only asset was his home in Florida, valued at $400,000, which he had properly registered as his homestead. What is the most likely outcome regarding John's debts?\n\nA) John's family members will be personally responsible for paying off all $500,000 in debts.\nB) The hospital can seize John's Florida homestead to recover their costs, even if it was properly registered.\nC) All of John's debts will be forgiven since he passed away.\nD) John's debts will remain unpaid as his homestead cannot be seized, and he has no other assets to cover the debts.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In this scenario, several key points from the documentation come into play:\n\n1. Debts are to be paid by the deceased person's estate, not inherited by family members.\n2. There are limits on how much can be collected, and creditors cannot collect more than what is in the estate.\n3. In Florida, a properly registered homestead cannot be seized to pay debts, even after death.\n4. If there are insufficient assets in the estate to pay all debts, some debts will remain unpaid.\n\nGiven that John's only asset is his Florida homestead, which is protected from seizure, and he has no other assets to cover the $500,000 in debts, the most likely outcome is that his debts will remain unpaid. The creditors, including the hospital, cannot collect from John's family members or seize his protected homestead. Therefore, the debts will effectively remain unpaid due to insufficient non-exempt assets in the estate."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30645/vienna-convention-on-road-traffic1968-letters-only-vehicle-registration-plate", "docs_id": 30645, "title": "Vienna Convention on Road Traffic(1968) Letters Only Vehicle Registration Plate", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is a large media scandal in Romania about a car that had a preferential number from another country.

The request was sent out to one of the agency's field offices, which automatically placed it in their \"complex track\". Placement in the track resulted in their notifying me that it could take up to nine months to complete the request.\n\nAfter ten months had passed and the status hadn't changed from \"Document Search\", I reached out to see if they had responsive records and/or an updated timeline. They didn't have either. I then reached out again last month (after 14 months had passed) with no response, and then a few days ago (after 15 months) where they said the same thing as before.\n\nFOIA requires agencies to stick to the basic timelines of 20 working days. But if a request is judged to be complex (more accurately: in certain \"unusual circumstances\" like needing to search field facilities), FOIA also permits agencies to negotiate an extended timeline or narrowed scope with the requester (described in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(6\\)(B)). The important part of this really lies in clause i of that subparagraph:\n\n> In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched.\n\nHowever, that clause limits the extension to 10 working days. Anything beyond that is governed by clause ii:\n\n> With respect to a request for which a written notice under clause (i) extends the time limits prescribed under clause (i) of subparagraph (A), the agency shall notify the person making the request if the request cannot be processed within the time limit specified in that clause and shall provide the person an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.\n\nThe law clearly states that any alternative timeline must be arranged with the requester, which was done when they notified me of the request's placement in their complex track. But seeing as how BOP has failed to meet the originally imposed deadline, are they required to provide an updated date of determination upon request?

In Florida, water bills typically stay with the property, not the individual owners. Even though John didn't incur the debt, it could be attached to the property as a lien.

I learnt of it the hard way, by being denied boarding on a Pegasus flight from Istanbul to Bergamo (despite calling the border police in Bergamo, who sent a clearance message to Pegasus).\n\nI then e\\-mailed my IATA contact and asked him to ask their Italian government sources to re\\-confirm this restriction. It was found not to exist whereby Timatic was corrected.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You've asked a two part question.\n\n> \\[Is this a violation of] the international policy that a country should never refuse entry to verified citizens of their own?\n\nIn considering that question, the US example may be illuminative. The US requires US citizens to have a \"passport book\" when flying into the US, even though the US issues \"passport cards\" that serve as proof of nationality. If you can get to the border and prove your US nationality (by passport card or otherwise), they'll let you in, but airlines won't board you unless you have a passport book. If you don't have a passport book, you're supposed to get to the nearest consulate and apply for a passport before flying to the US.\n\nBut note that the US obligation to admit its own citizens is principally a feature of US law. CBP does not waive [8 USC 1185](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1185) because of some international body; there is no body that enforces international \"policies\" of this nature. Rather, they do so because they know that the federal courts would require them to admit US citizens based on the right of free movement implicit in US law.\n\nIf someone were unable to get into their country of citizenship and unable to gain legal residence elsewhere then unless they could remain on the run for the rest of their life they would eventually end up as the subject of negotiation between whatever country is trying to deport them and their country of citizenship. In other words, in the worst case, such people become a bilateral diplomatic matter between two countries. Therefore, any challenge to the restriction would have to go through the Italian or EU legal system.\n\n> Is this a violation of the EU freedom of movement directive, whereby a verified EU/EFTA national cannot normally be refused entry to any EU/EFTA state?\n\nIt certainly seems to be, but without a decision from an EU court, we can't be certain. From Article 5 of the freedom of movement directive ([2004/38/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02004L0038-20110616)):\n\n> Article 5\n> \n> \n> Right of entry\n> \n> \n> 1\\.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without prejudice to the provisions on travel documents applicable to national border controls, Member States shall grant Union citizens leave to enter their territory with a valid identity card or passport and shall grant family members who are not nationals of a Member State leave to enter their territory with a valid passport.\n> \n> \n> No entry visa or equivalent formality may be imposed on Union citizens.\n\nThis doesn't say anything about allowing EU citizens to *board aircraft* from non\\-EU destinations without their EU passports. So if Italy makes a rule that EU citizens need a passport to board a flight to Italy from outside the EU and Schengen area, that doesn't seem to violate Article 5 except by implication. It would be for a court to decide whether that implication is in fact present.\n\nBecause Article 5 doesn't say anything about where the passenger has flown from, we can also consider the case of a dual citizen of an EU member state and a \"third country,\" who might fly to Italy using the third\\-country passport, and then present a national ID card at the immigration counter. If such a traveler were denied entry, that would appear to violate Article 5\\. If that traveler's other nationality were one that required a visa in the non\\-EU passport, the traveler might have a stronger case that Italy's rule infringes on the right of free movement.\n\nEU or EFTA citizens could also challenge the restriction more generally as an infringement on the right of free movement that is established in the [Treaty on European Union](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12012M/TXT) (TEU), even if the directive itself does not prohibit the restriction.

A number of them are listed [here](http://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/treatise-finders/intellectualproperty).\n\nChisum on Patents is the leading treatise in the field and should usually be your first destination. It will mention most of the relevant primary source authority in the subject area you are researching.\n\n**Priority of Authorities**\n\nThe CFR is superior to the MPEP but inferior to Title 35\\. \n\nTreaties are co\\-equal with Title 35 with conflicts resolved by the date of enactment. \n\nCase law of the U.S. Supreme Court trumps everything (even, in practice, the language of the United States Constitution).\n\nCase law from the U.S. Court of Appeals from the Federal Circuit trumps everything except the U.S. Supreme Court. Given the very long string of recent reversals of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit by the U.S. Supreme Court (almost one or two a year for the last decade or so), however, every Federal Circuit case should be analyzed to determine if it has been implicitly overturned or limited by the applicable U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence.\n\nThe United States Constitution trumps everything except U.S. Supreme Court cases and cases from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (these cases impliedly provide definitive interpretations of the United States Constitution). \n\nCase law from a U.S. District Court is not binding on anyone but the parties to the case, but is highly persuasive and in practice is about on a par with the MPEP, but subordinate to the CFR and administrative case law of PTO bodies.\n\nOne complicated aspect of case law is that it is only binding when it resolves a question of law necessary to resolve to decide the case before it. Sometimes opinions go off on tangents which discuss other questions of law not before the court and that is called \"dicta\" which is persuasive on that point of law, but not binding and not as authoritative. It is not always obvious what constitutes the binding portion of a court decision and what constitutes dicta.\n\nAnother complexity in case law involves concurring or dissenting opinions in cases. Dissenting opinions, obviously, are not binding on anyone but sometimes clarify the scope of the majority opinion. If there is a plurality opinion and a concurring opinion in a case, they have equal weight and neither opinion's rule is definitive except to the extent that they agree. Generally speaking a majority opinion will be binding relative to a concurring opinion in the same case, but that status isn't really definitive and a concurring opinion should be considered even when it accompanies a majority opinion even though the concurring opinion shouldn't be considered binding in that situation.\n\nOf course, all case law (and for that matter all other authority) can be made obsolete by subsequent amendments to Title 35 or by the adoption of new treaties.\n\nA treatise isn't binding on anyone, but a well reasoned passage from a leading treatise like Chisum will, in practice, be given weight a little below a U.S. Court for the Federal Circuit case, but often greater than any lesser source of authority on a topic. A well reasoned passage in a lesser treatise is typically given a weight comparable to a U.S. District Court case that is on point.\n\n**Loose Ends**\n\nOne of the important sources for prior art is the compendium of all patents ever issued by the United States (the vast majority of which have expired and entered the public domain). You can get them all for a very reasonable cost in electronic form. The compendium of patents which have not expired is obviously relevant when attempting to determine if a potential patent or technique or process of a client infringes on any existing patent.\n\nThere are also some patent issues (e.g. jurisdiction and venue in patent disputes) which depend upon other Titles of the United States Code and have the same priority as Title 35 of the United States Code.\n\nThere are circumstances in which the procedural rules of various courts which issue relevant case law are relevant. Each type of court has its own rules of procedure, and each particular court has its own local rules. (This is not hypothetical, I've had a case involving patent law in which three\\-quarters of the motion practice in the heavily litigated case depended upon the local rules of practice in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.)\n\nPrecedents of U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, and precedents from U.S. Court of Appeal for Circuits other than the Federal Circuit, are sometimes relevant as well (e.g. interpreting procedural court rules, rules of evidence, or very general principles of law that aren't restricted to patent law such as the *ex post facto* clause of the U.S. Constitution). But, for the most part, patent case law arises in U.S. District Courts, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court and the administrative tribunals of the PTO.\n\nIssues related to the relationship between an attorney and a client in patent law cases (e.g. attorney malpractice law in patent cases) is a question of state law rather than federal law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the hierarchy of authorities for patent law, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) takes precedence over the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in guiding patent examiners.\n\nB) U.S. District Court cases are binding on all future patent cases and are considered equal in authority to Federal Circuit decisions.\n\nC) The United States Constitution trumps everything, including U.S. Supreme Court cases interpreting patent law.\n\nD) Case law from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is authoritative unless overturned or limited by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the CFR is superior to the MPEP in the hierarchy of patent law authorities.\n\nB is incorrect because U.S. District Court cases are not binding on anyone but the parties to the case.

Now, particular statutes may be phrased as requiring certain actions but, if you read them the \u201ccommon law way\u201d to coin a phrase, they are really imposing sanctions for doing the prohibited thing that falls outside those parameters.\n\nSince there is no legal prohibition on using multiple names (simultaneously or sequentially) you are free to do so.\n\nNow, there are common law prohibitions of, for example, fraud or tax evasion. So, if you use different names *for the purpose* of doing those prohibited things, then that is illegal but it is the specific criminality that is sanctioned, not the use of the alias in perpetrating it.\n\nThe UK has a law that makes it a crime to not register the birth of a child. It also imposes some (and by most country\u2019s standards, very few) restrictions on the name a child can be registered under. But there is no legal obligation on the child or their parents to use the registered name in any particular circumstances. There may be difficulties (amounting to impossibility in some cases) in obtaining a passport, opening a bank account, or claiming social security under a non\\-registered name but that is due to the necessity to *identify* the individual for which the name serves as a proxy.\n\nHowever, outside the requirements of specific statutes or administrative procedures, the common law position is that your name is what people call you and you identify as your name. The second part is important \\- I have been called dickhead on many occasions but I do not consider it to be my name.\n\nThe UK has a patronymic tradition for surnames so, usually, on marriage, the female adopts the surname of the male and that, through the marriage certificate, becomes her registered name.

I assume this lawsuit will be promptly thrown out. But what I don't understand is exactly *why* it will be thrown out.\n\nIs it because there's no law against giving funny looks? Is it because the harm I experienced didn't pass a certain threshold? Is it because a reasonable person wouldn't care that much about getting a funny look? Is it because there is no precedent for such a lawsuit? Is it just up to the whims of the judge that day?\n\n**What are the principles used to decide whether a lawsuit is to be taken seriously?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several. First of all, the suit must state a claim for action under the law. This means there must be some law, or case law, which permits a person to sue in the kind of situation at hand. The claim for \"looking at me funny\" would probably be thrown out at this stage, unless perhaps it could be framed as a case of harassment. This often has a good deal to do with how the case is framed and what laws it cites as giving the plaintiff the right to sue, and the right to a remedy.\n\nSecondly, the plaintiff must usually allege significant harm, actual or in some cases potential.\n\nIn federal courts, and some state courts this is often part of having ***standing to sue***. A person only has standing when that person can show a real and significant actual harm, or a likely imminent harm, as a result of defendant's alleged actions. For example if a person claims that Congress has passed an unconstitutional law, but that person is not personally affected by the law, that person has no standing to sue.\n\nThirdly the claim must be one that is within the jurisdiction of the court. That means both that it is the kind of claim that the court is authorized to handle, aka subject matter jurisdiction, and that the court has authority over all parties (personal jurisdiction),\n\nYou can't sue for slander in a landlord/tenant or a traffic court court, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Nor can you sue for theft under a state law in a federal court, it only has jurisdiction over \"federal questions\" (or in some cases over issues between people in different states, diversity jurisdiction). And if person A in Georgia did something to person B in Georgia, B cannot normally sue in a California court, although if the is some connection to California, the court may find it enough.\n\nThirdly the suit must present a claim for a remedy which the court is authorized by statute or precedent to give. In some kinds of cases, the law may permit an injunction. but not a claim for money damages. In proceedings for action under the California Consumer Privacy Act (for example) most provisions can only be enforced by the California Attorney General, not by a private litigant. This will vary widely depending on the specific law involved.\n\nA classic example of a frivolous suit is [*United States ex rel. Gerald Mayo v. Satan and His Staff*, 54 F.R.D. 282 (W.D.Pa. 1971\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_ex_rel._Gerald_Mayo_v._Satan_and_His_Staff) in which a prison inmate sued Satan and his assistant devils, claiming that \"Satan has on numerous occasions caused plaintiff misery and unwarranted threats, against the will of plaintiff, that Satan has placed deliberate obstacles in his path and has caused plaintiff's downfall\" and had therefore \"deprived him of his constitutional rights\". The judge noted that Satan was not under the control of the prison, and it was not clear if he was a US resident, but dismissed the suit on the technicality that the prisoner has not told the US Marshals where and how to serve the needed papers on Satan.\n\nDismissal of a lawsuit as frivolous, or as \"not reasonable\" is a judgement call by the court, guided by past cases on the topic, of which there are many.

The lawsuit would likely be thrown out because \"giving funny looks\" is not typically recognized as a legal cause of action under existing law, unless it could somehow be framed as part of a larger pattern of harassment. This aligns with the principle that a suit must state a claim for action under the law to be considered valid.\n\nOption A is incorrect because personal jurisdiction is likely not an issue if the plaintiff and defendant are neighbors. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while the damages might be minimal, that alone wouldn't necessarily cause dismissal, especially in state courts where there may not be a minimum damages threshold.\n\nOption D, while plausible, is less likely to be the primary reason for dismissal.

Hank was, from early in the series, well aware of a list of crimes attributable to \"Heisenberg,\" but didn't have a person to charge with these crimes. What blows Walter's cover to Hank was the book of poetry *Leaves of the Grass* by Walt Whitman. The Handwritten dedication inside the cover is \"To my other favorite W.W. It's an honour working with you. Fondly, G.B.\" written by Gale, who's death had previously led to a raid on the Meth Lab where Walter White and Gale had worked together and was no known to have been run by Gus Fringe (also deceased). Other evidence in Gale's office were notes regarding the cook operation at the Fringe Lab, with the quotes attributed to then unknown to Hank, \"W.W.\" and his own notes attributed to him as \"G.B.\" (I believe Gale did have Whitman books in his home).\n\nWalter had previously told Hank he had no idea who Gale was, so seeing a book that Gale personally dedicated to Walter and attributing him as the other favorite W.W. would be as easy as comparing handwriting samples from Gale's notes to the snippet from the book, thus linking Walter White to the Heisenberg ring. Hank also discusses that he believes Gale is not Heisenberg as Gale was taking extensive notes from another source in meth production and did not have any ties to the known distribution chain outside of Gus Fringe.\n\nWhat complicated Hank's ability to prosecute was that Marie (aka Jesus Christ\\-Marie) had knowingly accepted dirty money from Hank and Skylar, believing it was from illegal high stakes poker and not drug money... but reporting Walt's source of income meant implicating them in the crime, which Walter and Skylar use as blackmail against them by creating a confession tape that would implicate Hank as the Mastermind of the operation who forced them to perform their illegal actions. This would have cost Hank his career and would have netted the Whites a not guilty plea as too much doubt would have existed to convict (The Schraders would not be convicted by the same reasoning, but Hank was the primary breadwinner and out of a job... and likely not hireable by other LEO organizations as the controversy of the matter would make him untrustworthy to have on, and the inability to realize a close family member was a drug lord made him look incompetent.

The documentation suggests that a constitutional amendment was probably not legally necessary to ban alcohol, just as it wasn't needed for other drugs in 1970.

Sarcastically goading someone into punching? Probably not enough, unless the taunting is pretty egregious.

According to the legal principle of self-defense, a person can use physical force if they reasonably believe it is necessary to protect themselves from imminent bodily harm. This doesn't require waiting for an actual attack or an explicit verbal threat. Instead, it's based on what a \"reasonable person\" would perceive as an immediate threat given the circumstances.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because explicit verbal threats are not always necessary for self-defense to be justified. Non-verbal actions can also constitute a threat.\n\nAnswer B is too broad. While an aggressive stance might contribute to a perception of threat, it alone may not always justify the use of force. The totality of the circumstances must be considered.\n\nAnswer D is overly restrictive. The law generally doesn't require a person to wait until they've been physically struck before defending themselves, as this could result in serious injury.\n\nThe key is the \"reasonable person\" standard and the concept of \"imminent\" threat, which allows for preemptive action but only when the threat of harm is immediate and apparent to a reasonable observer."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64782/is-it-legally-permitted-to-quote-from-legally-restricted-materials-in-us", "docs_id": 64782, "title": "Is it legally permitted to quote from legally restricted materials in US?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Is it legally permitted to quote from legally restricted materials in US?**\n\nLet\u2019s say, US government banned/censored a site or book `X` legally.

Minnesota*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_v._Minnesota) it is very hard to \"legally restrict\" any publication in the US. The \"Banned books\" linked to in the question have, in some cases, been removed from particular school curricula or from library collections. A few have been challenged as obscene, but none of them are unavailable to the general public at this time.\n\nA work can be \"legally banned\" or \"legally restricted\" under US law for only a few reasons:\n\nSecurity\n--------\n\nA work that is actually classified cannot be lawfully distributed. However, referring to it or quoting from it would be legal unless the quoted content includes actual classified information. A problem with this is that one often does not know just what aspects of a document are in fact classified, short of asking the government.\n\nIn many cases the restrictions on distributing classified material apply only to those who have accepted a security clearance or otherwise agreed to be bound by the classification system. However under the Espionage Act and the Atomic Energy act, and perhaps other laws, in some cases people who never accepted a clearance may be enjoined from disclosure, or possibly held criminally liable. This was challenged in [*United States v. Progressive, Inc.* 467 F. Supp. 990 (W.D. Wis. 1979\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Progressive,_Inc.) (The \"H\\-bomb Secret\" case). But that case was dropped as moot when the information was published by others, and the DoE announced that they would not prosecute anyone involved. No final binding decision on the issues was made.\n\nA\\\\n attempt to enjoin publication of classified information was famously overturns in [*New York Times Co. v. United States*, 403 U.S. 713 (1971\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._United_States) (the \"Pentagon Papers\" case). In that case the material sought to be classified was historical, not of current operational importance.\n\nObscenity\n---------\n\nA work found obscene under [*Miller v. California*, 413 U.S. 15 (1973\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_v._California) is illegal to distribute. But it is legal to refer to such a book. It is legal to quote it, unless the quoted section is itself obscene under *Miller*.\n\nNote that content will not be found obscene under *Miller* unless it violates a specific law, usually a state law. Unless there is such a law, a prosecution does not pass the *Miller* test. This means that generalized laws such as \"disturbing the peace\" cannot be used to punish allegedly obscene content.\n\nLaws may prohibit content not obscene under *Miller* from being knowingly provided to minors, or shown in movie theaters under ratings which would permit minors to enter.\n\nA work containing child pornography is unlawful to create, distribute, or possess under 18 U.S.C. \u00a72251 and subsequent sections. Quoting a part that includes child pornography as defined under those laws would be equally illegal, but quoting a part that does not include such content would not. Referring to such a book would not be illegal.\n\nNote that in the US only actual images of real children constitute child pornography. Drawings or computer images not based on any real child, and text, may not be banned under these laws. In some other countries, such content may be highly illegal.\n\nDefamation\n----------\n\nRepublishing a work found to be defamatory would in many cases be defamation also, and could give rise to a successful lawsuit, but it is not a crime. A quote that did not include any of the defamatory statements would be lawful. A quote that did include defamatory statements may be protected under some circumstances, such as news reporting of the court case. It is lawful to refer to such a work.\n\nCriminal Libel\n*Criminal libel* was once common, but prosecutions for it are now very rare. According to [the ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech/map-states-criminal-laws-against-defamation):\n\n> Twenty\\-four states have laws that make it a crime to publicly say mean things about people, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment. These laws violate the First Amendment and are disproportionately used against people who criticize public officials or government employees. The ACLU has filed a lawsuit challenging the law in New Hampshire.\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law):\n\n> Criminal libel is rarely prosecuted but exists on the books in many states, and is constitutionally permitted in circumstances essentially identical to those where civil libel liability is constitutional.\n\nAccording to [The First Amendment Encyclopedia's article](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/941/criminal-libel):\n\n> Although libel or defamation is now primarily a civil claim, it once was primarily a criminal offense, prosecuted by the government and punishable by imprisonment or a fine.\n> \n> \n> In the United States, courts have based decisions regarding slanderous or libelous statements on the First Amendment rights of free speech and freedom of the press.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> There was also a growing sentiment against criminal libel, which led the drafters of the 1962 American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code specifically to exclude the crime of criminal defamation.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> \\[The US Supreme] Court ruled, in *Garrison v. Louisiana* (1964\\), that truth must be an absolute defense to criminal libel. The Court also held that the actual malice requirement in *Sullivan* applied to criminal libel prosecutions stemming from statements about public officials ...\n> \n> \n> The Court\u2019s most recent ruling regarding criminal libel was *Ashton v. Kentucky* (1966\\), which held that Kentucky\u2019s unwritten, common law crime of libel was too indefinite and uncertain to be prosecuted. This ruling effectively eliminated common law criminal libel.\n\nIn short, while criminal libel still exists in the US it is of very limited importance and rare occurrence. referring to a document publishing a criminal libel is not an offense. Quoting such a document could be an offense if the quotation includes the allegedly libelous statement(s).\n\nCopyright Infringement\n----------------------\n\nDistributing unauthorized copies of a work, or copies of an unauthorized derivative work, **may** be copyright infringement and be grounds or a successful infringement suit. Referring to such a work is lawful. Linking to an infringing work may in some cases be held to be contributory infringement. Quoting from such a work will in most cases be lawful, unless the quotation itself constitutes infringement. Quoting an excessive amount may itself be infringement.\n\nNote that a valid defense of fair use may mean that distributing copyrighted content is lawful, so that a suit will not succeed. Fair use issues are highly fact\\-driven, and no clear bright line can be drawn between what is and is not permitted. This seems to be by legislative intent. Fair use was originally a judge\\-made doctrine, incorporated into the Copyright Act of 1976\\.\n\nNote also that copyright infringement is usually a civil matter, so that if the copyright holder does not file suit, there is no enforcement. Only in willful bulk commercial infringement are criminal charges brought.\n\nTrade Secrets\n-------------\n\nIt is unlawful to publish, distribute, or use a trade secret to which one has gained improper access. Under the [Uniform Trade Secrets Act (UTSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Trade_Secrets_Act), specifically [section 1\\.4](https://www.uniformlaws.org/viewdocument/final-act-with-comments-89?CommunityKey=3a2538fb-e030-4e2d-a9e2-90373dc05792&tab=librarydocuments):\n\n> \"**Trade secret**\" means information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process, that:\n> \n> \n> (i) derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use, and\n> \n> \n> (ii) is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\n\n\"Improper means\" of learning a trade secret (under the USTA, sec 1\\.1\\) include:\n\n> theft, bribery, misrepresentation, breach or inducement of a breach of a duty to maintain secrecy, or espionage through electronic or other means.\n\n\"Proper means\" include: discovery by independent invention, reverse engineering, licensing arrangement, and published literature.\n\nThe 2016 US Federal [Defend Trade Secrets Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defend_Trade_Secrets_Act) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1836\\) and the earlier US Economic Espionage Act of 1996 offer protection to trade secrets on a federal level.\n\nNote that like copyright, violation of a trade secret is a civil matter, not a crime. If the owner of a trade secret does not file a suit or take other legal action, there is no enforcement.\n\nIt is not unlawful to refer to a trade secret or a document that discloses one. It is not unlawful to disclose a trade secret that has already become public knowledge, although an actual document may well be protected by copyright.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nSimply referring to a work is almost never unlawful.

Nevertheless, this does not give you the right to drop bombs for fun. The arresting individual has the right to use reasonable force to effectuate the arrest. Ordinarily, you can't punch a person; but it is a defense against a battery charge that you did so in the course of a lawful arrest. [NRS 171\\.126](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-171.HTML#NRS171Sec126) even allows private citizens who are not bounty hunters to perform an arrest. A line is drawn at deadly force, because under NRS\u2002171\\.1455,\n\n> If necessary to prevent escape, an **officer** may, after giving a\n> warning, if feasible, use deadly force to effect the arrest of a\n> person only if there is probable cause to believe that the person:\n> \n> \n> 1.

Independently, though, if one of the illegally\\-acting police officers uses force to prevent the lawful arrest, deadly force may be legal under [NRS 200\\.120](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-200.html#NRS200Sec120):\n\n> Justifiable homicide is the killing of a human being in necessary\n> self\\-defense, or in defense of an occupied habitation, an occupied\n> motor vehicle or a person, against one who manifestly intends or\n> endeavors to commit a crime of violence, or against any person or\n> persons who manifestly intend and endeavor, in a violent, riotous,\n> tumultuous or surreptitious manner, to enter the occupied habitation\n> or occupied motor vehicle, of another for the purpose of assaulting or\n> offering personal violence to any person dwelling or being therein.\n\nThe rogue officers are committing battery, which is a crime.\n\nThis assumes that the underlying charge is a felony, whereas if it is a misdemeanor, the person either had to witness the offense, or must have been ordered to perform the arrest by a magistrate who witnessed the offense. Nevada law ([NRS 171\\.117 ff](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-171.HTML#NRS171Sec126)) says that an arrest warrant is \"directed to and executed by a peace officer\", so a bounty hunter is not executing an arrest warrant (unless they were deputized by a magistrate, as also provided by law).

Provided that an extradition hearing is not a trial, can a person still be extradited even if the legal case against her is flimsy or if she can be proven to be innocent beyond a reasonable doubt under the Canadian legal system?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under Canada's [Extradition Act](https://www.laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-23.01/page-1.html#h-212769), extradition requires an agreement (which exists between Canada and the US), and the alleged act would be a crime in Canada. Canada does not criminally prosecute the defendant, so this is largely procedural, verifying that the request is legally stated and so on. However, they will also have a hearing on the sufficiency of the evidence to go to trial (by Canadian standards). The ultimate truth or falsity of the criminal allegations will only be determined in the US court system.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In an extradition case between Canada and the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the extradition process and the determination of guilt?\n\nA) The Canadian court will conduct a full trial to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused before deciding on extradition.\n\nB) If the accused can prove their innocence under Canadian law, they cannot be extradited regardless of the evidence presented by the requesting country.\n\nC) The Canadian court will primarily verify the legal validity of the request and assess if there's sufficient evidence for the case to go to trial, without determining guilt.\n\nD) Extradition can only proceed if the accused is found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a Canadian court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In extradition cases between Canada and the US, the Canadian court does not conduct a full trial or determine guilt or innocence. Instead, it verifies that the extradition request meets legal requirements and that there is sufficient evidence for the case to proceed to trial in the requesting country (in this case, the US). The actual determination of guilt or innocence will only occur in the US court system if extradition is granted.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Canada does not conduct a full trial in extradition cases. Option B is false because proving innocence under Canadian law does not automatically prevent extradition; the focus is on the legal validity of the request and sufficiency of evidence. Option D is incorrect because a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is not required for extradition; this determination is left to the requesting country's courts."}, "44": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37500/is-a-cop-allowed-to-use-deadly-force-under-the-following-circumstances", "docs_id": 37500, "title": "Is a cop allowed to use deadly force under the following circumstances?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This was featured on [\"TJ Hooker\", episode 43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_T._J._Hooker_episodes) but conceivably could happen in real life.\n\nThe cop (Hooker) is escorting a victim, who is a diabetic. While walking, she dropped the insulin that she needs to survive.

Any pharmacy or hospital can supply more. Once the villain is secured, or the cop and victim are away from the villain, additional supplies can be obtained. That does not justify deadly force.

They have a corporate tax of 0%, and that includes income from abroad. So by moving your company officially to the Cayman Islands, you can avoid to pay a lot of taxes.\n\nNow of course most other countries will still send you a tax bill for any income you make with business activities within their borders. But there are accounting tricks to get around that. For example, many countries only tax profits, not revenue. So you can reduce your annual profits of your national subsidiaries to zero by having them pay money to your company on the caymans. For example, you can transfer your trademark to your subsidiary on the Cayman Islands and then have your subisdiaries in all other countries pay the Cayman company an annual license fee for using that brand name.

To maximize this benefit, multinational corporations often use accounting strategies such as trademark licensing fees. This involves transferring the company's trademark to a Cayman Islands subsidiary and having other global subsidiaries pay licensing fees to use the brand name. These fees are typically set at a level that reduces the taxable profits of subsidiaries in higher-tax jurisdictions to near zero, effectively shifting profits to the tax-free Cayman Islands entity.

But it isn't easy to discern from the resources available to me precisely when authority for crimes committed on the high seas was transferred from England's Admiralty Court to the Crown Courts (which have jurisdiction over these cases now).\n\nSimilarly, while debtor's prison was [abolished in England in 1869](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtors%27_prison), a few years before the High Court was created, I wouldn't be shocked to find that the Queen's Bench division may have handled some residual original jurisdiction cases related to quasi\\-criminal body executions for non\\-payment of debts originally resulting in incarceration in debtor's prisons, in cases originally arising prior to 1869 that weren't fully wrapped up in 1875\\.\n\n**Footnote**\n\nSome countries with common law legal systems and a court system based upon the English model have courts called a \"High Court\" which consolidate the functions of the English \"High Court\" and the English \"[Crown Court](https://www.judiciary.uk/you-and-the-judiciary/going-to-court/crown-court/)\" (which handles trials in serious criminal cases) in a single court. This is frequently motivated by a shortage of judges with the exceptional legal competence necessary to inspire confidence in the conduct of such proceedings.\n\nIn U.S. practice, for example, it is the rule and not the exception, for felony criminal cases, civil cases arising in equity, serious civil cases arising at law, and both criminal and civil appeals from lower courts to all be handled by the same court of general jurisdiction (although the terminology, of course, is usually slightly different since the U.S. does not have, and has never had after 1776, a King, a Queen, or Lords, as a matter of constitutional law).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements accurately describes the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales (Queen's Bench Division) in modern times?\n\nA) It regularly exercises original jurisdiction in serious criminal cases such as terrorism trials.\n\nB) It has no criminal jurisdiction whatsoever.\n\nC) It exercises original jurisdiction only in cases of criminal contempt of court.\n\nD) It frequently handles original jurisdiction cases related to crimes committed on the high seas.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The High Court of Justice of England and Wales (Queen's Bench Division) does not exercise original criminal jurisdiction in serious cases like terrorism trials in modern times.

Volunteering involves spending time, unpaid, doing something that aims to benefit the environment or someone (individuals or groups) other than, or in addition to, close relatives.\n\nThe guidance is that you must be careful it is genuine volunteering, not just 'working for free' (because the loophole here is that you 'volunteer' at a friends' restaurant, and they pay you in kind.\n\n> ...volunteering must not amount to unpaid work, or job substitution.

I think this may still apply to people in the [PRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personnel_Reliability_Program).

Unless the accusation does prove to constitute probable cause, any evidence found during such a search would not be admissible against Bob in a criminal case.\n\nIn practice, most US police would not undertake either search without better evidence than is described in the question. But some police will overstep the lines, which is what the US exclusionary rule is for.\n\nLegal procedure does not as far as I know make a distinction between \"exploratory\" and \"confirmatory\" evidence. Instead, evidence is either admissible or not. The rules for when evidence is admissible are quite complex, and vary by jurisdiction. Some of them are more traditional than logical, and some of them are addressed to particular problems that have arisen in particular circumstances.\n\nBut the US Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches, and the requirement of probable cause before search or arrest warrants are issued, serves some of the same purpose.\n\nOther countries have different rules, but many of them restrict the authorities to some extent from making arbitrary searches with no initial evidence.\n\n**Response to the Revised Question**\n\nAs the question has been edited, there seems to be fairly clear probable cause to search Alice's phone, and if clear evidence of \"illegal pornographic content\" presumably actually child pornography, as no other kind is illegal simply to posses) is found, she can be brought to trial and perhaps convicted. The mere \"suspicion\" of Alice's \"friends and relatives\" would add little and mi8ght well not even be admissible. The facts, if any, on which those suspicions are based might be admissible, one cannot tell from the summary in the question. \n\nThe case against Bob, however, remains weak. Indeed there still seems to be no probable cause either to arrest Bob nor to se3arch his phone, and the results of any search that was done would not be admissible. Probably none would be done without more evidence.\n\nThe OP wrote:\n\n> Thus, although the situation looks grim for both, since the evidence against Bob is confirmatory, it might be considered stronger.\n\nNot so, the case against Bob is weaker, indeed so weak that an arrest would be unlikely, and if one were made, the case would likely be dismissed before going to trial, assuming no more evidence than was included inn the question. The evidence prior to the search seems to consist only of vague suspicion not supported by any actual evidence, and so there is nothing to confirm, and no **valid** search would occur.\n\nThat suspicion of Bob came before the search, and the search is thus \"confirmatory\" is not relevant.

In the EU, for instance, there are rules allowing Member States to enact laws allowing trademark owners to prevent others from using a similar brand where\n\n> \"use of that sign without due cause takes unfair advantage of, or is\n> detrimental to, the distinctive character or the repute of the trade\n> mark.\"\n\n[EU Trademarks Directive 2008 at EUR\\-Lex](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32008L0095)\n\nAlso worth noting that business names are regulated differently from trademarks and it may be normal to have a business name registered in one place while someone else has the identical name registered to them in a different place.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A small tech startup named \"Innovate Solutions\" is considering rebranding itself as \"Not Apple\" to gain attention in the market. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the potential legal implications of this decision?\n\nA) This rebranding strategy is completely safe from any legal repercussions as long as the word \"Not\" is clearly visible in the new name.\n\nB) The startup could face legal issues only if they operate in the same specific product category as Apple Inc.\n\nC) The rebranding could potentially lead to trademark infringement issues, depending on various factors including likelihood of confusion and possible unfair advantage.\n\nD) As long as the startup registers \"Not Apple\" as their business name in a different jurisdiction from Apple Inc., they are protected from any trademark claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate reflection of the potential legal implications. The question of trademark infringement is complex and depends on multiple factors. While adding \"Not\" to a trademarked name might seem like a clear distinction, trademark law considers the overall impression and potential for confusion. The likelihood of confusion, similarity of markets, distinctiveness of the original brand, and potential for unfair advantage or detriment to the original brand's reputation are all relevant factors. Even if there isn't a likelihood of confusion, the startup could still face issues related to \"coat-tailing\" or taking unfair advantage of Apple's reputation. Options A and D oversimplify the issue and incorrectly suggest easy workarounds, while B is too narrow in its focus on product category alone."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45974/can-a-voided-contract-be-amended", "docs_id": 45974, "title": "Can a voided contract be amended?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The 1st contract was signed by both parties but the services were misrepresented to Party A.

The term of *amended* might have a connotation that some changes were made to a former contract *while* it still was in force (or *prior* thereto).\n\n> Is the amended contract, that is based on the first voided contract, valid and enforceable?\n\nYes, unless the clauses or misrepresentation of the new contract renders it unenforceable, regardless of how similar to the voided contract it looks. The new contract became binding and enforceable as soon as party A signed it.\n\nThe mere existence of similarities between the voided contract and the new one are mostly irrelevant for determining the enforceability of the new contract.\n\nYou did not specify what kind of misrepresentations induced party A to sign the initial contract. It is noteworthy that if certain types of misrepresentations persist in the new contract, party A might have forfeited his entitlement to void or get out of the new contract. That would qualify as what the [*Restatement (Second) of Contracts* at \u00a7 152\\-154](https://www.nylitigationfirm.com/files/restat.pdf) calls \"*A Party Bear\\[ing] the Risk of a Mistake*\".\n\n> What if Party A felt pressured (due to financial reasons/limitations) to sign the amended contact? Is it enforceable?\n\nA contract is void if duress or coercion by one of the parties prompted the other(s) to accept that contract.

Party A tried to back out, but Party B proposed an amended contract which Party A signed due to financial pressures. Both parties received consideration in this new contract. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforceability of the new contract?\n\nA) The new contract is automatically void because it is based on a previously voided contract.\n\nB) The new contract is enforceable unless Party A can prove that Party B directly coerced them into signing.\n\nC) The new contract is void because Party A felt financially pressured to sign it.\n\nD) The new contract is likely enforceable, regardless of its similarity to the original voided contract, unless it contains its own grounds for unenforceability.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the documentation, what is referred to as an \"amended contract\" is actually a new contract. This new contract becomes binding and enforceable as soon as Party A signs it, regardless of its similarities to the voided contract. The mere existence of financial pressure on Party A does not typically constitute grounds for voiding the contract unless the pressure can be directly attributed to coercion by Party B. The contract would only be unenforceable if it contains its own grounds for unenforceability, such as persisting misrepresentations or other legal issues within the new contract itself."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7661/is-membership-in-the-paris-convention-for-the-protection-of-industrial-property", "docs_id": 7661, "title": "Is membership in the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property required for other special agreements such as PCT?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am currently studying for an exam in intellectual property rights and read that the *Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property* is a umbrella agreement, whereas agreements such as PCT (*Patent Cooperation Treaty*) or MMA (*Madrid system for the international registration of marks*) are special agreements (within the umbrella).\n\nTherefore I wonder if **membership in the *Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property* is a requirement for any of the before mentioned special agreements and if not why**?\n\nSpecial agreements are mentioned in [Art. 19 of the Paris Convention](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=288514#P361_57002).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is true regarding the relationship between the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property and special agreements such as the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and the Madrid system for the international registration of marks (MMA)?\n\nA) Membership in the Paris Convention is a mandatory prerequisite for joining any special agreement.\n\nB) The Paris Convention explicitly prohibits countries from joining special agreements without first becoming members of the Convention.\n\nC) Special agreements like PCT and MMA can operate independently of the Paris Convention, but are designed to complement its principles.\n\nD) The Paris Convention automatically grants membership to all special agreements under its umbrella.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property serves as an umbrella agreement, while agreements like the PCT and MMA are special agreements within this framework. However, membership in the Paris Convention is not a strict requirement for joining these special agreements. Article 19 of the Paris Convention allows for special agreements to be made between member countries, but it does not mandate Paris Convention membership as a prerequisite. These special agreements are designed to complement and extend the principles of the Paris Convention, but they can operate independently. Countries may choose to join special agreements based on their specific needs and interests in intellectual property protection, even if they are not members of the Paris Convention."}}
