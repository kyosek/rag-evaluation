According to the LawStackExchange discussion, creating and publishing a fictional version of the redacted portions of the Mueller Report, as long as it's not claimed to be factual, would likely be protected under freedom of speech in the United States.

California](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/607/), a criminal case, held that \"A law enacted after expiration of a previously applicable limitations period violates the Ex Post Facto Clause when it is applied to revive a previously time\\-barred prosecution\". In 1798, in [Calder v. Bull](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/3/386/), SCOTUS long ago decided that the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to civil cases. In that case, Calder had been entitled to property under a will, and the Connecticut legislature changed the law. The Supreme Court held that the legislative act was not an Ex Post Facto law. Chase's reasoning, which relies on the distinction between ex post facto law and retrospective law, is this:\n\n> In my opinion, the true distinction is between ex post facto laws and\n> retrospective laws. Every ex post facto law must necessarily be\n> retrospective, but every retrospective law is not an ex post facto\n> law. The former only are prohibited. Every law that takes away or\n> impairs rights vested agreeably to existing laws is retrospective, and\n> is generally unjust and may be oppressive, and it is a good general\n> rule that a law should have no retrospect; but there are cases in\n> which laws may justly, and for the benefit of the community and also\n> of individuals, relate to a time antecedent to their commencement, as\n> statutes of oblivion or of pardon.

The Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution does not apply to civil cases, as established in Calder v. Bull (1798). While Stogner v.

Making and distributing copies of images that are not under free licenses would be at least a technical infringement of copyright. (In general, making a copy of a protected work is infringement, unless you have permission, usually some sort of license.) As you are not transforming the images, and are not commenting on them, and are doing this as part of a commercial enterprise, this probably would not count as fair use under US law (you don't state where you are located).

The documentation clearly states that many images on platforms like Pinterest are not under free licenses, and using them without permission could constitute copyright infringement. The safest approach is to use only images that are explicitly licensed for free use or to distribute links to the original images, as suggested in the answer. This avoids potential legal issues while still allowing the florist to showcase examples to clients.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all images found online are free to use, even if credit is given.

Sometimes, circuit splits are resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court (a large share of its docket is devoted to such cases).

When there is a circuit split between two U.S. Courts of Appeals, each court's decision is binding only within its own circuit. There is no automatic mechanism for resolving such splits based on timing or geography. The U.S. Supreme Court may choose to resolve the split, but is not required to do so immediately. Often, circuit splits can persist for years or even decades, resulting in different interpretations of federal law or treaties in different parts of the country. Options A and B are incorrect because neither recency nor geographic jurisdiction automatically determines precedence in a circuit split. Option C is incorrect because the Supreme Court is not obligated to immediately resolve every circuit split; in fact, it often waits until a clear majority view emerges among the circuits before addressing the issue."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/63931/inheritance-of-shares-or-their-value", "docs_id": 63931, "title": "Inheritance of shares or their value", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: X and Y both buy 10 shares in company C.

Therefore the staff varies. One of the volunteer download a photo from a blog that it seemed to be free use (the photo has been published hundreds of times in blogs that doesn\u2019t ask for copyright) and we published the photo thinking it was OK. \n\nBut weeks ago a company called Copytrack emailed us and asked for money for the copyright infringement. So, I do some research, and found that indeed the use of the photo needed a license but when it was downloaded by the volunteer it was from a blog. So, it was a real mistake, but also an unintentional copyright infringement. So I remove the pic and article in full and I sent an email apologising for the mistake and even I offer to do an interview to the photographer or something similar, as we don\u2019t have money.\n\nThey replied in identical terms they told @user1889580 \u201cyou have infringed on our client's image, pay us right away to avoid legal issues\u201d, etc.\n\nSo, I reply with a more comprehensive letter, apologising again, explaining that we don\u2019t\u2019 receive money, plus we never make any profit from the work we published. Something easy to prove and in fact I invited them to check in internet, were you find that we don\u2019t receive more than 30 pounds a year. So, I said I would paid something, from my own pocket. \n\nThey haven\u2019t reply yet, but I have been doing a research and talking to colleagues and press associations. And there is a consensus: Copyrigth is a legal company but doesn\u2019t act ethically, they act as scam and there are many complains. Plus I found this: \u201cIn view of German copyright law and the respective jurisdiction of the German courts, the amount that Copytrack claims is far too high\u201d. \n\nThe amounts they usually charge are absurd. For instance, if a photo cost 30 Euros or 100 Euros, Copytrack asks for 500, 600, 1000 euros and more. We think this is because they don\u2019t charge for their services to their clients, so the way to get their fees is by doing this. \n\nI am are aware copyright infringement is something serious and we respect other people\u2019s work, but I want all this managed in a fair, ethical and reasonable manner from both sides. \n\nI have been asking for advice and my colleagues say, I must ignore it. But like @user1889580 , I am worried.

Section 111(b) of the bill says:\n\n> (b) Exclusion of portion remaining as seat of Government of United\n> States.\u2014The territory of the State shall not include the area\n> described in section 112, which shall be known as the \u201cCapital\u201d and\n> shall serve as the seat of the Government of the United States, as\n> provided in clause 17 of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of\n> the United States.\n\nBut under the 23rd Amendment to the US Constitution, the district constituting the seat of the US government gets to appoint electors (in a manner that Congress decides) to the Electoral College that elects the President and Vice President. (The number of electors that the district gets is the number of Senators and Representatives it would have if it were a state, but no more than the number of electors of the least populous state, so effectively the number will always be 3 electors, since each state has 2 senators and at least 1 representative, and there are some states with only 1 representative.)\n\n> Section 1\\.

Bush's presidency). So the issue would have come up then at least, if not sooner. The reasons they look at alcohol abuse is that, as the DoD says, Loose Lips Sink Ships, and as the Romans observed *In Vino Veritas* (In wine, there is truth). They also look into it for matters as an substance abuse issue could be exploited by an adversary or could lead to poor choices.\n\nTypically, these investigations are lenient on youthful indiscretion during college and high school, as it would be near impossible to find a new recruit who hasn't drank under\\-age during college. It's quite common. Additionally, the scope of these investigations is 10 years or to your 18th birthday, which ever is sooner. If Kavanaugh was 17 in 1982, than it would not be covered in a 2001 investigation. They also require that you list six separate non\\-familial witnesses, with four of them being able to vouch for you during the entire portion of the scope's time AND they cannot be family members. Kavanaugh's first background check was when he clerked for the Solicitor General of the United States, in 1990 or 1991 (cannot remember the specific date, but it was early) so his college years could have been investigated during that time, though I do not know what the DOJ process is.\n\nDrinking is not in and of itself enough to get you disqualified, but does need to be assessed with other issues to make a determination on if the subject of an investigation could be trusted to handle classified materials. As it's not an illegal substance, they are looking for a problematic pattern, not if the subject drank underage, even if it was a glass of wine at Christmas Dinner.\n\nIt should be stressed, that this is a very, very, through screening. As one DoD hiring manager I know personally has told me, the general rule for hiring for hiring for a position is that for one billet that needs to be filled, give a conditional job offer to 4 people. This is due to the fact that, because of the rigorous nature of the background checks, only one person is likely to clear them.

But, responsibilities is a very broad concept: some aspects of responsibility are encoded in law, others are not. You have an absolute legal obligation to not murder or steal, as defined by the law. Some people say you have a social responsibility to put others before your own interest: this may be legally true in certain contexts, especially fiduciary contexts where your broker is supposed to make decisions on your behalf that benefit you (regardless of personal effect on the broker).\n\nContracts are another source of obligations \u2013 you gain a right (access to someone else's property) in exchange for something, which may include standards of behavior.

Thank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a developing area of law and there really aren't clear answers.\n\nHistorically, the courts have largely taken the position that when Congress says something, such as delegating enforcement power to a Presidentially nominated, Senate approved officer of the United States government, that it means it and that the President has only indirect power to take that action through the government officer in question if that government officer is the President's subordinate (often indirectly through another political appointee).

People's signatures change over time for a variety of reasons, sometimes dramatically in a short period of time, for example, in the case of a stroke or a hand injury.\n\nWhen signatures differ over time and there are allegations of forgery, then it is a question of proof for a finder of fact (i.e. a judge or jury) to decide if the alleged forgery is really a forgery.\n\nMany businesses that routinely accept small dollar value personal checks, for example, also take a thumb\\-print of the person signing the check in order to make it cheap and easy to litigate the question of whether a signature on a check is forged, and to discourage litigants from falsely claiming that a check was forged in the first place.

In my country, international treaties have constitutional level since 1994, which means a violation of an international treaty is a violation of the constitution. For example, Argentina signed the declaration of human rights, so if a law violates a human right here, it's violating the constitution. How is this in United States? Does violating an international treaty have any legal consequence in United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For the US, violating the obligations of a treaty (for the purposes of international law) is not the same as a violation of the US constitution (for the purposes of domestic US law). The US Constitution is higher than treaties, and if a treaty is in conflict with the constitution, courts will rule the treaty null and void for the purposes of US law. See the Supreme Court decision in Reid v. Covert (1957\\). In addition, treaties do not have a privileged position over regular federal law, and simple acts of Congress can amend or repeal treaties for the purposes of US law. See the Supreme Court decision in the Head Money Cases (1884\\). In these cases, other countries may still regard the US to still be bound by the obligations of the treaty, even though the US may no longer be following the domestic law obligations, and thus the US may be \"violating\" the treaty from the perspective of international law.\n\nEven if a treaty has not been ruled unconstitutional and has not been amended by Congress, a violation of it might still not be a violation of US law. For example, Article 33 of the Refugee Convention (which is binding on the US because it's a party to the Refugee Protocol) prevents countries from returning refugees to a country where they are persecuted. But the US government has taken the [position](https://www.justice.gov/file/23326/download) that this treaty provision is \"not self\\-executing\" and does not by itself impose domestic legal obligations without separate domestic legislation (though others [disagree](https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1281&context=facpubs)).

I'm not talking about extradition or something. It is more about bringing this person to trial, whether in USA or in Sri Lanka. What is the process after a crime's been committed and the perpetrator flees back to the safety of their country?\n\n### Supplemental Questions\n\n1. If a good lawyer was stating the question above, what would their precise terms be?\n2. Will this whole hypothetical situation fall under the case study of criminal law? Is it a matter of international laws as well?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If the police or other authorities of Sri Lanka do not have witnesses or other evidences supporting that this American committed the crime, there is little that can be done. The police of Sri Lanka could ask the police of whatever locality the person is now in to interview the accused, which they might do as a favor, but are not obliged to do. If they do such an interview, the content would probably be sent to the Sri Lankan authorities. It might or might not be of help to them.\n\nIf the Sri Lankan authorities can assemble some evidence, they could apply for [extradition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition). That is a matter which depends on the existence of a treaty. According to [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3181](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3181) there is an extradition treaty between the US and Sri Lanka, which became effective on Jan. 12, 2001\\.\n\nExtradition requests are normally subject to review by the courts and diplomatic authorities of the *sending nation*, that is the country that is requested to extradite a person. The request may be refused if there is not sufficient evidence, or if the charge is not a crime under the laws of the sending nation, or for other reasons specified in the law of the sending nation.\n\nIn the hypothetical case in the question, the main issue would probable be whether there was sufficient evidence. If it were claimed that the accused could not get a fair trial in Sri Lanka, or would be likely to be subject to torture there, that could also be a reason for refusal.\n\nIn the US this is handled under [18 USC 3184](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3184) This provides in relevant part that:\n\n> If, on such hearing, \\[the judge or magistrate] deems the evidence sufficient to sustain the charge under the provisions of the proper treaty or convention, or under section 3181(b), he shall certify the same, together with a copy of all the testimony taken before him, to the Secretary of State, that a warrant may issue upon the requisition of the proper authorities of such foreign government, for the surrender of such person, according to the stipulations of the treaty or convention; and he shall issue his warrant for the commitment of the person so charged to the proper jail, there to remain until such surrender shall be made.\n\nI do not know the details of criminal procedure in Sri Lanka, so I don't know what, if anything, a court might do about such a case. In the US, a court would have nothing to do in such a matter until and unless the prosecutor was willing to present formal charges. Such charges would have to establish that there was *probable cause* to believe that a crime had been committed, and that the accused had comitted it, before a trial could be held.\n\nThe Sri Lankan authorities could also request that a relevant US prosecutor file charges and try the accused in a US court. In some cases the US will try US nationals for offenses committed outside the US. But in the kind of case described in the question, this would not be usual.\n\nIf Sri Lankan law permits, the authorities there could also try the accused *in absentia*. Many countries and many people regard this as fundamentally unfair, but it is sometimes done. In such a case, the person convicted *in absentia* could be arrested if s/he ever came within the jurisdiction of Sri Lanka. Aside from that, Sri Lanka cannot bring the person to court unless they apply for and get extradition, or the person travels to Sri Lanka again and is arrested there.\n\nAs to the specific questions:\n\n> if a good lawyer was stating the question above, what would their precise terms be?\n\nThere are not very many specific terms to be used. The person said to have comitted the murder (or other crime) would probably be refereed to as \"the accused\" or possibly \"the alleged criminal\". If there is a specific term for the particular crime in Sri Lankan law, it would be used. If it were a real case, details such as the time and place of the crime would be given.\n\n> will this whole hypothetical situation fall under the case study of criminal law? I'm thinking international laws as well, but then I don't know for sure what international laws are, so there's that.\n\nYes, this is an aspect of criminal law, albeit one that most lawyers in criminal law practice never have occasion to deal with. In a sense there is no such thing as \"international law\", that is, law binding on countries. What is known as \"international law\" is the complex of treaties and agreements between various countries and the way in which they are given effect. Nations never have to enter into treaties, although there can be great pressure to do so. A nation can always denounce a treaty, although there may be consequences such as political or economic pressure, or in extreme cases, war.\n\n\"international law\" is also the accumulated precedents for how nations have interacted in the past over legal issues, but this is only binding in future cases to the extent that a given country's laws or courts treat it as binding, or that a current treaty makes it so.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the hypothetical scenario where a US citizen commits murders in Sri Lanka and flees back to the USA, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal process?\n\nA) The Sri Lankan authorities can directly bring the accused to trial in the USA without any involvement from US authorities.\n\nB) If there's insufficient evidence, Sri Lanka can still easily extradite the accused from the USA based solely on eyewitness accounts that are unwilling to testify.\n\nC) Sri Lanka could request extradition, but the process would be subject to review by US courts and diplomatic authorities, considering factors such as sufficiency of evidence and potential for a fair trial.\n\nD) International law automatically requires the USA to arrest and return the accused to Sri Lanka, regardless of the evidence available or the existence of an extradition treaty.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the complexities of the extradition process. As per the information provided, extradition requests are subject to review by the courts and diplomatic authorities of the sending nation (in this case, the USA). The US would consider factors such as sufficient evidence and the possibility of a fair trial in Sri Lanka before approving an extradition request. This process is governed by the extradition treaty between the US and Sri Lanka, as well as US laws like 18 USC 3184.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Sri Lankan authorities cannot directly bring the accused to trial in the USA without US involvement. Option B is wrong because insufficient evidence and reluctant witnesses would likely hinder, not facilitate, extradition. Option D is incorrect because there is no automatic international law requiring extradition; the process depends on treaties and is subject to review."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90737/can-underage-people-who-commit-a-crime-while-underaged-but-are-later-charged-wit", "docs_id": 90737, "title": "Can underage people who commit a crime while underaged but are later charged with the same crime after turning 18 be tried as an adult?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: U.S federal law specifically but are there other countries that do this and in USA is an affirmative defense possible in these cases where they are tried as an adult?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\nDefendants who are later accused of a crime committed when they were minor (under 18, or under 21 if the court finds that they had juvenile mental maturity) will be tried under juvenile rules.\n\nThat can lead to people [almost 90 years](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Dey) old being sentenced to juvenile detention.

Let's say a suit is filed by some entity having standing on the matter (somehow): the amendment is invalid, because the process of adopting it was illegal, but to even consider its possible invalidity, you have to contradict the amendment's provisions, which means pre\\-judging it as invalid.

According to the information provided, if a U.S. citizen agrees to self-deport, CBP would likely view this as evidence that the person is not a genuine citizen and that their documents may be fake.

The registered design for a model of a historical locomotive may not meet the requirement of being \"novel,\" as it is based on an existing, well-known object. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while historical locomotives themselves are not protected, registered designs of models can be protected if they meet certain criteria. \n\nOption B, seeking a licensing agreement, is not the best first step as the design registration itself may be invalid. \n\nOption D, creating a significantly different design, would defeat Sarah's purpose of creating an accurate replica and may not be necessary if the existing registration can be invalidated.\n\nBy challenging the validity of the registered design, Sarah can potentially clear the way to create her own accurate model without infringing on others' intellectual property rights."}, "47": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48687/can-i-lend-an-ebook", "docs_id": 48687, "title": "Can I &#39;lend&#39; an ebook?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am aware that ebooks actually have a license (usually) which prohibits a user from sharing an ebook.\n\nI am curious, if, as a programmer, I can have a system (say an online session) where only one user (not necessarily the original purchaser) can use/view an ebook (i.e. it is not replicated or distributed) at any given time, will it be legal for me to share my ebooks?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No, not as a general rule.

These boards have both regulatory power like any other government agency, and the quasi\\-judicial authority to resolve union\\-management disputes outside of the regular court system.\n\nThe cited document is an opinion of the New York Public Employment Relations Board decided in 1998 and reported in the case reporter \"[Public Employment Relations Board Reports](http://www.nycourts.gov/reporter/style-manual/2017/2017-SM.htm#APPENDIX%202)\" in volume 31 as decision number 4021 in that volume, for which the paragraph symbol (\u00b6) is used in their official form of citation (the section symbol is \u00a7).

If no section or paragraph mark were used, the reference would be to a page number in that volume of the case reporter under default rules for interpreting citations. But, since this is a reference to a sequential entry in the case reporter, rather than to a page number, some symbol must be used to identify it. The use of the \u00b6 symbol to break up logical components of a volume parallels the practice for learned legal treatises and legal services which usually break up their logical units by components denoted with the paragraph mark.\n\nThe case name \"(Matter of Freeport Union Free Sch.

I recently moved to a new neighborhood. My side of the street has parking, and there are cars regularly parked all along it, at all hours of the day. There are no signs posted regulating parking on this side of the street in any way. Last night I was given a ticket for being parked on the street between 2\\-6am. I looked up the code for the neighborhood, and the policy is definitely on the books.

If the municipal ordinances state that a particular place does not allow parking at certain times, then if you park there you have violated the law and will get ticketed. There is no requirement that there be signs prominently posted saying that you must obey the law in this particular location. A law might itself require there to be postings, for example speed limit law pertaining to school zones typically are stated in terms of \"posted\" boundaries. Assuming that the ordinance doesn't have such a \"as posted\" requirement, you have no legal leg to stand on, and the burden must be shifted to your political leg.\n\nIf, for example, you were in Pennsylvania, [75 PaCSA 3353(d)](https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-75-pacsa-vehicles/pa-csa-sect-75-3353.html) permits local parking ordinances: \n\n> The department on State\\-designated highways and local authorities on\n>  any highway within their boundaries may by erection of official\n>  traffic\\-control devices prohibit, limit or restrict stopping, standing\n>  or parking of vehicles on any highway where engineering and traffic\n>  studies indicate that stopping, standing or parking would constitute a\n>  safety hazard or where the stopping, standing or parking of vehicles\n>  would unduly interfere with the free movement of traffic.\n\nSigns are kinds of traffic control devices. Since PA does not statutorily prohibit overnight parking, any local restrictions on overnight parking would require signage. Thus restriction such as [this one](https://ecode360.com/32271425#32271425) that \"The following vehicles shall not be parked between 9:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. on the streets...\", applying to commercial vehicles among others, would require a sign. That borough has an interesting ordinance stating that\n\n> In the event of a conflict between the Codified Ordinances of the\n>  Borough of Lansdale and the provisions set forth in the Pennsylvania\n>  Motor Vehicle Code at 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3351 through 3354, as amended\n>  from time to time, the provisions of the Codified Ordinances of the\n>  Borough of Lansdale shall control.\n\nGenerally speaking, local ordinances are subordinate to state law, so this provision is legally questionable (although: the borough does not actually *deny* the signage requirement, so technically this is not a conflict, it is just ignoring state law \u2013 if there is no signage).\n\nThe borough could of course argue that they were unaware of the state requirement to post no\\-parking signs, but *ignorantia legis neminem excusat*.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of local parking ordinances and state laws, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Local parking ordinances always supersede state laws, regardless of signage requirements.\n\nB) Ignorance of a local parking ordinance is a valid legal defense if there are no visible signs posted.\n\nC) State laws may require signage for certain parking restrictions, even if local ordinances don't explicitly mention this requirement.\n\nD) Local authorities have complete discretion in enforcing parking rules without any obligation to post signs or follow state guidelines.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because local ordinances do not always supersede state laws.

The landlord's main concern regarding credit rating is probably financial responsibility, and if you qualify, having people live with you who have low or no credit rating is unlikely to make any difference. There may be other concerns, such as background checks or increases utility costs).\n\nVirginia law does not specifically allow \"unauthorized occupants\", i.e. occupants *not* approved by the landlord, nor does it specifically disallow such occupants. Leases often include a provision that addresses this matter, prohibiting unauthorized occupants. Supposing that the lease is silent on the matter (not likely) and the landlord wanted to compel the other occupants to leave, the procedure would be to tell the tenant that the unauthorized occupants must leave. Then if you do not comply (do not get them to move out), the landlord could start the procedure of evicting the lot of you, and the question would be whether the court would find that you have a right to let unauthorized other people live with you. I can't find any applicable case law, but it is unlikely that the court would find such a right. Tenants have special statutory rights, as do authorized occupants under the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act.

On the other hand, *the first* defendant to actually fight back was able to uncover the hundreds of other cases, and the obvious fraud. The court swiftly ruled that\n\n* Jarek Molski is a *vexatious litigant* and **can file no more lawsuits**, except by asking permission (presenting the facts to a judge and the judge deciding that there's really a worthy case there).\n* The lawyers which represented Molski are likewise barred from representing anyone in an ADA case.\n* Their law firm, likewise.\n\nRighthaven\n----------\n\nAnother group of lawyers set up a law firm specifically to sue the owners of \"BBS's\" / internet forums / Q\\&A sites such as StackExchange, *whose public users* had pasted up copies of newspaper articles into the BBS. They **Bought the \"right to sue\"** from copyright owners such as newspapers \\- Righthaven didn't own the content, just the \"hunting license\" to go after people who infringed on the content \\- with the content owners getting a cut of proceeds.\n\nThey too filed hundreds of \"madlib\" lawsuits.

It's so rare that when I had the pleasure of doing so, the court told us to take the standard garnishment forms, cross out \"defendant\" and hand\\-write \"plaintiff\" :)\n\nAnd again, the first defendant to actually stand up to Righthaven in court, asked the court to knock Righthaven to the moon, which [the court gleefully did](https://www.wired.com/2011/09/righthaven-on-life-support/).\n\nRIAA / MPAA\n-----------\n\nBitTorrent is a file\\-sharing network with no central hub. It breaks files into thousands of \"chunks\". Users collect chunks from hundreds of other users until they have the whole thing. Part of the social contract of BitTorrent is that people who download also upload (seed) to share the chunks they have gotten so far. People who refuse to upload are called leeches.\n\nRIAA and MPAA are the trade associations of the music and movie industries, respectively. They searched for BitTorrent (pirated, they claim) copies of their members' music and movies. They then \"leeched\" those copies with modified BitTorrent software that recorded the IP address of the \"seeder\". They took the IP address to the owning ISP, and demanded the customer identity. Then they sent out \"pay\\-us\\-or\\-else\" letters by the tens of thousands, and filed suits by the thousands. The argument was that the seeder had pirated the music, and that the ISP account holder was financially responsible for that activity, neither claim 100% reliable.\n\n[This campaign](https://jolt.richmond.edu/2018/03/15/has-the-riaa-given-up-on-combating-end-user-internet-piracy/) has been supported by the courts, because RIAA/MPAA were very careful of their legal footing.

If the third party does not sign up within X months, I give the money to charity.\n\nIs this legal according to the law of Minnesota, US? Any advice is greatly appreciated!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One way to look at this arrangement is that it would be an enforceable contract. \nAs a contractual matter, there is an agreement between you and the customer, and a separate agreement between you and the artist. In the first agreement, you have to give something of value, and the customer has to give something of value (money). You would be offering self\\-generated good feelings and encouraging something that the customer finds valuable. You would need to be clear about what they must do and what you must do, and assuming that, it would be a valid thus legal contract. (I set aside the question of whether the Spotify TOS might prohibit you from doing this: my answer is not Spotify\\-specific).\n\nTo be a real contract, you ought to be able to say what would be a breach of contract by you or the customer (you don't define breach in the contract, but conceptualizing the matter this way will help clarify the terms). You could breach if you simply refused to pass on the promised percentage, or unilaterally changed the percentage, or surprise customers by refusing to support Bj\u00f6rk or Enya. The customer might breach by e.g. inflating hit\\-rates by some software means, or by paying with fake money (rubber checks, invalid cards, whatever). One thing you cannot reasonably do is promise that the artist will be cooperative, so your promise would have to be clear about the non\\-cooperative artist option. (Suppose a customer listens to Bj\u00f6rk, Enya and Smith in that order, but Bj\u00f6rk declines to cooperate: is the money automatically re\\-distributed to Enya and Smith, or does Bj\u00f6rk's share go to the customer's charity? What is both the charity and artist are uncooperative \u2013 unlikely but not impossible?)\n\nTheoretically you can also form a contract with the artist, where you give something of value (money) in exchange for... and that part is not clear. \"Providing bank details\" might be the thing of value (valuable because it enables your contract with the customer). But there is no obvious reason for you to actually form a contract with the artist, and it is legal to give someone money with no strings attached (though you may have to mind income\\-reporting laws, if you hand over a lot of money). The tax consequences of this scheme should not be overlooked.\n\nAnother way to approach this is that you are running a charity, serving as a clearinghouse. Charities are highly regulated: the Minnesota AG provides [this guidance](http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Consumer/Publications/GuideCharityLaws.asp) on some of the law. If one opts to create a charity, one should hire an attorney. If one opts to not officially create a charity but does something that looks like it is a charity, one should hire an attorney to figure out how to do this so as to avoid prosecution for operating an unregistered charity.\n\nThere is also the potential that this could become a money\\-laundering operation. The federal [Money Laundering Control Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Laundering_Control_Act) might be relevant. The entire thing as enacted originally is [here](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-100/pdf/STATUTE-100-Pg3207.pdf) (193 pages), the laundering part is Subtitle H. Fortunately, what is outlawed is willful acts, e.g. \"knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity\", \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity\".

Penney case last month. \u201cEquity gets lost long before the case is filed.\u201d\n> \n> \n> Under U.S. bankruptcy law, shareholders are last in line for any kind of payout \\-\\- behind the lawyers, lenders, and vendors \\-\\- making a recovery for shares unusual. The size and scope of payouts is usually determined by a so\\-called Chapter 11 plan, which creditors vote on and send to a federal judge for approval. Those plans often leave even high\\-ranking creditors getting less than they\u2019re owed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Because a company with positive equity isn't bankrupt\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nUsually.\n\n**The simple version**\n\nEquity in accounting terms is a part of the Statement of Financial Position (previously called the Balance Sheet) and represents the value owned by the shareholders. It was called a Balance Sheet because it balances:\n\n```\nAssets - Liabilities = Equity\n\n```\n\nA bankrupt company is one that is unable to settle its debts meaning that its Liabilities (what it owes) are greater than its Assets (what it owns). Therefore equity is negative \\- the equity has been lost before the company files for bankruptcy.\n\nSince shareholders have limited liability, they do not have to contribute to pay the company's debts so their shareholding is worthless. Their shareholding can't be worth less than worthless so in that sense David Jones is right \u201cNo one ever loses equity in a bankruptcy case, Equity gets lost long before the case is filed.\u201d It is the loss of the equity that caused the bankruptcy.\n\n**The more complex version**\n\nThe Statement of Financial Position is a point in time measure of the liquidated value of the entity \\- that is, the value of the company if all assets were sold for their book value and all debts were settled for their book value. This isn't something that can actually happen for all sorts of reasons.\n\nA company that gets liquidated will often not realise the full value of its booked assets because these are accounting measures of value rather than sale under the hammer values at a liquidation auction.\n\nFurther, businesses as [going concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_concern) have a different value than their book equity. An ongoing business will make profits (or losses) in the future and the expectation of these needs to be added (or subtracted) from the book equity. This is why a company with negative equity may still be worth operating and, conversely, why one with positive equity maybe should be closed.\n\nAlso, businesses may have significant off\\-balance\\-sheet assets such as valuable IP and branding that was developed in house and therefore don't create bookable transactions. For example, there is no item in the Coca\\-cola [balance sheet](https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/financial-information/balance-sheet) that represents the value of the brand. This is clearly an item of value that a) isn't on the balance sheet and b) only has value while someone is making cola and using that branding. Kodak, Blockbuster, Panamerican and Concorde were all once valuable brands that now only have nostalgia value.\n\nOne final point is that it is quite possible for a business with positive equity to go bankrupt because bankruptcy can be triggered by insolvency. Insolvency is being unable to pay your debts as and when they fall due. An asset rich but cash poor organisation can be insolvent while still having positive equity. For example, a property developer may have a large portfolio of valuable property and owe a relatively small amount to contractors, however, if they can't come up with the cash to pay these debts they are insolvent and this can trigger bankruptcy.\n\nMany businesses and individuals may be insolvent and recover from it \\- they borrow money from a bank (or by delaying payments to creditors) or inject more funds into the business. It is usually only when a business is of borderline profitability that insolvency will push them into bankruptcy.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company has filed for bankruptcy, but its stock is still trading at a low price.
