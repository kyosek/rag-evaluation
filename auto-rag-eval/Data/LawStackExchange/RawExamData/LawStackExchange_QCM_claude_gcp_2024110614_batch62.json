All of the considerations upon which the rule is based are as applicable to polygraph evidence as to other statements. The repetition of statements by another witness adds nothing to their weight and reliability. The ultimate decision as to the truth or falsity of the evidence of a witness must rest upon the exercise of the judgment of the trier of fact. This is as true of evidence of polygraph tests as of any other evidence. In the last analysis, the trier of fact must reach its conclusion on the basis of the evidence given by a human being in court. The evidence of the polygraph operator if heard by the trier of fact adds nothing to the earlier statement of the witness which is sought to be supported.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> It was also argued that the polygraph evidence was receivable as expert evidence. The polygraph operator, as an expert, was trained and qualified to give his opinion as to the veracity of the witness, based solely on his interpretation of the significance of the responses made by the witness to the questions put on the examination.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Here, the sole issue upon which the polygraph evidence is adduced is the credibility of the accused, an issue well within the experience of judges and juries and one in which no expert evidence is required.

It wouldn't be the focus of the video, but it would be a passing part of the video. I'm wondering about the ability to monetize such content.\n\nAs for why I'm curious about this, I've recently been thinking about starting a youtube channel. I have no delusions of grandeur, and I don't want to be presumptuous, but it serves to be prepared. I tend to whistle, and without trying to sound cocky, I'm quite good at whistling music. The channel would be man\\-cave workshop type content, among other things, and I would like to include bits where you can hear me whistling or singing along with the music that I'm listening to (the video music would be non\\-copyrighted, but I would quiet it to hear the whistling or singing). It would be short snippets, no more than 5 or 10 seconds, and you wouldn't hear the music that I'm hearing because I use headphones. If I ever got to a point where I *could* monetize my channel, would this prevent me from doing that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes it's illegal. Just like singing/whistling happy birthday in public (used to be) illegal. You could be sued for untold amount of damages that could ruin your life forever (in theory).\n\nIf you whistle a mashup remix then it's legal as long as it's different enough from the original that you can't tell that they are the same song anymore.\n\nYes anyone can sue you if you piss them off. Disney doesn't sue all the people who sing covers of their songs because it's bad for business to piss off your fans, but they can sue if they feel like it.\n\nThis is more common sense than anything else but I suggest you look into fair use copyright law since there is a lot of misconception about it.\n\n[https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair\\-use/what\\-is\\-fair\\-use/](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/what-is-fair-use/)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A YouTube content creator plans to include short snippets of themselves whistling copyrighted songs in their DIY workshop videos.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states, \"If you whistle a mashup remix then it's legal as long as it's different enough from the original that you can't tell that they are the same song anymore.\" This option provides the strongest protection against copyright infringement claims.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation clearly states that whistling copyrighted music, even in short snippets, is still illegal. The duration and absence of background music do not provide protection.\n\nOption C is a cautious approach but is not the most likely to provide protection, as it would be extremely difficult and impractical to obtain permission from all copyright holders for incidental whistling.\n\nOption D is incorrect because fair use is often misunderstood, and the educational nature of DIY content does not automatically qualify whistling copyrighted music as fair use.

The correct answer is B, to request a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) replacement. This is the most appropriate solution because:\n\n1. The individual was born on a military base in Germany, which means they would have been issued a CRBA rather than a standard birth certificate.\n2.

The answer directly addresses both the need for proof of citizenship (required for a passport) and proof of identity (required for an Oregon driver's license).\n\nOption A is incorrect because a standard German birth certificate would not be issued for a birth on a US military base and would not establish US citizenship.\n\nOption C is plausible but less likely to succeed, as DMVs typically have strict identification requirements that they cannot easily waive.\n\nOption D, while potentially a last resort, is an unnecessarily complex and time-consuming process when a more direct solution (CRBA replacement) is available.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (citizenship, documentation requirements, and specific procedures for unusual birth circumstances) and apply them to a real-world scenario.

I soon thought that there would be no technical difficulties.\n\nDetails:\n\nThe hashing algorithm is not documented outside the source code, and the only way to write a compatible code even from scratch is to find in the code:\n\n* the details of the hash function (it is a derivative of P.J Weinberger hash function)\n* the lookup function which uses that hash function and a second function to deal with conflicts\n* the method for determining the size of the hash table\n\nThe first 2 elements are in LGPL copyrighted source code, the last is in GPL copyrighted source code.\n\nEverything else is documented and can be written from scratch with no need for copyrighted material.\n\n### Problem:\n\nI would like to use the Apache Free License 2\\.1 for my own work, which is of course a free license but incompatible with both GPL and LGPL.

If you can't easily rewrite it, it's got to be sufficiently original and significant to be under copyright. Your version would be a derivative work.\n\nAs far as fair use goes, the fact that you're trying to replace the existing work in its own field is likely to doom that.

The results on [this site](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7461/can-someone-use-dna-samples-that-were-scattered-by-their-owners-for-commercial-p) seem to say (at least, to my uneducated eye) that you can't \"protect\" your DNA by copyright or patent if you abandon it (cuz trash is public property). \n\nDoes that mean that police can go through your trash once it's out of your curtilage ? [This](http://blogs.findlaw.com/blotter/2013/05/can-police-search-through-your-trash.html) site says you can file a motion to suppress any trash evidence (if within your right of privacy ?) but is there a case where the police can't get a warrant to obtain your DNA directly but can instead wait for your trash and then get it from there ? Or is every case where a warrant isn't obtainable *also* a case where trash evidence isn't allowed ?\n\nAnd what about anyone ? I can think of a few queasy things someone can do with your DNA like finding out details about you that you don't want them to know. In 2006, the UK made it illegal to sequence another person's DNA without permission. But it says [here](https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/05/11/the-dna-your-garbage-for-grabs/sU12MtVLkoypL1qu2iF6IL/story.html) that it should be a felony theft in USA but isn't ? Yet ? Are there any other countries like the UK ?\n Does it instead matter much more *what* I do with the DNA I collect or is simply intentionally owning it enough to constitute a crime ? Let's say I follow someone into a barber shop and leave with some clippings of their hair, am I doing something illegal ? I'd expect this to vary from state to state, right ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't know what you mean by \"own a person's DNA\", but analogous to owning a car or picture, you can't own a person, which is what would be required to have complete ownership of all of a person's DNA. You can legally own a sample of a person's DNA, for example by buying or bartering tissue, or if you are given tissue. If you grab a handful of hair from a person and pull it out, it is not legally yours, and you can be required to return it. If you lose, misplace or abandon tissue (or a knife), then the finder could end up owning it, depending on the circumstances. Tissue in the trash is more complicated since there may be municipal laws preventing dumpster\\-diving. Setting aside any such municipal codes, if you abandon your property, someone else can claim it. Hair on the floor of a barbershop, or in the trash, is a good example abandonment: it could also be an example of trespassing, in case the barber objects to you gathering samples from his floor.\n\nThe 4th Amendment cannot be used to secure your DNA: it could be used to *prevent* securing DNA, if the intended application is compelled blood drawing. The ruling in [Maryland v. King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_v._King) did *not* say that \"your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason\", since that was an objection to the majority ruling given in the dissent, not part of the actual ruling. Maybe that will end up being true, but that hasn't been determined to be the law yet. With a warrant, the police can take a tissue sample, and not wait for you to throw a tissue sample in the trash. They can *also* take a cheek swab from an arrestee just like they can take a photo or fingerprints (that's what Maryland v. King says).\n\nOnce we've settled the matter of obtaining a DNA sample, the concept of ownership might be relevant if a party could restrict others from using that DNA pattern. But DNA is not subject to patent or copyright, so once I know your DNA pattern, you cannot legally prevent me from using that information. However, you *might*, if I gave you a sample as part of a contract, and there is a clause in that contract that prevents the other party from ever using that information.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A private investigator is hired to gather information about a person of interest.

However, I've now come across the following [Texas Bar statement](https://www.texasbar.com/Content/NavigationMenu/LawyersGivingBack/LegalAccessDivision/ProBonoPolicyFAQ2009.pdf#page=2), which seems to **allow** public attorneys to engage in *pro bono* practice. It raises the question, \"Do legal aid staff attorneys, public defenders, and prosecutors count their work time as pro bono, since they provide free legal services to the poor?\" This is the answer (emphasis added):\n\n> No. Although the services are free to the clients, the attorneys are paid for their work at salaries they have accepted. **However, if these attorneys provide volunteer legal assistance to the poor outside their regular work, they may report those hours as pro bono service.**\n\nDoes this mean that public attorneys can engage in *pro bono* work in Texas?

I'll restate the analysis in a different way in this answer in the hope of providing greater clarity.\n\nThe key to understanding that question is that the question presented there was: \"Are DAs and other prosecutors prohibited from being defense attorneys, such as in a pro bono fashion?\" Having a prosecutor do criminal defense work presents conflicts that other types of *pro bono* work frequently would not.\n\n> Does this mean that public attorneys can engage in pro bono work in\n> Texas? If so, are there strings attached? For example, would a public\n> attorney be able to represent their friends and family so long as they\n> don't charge for the work?\n\nThese questions don't have a single global answer and must be analyzed on a case by case basis. It depends upon whether the *pro bono* work constitutes a conflict of interest with the public attorneys' regular work (i.e. what kind of legal work is done *pro bono* and for whom) and it depends upon the policies of the lawyer's particular employer.\n\nThere are two distinct questions presented, neither of which are materially different in Texas than they were in the previous question.\n\nOne is when doing so would violate the professional ethical obligations of a lawyer, which is what the Texas Bar Association statement is talking about.\n\nThe other is whether it is permissible in a manner consistent with the contractual employer\\-employee relationship of any particular Texas attorney working on a full time salaried basis for a particular employer. This is a subject upon which the Texas Bar Association statement is silent.\n\n**Professional Ethics Considerations**\n\nAs noted above, one question is whether *pro bono* work by a prosecutor in the specific subject matter of criminal defense would constitute a conflict of interest. The answer to that question is \"usually yes\" for the reasons explained in the linked question.\n\nOne can also easily imagine other circumstances where *pro bono* work could pit a salaried government lawyer against his employer, such as a state attorney general's office lawyer doing *pro bono* civil rights litigation against the state government.\n\nBut, not all *pro bono* legal work constitutes a conflict of interest.\n\nFor example, a prosecutor doing *pro bono* work helping low income people prepare documents naming legal guardians for their children in the event that they predecease their children (the very first *pro bono* case I took on as a Colorado attorney) would be very unlikely to be conflict of interest for the prosecutor, even though a *pro bono* criminal defense case in the county where the prosecutor practices would be an obvious and direct unethical conflict of interest.\n\nSimilarly, judges frequently do *pro bono* work, where authorized to do so by the court systems in which they work, in the areas of legal education for non\\-lawyers (like High School Mock Trial competitions or lectures to school students) and by providing mediation services to indigent parties outside the judicial district where they practice, that are specifically calculated to avoid conflicts of interests, or appearance of bias or impropriety.\n\n**Employment Relationship Considerations**\n\nThe second issue is whether \"public attorneys can engage in *pro bono* work in Texas?\" in a case with a subject matter that does not otherwise present a conflict of interest.\n\nPublic sector attorneys are not prohibited from doing so as a matter of professional ethics. But, that isn't the only consideration. The other consideration is whether doing that *pro bono* work violates the employment policies of a public sector employer of a lawyer in the usual case when a public sector lawyer is employed on a salaried basis for the *full efforts* or something similar, of the lawyer. This is basically an issue of contract law, not of professional ethics.\n\nThe way this is usually dealt with in private law practice when a salaried attorney works for a law firm is that the private salaried lawyer needs to obtain law firm permission to do *pro bono* work and that *pro bono* work is often structured so that the *pro bono* client's lawyer is the law firm itself and the lawyer in that firm doing the actual *pro bono* work is often just one agent of the firm as a whole that actual represents the *pro bono* client. Frequently, salaried lawyers in private law firms have quotas of billable hours which they have to meet as a condition of employment each year at the law firm, and frequently a private law firm's *pro bono* program allows the salaried lawyer to count hours working for the law firm's *pro bono* clients towards that annual billable hour quota.\n\nIncidentally, there is nothing magic in the absence of a conflict of interest, about limiting \"moonlighting work\" to unpaid *pro bono* work.\n\nFor example, many U.S. law schools expressly authorize salaried full time law professors who are admitted to the practice of law to have a paid private practice up to a certain number of hours per year as a fringe benefit in addition to the salary, akin to the common practice of allowing professors to retain for themselves textbook royalties for textbooks written while the professors were being paid a salary to do scholarly work including writing textbooks.\n\nThe *pro bono* program structure used in private law firms for their salaried employers isn't as workable for a salaried attorney working full time for a governmental employer. This is because allowing a government salaried employee to work for free for a private citizen on something that doesn't involve public business of the government would functionally be an indirect appropriation of legal salary funds from the governmental entity to the *pro bono* client without receiving authorization from the elected representatives of the government in question.\n\nSo, in the public sector, a more common arrangement would be to provide that every salaried public sector lawyer working for that government is permitted to do up to X billable hours of *pro bono* work per year for their own, personal moonlighting private practice clients as a fringe benefit of employment, much like paid time off, if it is permitted at all. And, other public sector employers, which are not so generous, simply prohibit their salaried attorney employees from doing *pro bono* work at all in order to avoid having to deal with and think about the issue.\n\nThis doesn't arise very often in the case of lawyers hired by small local governments or on a contract basis by a larger government for a particular specialized task, as they have their own practices and have not agreed to provide substantially all of their professional legal work to their employer the way that a salaried lawyer would. So they are more akin to private sector law firm lawyers who simply have an additional set of conflict of interest considerations as a result of having a particular local government as an employer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A district attorney in Texas wants to provide pro bono legal services outside of their regular work hours. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to be permissible under both professional ethics and typical employment policies?\n\nA) Representing a friend in a criminal defense case in a neighboring county\nB) Drafting wills for low-income elderly residents at a local community center\nC) Filing a civil rights lawsuit against the state government on behalf of a non-profit organization\nD) Volunteering as a public defender in the same courthouse where they normally prosecute cases\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the documentation, including professional ethics, conflicts of interest, and employment policies for public attorneys. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. Professional Ethics: Drafting wills for low-income elderly residents does not present an obvious conflict of interest with the DA's regular prosecutorial duties. Unlike criminal defense work (options A and D) or litigation against the state (option C), this type of pro bono work is unlikely to pit the attorney against their employer or create ethical conflicts.\n\n2. Employment Policies: While the documentation doesn't specify exact policies, it suggests that public attorneys may engage in pro bono work outside their regular duties if permitted by their employer. Estate planning for the elderly is a type of work that's less likely to interfere with or relate to the DA's official duties, making it more likely to be allowed under typical employment policies.\n\n3. Texas Bar Statement: The provided statement explicitly allows public attorneys to \"provide volunteer legal assistance to the poor outside their regular work\" and count it as pro bono service. This aligns well with the scenario in option B.\n\n4. Avoiding Conflicts: Options A, C, and D all present clear potential conflicts. Criminal defense work (A and D) directly conflicts with a prosecutor's role, even if in a different county. Suing the state government (C) would likely be seen as conflicting with the DA's role as a state employee.\n\n5.

Would there be\n>  civil or criminal penalties if, some but not all, documents (like bank\n>  statements or property assessments) were accidentally lost?\n\nThere isn't enough context in this question to know.\n\nAn executor is a fiduciary who has a duty to account, so if the fiduciary can not provide a report that tells where all of the assets of the estate went, the fiduciary is deemed to have converted the assets unaccounted for and this could even give rise to theft charges.\n\nBut, losing supporting documents for an accounting, particularly documents like bank statements and property assessments which can be recreated from third\\-party sources is neither a crime nor a tort. No one is harmed because they are lost.\n\nA fiduciary has a duty to keep beneficiaries informed of what happened in an estate, not to preserve records supporting those communications *per se*. \n\nAlso, in the probate process, it isn't uncommon for interim accountings to be filed quarterly or annually before the estate is officially closed. And, in many states, when an executor files an interim accounting it can often be contested for only a short time period after it is filed (frequently a matter of weeks or a few months). So, a lack of supporting documentation would only be legally relevant to the time period since the last interim accounting in many cases.\n\nFurther, frequently in a probate estate, to receive a distribution without a court order, a beneficiary will sign a waiver of all liability of the executor and the estate arising prior to the distribution. So, if there are multiple distributions made in a probate estate, only acts since the last waiver was signed could be contested.\n\nSimilarly, if losing documents that help prove that the executor is innocent of improper action makes it harder for the executor to defend himself or herself or itself against claims that the executor acted improperly, the executor may have a harder time defending against those claims.\n\nBut, losing relevant documents during the course of a contested litigation or in anticipation of contested litigation is only sanctionable as spoliation of evidence if the impact on the litigation is material because there is no other source of the evidence, and is intentional.\n\nAlso, with narrow exceptions, usually involving physical injury, accidents don't give rise to criminal liability (which is usually based on reckless or intentional acts).\n\nCivil liability almost never arises unless someone is actually economically or physically harmed by an act.\n\nNow, if the executor lost a \"real\" document like a live check that for some reason can't be reissued due, or a bearer bond that is subsequently sold by a unknown person who finds it to a bona fide purchaser for value, resulting in an economic loss to the estate, and this loss is due to negligence, the executor is legally responsible for indemnifying the estate from this harm. \n\nBut, this would not apply in a case where the document is mere evidence of a legal obligation rather than embodying the legal obligation, or having intrinsic value (e.g. if the document was an original copy of the Declaration of Independence), unless the loss of the document was negligent and losing it causes physical or economic harm (which would rarely be the case).\n\nAs a concluding caveat, it bears mentioning that the relevant parts of the criminal law are predominantly a matter of state law, and that probate law is almost entirely state law, so the law is not perfectly uniform within the United States on this issue.

Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An individual receives an unexpected bank transfer of $50,000 followed by a brief phone call where the sender claims the money is payment for an illegal act. The sender immediately blocks all communication. Given this scenario, what is the most likely legal outcome for the recipient?\n\nA) The recipient will be charged as an accomplice to the illegal act\nB) The recipient can keep the money without legal consequences\nC) The recipient will face a civil lawsuit for the return of funds\nD) The recipient will be temporarily investigated but likely cleared of wrongdoing\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario presents a complex legal situation that requires analysis of multiple factors. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Lack of criminal intent: The recipient has no prior knowledge or agreement to participate in any illegal activity. Mere receipt of funds and a one-sided claim do not constitute criminal conspiracy or intent.\n\n2. Investigative process: Law enforcement would likely investigate the recipient due to the suspicious transfer and claim. This would involve questioning and possibly a search warrant, but without corroborating evidence of criminal activity, the investigation would likely be concluded without charges.\n\n3. Hearsay evidence: The phone call claim is hearsay and insufficient to prove criminal involvement without additional evidence.\n\n4. Burden of proof: In criminal cases, the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. With only a transfer and an unsubstantiated claim, this burden would not be met.\n\n5. Civil vs. Criminal: While the recipient might face a civil lawsuit for the return of funds (option C), this is separate from criminal proceedings and doesn't preclude being cleared of criminal wrongdoing.\n\n6. Unenforceable contract: The claimed \"agreement\" for illegal activities would be unenforceable in court, complicating any attempt to reclaim the funds.\n\nOption A is incorrect because being an unwitting recipient doesn't make one an accomplice. Option B oversimplifies the situation, as there could be tax implications or civil proceedings. Option C, while possible, doesn't address the criminal investigation aspect central to the scenario.\n\nThis question requires integration of legal concepts including criminal intent, evidentiary standards, and the distinction between civil and criminal proceedings, testing critical thinking about real-world legal scenarios."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78563/first-criminal-court-trial-with-dna-evidence-idaho", "docs_id": 78563, "title": "First criminal court trial with DNA evidence Idaho", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **I'm wondering what was the first Idaho criminal court trial that admitted DNA evidence and led to defendant's conviction?**\n\nThe only thing I found is the following but the defendant pleaded guilty in that case.\n\nState of Idaho v. Horsley;\nMay 1988;\nDNA evidence admitted in rape case. Defendant convicted.\n(LifeCodes)\n\nThank you!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *State v. Todd Horsley*, 117 Idaho 920, 792 P.2d 945 (Idaho 1990\\) is the first reported appellate case in Idaho involving DNA evidence (which was only a conditional plea bargain, reserving the appellate issue of the admissibility of the DNA evidence). The trial court judge was James R. Michaud in a trial in Bonner County. The conditional plea was entered sometime between February 8, 1988 and May 10, 1988, followed by an appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court argued on April 5, 1989 (the opinion contains a typo that in one instance states that the oral argument was on April 5, 1988 rather than April 5, 1989\\). The ruling was delayed due to the death of one of the justices who heard the oral argument and the resignation of another justice who heard to oral argument. The ruling was deferred until those two vacancies were filled and was made by the full reconstituted court on the basis of the briefing and a recording of the oral argument that was conducted on April 5, 1989\\.\n\nAnother early appellate case involving a plea bargain was *State of Idaho v. Roy R. Garcia*, 126 Idaho 836, 892 P.2d 903 (Idaho App. 1995\\). This case was charged as a rape case with DNA evidence, but downgraded to a battery conviction in connection with a plea bargain entered mid\\-trial during a trial commenced on October 12, 1993 after two previous continuances were granted on speedy trial grounds. The court of appeals held that the speed trial objection was waived by the plea bargain.\n\nThe first reported appellate case involving DNA evidence where the defendant was convicted following an evidentiary trial on the merits (in this case to a jury) was *State of Idaho v. Gene Allen Faught*, 127 Idaho 873, 908 P.2d 566 (Idaho 1995\\). The jury trial took place in March of 1994 and involved the defendant's alleged rape of his fourteen year old step\\-daughter (a conviction affirmed on appeal with the admission of the DNA evidence upheld as proper). The trial court judge was Judge George D. Carey presiding over a trial in Ada County.\n\nThe underlying trial in the appellate case *State of Idaho v. Robert Andrew Amerson*, 129 Idaho 395, 925 P.2d 399 (Idaho App. 1996\\), however, commenced September 13, 1993 in Lincoln County before Judge Phillip M. Becker, and resulted in a conviction for the crimes of rape and robbery. The convictions were affirmed although the sentence was modified on appeal. This conviction took place in the trial court about six months before the conviction in *Fraught*.\n\nIt is possible that there was an earlier case than either of these two cases in Idaho that did not result in an appeal because the defendant did not appeal the conviction. There is no good database with that kind of information, other than media reports. Unreported appellate decisions are also not always available. But given the novelty of DNA evidence at the time, the severity of the kind of charges typically proven with DNA evidence in its early days, and the right of a defendant to an appeal at state expense on a novel legal issue, it is fairly unlikely that the appellate cases listed overlook a trial court conviction following a trial that was based upon DNA evidence in Idaho.\n\nI included the full name of the defendant in these cases and other information not customarily mentioned in a summarized case report or citation in order to assist in the search for additional media reports, even though customary citation practice is to include only the surname of the defendant in the citation. It is possible that media reports from one of these earlier cases might allude to earlier cases where there was a conviction that was not appealed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A legal researcher is studying the history of DNA evidence admissibility in Idaho criminal trials.

Rickstarter charges and holds funds in an account to distribute if the backer hits the 100k threshold, they fully refund in the case of the not hitting the milestone. \n\nLet's say by New Years the fund has 50k in it's account. \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. How would taxes be resolved if the funds are distributed for a successful campaign (say 5% cut for Rickstarter if we need specific metrics) before they file in April?\n2. How would taxes be resolved if the funds are refunded for a failed campaign before they file in April?\n3. How would taxes be resolved if they filed in February before it became clear either way what was happening with the funds?\n\nBy my understanding taxes are based on the prior year so I'm quite confused who exactly owns (and owes) what here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note: I do not know the internal mechanics of Kickstarter (some comment states that it does not work as explained), so I will work on Rickstarter description by the OP.\n\nThe funds are managed and held by Rickstarter but they are not owned by Rickstarter; it works as a scrow service.\n\nFor each $1 of cash directed to funding a project Rickstarter accrues an obligation (either towards the donor or the project to be funded)1 of exactly $1; in the books there is neither profit nor loss. At some point of time RS will get its cut from that $1\\.\n\nIt is similar to getting a $100\\.000 loan from a bank: you are not any richer because with the money comes the obligation to pay it back.\n\nA point of interest is *when Rickstarter gets its profits*. The basic rule is that Rickstarter can only put into the books its income when it has earned it and can be reasonably sure to get the money.\n\nFor example, Rickstarter could stablish in its service terms that it gets a 5% rate from any donation, and in this case it could be reasonable to consider a 5% of any received money to count towards the profits immediately. If there were a time for the investor to retreat his money without penalties, then the profits should only be accounted after that period. Or Rickstarter could apply a 5% rate to the money directed at projects that get enough funds, and in that case it could only write his profits in the book the moment the project gets that limit. In case that Rickstarter allowed people just to pledge the money, it would be unwise to count the profits before people had actually paid the money....3\n\nNow, direct taxes4 on business are almost always directly linked to profits, not to the size of assets, so Rickstarter's taxes would be linked to its cut of the money (minus all expenses, of course) and not related to the size of assets that it keeps in scrow.\n\nA different (and a lot more complicated) issue would come from regulatory obligations: there could be laws mandating that if Rickstarter manages more than $X assets then it has to start making audits and comply with other rules. But, while following those rules can have a cost, that would not make them \"taxes\".\n\n1The specific details of which kind of account would be convenient to reflect this obligation is beyond my knowledge of accounting.\n\n2Here [the prudence concept](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-the-prudence-concept-in-accounting.html) comes into play, you cannot consider that you got your cut until you are reasonably sure that you have earned it.\n\n3This can become very complex. For example, in the case of a pledge RS would probably write as an asset \"the $1000 SJuan76 owes us\", but at the same time if there are doubts about SJuan76 ability or willingness to pay it should also anotate a liability of \"the $1000 (or $500\\) SJuan76 might default\" so it would not be count (at least totally) towards profits.\n\n4There may be taxes based on activity (e.g. sales tax) or related to some assets (for example property taxes on the buildings owned by the company), but I think you are not asking about those.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about Rickstarter, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: Rickstarter, a crowdfunding platform, is holding $50,000 in its account on December 31st for a campaign aiming to raise $100,000 by April. The campaign creator files taxes in February, before the campaign's outcome is determined. Which of the following best describes the tax implications for Rickstarter and the campaign creator at this point?\n\nA) Rickstarter must report the entire $50,000 as income, while the campaign creator has no tax obligations yet\nB) The campaign creator must report $50,000 as income, minus Rickstarter's potential fee\nC) Rickstarter reports only its potential fee as accrued income, with no immediate tax implications for the creator\nD) Both Rickstarter and the campaign creator must report half of the $50,000 as tentative income\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the escrow-like nature of Rickstarter's operations and the timing of income recognition for tax purposes. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Rickstarter acts as an escrow service, holding funds that it doesn't own. The $50,000 in the account is not Rickstarter's income, but rather a liability owed either to the campaign creator or the backers.\n\n2. Rickstarter can only recognize income (and thus have tax implications) when it has earned its fee and can be reasonably sure it will receive the money. This would typically occur only when the campaign succeeds and meets its goal.\n\n3. The campaign creator has not received any funds yet, so they have no income to report at this stage. The money is still held by Rickstarter and could potentially be refunded to backers if the campaign fails.\n\n4. Even though taxes are generally based on the prior year, income is typically recognized when it's earned or received, not when it's in escrow or potentially earnable.\n\n5. The prudence concept in accounting suggests that Rickstarter might accrue a portion of its potential fee as income, based on the likelihood of the campaign succeeding, but this would only apply to its fee, not the entire fund amount.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of income recognition, escrow accounts, and the timing of tax obligations in a complex, real-world scenario.

I take it you mean that you are not personally acquainted with the other party, but you did somehow acquire his code, and then you used it in your own work.\n\nThis is copyright infringement, and you can easily get sued. Anytime you copy someone else's code without their permission, you have infringed their copyright. It is not a defense that you didn't know they you're required to have permission, and it is not a defense that you changed the code (since copyright is about copying, not verbatim copying). It would be particularly difficult to maintain that you didn't know that permission is required since you say that their code has a license. (If your code has no license, that means nobody other than yourself can legally use it).\n\nOn the off chance that you did not actually mean to say that you used their code, and you meant to say that you accidentally or coincidentally wrote similar\\-looking code, then the legal question is more complicated (essentially unanswerable in a useful way, at least here). One way to establish violation of copyright law is to prove actual copying (eyewitness accounts, confessions, etc.). Alternatively, the fact\\-finders (jury or judge) would have to look at the degree of similarity between the works, to determine whether the similarity is so great that it could not be coincidence or functionally necessary. For example, all examples of bubble sort have a certain necessary similarity. All music with a certain genre is somewhat similar, given the nature of the genre. You would then need to hire an attorney (one experienced in software copyright and substantial similarity doctrines) to assess the particular facts.

The question states that the developer \"unknowingly incorporated portions of the competitor's licensed code,\" which is a direct violation of copyright law. As explained in the documentation, copyright infringement occurs whenever someone copies another's code without permission, regardless of whether they knew permission was required. The presence of a license on the competitor's code makes it even more difficult to claim ignorance. \n\nOption A is incorrect because market competition alone doesn't typically present a legal issue. Option B presents a lower risk because independent creation of similar code is not necessarily copyright infringement, though it could potentially lead to a legal challenge based on substantial similarity.

Companies are legally allowed to retain certain information, including payment data, for legitimate business purposes such as processing refunds or defending against chargebacks, even after a customer has attempted to remove their payment information from a user-facing portal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while data protection laws do exist, they typically allow for reasonable retention of data for legitimate business purposes. Option C is a distractor that focuses on the user interface rather than the underlying legal principles. Option D is too extreme, as the company's actions, while potentially frustrating for the customer, are not necessarily illegal if done for legitimate business reasons.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple ideas from the documentation and critical thinking about the balance between consumer expectations and business practices in data retention."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41650/impersonation-promoting-contents-to-make-it-look-like-its-coming-from-someone", "docs_id": 41650, "title": "Impersonation - promoting contents to make it look like it&#39;s coming from someone else", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We have 2 people, person A and person B.\n\nLet's say person A decides to fabricate contents and made it look like it came from person B and promoted it to anyone and everyone.\n\nPerson A made it look to where person B was writing about himself, his family, friends, and others and has caused discord among everyone.

In this situation, person B will need to prove *actual malice* only if person A can reasonably advance the defense of *qualified privilege* (which is unlikely in the situation you describe) or if person B is a public figure.\n\nOther claims such as *tortious interference with relations* derive from *defamation*, and thus they are treated as a claim of defamation.\n\n> Would impersonating someone with the purpose of trashing someone's name and promoting it be enough to pursue something more than a civil case?\n\nImpersonation with *intent to deceive* others as to someone's identity is a crime (regardless of the propensity \\-\\-in each jurisdiction\\-\\- to prosecute it).\n\nThat being said, there is an important distinction between \"*intent or reasonable effect of deceiving*\" and *parody*. The latter usually is obvious enough in that it does not attempt to mislead others as to the source or authorship of statements. Was person A's impersonation of B a parody that made truthful but uncomfortable disclosures?\n\nIn the case of parody, what matters is whether the *import* is defamatory. For instance, in the latter portion of [this post](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/2018/11/judge-carol-kuhnkes-imbecile.html), I make a parody of judge felon Carol Kuhnke, who last year endorsed a sexual harasser for judicial reelection. The parody simulates as if felon Kuhnke wrote a letter to the assistant who for years was sexually harassed by Kuhnke's judicial buddy.\n\nThe parody\\-letter obviously **does not** intend to deceive others as to its authorship: you will notice that the line preceding the parody letter presents it as a *plausible adaptation* of Kuhnke's statements in court. And several items preempt any \"defamatory import\", since \n\n* the parody mirrors Kuhnke's statements during a court hearing she presided;\n* judge Kuhnke was [busted](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/2018/04/felon-carol-kuhnke-seeks-reelection-as.html) for [illegal possession](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rKzkiiojXB8/XC5h5GQf3-I/AAAAAAAAAXg/qB-10dZ5vtMPsbIHeIOdZL5nUWQ4AvvywCLcBGAs/s1600/certif_JD.jpg) of drugs in year 2016;\n* Kuhnke endorsed her colleague Gregg Iddings in 2018 despite him having gotten suspended by the Michigan Supreme Court for sexually harassing his secretary; and\n* Kuhnke's [campaign endorsement](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9zhvLifOcVw/W_VkreP5IzI/AAAAAAAAAWI/vcxqJkttmucdOR6q8m10Phjpr6g_fOgOwCLcBGAs/s1600/iddings2.jpg) of a sexual harasser is quite at odds with Kuhnke's [campaign babbling](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Du5wvZHMmsU/W_VkyhkmlGI/AAAAAAAAAWM/2uYO6tWPq1QK7QV52KZZ4a6iknZcmaAbwCLcBGAs/s1600/iddings4.jpg) on how \"*it's important that a woman's voice be heard in all of the matters of society*\".\n\nThus, merging all these facts (with their sources) to substantiate the parody simply leaves no room for claims of defamation. Except for the form (letter), the substance is true and therefore does not carry an actionable defamatory import.\n\nSimilarly, another parody is a simulation of [judge Larsen's letter](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/2018/07/larsen-in-scotus-big-no-no.html) to three innocent siblings after she favored the judge who in year 2015 were yelled at, extorted, and jailed them for 17 days.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications and potential courses of action for Person B?\n\nA) Person B can only pursue a civil lawsuit for defamation, as impersonation without financial gain is not a criminal offense.\n\nB) Person B must prove actual financial losses to have a viable defamation claim, regardless of the severity of the false statements.\n\nC) Person B likely has a strong case for defamation per se, and may also pursue criminal charges for impersonation with intent to deceive.\n\nD) Person B's case depends entirely on whether Person A's actions can be classified as parody, which would be protected speech.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves multiple legal concepts and potential actions. Person B likely has a strong case for defamation per se, given the severity of the false statements and their impact on B's personal and professional life. In cases of defamation per se, which includes false accusations of moral turpitude or severe misconduct, B is not required to prove actual damages. \n\nAdditionally, the documentation states that impersonation with \"intent to deceive\" others as to someone's identity is a crime, regardless of financial motives.

The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced reality of most jurisdictions:\n\n1. While it's often illegal to ask about protected characteristics during job interviews, many jurisdictions allow or even encourage employers to collect diversity data post-hiring for legitimate business purposes, such as complying with equal employment opportunity regulations or improving diversity initiatives.\n\n2. However, this data collection is typically subject to privacy laws. In many countries (e.g., under GDPR in the EU or various state laws in the US), employees have the right to access personal data held by their employer and request corrections if the information is inaccurate.\n\n3. The company's ability to share this data is usually restricted. While aggregated, anonymized data might be shared internally or externally for diversity reporting, sharing individual-level data would likely violate privacy laws in most jurisdictions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while there are restrictions, collecting such data post-employment is not universally illegal.

Goldwater won the suit, although he got much less than he sought. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict, finding that the \"actual malice\" standard had been clearly met.

A quitclaim deed does not convey after\\-acquired property except when an exception to the general rule applies.\n\nA bargain and sale deed conveys what is described with a promise that the person executing the deed had not encumbered (e.g. mortgaged) or sold the property at any time after it came to be titled in their name that are not described in the deed, but does not promise that the person that they obtained the property from had good title or that their title was free of liens or encumbrances. A bargain and sale deed preserves title insurance policy protections from the previous owner, while a quitclaim deed does not. I don't know what affect a bargain and sale deed has with respect to after\\-acquired property.\n\nWarranty deeds are not normally used for this purpose. Warranty deeds are normally used in arms\\-length sales for fair market value between unrelated parties and are normally processed by title insurance companies who insure the buyer and anyone financing the buyer's purchase of the property with a mortgage against the possibility that the seller didn't have good title to the property sold or had undisclosed liens or encumbrances. A warranty deed contains a promise that the seller owns all real property described in the deed subject only to the liens and encumbrances stated in the deed. A warranty deed also conveys after\\-acquired property.\n\n### ACRIS\n\nYou [don't have to use the ACRIS system](https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-recording-documents.page).

They have prepared a warranty deed for the transfer. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the best practice for this transaction based on the information provided?\n\nA) They should proceed with filing the warranty deed through ACRIS, as it provides the strongest guarantees for the transfer\nB) They should use a quitclaim deed instead, file it in person at the city office, and only submit the RP-5217NYC and TP-584 forms\nC) They should use a bargain and sale deed, file through ACRIS, and include a detailed LLC member list due to recent legislative changes\nD) They should use a quitclaim deed, file through ACRIS, and include Form TP-584 with Schedule F for \"Mere change of form of ownership\"\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires integrating multiple concepts from the documentation and applying them to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is D for the following reasons:\n\n1. A quitclaim deed is more appropriate than a warranty deed for this type of related-party transfer to an LLC, as mentioned in the documentation.\n\n2. While filing in person is an option, the documentation indicates that the transfer was completed using ACRIS, suggesting it's a viable and potentially more efficient method.\n\n3. The TP-584 form is specifically mentioned as necessary, with Schedule F being crucial for indicating a \"Mere change of form of ownership,\" which applies to this scenario where the property is being transferred to an LLC owned by the same individuals.\n\n4. The recent legislative changes (effective September 13, 2019) require disclosure of LLC ownership for residential properties with one to four family dwelling units. This information would be included on a separate page behind the TP-584.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a warranty deed is not typically used for this type of transfer. Option B is partially correct but misses the importance of using ACRIS and the specific Schedule F requirement. Option C incorrectly suggests using a bargain and sale deed, which is less common for this type of transfer than a quitclaim deed.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze the situation, apply the correct legal concepts, and identify the most appropriate procedure given the specific circumstances of the property transfer."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67353/what-legal-recourse-do-citizens-have-when-law-enforcement-refuse-to-address-crim", "docs_id": 67353, "title": "What legal recourse do citizens have when law enforcement refuse to address crimes for political reasons?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is a bit of follow\\-up [to this situation](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48451/is-it-legal-for-a-district-attorney-to-choose-a-policy-to-not-prosecute-certain), although the question is different and things got much worse.\n\nAccording to [a recent poll](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/40-san-francisco-residents-plan-200200119.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAC24TmFvWz2WEm8TUWqwVdgTYf9RWV0DsHVFHE7YF4xE9-tc7pL5QDHUPuZFbQKhSzI-KC0qtaxR9qUL5ihrXnArOKq-IDSX94aZWMewvXjEmxIZPzBEyFFItOYP0E6yS_eKJYwbmvs-5SouuMak1zEWdKfr9-JIltnv1mn4ZMVR#:%7E:text=Washington%20Examiner-,40%25%20of%20San%20Francisco%20residents%20plan%20to%20leave,to%20quality%20of%20life%3A%20Poll&text=The%20poll%20of%20500%20San,in%20the%20next%20few%20years.), 40% of San Francisco residents are considering moving out of the city.

This is the most direct and legally sound method for residents to change prosecutorial policies they disagree with.\n\nOption D is incorrect because suing the city for damages would likely fail.

The dictates of the constitution itself.\n2. The will of the people.\n\nThe first one, however, has only the force that each branch and its constituent members give it. If the Executive branch collectively decides to selectively (or wholly) ignore the constitutional dictates of the judicial branch (as in your case), then the constitution itself has no force to stop the Executive branch. The branches willfully imposing upon themselves the dictates of the constitution, even when it seems inconvenient or undesirable, falls under the concept of \"respect for the rule of law\". The belief being that it is better to be guided by (democratic) laws and constitutions than to allow particular governments or individuals to dictate things according to their whims. Otherwise we end up with things like dictatorships, which have historically proven themselves to be undesirable for all but the few people in power (and even they sometimes meet an awful end).\n\nThis then pulls us into the second point, which is the will of the people. If one branch of a (democratic) government starts ignoring and disrespecting the rule of law, it then falls to the people to make them pay the consequences: demand rectifying legislation or other measures, elect new officials, recall existing ones, engage in protests, and in extreme situations outright rebellion. Of course, if the people by and large don't mind what's happening, or have too little power to effect change, then the offending branch can continue to do as it pleases. \n\nChina, for example, is considered by many, including its own people, to have a corrupt government. But the people are either too powerless or too unwilling to stop it. Keep in mind that before the current style of government the country was under significant duress from overpopulation, including widespread food shortages, and economic underdevelopment. This rendered many of the people desperate and willing to accept a certain degree of corruption and non\\-democratic rule provided the government solved and prevented such problems; it also led them to essentially accept the [One Child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy).

The correct answer, D, reflects the most nuanced and legally sound approach.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the specific nature of the case and the potential relevance of livestock-related precedents.

It prioritizes relevant case law, which is a primary source of legal precedent.\n2. It allows for consideration of cases from other jurisdictions, which is common practice when local precedent is lacking.\n3. It permits the use of biblical references, but only as supplementary context for historical legal principles, not as primary precedent.\n\nThis approach aligns with the example in Banks v.

This argument aligns with the information provided that the clause was \"buried deep in the lease agreement\" and that the tenant and their agent \"do not recall this clause in the earlier drafts.\" \n\nOption A (mutual mistake) is less likely to succeed because the landlord's actions suggest they were aware of the clause, making it difficult to argue it was a mutual error.\n\nOption C (violation of the parol evidence rule) is incorrect because, as stated in the documentation, the parol evidence rule typically makes written agreements supersede verbal ones, not hold them as equally valid.\n\nOption D (unconscionability) is a weaker argument because, while the clause may seem unfair, it's not necessarily so egregious as to be deemed unconscionable, especially in a commercial context.\n\nThe fraudulent inducement argument (B) targets the potential deception in the contract formation process, which is described as the \"best defense\" in the documentation.

The correct answer is D, based on the information provided in the documentation. In New South Wales (and likely other jurisdictions with similar laws), there is a legal presumption that a blood alcohol reading taken within 2 hours of the offense reflects the level at the time of the offense. This law was specifically implemented to address scenarios like the one described in the question.\n\nThe driver's attempt to avoid a DUI charge by consuming alcohol after the crash would not be successful. Instead, it would likely make the situation worse for them. Option A is incorrect because the law doesn't require proof of intoxication at the exact moment of driving. Option B is partially correct but doesn't capture the legal reasoning behind the conviction. Option C is incorrect because while the driver's actions might be considered obstructive, the primary charge would still be DUI based on the test results.\n\nThis question challenges test-takers to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, consider the intent behind laws, and understand how evidence is interpreted in DUI cases.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The contract is void because Alice signed a document with Bob's name on it, constituting a clear case of mistaken identity.\n\nB) The contract is likely enforceable against Alice under the principle of apparent authority, as she knowingly signed the agreement despite the name discrepancy.\n\nC) The contract is only enforceable against Bob, as his name appears on the document, regardless of who actually signed it.\n\nD) The contract is unenforceable due to the combination of incorrect name and digital signature method, failing to meet formal contract requirements.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex legal principles, primarily apparent authority and unilateral mistake. The most likely outcome is that the contract would be enforceable against Alice (option B) for the following reasons:\n\n1. Apparent Authority: By signing the document, Alice created an appearance of authority to act on behalf of the named party (Bob). A reasonable person in the supplier's position could believe Alice had the authority to sign, especially given that she didn't raise any objections about the name discrepancy.\n\n2. Intention to Contract: Alice's act of signing demonstrates a clear intention to enter into the agreement, despite the incorrect name. This intention is a crucial element in contract formation.\n\n3. Digital Signature Validity: As referenced in the linked question about iPad signatures, digital signatures (including finger squiggles) can be legally binding if they represent the signer's intent to agree to the contract terms.\n\n4. Difficulty of Proving Mistaken Identity: While option A mentions mistaken identity, this would be extremely difficult to prove in this case. For a mistaken identity claim to void the contract, the supplier would need to show they specifically intended to only contract with Bob and took steps to verify Alice was Bob, which is unlikely in this scenario.\n\n5. Personal Responsibility: Option C is incorrect because the signature, not just the printed name, is a key factor in determining who is bound by the contract. Alice's act of signing makes her personally responsible, regardless of whose name is printed.\n\n6.

There are 11 jurors remaining, which is more than the minimum of 8 required for trials longer than 2 months.\n\nGiven these factors, the trial can continue as long as the court is satisfied that there will not be a substantial miscarriage of justice. The fact that the jury had already reached a verdict (though not yet delivered) suggests that continuing the trial with 11 jurors would likely not cause a miscarriage of justice.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple pieces of information from the legislation, apply it to a specific scenario, and understand the nuances of jury proceedings in criminal trials.

Why is this done?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several reasons to verify a complaint (i.e. to swear that its factual allegation are true).\n\n**1\\. This is required for certain kinds of claims in certain jurisdictions as a matter of statute or court rule, which vary widely.**\n\nFor example, in Colorado, a \"replevin claim\" (i.e. a claim for expedited recovery of possession of specific tangible personal property) must be verified, and the object will be repossessed by force under court order if a timely response is not filed, often in a matter of a week or two, when the lack of a response could be due to reasons other than a lack of a good defense to the seizure.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is required when the relief requested is extraordinary relative to an ordinary lawsuit to collect an unpaid bill or recover damages from an injury in an accident, but requirements vary considerably from one jurisdiction to another.\n\nHistorically, at least, there have been jurisdictions in which all complaints must be verified, and there are other jurisdictions where it is almost never required.\n\n**2\\. The lawyer wants to insulate himself from liability.**\n\nA lawyer is required to exercise due diligence to confirm that the facts in documents filed with a court are true. Normally, a lawyer is entitled to simply rely on the fact that this lawyer's clients are telling the truth. But, if the client is sketchy, it is hard to independently confirm the facts, or the facts alleged seem extraordinary, the lawyer can be mostly insulated from liability for sanction for filing a complaint that lacks a factual basis by having a client swear to the fact under penalty of perjury.\n\n**3\\. A motion for summary judgment is likely.**\n\nIn most U.S. jurisdictions, if a party defending a claim provides a factually detailed affidavit in support of a motion to dismiss a case because the facts alleged in the complaint are not true, the claim against that party will be dismissed unless the party bringing the claim files a response to the motion for summary judgment supported by a factually detailed affidavit disputing the facts alleged in the defending party's affidavit on material issues that creates a \"disputed issue of fact\" that must be resolved in an evidentiary hearing or trial by a judge or jury.\n\nIf the initial complaint contains factually detailed assertions in support of its allegations that are verified, i.e. sworn it as if by an affidavit, then that route to ending the case prematurely with a motion for summary judgment is largely thwarted.

Which strategy would best address both of these concerns while complying with legal requirements?\n\nA) File an unverified complaint and attach a separate affidavit from the client detailing the fraud allegations\nB) File a verified complaint with detailed factual assertions sworn to by the client under penalty of perjury\nC) File an unverified complaint and request a pre-trial conference to present evidence informally\nD) File a verified complaint containing only general allegations, saving detailed facts for discovery\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. Option B is the best strategy because:\n\n1. It addresses the liability concern: As stated in point 2 of the documentation, having the client swear to the facts under penalty of perjury can insulate the lawyer from liability for sanctions if the complaint later turns out to lack a factual basis.\n\n2.

It is evident that the school setting requires some easing of the restrictions to which searches by public authorities are ordinarily subject. The warrant requirement, in particular, is unsuited to the school environment: requiring a teacher to obtain a warrant before searching a child suspected of an infraction of school rules (or of the criminal law) would unduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures needed in the schools.

TLO to a specific scenario. The correct answer is B because it represents an excessively intrusive search that likely violates the third criterion for reasonable searches in schools.\n\nOption A is likely permissible because school administrators only need reasonable grounds, not probable cause, to conduct a search. The mapping of security cameras could be seen as a potential security threat, providing reasonable grounds.\n\nOption C is clearly permissible as the search was conducted with parental consent, though the documentation suggests this consent may not have been necessary.\n\nOption D is a more challenging distractor. While warrantless searches of phones are generally not allowed for law enforcement, schools may have more leeway. However, this search might be considered excessively intrusive or not reasonably related to the objectives, making it potentially problematic but not as clearly violative as option B.\n\nOption B, however, clearly violates the principle that the search must not be excessively intrusive with respect to the age and sex of the child and the nature of the infraction.

Estoppel is a legal principle that can prevent a party from asserting a claim or right that contradicts what they have previously said or done. By including this phrase, the law firm is indicating that despite outlining a potential compromise, they are not committing their client to any specific course of action. This allows them to discuss possibilities while maintaining flexibility in future negotiations or legal proceedings.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a timeline of previous negotiations doesn't protect against future estoppel claims.

The Tesla detects the pedestrian, but elects to continue through the crossing without stopping (presumably because the pedestrian was not on their side of the road).\n\nVarious comments to that article state that what the Tesla did was illegal. But in my various googling attempts, I have not found any source that definitely states that the car *has* to stop. For example, the [CA DMV Drivers handbook](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/handbook/california-driver-handbook/laws-and-rules-of-the-road/) says:\n\n> When there is a pedestrian crossing a roadway with or without a\n> crosswalk, you must use caution, reduce your speed, or stop to allow\n> the pedestrian to safely finish crossing.\n\nThe use of \"or\" here seems to imply that stopping is optional (of course I assume that means only if you have taken due care/caution)\n\nBut some of the commentators quote this from the same DMV handbook:\n\n> Pedestrians have the right\\-of\\-way in marked or unmarked crosswalks. If\n> there is a limit line before the crosswalk, stop at the limit line and\n> allow pedestrians to cross the street.\n\nAnd take it to imply that the Tesla should have stopped because the crossing does have a \"limit line\".\n\nMy question is pretty simple.

I know that in other jurisdictions in the US and in other countries there may be other definitions of legality \\- which does make producing generic software for an automated car rather complex.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am aware of a view of the California law that if a pedestrian looks like they might want to cross the street, any car must stop, but this is not supported by the law, which is about \"yielding\". The law incorporates both \"yield\" and \"stop\", the former being \"and allow the other person to proceed\".\nIgnoring the photo for a moment, the requirement to yield (not stop) allows a car to continue driving when the driver is e.g. 10 ft from the crosswalk and the pedestrian is three lanes over when they enter the crosswalk, remaining in compliance with the law. The pedestrian and the driven can continue with their journey because there is no conflict.\n\nThe requirement to yield states whose right to proceed is subordinated to the other person's, in case of conflict. Turning to the video which shows what is in front but not behind, it is evident that the vehicle did not actually conflict with the pedestrian, who did not slow down in order to let the vehicle pass. The violation of social conventions is clear, in that the pedestrian enters the crosswalk while the car is 5 or so car lengths back, and can safely slow down so that there would be zero chance of hitting the pedestrian (it starts to slow but only trivially one the pedestrian is visibly 'crossing the street').

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. California law uses the term \"yield\" rather than mandating stopping in all cases. The top answer clarifies that \"yielding\" means \"allow the other person to proceed\" and doesn't always require stopping.\n\n2. The law doesn't specify exact distances or timing for when yielding is required, leaving room for interpretation.\n\n3.

So, usually I just paste a scanned image of my signature into the signature block of the form, then send the file without ever having to go through the print/scan cycle.\n\nHowever, I recently did this with a stack of forms where the receiving party apparently noticed that all my signatures were identical and deduced that I used a digitized signature instead of manually signing the forms. They rejected the forms saying that they needed \"original\" signatures. I pointed out that the signature becomes digital when I scan the form anyway, but they insisted that I manually sign, then scan, then email the forms. All illogicality aside, is there any legal reason for this policy?\n\nBTW, this is in the United States, though I imagine if there is a legal principle behind this that it would be fairly universal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Digital signatures are sometimes allowed in the U.S., but, when they are allowed, they are allowed only in the context of a fairly specific statutory procedure for doing so.\n\nPart of the idea of a manual signature is that a human being manually writing something creates an original document that can be pulled out if necessary and has some rather distinctive aspects to it that can be examined to see if the signature is a forgery. But, in contrast, when you cut and paste a signature into a document, there is no way to know if the person doing the cutting and the pasting is really the person identified in the signature, even after the fact with forensic expert attention.\n\nAnother part of the idea of a manual signature is that the physical act of putting a pen in your hand and putting it on a physical piece of paper is a time honored and traditional way of symbolically giving assent to what it on the paper. This physical act *is* what legally constitutes your consent. Indeed, it isn't even terribly important for this aspect of the idea that it be your name. The practice of having illiterate people write an \"X\" on a signature line with the intent that they will be bound is used for this same purpose, even though it is probably not identifiable forensically (although it rules out a signature by a literate person). Tapping keys on a keyboard that cause a copy of a signature to appear in a document is arguably not distinct enough from other kinds of keyboard use to make it stand out from the other actions of a person to make it a distinctively symbolic act of assent in the way that a manual signature is distinct from simply typing or writing prose.\n\nIndeed, the importance of this manual signing activity in conferring the significance of important legal actions is memorialized in a group of statutes collectively known as the \"statute of frauds\" which says that certain kinds of legal acts are only legally effective if they are in writing and \"signed\" by the party against whom the document will be enforced. A cut and paste of a signature, even if authorized by the person whose signature it purports to be, doesn't count as a signature for statute of frauds purposes, unless legislation specifically authorizes that and the legislation that does so has limitations and safeguards built into it.\n\nThe important part is not that it is digitized \\-\\- photocopies and electronic reproductions (such as scanning and faxing) are often allowed in lieu of originals. The important part is that the signer engaged in a distinctive, individualized symbolic act to authorize the matters set forth in a document by the conventional manual means or a statutorily approved alternative.\n\nOf course, cutting and pasting scanned signatures is a very new thing under the sun. Mimeographs were expensive and were not considered individualized assent signatures either. Before that, the recognized and valid alternative to a manual signature was a seal, often in wax. But, seals fell out of favor before they were replaced with digital cutting and pasting.\n\nWe are still in transition. This transition is particularly hard certain documents that are \"real\" as opposed to being mere evidence of your intent, such as checks and promissory notes and wills where a photocopy is not considered to be equivalent to the original. It has been accepted practice to allow faxes of many kinds of contracts to be considered valid for 30 years or more, but allowing people to deposit a \"real\" document like a check electronically has only been possible for a few years.\n\nSooner or later, this requirement will cease. But, it will take time. Consider that for almost a thousand years, in order to validly sell real estate, the seller had to physically hand some dirt from that location to the buyer in what was called the \"livery of seizen\". A couple of hundred years ago, we finally dispensed with that tradition and let a signed and notarized deed take its place. The complete transition to digital signatures will no doubt happen sooner. But, we aren't there yet. \n\nThere are several \"uniform acts\" proposed as models for states to adopt on the subject such as the \"Uniform Computer information Transactions Act\", and the \"Uniform Electronic Transactions Act\", and the \"Uniform Electronic Transactions Act\", but these have not been more or less uniformly adopted by the states. \n\nThere is also federal legislation on this subject in the U.S. called the \"E\\-Sign Act\" (formally the \"Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act\", 15 USC \u00a7 7001 et seq.) adopted on June 30, 2000\\.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation clearly states that executors hold \"a position of extreme personal and legal trust\" typically filled by close family members, friends, or government trustees.

Option B is incorrect because a power of attorney typically ceases upon death, and would not grant the necessary authority to manage a deceased person's affairs.\n\n3.

This approach respects the fiduciary duty required of executors while allowing the company to offer its specialized digital asset management services.\n\n4.

The voices in his head also contributed to the assaults. Also, attacking a non\\-sentient entity amounts to nothing more than criminal damage (not to know the nature and quality of the act they were doing).\n\nThe determination of insanity is down to the jury, but the above does satisfy all the criteria.

But the crux of the matter is whether expert psychiatric evidence is able establish that:\n\n> They did not know what they were doing was wrong.\n\nIf they can, then the defence would presumably succeed.\n\nFor completeness: insanity, at the time of the offence, is determined by the\u00a0M'Naghten rules as laid out in [M'Naghten\u00a0\\[1843] UKHL J16](http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1843/J16.html):\n\n> In all cases of this kind the jurors ought to be told that every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved to their satisfaction: and that to establish a defence on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of commiting the act the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, **or as not to know that what he was doing was wrong.**\n\nSee also [Loake v CPS \\[2017] EWHC 2855 (Admin)](http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2017/2855.html) which includes this at the end of paragraph 60:\n\n> ...The second limb of the defence \\[*emboldened, above*] only arises where an individual who satisfies the threshold condition of a mental disorder cannot tell right from wrong to the extent of not knowing his conduct breaches the law.

The correct answer is C because the key factor in determining the success of an insanity defense in this case would be whether the defendant knew that what they were doing was wrong, which is the second limb of the M'Naghten test.\n\nOption A is incorrect because experiencing delusions alone does not automatically lead to a successful insanity defense. The defendant's understanding of the wrongfulness of their actions is crucial.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it misinterprets the requirements of the insanity defense. A mistaken belief about the victim's identity doesn't necessarily preclude a successful insanity defense if the defendant truly did not understand the wrongfulness of their actions due to their mental state.\n\nOption D is incorrect because self-defense and the insanity defense are not mutually exclusive. The defendant's perceived need for self-defense could be part of their delusional thinking, which might support an insanity defense.\n\nThe correct answer (C) focuses on the critical aspect of the insanity defense as outlined in the M'Naghten rules and reinforced in Loake v CPS [2017]: whether the defendant knew that what they were doing was wrong.

However, that path of restraints is tailored to domestic violence, so item 27 has you describe the alleged abuse:\n\n> Abuse means to intentionally or recklessly cause or attempt to cause \n>  bodily injury to you; or to place you or another person in reasonable\n>  fear of imminent serious bodily injury; or to harass, attack, strike,\n>  threaten, assault (sexually or otherwise), hit, follow, stalk, molest,\n>  keep you under surveillance, impersonate (on the Internet,\n>  electronically or otherwise), batter, telephone, or contact you; or to\n>  disturb your peace; or to destroy your personal property.\n\nNote that the description refers to destroying your personal property, not pawing through it. It's really impossible to know if the judge will exercise his discretion to include \"reasonable fear of destruction (or theft) of personal property\", since the ex\\-roommate has no further interest in the apartment.\n\nThere is an alternative path of a [harassment restraining order](http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/ch100.pdf), which does not require a defined domestic relationship (such as ex\\-roommate), where \"harassment\" is \n\n> violence or threats of violence against you, or a course of conduct\n>  that seriously alarmed, annoyed, or harassed you and caused you\n>  substantial emotional distress.

What legal action would be most appropriate and likely to succeed in protecting the tenant's privacy and property?\n\nA) File for a standard restraining order citing domestic violence\nB) Pursue a harassment restraining order\nC) Change the locks and deny the ex-roommate access\nD) Seek a temporary restraining order with a request for exclusive use of the property\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal options available and application to the specific scenario. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. A temporary restraining order with a request for exclusive use of the property (item 14 in the petition) is the most appropriate legal tool in this situation. It directly addresses the need to protect the tenant's privacy and property while acknowledging the ex-roommate's current legal right to access the apartment.\n\n2. Option A is incorrect because standard restraining orders for domestic violence typically require more severe allegations of abuse or threats, which are not explicitly present in this scenario.\n\n3. Option B, a harassment restraining order, is less likely to succeed as the definition of harassment requires \"a course of conduct that seriously alarmed, annoyed, or harassed you and caused you substantial emotional distress,\" which may be difficult to prove based on the given information.\n\n4. Option C, changing the locks, would be illegal as the ex-roommate still has a legal right to access the apartment until the lease ends.\n\nThe temporary restraining order approach (D) allows for the possibility that a judge might exercise discretion to include protection against potential theft or destruction of personal property, even though the ex-roommate no longer has a continuing interest in the apartment.

In [South Dakota v. Dole](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/483/203/), 483 U.S. 203, the issue was a federal law, the National Drinking Age law, which withheld 5% of federal funds (initially, 10% every year thereafter) from a state that did not have a minimum drinking age of at least 21\\.

The correct answer is C, compensatory damages for lost profits during the holiday season. This aligns with the top answer's explanation of \"loss of profits\" as a potential form of damages.\n\nThe answer requires integration of multiple concepts:\n1.

Both the US and the UK give *post\\-mortem* 70 years of copyright protection to authors' material. Does the answer depend on where the book was published?\n\n**Note**: this question is particularly relevant in the context of copyright defined in terms of \"end of calendar year\". This seems to be the issue in the definition of copyright protection length. For instance, see page 3 of [this document](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf) for the US, and the Notes at the end of [this page](https://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p10_duration).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright under the Berne Convention relies on the concept of \"country of origin\". This is the country where the work was first published or, for simultaneous (i.e. within 30 days) publishing the country that gives the *shortest* copyright term. While the country of origin may be disputed, particularly for works first published on the internet, every work has one, even if a court may need to decide which it is.\n\nTherefore the relevant time of death is the one in the country of origin.\n\nFor your UK/USA example, the country of origin if the works had been published simultaneously is the UK because, based on the time of death, it has the shortest copyright term: one year shorter than the USA\n\nFor a country entirely within one time zone, like the UK, this is straightforward. For countries that span multiple time zones, this will depend on the local law regarding time.\n\nFor example, the Australian *Acts Interpretation Act 1901* says:\n\n> **ACTS INTERPRETATION ACT 1901 \\- SECT 37**\n> \n> \n> **Expressions of time**\n> \n> \n> Where in an Act any reference to time occurs, such time shall, unless it is otherwise specifically stated, be deemed in each State or part of the Commonwealth to mean the legal time in that State or part of the Commonwealth.\n\nAt face value, as applied to the Copyright Act 1968 for an Australian work, this could mean that the work would have a years further protection in Western Australia than in New South Wales. However, such an interpretation would be unconstitutional as Commonwealth law must apply equally in each state and territory of the Commonwealth.\n\nWhen such a case comes up, the judge would need to hear the evidence and make a decision. We cannot speculate what that decision will be but some arguable possibilities include:\n\n* if the author died in Australia, the date in the place where they died\n* the date on their death certificate, being the *official* date\n* the date in the specific place where the work was created\n* the date of their death in Canberra, being the national capital.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: An author simultaneously publishes a book in the UK, USA, and Australia on January 1, 2000.

Assuming all three countries have a 70-year post-mortem copyright protection period, when will the copyright expire in the \"country of origin\" according to the Berne Convention?\n\nA) December 31, 2094\nB) December 31, 2095\nC) December 31, 2096\nD) It depends on a court's interpretation of Australian law\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the Berne Convention's \"country of origin\" principle, simultaneous publication rules, and the complexities of time zones in copyright law.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. The Berne Convention determines the \"country of origin\" as the country with the shortest copyright term for simultaneously published works.\n2. All three countries have 70-year post-mortem protection, so we need to examine the exact time of death in each country.\n3. The author died on January 1, 2025, in both the UK and USA, but on December 31, 2024, in Australia.\n4. Australia spans multiple time zones, which introduces complexity.\n\nDespite the ambiguity in Australian law regarding time zones, Australia would be considered the country of origin because it provides the shortest copyright term based on the date of death (December 31, 2024, vs. January 1, 2025, in the UK and USA).\n\nCopyright expiration is typically calculated to the end of the calendar year. Thus, the copyright would expire 70 years after the end of the year in which the author died.

There is an irreducible chance that no matter how clear the outcome should be that the jury will get it wrong. Based upon a review of the academic literature on wrongful convictions and inaccurate acquittals, I generally tell my clients that this is about 10%. Many people think that this is a low end estimate.\n\nAlso, sometimes a jury will acquit a defendant in a case where they think that the defendant was actually legally guilty because of extraordinary circumstances, and so the jury will disregard the law and acquit. This practice is called \"jury nullification.\"\n\nAnd, as other answers have noted, sometimes the prosecution or the judicial system screws up for reasons that are unforeseeable, after a not guilty plea, in a way that makes proving your guilt difficult or impossible.\n\nBasically, if you \"roll the dice\" there is some non\\-zero chance you will be acquitted, while if you plead guilty, there is none.\n\nAlso, sometimes court decisions will change the law in way favorable to you after the trial, and as long as your case is still on direct appeal from the conviction, you can benefit from those changes in the law, which you cannot if you simply plead guilty without any concessions.\n\nLikewise, if you are innocent and the evidence is currently strongly against you, but you wish to preserve the ability to later attack the conviction based upon future newly discovered evidence, not pleading guilty is generally necessary to preserve that option.\n\nAnother circumstance where going to trial but losing can still be worth it, is where there are extenuating circumstances that make your conduct understandable, even if it is not a legally valid defense. Getting these facts in front of the judge in a fuller fashion, as a trial can make possible, can convince the judge that while you are legally guilty, that you deserve leniency.\n\nGoing to trial typically results in a longer sentence, even without a plea bargain, however, so going forward with a hopeless trial is rarely a good move.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is facing trial for a serious offense where the evidence against them appears overwhelming.

It also demonstrates a higher level of analysis by considering future possibilities rather than just immediate outcomes.\n\nOption A, while possible, relies on an unpredictable and ethically questionable practice. Option C is a valid consideration but doesn't necessarily require a full trial to achieve. Option D, while statistically relevant (the documentation mentions a 10% inaccuracy rate), doesn't represent as strategic or nuanced an approach as option B.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze multiple factors, integrate various concepts from the documentation, and apply critical thinking to a real-world legal scenario, meeting the criteria for a high-quality, challenging question."}, "89": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64559/is-it-gdpr-compliant-to-hide-a-competition-entry-behind-a-requirement-to-sign-up", "docs_id": 64559, "title": "Is it GDPR compliant to hide a competition entry behind a requirement to sign up to a newsletter", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm looking to run a giveaway competition on my website.

The relevant statute is [here](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleI/Chapter186/Section15B). A security deposit must be deposited in a separate account (1e), a signed receipt must be given upon receipt of the deposit (2b), the deposit must go in an interest\\-bearing account with a receipt showing name and location of bank and account number provided within 30 days (3a), also note that \"Failure to comply with this paragraph shall entitle the tenant to immediate return of the security deposit\". Subsection 4 requires returning the deposit within 30 days (not \"waiting at least 30 days\", much less 30 *working* days), minus deductions for damage, specified under 4(iii) as damage *excluding* normal wear and tear (light bulbs burning out). This does not include cleaning. and \"No deduction may be made from the security deposit for any purpose other than those set forth in this section\".\n\nSubsection 6 says:\n\n> The lessor shall forfeit his right to retain any portion of the\n>  security deposit for any reason, or, in any action by a tenant to\n>  recover a security deposit, to counterclaim for any damage to the\n>  premises...\n\nand the conditions triggering that forfeiture include under (6a) failing to deposit the funds per (3\\), or (6c)\n\n> uses in any lease signed by the tenant any provision which conflicts\n>  with any provision of this section and attempts to enforce such\n>  provision or attempts to obtain from the tenant or prospective tenant\n>  a waiver of any provision of this section\n\nwhich may be the case here and (6e)\n\n> fails to return to the tenant the security deposit or balance thereof\n>  to which the tenant is entitled after deducting therefrom any sums in\n>  accordance with the provisions of this section, together with any\n>  interest thereon, within thirty days after termination of the tenancy.\n\n(\"within\" means \"after N days or less\"). \n\nSubsection 7 states that \n\n> If the lessor or his agent fails to comply with clauses (a), (d), or\n>  (e) of subsection 6, the tenant shall be awarded damages in an amount\n>  equal to three times the amount of such security deposit or balance\n>  thereof to which the tenant is entitled plus interest at the rate of\n>  five per cent from the date when such payment became due, together\n>  with court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nAnd subsection (8\\) statutorily states DaleM's point about contract terms not being above the law:\n\n> Any provision of a lease which conflicts with any provision of this\n>  section and any waiver by a tenant or prospective tenant of any\n>  provision of this section shall be deemed to be against public policy\n>  and therefore void and unenforceable.\n\nIt would be interesting to see if the Massachusetts courts interpret this as being an automatic severability clause.\n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nSecurity deposit law in Massachussets seems to be one of those cases where professional legal advice is virtually mandatory. Subsection 3a says\n\n> Any security deposit received by such lessor shall be held in a\n>  *separate*, interest\\-bearing account in a bank, located within the\n>  commonwealth *under such terms as will place such deposit beyond the\n>  claim of creditors of the lessor*, including a foreclosing mortgagee or\n>  trustee in bankruptcy, and *as will provide for its transfer to a\n>  subsequent owner of said property*\n\nAn attorney would be typically required to understand what the italicized portions mean. A reasonable interpretation would be that you have to set up an escrow bank account on behalf of the tenant. To do that, though, the tenant must cooperate to some extent (providing a Social Security number, providing acceptable ID). There is no law requiring a tenant to cooperate, which apparently puts the landlord in a legal bind.\n\nThe trick is that the statute has been interpreted \"functionally\" in [Karaa v. Kim 86 Mass. App. Ct. 714](http://masscases.com/cases/app/86/86massappct714.html) citing [Neihaus v. Maxwell 54 Mass. App. Ct. 558](http://masscases.com/cases/app/54/54massappct558.html) as simply meaning that the landlord cannot deposit the security money into their own personal bank account. In Neihaus, the landlord handed the problem over to a property management company, which had in place suitable accounting procedures so that the desiderata of being beyond the claim of creditors, being in a bank in the commonwealth, and being separate, were satisfied. In the case of Karaa, the tenants did not ever supply a Social Security number: the court ruled that the tenants action did not excuse violation of the statute, stating \"The failure of the tenants to provide a Social Security number did not preclude the Karaas from establishing a separate account in compliance with \u00a7 15B(3\\)(a)\".

Option D is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. Signing the lease allows the tenant to secure housing while preserving their legal rights. Massachusetts law (Chapter 186, Section 15B) explicitly states that lease provisions conflicting with the security deposit law are \"void and unenforceable.\"\n\n2. Documenting all interactions creates a paper trail that could be crucial in potential legal proceedings. This includes requesting (in writing) the required receipts and account information for the security deposit.\n\n3. Preparing for potential legal action while still occupying the property is strategic because:\n   a) The tenant can monitor the landlord's compliance with state law regarding the security deposit.\n   b) If violations occur, the tenant may be entitled to immediate return of the deposit or even treble damages in some cases.\n   c) The tenant maintains leverage by still being in possession of the property.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely informing the landlord doesn't protect the tenant's rights and may create unnecessary conflict.

The correct answer, C, is based on the principle that Clinic B's actions may constitute tortious interference with Clinic A's potential business relationships. \n\nClinic A has no contractual obligation to Clinic B (only the new doctor does), so A is not bound to refuse service to B's former clients (eliminating option A). The non-compete clause typically only affects the specific employee who signed it, not the entire new employer's staff (ruling out option D). \n\nWhile B seems plausible, it oversimplifies the situation. The non-compete might restrict the new doctor from treating former clients, but this doesn't necessarily mean they can treat the client without profit.\n\nOption C recognizes that Clinic B's attempt to prevent a client from freely choosing their service provider could be seen as interfering with Clinic A's potential business relationships. This goes beyond the scope of a typical non-compete agreement and could potentially lead to legal action for tortious interference, showcasing a more nuanced understanding of the legal implications in this scenario."}, "97": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23977/can-i-make-a-privacy-policy-on-my-own-for-free", "docs_id": 23977, "title": "Can I make a privacy policy on my own for free?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have the Problem that I want to start a web application which has access to the users files on dropbox and co.
