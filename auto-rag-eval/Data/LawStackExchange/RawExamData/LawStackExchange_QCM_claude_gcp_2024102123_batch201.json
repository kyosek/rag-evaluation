[This story from *The Nation*](https://www.thenation.com/article/why-is-bank-of-america-asking-clients-about-their-citizenship/) says that Bank of America is denying accounts to non\\-citizens, and arguing that it is legal because of increased risks, although there are current court challenges to this. [*Perez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A*](https://www.venable.com/lawsuit-claiming-discrimination-by-lender-on-basis-of-immigration-status-survives-dismissal-09-18-2017/) is a case now pending challenging loan denials based on immigration status. This has particularly come up in regard to DACA recipients, rather than people with LPR status. \n\nThe US \"public accommodation\" laws probably do not apply, as a bank is not usually considered a place of public accommodation. Any specific state laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of immigration status might apply. \n\nIn short, this is an issue still not clearly settled. There seems to be no law or regulation requiring banks to ask for citizenship information, much less to deny accounts based on it, and it would be well to seek a bank with a different policy if possible.\n\nThe above is very US\\-specific. Many countries do limit banking access based on citizenship, i understand.\n\nI am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice.

While FDIC Regulation 500 prohibits discrimination based on national origin for loans, it doesn't explicitly cover immigration status for general banking services. The text mentions ongoing court challenges, such as Perez v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., which suggests that the legality of such practices is still being debated. Additionally, the passage states that \"this is an issue still not clearly settled,\" making option C the most accurate statement among the choices provided."

North Carolina allows secret audio recordings, and it does not make exceptions for audio recordings that hurt someone's feelings.\n\nBut to go beyond your explicit question, there still remains the possibility that you could pursue a legal action. If the other party used that recording in a way that violated the law, that might give rise to a tort that would support an award of damages for pain and suffering. If they publicly distributed a recording of themselves having sex with someone, that might constitute the tort of public disclosure of private facts. If they edited the recording to make it sound like someone had said something that they had not and then gave it to someone else, that might be grounds for a libel action.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Sarah's legal options?\n\nA) Sarah can sue John for pain and suffering caused by the secret recording, as it violates her privacy rights.\n\nB) Sarah cannot sue John for the act of recording itself, but she may have legal recourse if John uses the recording in a way that violates other laws.\n\nC) Sarah can sue John for damages because North Carolina law prohibits all forms of secret audio recording.\n\nD) Sarah has no legal options since secret audio recording is completely unrestricted in North Carolina, regardless of how the recording is used.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In North Carolina, secret audio recording is generally allowed and does not in itself constitute a legal violation. Therefore, Sarah cannot sue John solely for the act of recording or for pain and suffering caused by the recording itself. However, if John uses the recording in a way that violates other laws (such as public disclosure of private facts or defamation through editing), Sarah may have grounds for legal action. Options A and C are incorrect because they assume that the act of secret recording is illegal in North Carolina, which it is not. Option D is too extreme, as it incorrectly suggests that there are no restrictions on how secret recordings can be used, which is not the case if the use of the recording violates other laws."

Since Honduras is not a U.S. territory, the shipment from Honduras to Puerto Rico is not subject to this Act, even though Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory.

There seem to be quite a few countries where there are few*er* protections for criminal defendants, but I can't find any where \"guilty until proven innocent\" is literally the case. What I mean by this is that there are non\\-US jurisdictions that allow defendants to be convicted on evidence that would be thrown out of a US court as unconstitutionally obtained, but the prosecution still has to present this evidence and use it to convince the court of the defendant's guilt. The court does not simply assume, \"The prosecutor said it so it must be true, GUILTY!\".\n\nI would define a \"guilty until proven innocent\" legal regime as incorporating most, if not all, of the following criteria:\n\n* The contents of an indictment or other formal accusation are presumed true unless specifically rebutted in a court of law.\n* Defendants in court who plead Not Guilty are required to prove their innocence in order to obtain an acquittal.\n* Simply disproving the prosecution's evidence is insufficient for an acquittal unless the defendant *also* affirmatively proves their innocence.\n\nAre there any jurisdictions anywhere in the world where \"guilty until proven innocent\" is the rule for criminal cases?\n\nJust to be clear, I'm *not* asking for examples of jurisdictions that are not as friendly to defendants (e.g. hearsay is admissible, no doctor\\-patient privilege, trial by jury not guaranteed, expanded authority of judges to issue search warrants, no right to a \"speedy\" trial, etc.), but something more approaching, \"Oh no, John accused me of breaking into his garage. If I can't affirmatively *prove* to a jury that I was in America all of last month and couldn't have broken into his garage here in Ruritania, I'm going to prison!\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: English defamation law is considered to put the burden of proof on the defendant, and until 2010 English law supported a criminal charge of libel\\- so called \"criminal libel\" or \"defamatory libel.\" It should be noted that criminal libel was never affirmatively enshrined in English law, but it came about as an outgrowth of English common law. It was never heavily prosecuted, but was a crime and did carry a potential sentence of one to two years in jail.\n\nA comprehensive review of criminal libel in English law was published as \"Working Paper No. 84 Criminal Libel\". [You can read it here.](https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2016/08/No.084-Criminal-Libel.pdf)\n\nIn England, when actions for libel are brought, the *defamatory statements are assumed to be false.* This assumes the defendant/publisher to be in the wrong, and they must demonstrate their actions to be reasonable. At the time, the defenses available (see paragraph 3\\.17 in linked reference) to the defendant/publisher were either:\n\n* Assert that the statements are not actually defamatory, or do not constitute libel on other technical grounds (e.g. were not actually published in a fixed medium)\n* Make an affirmative defense of \"justification\"\\- proving both that the defamatory statements were actually true AND that that there is a public interest in publishing the statements.\n* Make an affirmative defense of \"fair comment\"\\- similar to justification but for statements that are a matter of opinion rather than a matter of objective fact.\n\nThis satisfies your first condition\\- the statements named by the plaintiff/prosecutor are assumed to be false and defamatory (note another peculiarity of English common law was that actions of libel could be brought by a prosecutor but could also be brought by private citizens... even if they weren't the ones being libeled). This means the prosecutor was assumed to be in the right, and the defendant was assumed to be in the wrong.\n\nParagraph 3\\.19 in the linked document lays it out for us:\n\n```\nThe onus of proving the truth of the statement lies on the \ndefendant who must also prove the facts by reason of which \nit was for the public benefit for the statement to be \npublished. Accordingly, the person defamed need give no \nevidence to rebut the allegations made in the plea of \njustification, leaving the defendant to prove that the \nlibel was true and that the publication was for the public \nbenefit.\n\n```\n\nNote that this is a departure from most other western legal systems in two ways. In the US we say that \"Truth is an absolute defense against libel claims.\" If the statement is true, then you can say it under US law, no matter how badly it damages someone's reputation. Note that this is not true for common law criminal libel\\- merely being true is not sufficient defense, the statements must both be true AND there must be a public interest in publishing the statements. Thus a newspaper or gossip rag that published lovers' intimate details could be prosecuted for criminal libel even if those details are true. Truth is not an absolute defense.\n\nAt this point we have also satisfied your second condition. Once an action of libel has successfully been brought, the defendant must assert some defense or else they automatically lose. Either they must contend that the alleged defamatory statements don't technically rise to the level of libel under the law, or they must prove the truth of their statements and provide a compelling public interest in making those statements.\n\nOther legal systems handle libel very differently. In the USA, libel laws vary on a state\\-by\\-state basis. In general however, a plaintiff wanting to bring suit for libel must provide evidence that the libelous statements are in fact false. If they cannot provide some evidence to that effect, there is no prima facie case of libel and the defense could move for a summary judgement. As has already been said, truth is an absolute defense in the USA.\n\nWhile the crime of libel no longer exists in England, all of this carries over into modern\\-day civil libel actions. The onus is still on the defendant to prove their innocence. Modern observers have coined the terms \"libel tourism\" and \"libel terrorism\" to refer to the practice of attacking critics in English courts rather than more appropriate venues specifically because of the fewer protections afforded to defendants there. The US in particular passed the SPEECH Act in 2010, saying that findings of libel from foreign courts are unenforceable in the US, largely due English libel tourism.",

The defamatory statements were assumed to be false, and the defendant had to make an affirmative defense. To successfully defend against criminal libel charges, the defendant had to prove not only that the statements were true (which alone would be sufficient in many other jurisdictions like the US), but also demonstrate that there was a public interest in publishing those statements. This dual requirement made English libel law particularly stringent and placed a significant burden on defendants, satisfying the \"guilty until proven innocent\" criteria in libel cases."

No customer is prohibited from buying either version based on their sex or gender, but needless to say this price regime will disproportionately affect male purchasers from the business over female ones.\n\nIs this unlawfully discriminatory on the basis of customers' sex?\n\nOf course the thinking here is that it may be indirect discrimination, but what could cause it to qualify or not qualify as indirect discrimination even though it is presumably not done for misandrous motivations?\n\nPossible starting points for research that survey the case law fleshing out this concept of legitimate aims, and the \u201ccosts plus\u201d principle:\n\n* [https://www.stammeringlaw.org.uk/disability\\-equality\\-law/discrimination/discrimination\\-arising\\-from\\-disability/justification/\\#cost](https://www.stammeringlaw.org.uk/disability-equality-law/discrimination/discrimination-arising-from-disability/justification/#cost)\n* [https://www.michelmores.com/news\\-views/news/age\\-discrimination\\-and\\-proportionate\\-means\\-achieving\\-legitimate\\-aim](https://www.michelmores.com/news-views/news/age-discrimination-and-proportionate-means-achieving-legitimate-aim)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Part 3 of the Equality Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/3) is the Part that applies to the provision of services to the public, which includes \"the provision of goods.\" This Part prohibits service providers from discriminating as to the terms on which a provider provides the goods to the customer.\n\nIndirect discrimination is defined at [Section 19 of the Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/section/19). It establishes that indirect discrimination is a form of discrimination:\n\n> **19 Indirect Discrimination**\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if A applies to B a\n> provision, criterion or practice which is discriminatory in relation\n> to a relevant protected characteristic of B's.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) For the purposes of subsection (1\\), a provision, criterion or\n> practice is discriminatory in relation to a relevant protected\n> characteristic of B's if\u2014\n> \n> \n> * (a) A applies, or would apply, it to persons with whom B does not share the characteristic,\n> * (b) it puts, or would put, persons with whom B shares the characteristic at a particular disadvantage when compared with persons with whom B does not share it,\n> * (c) it puts, or would put, B at that disadvantage, and\n> * (d) A cannot show it to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) The relevant protected characteristics are\u2014\n> \n> \n> * age;\n> * disability;\n> * gender reassignment;\n> * marriage and civil partnership;\n> * race;\n> * religion or belief;\n> * sex;\n> * sexual orientation.\n\nIn characterizing the \"practice\" that is being applied, the Court of Appeal has said this word is not a term of art and is not to be construed narrowly or in a limited way (see *Ishola v Transport for London*, [\\[2020] EWCA Civ 112](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2020/112.html)). A fair way to characterize the \"practice\" being applied in this circumstance is that the store is \"selling Nike Jordan 4128s (women's) at \u00a3150 and Nike Jordan 4128s (men's) at \u00a3200\\.\" (If instead the \"pratice\" were characterized more narrowly\u2014selling Nike Jordan 4128s (women's) at \u00a3150\u2014then the analysis would not even get past 19(2\\)(b). Likewise, if the \"practice\" were characterized more broadly\u2014selling both the women's and men's versions at a discount from time to time, not necessarily at the same time\u2014then the analysis will also have difficulty getting past 19(2\\)(b).)\n\nThe question is whether the application of this practice indirectly discriminates against \"male purchasers.\"\n\n### 19(2\\)(a): does the Nike store apply this practice to male and non\\-male purchasers?\n\nYes. (This is why we're in an indirect discrimination analysis rather than direct discrimination.)\n\n### 19(2\\)(b): does this practice put male purchasers at a disadvantage?\n\nDepending on evidence showing that male purchasers are more likely to want to purchase the Nike Jordan 4128s (men's), then yes. (I could also see a tribunal cutting the analysis off at this stage, depending on how much weight they place on choice. I know that [Canada avoids inquiring into the \"source\" of the disadvantage or blaming it on an individual's choice](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18510/index.do), but I have no idea what the approach in the U.K. is to this aspect.)\n\n### 19(2\\)(c): would this practice put a particular male claimant at that disadvantage?\n\nDepending on evidence showing that the particular claimant wants to purchase the Nike Jordan 4128s (men's), then yes.\n\n### 19(2\\)(d): is it the case that the Nike store cannot show the practice to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim?\n\nMy prediction is that the store would be able to justify the practice as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.\n\nOne example of a legitimate aim: a charging policy at swimming pools that disproportionately affected \"disabled swimmers\" was found to be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim, being part of \"an overall financial structure which covers the provision of a wide range of public services\" ([https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2022/1588\\.html](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2022/1588.html))\n\nOther [examples of legitimate aims](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/law-and-courts/discrimination/check-what-type-of-discrimination-youve-experienced/justifying-discrimination/): \"running an efficient service,\" \"requirements of a business,\" \"desire to make a profit.\" However,\n\n> Economic reasons alone are not enough to justify discrimination. Someone can\u2019t justify discrimination by saying it\u2019s cheaper to discriminate. But costs can be taken into account as part of the justification if the person can show there are other good enough reasons for the treatment.\n\nSo, depending on the business rationale, and the proportionality of the discount compared to the business need (e.g. cost of holding extra stock, risk of failing to sell stock as a new model comes in, etc.), the price differential could be a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. This will depend on the evidence. I predict most stores would be able to justify a modest and occasional price differential, even in the case that the production costs of each shoe are identical.\n\n### Summary\n\nI see four ways through this analysis, each leading to the conclusion that this would not be indirect discrimination:\n\n* a narrow characterization of the \"practice\" as simply selling the women's version at \u00a3150 (probably too narrow of a view)\n* a broad characterization of the \"practice\" as selling all versions at a discount from time to time, albeit not necessarily at the exact same time\n* a view that any disadvantage experienced by men is due to their choice not the price discrepancy (dubious)\n* the price discrepancy is a proportionate means to achieve a legitimate aim (admittedly, a thin analysis requiring more research)",

        "answer": "Here is a multi-form exam question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A clothing store sells Nike Jordan 4128s sneakers in men's and women's versions. The store normally prices both versions at \u00a3200, but decides to discount the women's version to \u00a3150 for a limited time. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential indirect discrimination claims under the UK Equality Act 2010?\n\nA) This pricing strategy would automatically qualify as unlawful indirect discrimination against male customers.\n\nB) The store could likely justify the pricing difference as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate business aim, avoiding an indirect discrimination finding.\n\nC) Characterizing the \"practice\" narrowly as just discounting the women's version would prevent any indirect discrimination analysis. \n\nD) Economic reasons alone, such as increasing profits, would be sufficient justification to defend against an indirect discrimination claim.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is most accurate based on the information provided. While the pricing strategy could potentially meet the initial criteria for indirect discrimination against male customers under Section 19 of the Equality Act, the store would likely be able to justify it as a proportionate means of achieving legitimate business aims (e.g. managing inventory, boosting sales of a particular product line). This justification, if accepted, would prevent a finding of unlawful indirect discrimination.\n\nOption A is incorrect as the pricing strategy is not automatically discriminatory - it depends on the full analysis including potential justification. Option C is flawed because even a narrow characterization would likely allow the analysis to proceed past the initial stages. Option D is incorrect because economic reasons alone are not sufficient justification - other factors must be considered as part of a proportionality assessment."

Assuming the bills are all paid on time, can a utility company refuse me service for arbitrary reasons e.g. my political views?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a matter of state law, and so could in theory vary from state to state. But I think that in most, if not all, US states, a public utility like a water or electric company must take any customer unless they have a history of unpaid bills or the like. They don't have to lay new pipes or run new wires to bring service to you if it is at a location not previously served, however.\n\nIn the Maryland code, [\u00a7 7\\-307](https://law.justia.com/codes/maryland/2018/public-utilities/division-i/title-7/subtitle-3/section-7-307/) ( Termination of service to low income customers) provides:\n\n> (1\\) Subject to paragraph (2\\) of this subsection, the Commission shall adopt regulations concerning the prohibition against or limitation of authority of a public service company to terminate service for gas or electricity to a low income residential customer during the heating season for nonpayment.\n\n> (2\\) In adopting the regulations required under paragraph (1\\) of this subsection, the Commission shall consider and may include provisions relating to:\n\n> (i) the circumstances under which service may and may not be limited or terminated;\n\n> (ii) the minimum heating levels required to maintain life, health, and safety;\n\n> (iii) the medical, age, disabling, or other individual characteristics that are relevant to a prohibition against or limitation on the termination of service;\n\n(and other provisions)\n\nThat the Public Service Commission is empowered, and indeed obliged, to issue binding regulations on when service may be terminated might imply a duty to provide service in the first place, but that is not as clear as I would like.

The documentation indicates that while the general principle across most U.S. states is that public utilities must serve any customer who can pay their bills, the specific regulations can vary by state. The answer notes that this is a matter of state law, not federal law, which rules out option B. It also mentions that utilities typically can't refuse service for arbitrary reasons like political views, which contradicts option A. Option D is too specific and not supported by the given information.

In this case, while the van driver may have been attempting to prevent a crime, the use of a motor vehicle as a weapon is likely to be considered excessive force, especially since there was no imminent risk of physical harm to anyone. The CPS guide emphasizes that prosecutors should consider whether any force was necessary at all, and whether the force used was reasonable. Ramming a moped with a van, given the circumstances described, would likely be seen as disproportionate and unnecessary, thus making the van driver's actions potentially criminal under UK law."

The supervisor in question has been delinquent with respect to many of these guidelines. Administration is resisting replacing him, possibly because the path of least resistance for them is to assume things will work out in time.\n\nMy understanding is that, while the courts in Canada do not generally adjudicate academic issues (quality of academic work, etc) they have in some cases treated the handbook and regulations at the time of enrolment as a contract between the student and the university.

You would be arguing that you have done what you are supposed to do under the terms of that contract, but the university has failed to perform its obligations. The first thing that has to be determined is whether you have done what is required of you, with respect to the grievance procedure. Assuming that you have filed an official grievance, then it is likely that there will have been an investigation. You say they are \"resisting\", which does not say whether they are still negotiating with you, or have they actually refused to give you what you want. If the latter, then your lawyer would tell you whether there is a realistic hope of prevailing in a lawsuit (or would you just be wasting time and money).

Money donated to PACs is meant to be spent solely on campaign efforts.\n\nAssuming that the claim is true (which is disputed), does this act constitute embezzlement?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Embezzlement is criminally prohibited by [18 USC 666](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666), and this [DoJ manual page](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1005-embezzlement) on what is embezzlement cites the answer in Moore v. United States, 160 U.S. 268 that\n\n> Embezzlement is the fraudulent appropriation of property by a person\n> to whom such property has been entrusted, or into whose hands it has\n> lawfully come. It differs from larceny in that the original taking was\n> lawful, or with the consent of the owner, while in larceny the\n> felonious intent must have existed at the time of the taking\n\nFollowing other case law, the elements of the crime are\n\n> there was a trust or fiduciary relationship between the defendant and\n> the private organization or State or local government agency;\n> \n> \n> the property came into the possession or care of the defendant by\n> virtue of his/her employment;\n> \n> \n> the defendant's dealings with the property constituted a fraudulent\n> conversion or appropriation of it to his/her own use; and\n> \n> \n> the defendant acted with the intent to deprive the owner of the use of\n> this property.\n\n[This page](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?data_type=efiling&committee_id=C00580100) lists over 32,000 disbursements; [filtering just for rent](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?data_type=efiling&committee_id=C00580100&disbursement_description=rent) give over 2,400 disbursements, a number of which are recent and made to some business with Trump in the name (Trump Tower LLC etc).\n\nThe conversion would have to be fraudulent to be embezzlement. There actually is not any evidence provided that a transfer violated FEC regulations (we have dates, amounts, and recipient), so we would have to speculate about what else is true. There are processed disbursement images up to 10/21/2020 such as [this receipt](https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?202104219445358829) for 3 charges for food and lodging paid to Trump Hotel Collection. In fact this payment was made by Donald J Trump for President, Inc. although the search term was the aforementioned PAC: I will overlook that anomaly.\n\n[This is the FEC page](https://docquery.fec.gov/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00580100) on that committee (you have to follow the committee number because the name was also used in the 2016 campaign but was terminated). There vast numbers of filings linked there, but nothing that I saw indicates that Trump is in any sense an employee of the organization, so there is no actual evidence that there were any \"Trump actions\". First, it would have to be shown that there were Trump actions. Second, it would have to be show that the action was *fraudulent*. Technical misappropriation is not fraudulent. [This FEC page](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/keeping-records/misappropriated-funds/) describes the safe harbor provisions for misappropriation. [This page](https://www.fec.gov/updates/safe-harbor-embezzlement-misreporting/) specifically addresses embezzlement. Although they use the word \"embezzlement\", they do not purport that misappropriation constituted embezzlement as defined above, to point out that civil penalties may result from violation, see [11 CFR Part 104](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt11.1.104&rgn=div5). Ultimately, the legal propriety of the disbursements depends on its purpose: [here](https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements/personal-use/) is what the FEC say about illegal conversion for personal use (food for daily consumption, mortgage or rent for personal residence, tuition...).\n\nThe available evidence does not even suggest embezzlement.",

Khill*, [2021 SCC 37, para. 52](https://canlii.ca/t/jjlbr#par52)).\n\nThe National Judicial Institute's [model jury instructions](https://www.nji-inm.ca/index.cfm/publications/model-jury-instructions/defences/self-defence-in-force/defence-34-self-defence/) slightly rephrases:\n\n> \\[the accused] believed that force \\[or the threat of force] was being used against him/her \\[or against another person] and \\[accused]\u2019s belief was based on reasonable grounds\n\n---\n\nRegarding evidence in general: the court needs *some evidence* on which to give an \"air of reality\" to every element of this defence in order to place the burden on the Crown to rebut the defence beyond a reasonable doubt. **This does not require the accused to testify about their subjective belief. The evidence about the subjective belief can come from elsewhere in the evidence. For example, even if an accused had no memory of the encounter, there may nonetheless be evidence about their subjective belief: video evidence of the encounter, hearsay evidence about what the accused said during the events, physical evidence revealing a defensive posture, etc.** The evidence *must* support an inference of a subjective belief in a threat. It is not enough that the evidence shows that a subjective belief would have been reasonable. But none of that is relevant to the question of what the elements of self\\-defence are or whether an act taken without the subjective belief that the accused or another person is being threatened is self\\-defence. The question has helpfully taken the standard approach to legal hypotheticals of just asserting what the facts are in order to take questions of evidence off the table.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Canadian criminal case, a defendant claims self-defense after using deadly force against an assailant. The defendant, who is partially deaf, misheard the assailant's words and thought they were insulting his dog, rather than threatening to shoot. Objectively, the assailant did have a gun pointed at the defendant. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the validity of the self-defense claim?\n\nA) The self-defense claim is valid because the objective circumstances would make it reasonable for someone to use deadly force.\n\nB) The self-defense claim is invalid because the defendant's subjective reason for using force was not related to a perceived threat.\n\nC) The self-defense claim may be valid if there is evidence suggesting the defendant subjectively believed they were under threat, regardless of the misunderstanding.\n\nD) The self-defense claim is automatically valid because the assailant had a gun, regardless of the defendant's subjective belief.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Canadian law, for a self-defense claim to be valid, the defendant must have a subjective belief that they are under threat, and this belief must be based on reasonable grounds. In this case, while the defendant's actual reason for using force was based on a misunderstanding, what matters is whether there is evidence to support that the defendant subjectively believed they were under threat at the time.\n\nThe fact that the defendant misheard the assailant doesn't automatically invalidate the claim. If other evidence (such as video footage, witness testimony, or physical evidence) supports the inference that the defendant believed they were in danger, the self-defense claim may still be valid. The court needs some evidence to give an \"air of reality\" to every element of the defense, including the subjective belief of threat.\n\nOption A is incorrect because objective reasonableness alone is not sufficient; subjective belief is also required. Option B is too definitive in ruling out the claim based on the misunderstanding. Option D is incorrect because merely having a gun present doesn't automatically validate a self-defense claim without considering the defendant's subjective belief."

(This\n> is in the state of Georgia, USA.) I prefer approaches that do not\n> involve paying an attorney, since that fast becomes expensive and\n> counterproductive.\n\nChild support generally either is, or can be reduced to, by court process, a money judgment. The money judgment can then be enforced by writ of execution and levy attaching tangible personal property of a debtor, to the extent that the asset is not exempt from creditors claims. The money judgment can also be used to garnish bank accounts.\n\nIf someone has a manifest ability to pay child support, but has willfully failed to do so, a court can incarcerate the child support debtor for contempt of court until such time as the child support debt voluntarily turns over the assets that the debtor has an ability to pay the child support debt with. In theory, however, an inability to pay child support is a full defense to a contempt of court proceeding.\n\nAll of these kinds of legal child support collection proceedings are technical, and it would be very challenging to accomplish these goals through the court process without a lawyer. The going rate for contingent fee collection of child support debts is usually 50% of the gross amount recovered, plus out of pocket costs for filing fees and process servers out of your half, if you can find an attorney willing to take on a child support collection case at all.\n\nSometimes collection agencies will agree to collect child support for a similar fee. Collection agencies can make negative credit reports, and nag the child support debtor regularly, but otherwise have the same remedies available to them as a lawyer.\n\nMany states have procedures for the state child support collection agency to seize tax refunds, to revoke occupational and professional licenses, and to revoke driver's licenses if child support is not paid. Usually, state child support collection agencies either exclusively serve, or prioritize, cases where child support is owed to someone who has received state welfare benefits, and it applies some or all of the proceeds received to the welfare payments made to the child support beneficiary.\n\nNot paying child support might be a probation violation that could be reported to the child support debtor's probation officer. But, causing the child support debtor to be incarcerated for failing to observe probation terms doesn't naturally or easily translate into providing the child support creditor with money.\n\nUltimately, you can't get blood out of a turnip. If someone doesn't have an ability to pay child support, they won't. A new car is suspicious and probably indicates that there was some under the table work done. But, by the time it is seized, it is a used car, and its fair market value at auction may be quite modest. Whether or not it is cost effective is for you to decide.\n\nI once tried to collect a money judgment of about $100,000 from a drug dealer which presented similar problems. It wasn't easy. It rarely is. There is no quick, inexpensive way of doing it.",

The state child support agency reports she has no employment income, but she drives a new car. Which of the following approaches is LEAST likely to be effective in enforcing child support payments without involving an attorney?\n\nA) Reporting the non-payment to her probation officer as a potential violation\nB) Attempting to garnish her bank accounts using the child support order as a money judgment\nC) Hiring a collection agency to make negative credit reports and regularly contact the mother\nD) Personally filing for a writ of execution to seize her new car\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) While reporting to the probation officer might lead to consequences for the mother, it's not directly tied to collecting child support and thus not the least effective option.\n\nB) Garnishing bank accounts can be an effective method if the mother has funds, even if she's not reporting employment income.\n\nC) Collection agencies, while costly, have experience in pursuing debts and can use various tactics to encourage payment.\n\nD) This is the least effective approach because:\n1. Filing for a writ of execution without legal expertise is complex and prone to errors.\n2. By the time the car is seized and auctioned, its value may have significantly decreased.\n3. The car might be exempt from seizure or not owned outright by the mother.\n4. This approach requires navigating court processes, which can be challenging without an attorney.\n\nThe other options, while not guaranteed to succeed, are more likely to yield results or apply pressure without requiring the same level of legal expertise as personally pursuing asset seizure through the courts."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software engineer, Alice, developed and published a machine learning algorithm before joining TechCorp. Upon hiring, she signed an agreement that assigns all intellectual property (IP) to TechCorp, including past inventions. Six months into her employment, Alice works on weekends to create a new software application using publicly available research articles and equations, without using any company resources. She hires external programmers to assist with the development. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ownership of Alice's IP?\n\nA) TechCorp owns both the pre-employment algorithm and the weekend project, as the agreement covers all IP regardless of when it was created.\n\nB) Alice retains ownership of both the pre-employment algorithm and the weekend project, as they were developed outside of her work for TechCorp.\n\nC) TechCorp owns the pre-employment algorithm, but Alice retains ownership of the weekend project as it was developed independently.\n\nD) Alice retains ownership of the pre-employment algorithm, but TechCorp may have a claim on the weekend project due to the broad IP assignment agreement.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Alice's pre-employment algorithm, which was developed and published before joining TechCorp, would typically remain her property. Employer claims to copyright are generally limited to work done in the course of employment and do not extend to works created before the employment relationship existed. \n\nHowever, the weekend project developed during her employment, even though done off-site and without company resources, may be subject to TechCorp's claim due to the broad IP assignment agreement Alice signed. While the project uses publicly available information and external programmers, the agreement Alice signed could potentially be interpreted to cover such work.\n\nOption A is incorrect because pre-employment IP typically remains with the employee. Option B is overly generous to Alice, ignoring the potential reach of the IP assignment agreement. Option C incorrectly assigns the pre-employment work to TechCorp. Option D most accurately reflects the nuanced situation, acknowledging Alice's rights to her pre-employment work while recognizing the potential claim TechCorp might have on work done during employment, even if done independently."

For example, if the recipient of a forged check has a fatal allergic reaction to the ink, most courts will not hold the forger guilty of murder, as the cause of death is too remote from the criminal act.\n\nFloyd was arrested on an accusation that he passed a counterfeit $20 bill. This is not an \"inherently dangerous\" felony. Nor has it ever been established that he had the criminal intent that would have been required to convict him of a crime. Indeed it has not been proved that he knew the bill was counterfeit. But a finding of criminal intent to commit the underlying felony is essential to invoking teh felony murder rule. [MN code 609\\.632](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.19) subdivision 3 requires \"intent to defraud\" and \"having reason to know that the money order, currency, note, or obligation or security is forged, counterfeited, falsely made, altered, or printed\". Moreover when the value is under $1,000 the possible penalties are much lighter and may not even be a felony.\n\nIn any case passing a phoney $20 is not the kind of offense for which the felony murder rule is normally invoked, nor is being killed by an arresting officer a plausible, outcome, althoguh obviously it is possible.\n\n### Further sources\n\nThe University of Minnesota's page on [\"felony Murder\"](https://open.lib.umn.edu/criminallaw/chapter/9-4-felony-murder/) says:\n\n> When the defendant commits a felony that is inherently dangerous to life, he or she does so knowing that some innocent victim may die. In essence, this awareness is similar to implied malice, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life. What is difficult to justify is a conviction for felony murder when the felony is not inherently dangerous to life. Thus most jurisdictions limit the felony murder doctrine to felonies that create a foreseeable risk of violence or death. ...\n\n> Joaquin, who has just lost his job, decides to burn down his apartment building because he can\u2019t afford to pay the rent.

He then runs outside to watch the entire building burn down. Several tenants die of smoke inhalation because of the fire.

Which of the following best explains why the court made this decision?\n\nA) The contract did not contain an arbitration clause.\nB) The third party was not bound by Section 8 of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.\nC) The defendants' rights under the contract were purely defensive and based on an exclusion clause.\nD) The defendants had explicitly waived their right to arbitration in the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The court rejected the defendants' attempt to stay proceedings in favor of arbitration because the contract conferred on them 'defensive' rights under an exclusion clause. This means that their rights were not substantive claims that arose pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, and therefore Section 8 of the Act (which would have required arbitration) did not apply.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage indicates that there was an arbitration clause in the contract.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the issue was not about the third party being bound by Section 8, but rather that the defendants' rights did not fall under the Act's purview.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as there is no mention of the defendants explicitly waiving their right to arbitration.\n\nThe question also includes a subtle trick by mentioning fraud, which is referenced in the original text but not actually relevant to the court's decision in this case."

The U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged in [*W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette*, 319 U.S. 624, 632 (1943\\)](https://casetext.com/case/west-virginia-state-board-of-education-v-barnette), that symbolic gestures can be \"a form of utterance\" protected by the First Amendment right to freedom of speech, and it addressed the middle finger specifically in a decision last year.\n\nIn [*Mahanoy Area Sch. Dist. v. B.L.*, 141 S. Ct. 2038, 2046 (2021\\)](https://casetext.com/case/mahanoy-area-sch-dist-v-b-l), a school suspended a student from its cheerleading team because she posted a picture to social media showing her and a friend \"with middle fingers raised\" (and bearing the caption \"Fuck school fuck softball fuck cheer fuck everything.\"). But the Supreme Court held that this violated her right to free speech, as her post \"did not involve features that would place it outside the First Amendment\u2019s ordinary protection. That decision aligned neatly with decades of lower\\-court decisions holding the same. E.g., [*Bad Frog Brewery v. N.Y. State Liquor Auth.*, 134 F.3d 87 (2d Cir. 1998\\);](https://casetext.com/case/bad-frog-brewery-v-new-york-st-liquor-auth) [*Sandul v. Larion*, 119 F.3d 1250, 1255 (6th Cir. 1997\\)](https://casetext.com/case/sandul-v-larion) (\"Sandul's action was not fighting words and therefore was speech protected by the First Amendment.\").\n\nOf course, First Amendment protectiosn are not absolute, so although the government almost certainly could not criminalize dabbing itself, it would be easier for a governmental body to prohibit it during its public meetings, easier still for a government employer to justify disciplining a working for dabbing, and easier still for a public school to justify disciplining a student for dabbing.",

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the likely constitutional status of this law?\n\nA) The law is likely constitutional because local governments have broad authority to regulate public behavior.\n\nB) The law would be upheld as constitutional if the town can prove a compelling government interest in banning the gesture.\n\nC) The law is likely unconstitutional as it violates First Amendment protections on symbolic speech without meeting strict scrutiny standards.\n\nD) The law would be constitutional only if applied to minors or in schools, but not to adults in general public spaces.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, gestures are generally protected as a form of symbolic speech under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld that symbolic gestures, even potentially offensive ones like the middle finger, are protected forms of expression. \n\nWhile First Amendment protections are not absolute, any law restricting such expression would likely need to pass strict scrutiny, meaning it must serve a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored. A blanket ban on a harmless gesture like dabbing in all public spaces would almost certainly fail to meet this high standard.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because local government authority is still limited by constitutional protections. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because even a compelling interest is not enough; the law must also be narrowly tailored, which a blanket ban is not.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while schools may have more latitude to restrict student expression, a town-wide ban affecting adults in all public spaces would still likely be unconstitutional."

In a country such as South Africa, India, or China, is it redundant to add a severability clause to a contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The substantive common law of severability turns, in part, on the intent of the parties. If the contract can carry out the intent of the parties with a particular provision severed, it is severable. If removing the invalid provision would upset the core bargain of the parties and defeat their intent, it is not severed and the entire contract is stricken.\n\nA severability clause exists to clarify the intent of the parties, but is never actually necessary.\n\nMuch of Chinese law is its own thing, home grown and outside the Western legal tradition, as applied in practice at least, even when it has a civil law structure to the extent it draws on the Western legal tradition.

A severability clause serves to clarify the parties' intent regarding whether the contract should remain enforceable if certain provisions are found to be invalid. However, it is not strictly necessary in any jurisdiction, as courts will generally consider the parties' intent and the contract's core purpose when deciding on severability, even without an explicit clause.\n\nOption A is incorrect because severability clauses are not legally required, even in common law jurisdictions. Option B is incorrect as it misrepresents the purpose of severability clauses, which aim to preserve the contract rather than invalidate it entirely. Option D is incorrect because the concept of severability is not fundamentally different between Western and non-Western legal systems, and the clause is not necessarily more crucial in countries like China.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the purpose of severability clauses, their relationship to different legal systems, and the broader principles of contract interpretation across jurisdictions."

Are there any laws that would enable Trump to make this a condition of the sale? Conversely, are there any laws that would prohibit this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law which allows the government to have any say in the question is [50 USC 4564](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/4565), by which presidents have blocked the sale of US property so that they become under the control of foreign persons. For example, the acquisition of [two Chinese companies were ordered](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/order-regarding-acquisition-stayntouch-inc-beijing-shiji-information-technology-co-ltd/) to divest themselves from Stayntouch, a US company. The sale of Qualcomm, a US company, to two foreign companies [was blocked](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-order-regarding-proposed-takeover-qualcomm-incorporated-broadcom-limited/) under that same law. The transactions affected are described in\n50 USC 4564(a)(4\\)(B), all of which involve acquisition of a US business by a foreign person.

A kickback does not relate / eliminate a national security threat.\n\nAcquisition of a foreign entity by a US entity is not a covered transaction, and Congress did not authorize taxing a US company for the acquisition of a foreign concern.

Option B, where a Chinese company acquires a U.S. hotel chain, fits this description as a \"covered transaction.\"\n\nOption A is not correct because it involves a U.S. company acquiring a foreign entity, which is not covered under this law.\n\nOption C involves only U.S. companies and doesn't introduce foreign control, so it's not applicable.\n\nOption D is a domestic merger and doesn't involve foreign entities, so it's also not covered under this particular law.\n\nThe law is designed to allow the U.S. government to review and potentially block transactions that could give foreign entities control over U.S. businesses, particularly when there are national security concerns.

They want to release a sample dataset to demonstrate their methodology. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential copyright infringement?\n\nA) As long as they release less than 10% of each copyrighted work, it will automatically be considered fair use.\n\nB) If they only release short excerpts from each work, it will definitely not be considered copyright infringement in any country.\n\nC) The determination of whether their use constitutes fair use depends on multiple factors, including the purpose of use and potential market impact.\n\nD) Google's success in the Google Books case establishes a clear precedent that releasing partial content of copyrighted works is always permissible.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The question of whether using copyrighted material constitutes fair use is complex and depends on multiple factors. There is no fixed percentage or word count that automatically qualifies as fair use. The court considers various aspects, including the purpose of the use, the effect on the potential market for the original work, and the nature of the copyrighted work.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no automatic threshold for fair use. Even small portions can be infringing if they represent the \"heart\" of the work.\n\nAnswer B is false because fair use is a US legal concept, and what might be considered fair use in the US could still be copyright infringement in other countries.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the Google Books case was significant, it does not establish a universal precedent that partial use of copyrighted works is always permissible. Each case is judged on its specific circumstances."

The beneficiary designation on the policy supersedes any other arrangements, including wills or family relationships. If the stepchildren are not listed as beneficiaries on the policy, they have no legal claim to the insurance money, regardless of their relationship to Sarah or any other circumstances.

Not that I'm asking about beeing physically able to file it.\n\nIf this is widely location dependent, assume it to be as tagged, but a common answer is prefered if possible.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: From a legal perspective co\\-signing a loan isn't the same thing loaning the money to the other co\\-signer. When you co\\-sign a loan with someone else both you and the other person are equal parties in the loan, both jointly responsible in fully paying off the principle and interest. If loan is defaulted on, the bank can pursue legal remedies to try to recover its money against either or both of you.\n\nIf you end up having to pay part or all of the loan, then whether or not you can recover any of that money will depend on whatever agreement you made with the other person. Given that you probably wouldn't a have a signed written agreement with the other signer in case like this, it'll probably come down to whether or not you can prove (on the balance of probabilities) that the other party promised to you to pay off the full amount of the loan. It will help if the loan is specifically tied to a car, a house or other property that the other party benefits from but you don't. \n\nNote that you'd have to give serious consideration to whether the other party can actually pay the amount owed. There's no point going to court to obtain an unenforceable judgement.\n\nI also should say that from a financial perspective it does make some sense to think of it as if you were loaning out the money yourself. While there's a big and significant difference between the two, in that your bank account isn't affected unless the other person defaults, if they do the result is going to be pretty much the same. Indeed in that case it's not much different than just giving the other person the money. When co\\-signing a loan you really need to trust that other person.",

Sarah defaulted on the loan, and the bank pursued John for the full amount. John paid off the loan to avoid damaging his credit score. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal options to recover the money from Sarah?\n\nA) John can easily sue Sarah and is guaranteed to recover the full amount he paid, as co-signing is legally equivalent to giving a personal loan.\n\nB) John has no legal recourse against Sarah, as co-signers assume full responsibility for the loan with no right to seek repayment from the primary borrower.\n\nC) John may be able to sue Sarah, but his success depends on proving there was an agreement that Sarah would repay the loan, and whether Sarah has the means to pay.\n\nD) John can only sue Sarah if he has a written contract with her specifically stating she would repay him if he had to pay the loan.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While John can potentially sue Sarah to recover the money he paid, his success is not guaranteed. It depends on several factors:\n\n1. John would need to prove that there was an understanding or agreement between him and Sarah that she would be responsible for repaying the loan.\n2. The fact that Sarah directly benefited from the loan (by getting the car) could work in John's favor.\n3. Even if John wins the case, he needs to consider whether Sarah has the financial means to actually pay him back.\n4. There's no automatic right for a co-signer to recover money from the primary borrower, unlike in a personal loan situation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because co-signing is not legally equivalent to giving a personal loan, and recovery is not guaranteed. Answer B is too extreme, as co-signers may have some legal recourse. Answer D is overly restrictive, as a written contract is helpful but not absolutely necessary to pursue legal action."

I was told recent events would not be a problem, both by Turkish acquaintances and service representatives of Turkish Airlines. However, that was when I booked the March 25th flight at the beginning of the month.\n\nWhen the bombings in Ankara (central Turkey) occurred last weekend, I called Turkish Airlines to cancel my flight, suspicious that violence was moving westward. After four separate customer service calls, they finally gave me the following breakdown of my non\\-refundable ticket:\n\n* $360\\.00 USD for fuel taxes (non\\-refundable)\n* $129\\.00 USD minimum ticket cost (non\\-refundable)\n* $96\\.76 USD refundable ticket cost\n\nWhich adds up to $585\\.76 USD, only $96 of which is refundable. I complained to their customer service representatives that the circumstances were such that I should not feel compelled to take a flight when there was a reasonable chance I would find myself in serious danger during my travels to Turkey (this was the only reason which would have driven me to cancel my flight). Their response was that they had no evidence of danger in Istanbul or Ataturk airport, and that I would be safe during my 16\\-hour layover. However, I was suspicious, and felt that this was not exactly a statement the Airline could guarantee.\n\nLast night, I called again because the U.S. Consulate in Istanbul issued a [travel warning](http://istanbul.usconsulate.gov/citizen_messages.html) yesterday (March 17\\), saying that U.S. Government buildings and tourist areas might be targets for acts of terrorism. I called Turkish Airlines again and complained; they redirected me to a Customer Care Relations form which I could fill out to request a full refund. I did so. The airline usually takes 48 hours to respond.\n\nThis morning, Istanbul was victim to a suicide bombing in a populated tourist area. At least 36 were injured, and five were reported dead. I am concerned that after hours of effort, I will not be able to obtain a full refund, even though there is now evidence of a clear and present danger in Istanbul. Given that I have had to book another last\\-minute flight through a safer region (Canada to Geneva), I would expect Turkish to at least refund the cost of my ticket, or provide me with a credit for future travel (although I am so concerned with the way they do business that I do not think the latter is acceptable anymore).\n\nIf they do not provide me with a full refund, my next step will be to go to small claims court. My question is whether there is a court precedent for my situation. Is there any chance I will get my money back in filing a claim?\n\nIn my view, the situation is like this: suppose you buy a cake from a bakery. You pay up\\-front for the cake, and are told that the purchase is final. This sounds reasonable, because you trust the business owner to provide you with a product which is, at the very least, safely comestible. However, when you stop by a week later to pick up the cake, the baker tells you that there is a reasonable chance the cake has cyanide in it, and that you would endanger yourself in the act of consumption. The baker then refuses to provide you with a full refund for your purchase. This situation seems unreasonable to me in the exact same way that my current situation does. What are your thoughts?\n\nThanks so much for your help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As I said in my comments, \"It was your choice to ask for a refund because you chose to assess the events as a safety risk to yourself and the airline.\"\n\nThe airline did not assess a risk and as a result cancel the flight and issue refunds. The airline did not disregard advisories or laws pertaining to the terrorist acts that took place and result in legal triggers that mandated the airline cancel the flight and give refunds.\n\nIf a city or country is classified as a war zone \\- by that country itself or some international body, or by the US State Department \\- then there are triggers that either suggest or mandate flight closures, through a myriad of laws and jurisdictions.\n\nIt is solely your perception of the risk to yourself and the airline that you are using as a reason to ask for a refund. You have made a decision on your own and simply don't have a case for a refund.\n\n[http://www.turkishairlines.com/en\\-int/travel\\-information/legal\\-notice/terms\\-amp\\-conditions/cancellation\\-refund](http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/travel-information/legal-notice/terms-amp-conditions/cancellation-refund)",

The student's decision to cancel the flight was based on their own perception of risk, not on any official cancellation by the airline or legal mandate. The airline continued to operate flights and did not assess the situation as requiring cancellation. Travel warnings and nearby incidents, while concerning, do not automatically entitle passengers to refunds on non-refundable tickets. The airline's refund policy and terms & conditions typically govern such situations, and personal risk assessments usually do not override these policies. The analogy to an unsafe product is not applicable here, as the airline was still operating and considered the flight safe to proceed. In a legal context, the student's personal decision to cancel, even if prudent, does not create a legal obligation for the airline to provide a full refund on a non-refundable ticket."

If so, when was the precedent set?

Article I, Section 5 gives each house of Congress the power to determine its own rules, but a quick review of Senate rules doesn't reveal any specific resignation procedures. The practice of submitting resignations to state governors appears to be based on precedent rather than constitutional or statutory requirement. While the Senate has the power to judge the qualifications of its members, this doesn't directly address resignation procedures. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that there is no Constitutional provision or federal law that explicitly dictates the recipient of a Senator's resignation letter."

Under Canadian law, which statement is most accurate regarding John's potential criminal liability for theft?\n\nA) John is guilty of theft because he took the lawnmower without permission, regardless of intent.\nB) John is not guilty of theft because he returned the lawnmower promptly after realizing his mistake.\nC) John is guilty of theft because he initially lied about having the lawnmower.\nD) John is not guilty of theft because the prosecution cannot prove he had the intent to deprive his neighbor of the lawnmower permanently.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to Canadian law, theft requires both a criminal act (actus reus) and a criminal state of mind (mens rea). The key element in the definition of theft is the phrase \"with intent\" to deprive, pledge as security, or destroy. In John's case, while he accidentally took the lawnmower and initially lied about having it, the prosecution would have difficulty proving that John had the intent to permanently deprive his neighbor of the lawnmower. His prompt return of the item upon realizing his mistake suggests a lack of criminal intent. The initial lie, while potentially problematic, does not in itself constitute theft. Option A is incorrect because intent is crucial. B is incorrect because merely returning an item doesn't negate theft if intent existed. C is incorrect because lying alone doesn't constitute theft. D is the most accurate because it focuses on the crucial element of intent, which the prosecution would struggle to prove in this scenario."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: GDPR Section 2 Recital 18 (?) reads:\n\n> Not Applicable to Personal or Household Activities\n> \n> \n> This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with no connection to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities.\n\nWhat information do we have to determine what counts as \"a purely personal or household activity\"?\n\nData processing tools available to the individual have become much more powerful in recent years, and it seems this is likely to increase rapidly in the near future. Last year I thought the most powerful tools available to anyone that had the potential to break the GDPR were [bellingcat's](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/09/19/identifying-suspicious-businesses-reddit-analysis-and-tracking-russian-propaganda-here-are-the-results-of-bellingcats-first-ever-hackathon/) [tools](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2022/10/06/automated-map-searches-scam-busting-tools-and-twitter-search-translations-here-are-the-results-of-bellingcats-second-hackathon/) for building personal network graphs from public information such as social media and Companies House. However in the last month open source tools derived from [Meta\u2019s LLaMA](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/) Large Language Model have improved to the point that they are competitive with the best in the world and [Google expects them to eclipse this performance in coming months](https://natural20.com/google-ai-documents-leak/).\n\nFor example [Vicuna\\-13B](https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/) runs on a reasonable gaming computer and when asked \"tell me about \\[FIRST SURNAME] from \\[INSTITUTION]\" will provide a mostly inaccurate paragraph that includes some true personally identifiable information. This works for me and some others who have a web presence such as have published peer reviewed literature but are not in any way famous. [They have an online demo that requires no registration, you can try it yourself here](https://chat.lmsys.org/).\n\nIt seems at the very least it would be challenging to justify the use of such a tool under the GDPR. As I understand it all the information within the network is used to answer every question, even if just as far as \"do not use this bit of the network\". Therefore any use could be classed as the processing of personal data. Therefore if one wanted to download and experiment with such a model the easiest way would be to rely on the Household Activities exception. However it is not totally clear what would and would not be counted. What information could we use to try and determine if such a use was legal, and what the limits would be?\n\nPrevious Reaserch\n\n[The ICO has a page on the exceptions](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/) but that explicitly does not cover domestic purposes: \"This is simply because they are not covered by the UK GDPR\". It gives the topic two sentences, the first repeats the law and the second give a couple of examples that are not relevant here.\n\n[There is a denied FOI request](https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/decision-notices/2019/2615778/fs50807165-1.pdf) for \"any policy, guidance, lines\\-to\\-take or other material you hold on the scope of the exemption contained in GDPR art 2(2\\)(c) and/ or recital 18\" with the denial based on this information appearing in guidance including \"a final published version\". However I cannot find this guidance with either Google or the ICO website search.\n\n[There is a case from the Netherlands](https://www.fff-legal.com/the-household-exemption-in-gdpr/) that excludes posting photos of one's child on social media from the household use exception. While this may not directly relate to my question, it does illustrate the the exception can be interpreted quite narrowly. It rather surprised me as posting photos of one's children seems to be quite a big bit of social media.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The household exemption is part of Art 2 GDPR, which lays out the subject matter scope. Clearly, the use of LLMs and other technologies can be GDPR\\-covered processing of personal data, unless this is done \u201cby a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity\u201d. You cited Recital 18, which provides a bit more background, and gives correspondence, keeping addresses, and some social media use as examples of personal or household activities.\n\nThere is some CJEU case law on the GDPR household exemption.\n\nIn *Lindqvist* (C\\-101/01\\), the court noted:\n\n> 47\\. That exception must therefore be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals, which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people.\n\nThat case was about a personal blog about the lives of coworkers. It would likely have been fine for that person to keep a personal diary of those matters, but here the problem was publication to the internet. Since *anyone* could read it, the blog was not purely personal.\n\nA decade later in *Rynes* (C\u2011212/13\\), the court noted that the legislators' use of the word \"purely\" requires this exception to be interpreted narrowly:\n\n> 30\\. The fact that Article 3(2\\) of Directive 95/46 falls to be narrowly construed has its basis also in the very wording of that provision, under which the directive does not cover the processing of data where the activity in the course of which that processing is carried out is a \u2018purely\u2019 personal or household activity, that is to say, not simply a personal or household activity.\n\nSuch a narrow interpretation is also necessary to maintain the data subject's fundamental rights.\n\nNote that Directive 95/46 is the old Data Protection Directive which was replaced by the GDPR. It contains a household exception that is worded virtually identically to the one in the GDPR, so these old CJEU judgments remain directly applicable. They also remain relevant in the UK, as all of this predates Exit Day.\n\nTo my knowledge there has not been any further guidance on the household exception, neither by the ICO nor by the EDPB. This is also because these data protection agencies do not make law or policy, but merely apply it. It is up to courts to correctly interpret the household exception. In the Dutch case you mention (for [GDPRHub has more details](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Rb._Gelderland_-_C/05/368427) and the [original judgement is here](https://uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl/#!/details?id=ECLI:NL:RBGEL:2020:2521)), the court does not explain why exactly the household exemption wouldn't apply, but the narrow interpretation seems in line with the CJEU case law. I want to highlight in particular that the defendant in that case failed to demonstrate that the personal data in question wasn't accessible to an \"indefinite number of people\", to borrow the expression from the Lindqvist case.\n\nMy personal opinion is that this \"indefinite number of people\" aspect provides the clearest criterion for whether the household exception might apply. If processing activities are not shared at all, or only made available to close friends and family, there's a good chance the exception might apply. In the LLM context, to the degree that their use constitutes processing of personal data, running such models for personal amusement or out of personal curiosity is probably fine. It might also be OK to share such outputs in a closed chat group. But creating them for non\\-personal purposes (e.g. employment purposes) or disseminating them to the public could cause GDPR to apply. LLMs are far from the only scenario where such difficult questions arise. Another fun topic is the degree to which the use of LinkedIn is GDPR compliant (since no one uses that platform for purely personal purposes), or how large a friend group's Discord server can grow while still counting as \"purely personal\".\n\nIf the household exception doesn't apply, this means that data processing activities have to be performed in compliance with the GDPR. This doesn't generally means that they would be illegal. However, the use of AI models does pose some potential challenges:\n\n* What is the legal basis for *training* the models? Perhaps there is a *legitimate interest* for using publicly available data, maybe not. Can an unlawfully trained model still be used lawfully?\n* What is the legal basis for using the models for *inference*? This will depend massively on the *purpose* for which the models are used.\n* How does the use of (potentially wrong) AI output interact with the Art 5(1\\)(d) accuracy principle and the Art 22 restrictions on automated individual decision\\-making?\n* To which degree are *prompts* other people's personal data? How does this interact with the legal basis used for inference? Whose personal data is the output?",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A data scientist develops a large language model (LLM) using publicly available data from social media and academic publications. She runs the model on her personal computer to generate summaries about various individuals, including her colleagues and neighbors, out of curiosity. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the application of GDPR in this scenario?\n\nA) The household exemption definitely applies, as the data scientist is using the LLM for personal purposes on her own computer.\n\nB) The household exemption does not apply, as the LLM processes personal data of an indefinite number of people.\n\nC) The household exemption may apply, but only if the generated summaries are not shared with anyone else.\n\nD) The household exemption does not apply because the initial training data came from public sources.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The household exemption may apply in this case, but it depends on how the data scientist uses and shares the generated summaries. The key factors to consider are:\n\n1. The use is for personal curiosity, which aligns with the \"purely personal or household activity\" described in the GDPR.\n\n2. The processing is done on a personal computer, which supports the idea of a household activity.\n\n3. The critical factor is whether the generated summaries are shared with others. If they are kept private or shared only with a limited group of close friends or family, the household exemption is more likely to apply. If shared widely or made public, the exemption would not apply, as per the CJEU's ruling in the Lindqvist case.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the household exemption doesn't \"definitely\" apply; it depends on how the information is used and shared.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the LLM processes data from many people, the household exemption may still apply if the output is used purely for personal purposes and not shared widely.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the source of the training data doesn't necessarily determine whether the household exemption applies to the personal use of the model."

The cooperation agreement is a separate obligation that the defendant agreed to as part of the plea bargain.\n4.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal requirements for drafting ToS in the European Union?\n\nA) ToS must be written by a professional lawyer to be considered valid in the EU.\nB) ToS must be notarized to be legally binding in the EU.\nC) ToS can be written by the developer but must be validated by a lawyer before implementation.\nD) ToS can be written by the developer without requiring professional legal drafting or validation.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, there is no legal requirement in most jurisdictions, including the European Union, for Terms of Service to be written or validated by a professional lawyer. While it may be beneficial to have a lawyer review or draft the ToS, it is not mandatory for the document to be considered valid. The developer can write the ToS themselves without requiring professional legal drafting or validation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because professional legal drafting is not a requirement for ToS validity. Option B is wrong as notarization is not necessary for ToS, and even when required for certain contracts, it pertains to the signing process, not the drafting. Option C is incorrect as legal validation is not mandatory, though it might be advisable for complex services."

Consequently, players cannot be held legally liable for trading their virtual currency into real money if the game is being serviced in South Korea.

As evidenced by the South Korean Supreme Court ruling in 2009, some countries have explicitly legalized the exchange of virtual currency for real money, even if it violates the game's terms of service. This ruling demonstrates that local laws can supersede game policies in certain jurisdictions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legality is not universal and varies by country.

However, after reading the rather lengthy details of this Charter, it appears as if there are too many areas which leave the government \\- therefore, the healthcare workers \\- loopholes to make the decision for the family. However, this Charter does make it clear that the patient has many more rights than what were apparently available to them before this time. Example, one bullet points out that \"As per Supreme Court, all hospitals both governmental and private, are duty\\-bound to provide basic emergency medical care, and injured patients have the right to get emergency medical care.\" I would be extremely cautious, about the entire Charter. As one is able to discern by reading this simple example, they leave plenty of room for their own discretion as well. What I mean is this: though these hospitals are duty\\-bound to provide emergency medical care, this Charter does not provide for the level of care that these caregivers are duty\\-bound to give to these patients. A good provision is \"Such care must be initiated without demand for payment in advance, and the basic care should be given to the patient regardless of the ability to pay.\" Another point to pay attention to: Care must be \"initiated\" without demand in advance.\" No provision says they cannot stop the care and demand payment in full before continuing. Next, this provision states that \"the basic care should be given....\" So, when I am in an emergent situation, I expect the best care, not the basic care. However, in a few places I shall not name, basic is the best they provide.\nFurther into the Charter, one finds what you may be up against, \"Right to Confidentiality, Human Dignity, and Privacy.\" That is the 5th point, in succession. I'm of the opinion that the family may be facing quite the difficulty, as this provision states in the first bullet point: \"All patients have the right to privacy and doctors have a duty to hold information about their health conditions and treatment plans in the strictest confidence.\" The 15th condition in the Charter provides this: \"Right to Take Discharge of Patient....\" The bullet point, \"A patient has the right to take the discharge and cannot be detained in a hospital, on procedural grounds such as a dispute in payment of hospital charges.\"\nApparently, as I was prepossessed on this matter, the patient has all of these rights \\- the patient's family does not seem to possess any particular right to the patient in India even, in the hospital.\nResource:\nDo you know your rights as a patient?

Since there isn't a written easement, the determination has to be based upon actual use and necessity over the prescription period and there are all sorts of factors and arguments that can lead to the being larger or smaller.\n\nThe answer would also be influenced by how the issue presented itself in a court. One of the concerns about overhead power lines is the extent to which another use interferes with the operation of the activity that benefits from the prescriptive easement, this might be one thing for tall trees, another for activities that have significant electromagnetic output that could interfere with the lines, and a third for the erection of a fence that could interfere with the ability to line maintenance trucks to access the lines. It might be different for a high voltage trunk line and the local line getting electricity to the houses on a particular block. It might depend upon what kind of vehicle utility companies used to tend to these vehicles and could conceivably, for example, be reduced if it becomes possible to maintain these lines for air based drones rather than ground based crane trucks.\n\n> Would my pedestal (ok, really the power company owns it, not me)\n> qualify for me to have access to it (for the purpose of turning my\n> power on/off etc) under this prescriptive easement?

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Montana, a utility company has maintained overhead power lines across private property for over 20 years without a written easement. The company claims a 10-foot right-of-way under a prescriptive easement. The property owner wants to build a shed 8 feet from the power lines. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The utility company's claim of a 10-foot right-of-way is automatically enforceable because it's their stated policy.\n\nB) The property owner can build the shed without concern, as the prescriptive easement only covers the exact area where the power lines are located.\n\nC) The scope of the prescriptive easement would need to be determined by a court based on actual use and necessity over the prescriptive period.\n\nD) The property owner must abide by the 10-foot right-of-way unless they can prove the utility company has never used that full width for maintenance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In cases of prescriptive easements without written documentation, the exact scope of the easement is not automatically defined by either party's claims. Instead, if disputed, it would need to be determined by a court as a question of fact. The court would consider various factors including the actual use of the land, the necessity for maintenance, and the specific circumstances of the case over the prescriptive period. The utility company's stated policy of a 10-foot right-of-way is not automatically enforceable without supporting evidence of actual use and necessity. Similarly, the property owner cannot assume the easement is limited only to the exact location of the power lines. The court would need to weigh all relevant factors to determine the reasonable scope of the easement."

Let's say, I live in a XYZ country and Google cloud has a data center in my country and I use their service to keep my data in the cloud, in the data center that is present inside my country.\n\nIf the USA puts my country on the sanctioned list(or restricts trade), like Iran, then I suppose American companies won't be allowed to do any business with any citizen of my country. In this case, what happens to my data? Since to do any business in my country, a company has to register a local entity, there will be a separate entity that is \"Google XYZ\".\n\nIs it legal for \"Google XYZ\" to continue the operation in my country? Or Since this is a subsidiary or related to Google in the USA, it can't continue the business? (I have no idea how this type of setup works when a company opens a branch in another country)\n\nIf it is allowed, I guess I will be able to retrieve my data, but what if it's not technically feasible to retrieve data without going through infrastructure owned by Google in the USA?\n\nIf it is not allowed, then what happens to company assets in the sanctioned country? Like some have manufacturing units, some have data centers, and many other kinds of assets.\n\nI am a little worried since I saw how some people in Iran were locked out of Github without any option to export their data. And this case, the majority of cloud providers are American companies, so just wanted to get some clarity.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a specific answer about Iran, and a vague general answer. The vague general answer is \"It depend on what the sanctions are\". [Here](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/drcongo.pdf) is the summary of the sanctions against DR Congo. The gist of the sanctions is that they are directed against [7 particular individuals](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/13413.pdf). The prohibited transcations are described as:\n\n> Unless otherwise authorized or exempt, transactions by U.S. persons,\n> or in or involving the United States, are prohibited if they involve\n> transferring, paying, exporting, withdrawing, or otherwise dealing in\n> the property or interests in property of an entity or individual\n> listed on the SDN List. The property and interests in property of an\n> entity that is 50 percent or more directly or indirectly owned,\n> whether individually or in the aggregate, by one or more persons on\n> the SDN List are also blocked, regardless of whether the entity itself\n> is listed.\n\nIn the case of Iran, the sanctions are much broader, but not universal. Bear in mind that a service provider may take an action which is not absolutely mandated by US law, out of an abundance of caution and fear of misinterpreting the law. [Here is a list](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/topic/1611) of computer things that are allowed to flow to Iran. Note the following.\n\n> **441\\. Do the Personal Communications GLs authorize the exportation of fee\\-based cloud computing services to Iran and Sudan?**\n> \n> \n> Yes. Paragraphs (a)(1\\) of the Personal Communications GLs authorize\n> the exportation to Iran and Sudan of fee\\-based cloud computing\n> services incident to the exchange of personal communications over the\n> Internet. In addition, paragraphs (a)(2\\)(i) and (a)(3\\) authorize\n> software necessary to enable such services, provided that such\n> software is designated EAR99 or classified by the U.S. Department of\n> Commerce on the CCL under ECCN 5D992\\.c or, in the case of software\n> that is not subject to the EAR, would be designated EAR99 if it were\n> located in the United States or would meet the criteria for\n> classification under ECCN 5D992\\.c if it were subject to the EAR.\n\nWould that cover your interest? (Would you, as a business, take a risk in possibly mis\\-interpreting this guidance?)\n\nIndeed, [Github announced](https://github.blog/2021-01-05-advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/) earlier this year that it now has a license to operate in Iran (they don't discuss details what caused the [earlier restrictions](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/29/github-ban-sanctioned-countries/), which were not absolute). During that period, some users had access suspended (but not, it is reported, public repositories).",

As seen in the examples of Iran and DR Congo, sanctions can range from targeting specific individuals to broader restrictions on certain types of transactions. In some cases, like with GitHub in Iran, companies may be able to obtain licenses to continue providing certain services. The answer also acknowledges that some services may be allowed while others are restricted, reflecting the complexity of sanction compliance. Options A and B are too extreme and don't account for the nuanced nature of sanctions. Option D is not necessarily true, as transferring ownership doesn't guarantee compliance with sanctions."

I'm also sure you saw freestone rock walls; same property line function, different effort and effect.\n\nThere *may have been* laws that required property boundaries to be marked by hedges in years past. (Someone with more knowledge of UK laws can respond).

This Congress can't bind a future Congress (?)\n\nHowever, my layman's understanding of Congress's power also includes the notion that \"this Congress can't bind a future Congress\". Googling around has provided many instances of politicians and even law professors invoking this notion, but no authoritative source. Some (perhaps only weak) form of this principle must be true; otherwise this Congress could say \"no new laws can be passed after 2030 except by a 4/5s majority in Congress\" or whatever, effectively stripping future Congresses of all of their power.\n\n#### 3\\. So, \"mandatory\" for whom?\n\nThus I think my question is, for whom is the spending \"mandatory\"? Future Congresses? Could they just do a simple majority vote (assuming the President signs it) to alter \"mandatory\" spending? If so, is it really \"mandatory\"? And how would it then substantively differ from \"discretionary\" spending? Is \"mandatory\" really just an escape clause from requiring Appropriations by the House of Representatives?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Mandatory\" spending means spending that takes place without passage of a new appropriation bill, but it may still be modified by Congress. The only truly mandatory spending categories that cannot be modified by future Congresses are interest on the national debt and certain multiple year contractual obligations (e.g. for naval ship building contracts).\n\n\"Discretionary\" spending means spending that has to be appropriated each budget cycle. Without affirmative legislation, each budget cycle, it doesn't happen.\n\nThe distinction is important because the U.S. federal legislative process is frequently gridlocked with divided control with the President's political party (which has veto power), or with a division of partisan control between the two houses of Congress, each of which have veto power over the legislative process.\n\nIt takes the approval of both houses of Congress and the President to pass legislation except in the case of a rare veto override or a Senate and President approved treaty, which requires a two\\-thirds majority, and appropriations bills have to start in the U.S. House. If all three are not controlled by the same party, getting legislation passes as is necessary for discretionary spending, is challenging. So the status quo default of mandatory spending is hard to modify.",

Mandatory spending occurs automatically based on existing laws without requiring new legislation each year. This includes programs like Social Security and Medicare. Discretionary spending, on the other hand, requires Congress to pass new appropriation bills each budget cycle to authorize the spending.\n\nOption A is incorrect because most mandatory spending can be modified by future Congresses through new legislation, although it's more difficult to change than discretionary spending.\n\nOption C is incorrect because both types of spending are ultimately controlled by Congress, not solely by the President.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it mischaracterizes the nature of mandatory and discretionary spending.
