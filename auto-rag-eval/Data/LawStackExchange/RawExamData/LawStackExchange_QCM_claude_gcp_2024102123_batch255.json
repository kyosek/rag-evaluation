            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm writing an article about the misuse of statistics in the courtroom. Of course one can not have this conversation without mentioning of the so\\-called \"[Prosecutor's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor%27s_fallacy)\". Most of the examples of this date back to the late\\-90s/early 2000s e.g Sally Clark, Angela Cannings etc.\n\nThe fallacy involves statistical reasoning in court cases. Basically, it is the error of assuming that the odds of a false positive are the odds of the defendant's guilt. So when the expert witness declares that the DNA test is 99\\.9% accurate, the prosecution tells the jury this means there is only 0\\.1% chance that the defendant is innocent.\n\nMy question is has anything actually been done to address the issue of prosecutors and unqualified expert witnesses giving misleading statistics in the courtroom? Or have lawyers more or less learned their lesson from these instances and are more careful about it now?\n\nMoreover, does anyone know of any other general practises that have been implemented to help prevent faulty scientific analysis from being presented in court?\n\n(I'm asking mainly about the English legal system, however please feel free to present anything relevant about the American system or any other).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This [article on the Daubert Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard) is a reasonable intro\\-level presentation of the relevant case law for the US. This related to [\"Rule 702\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702), a rule governing the admissibility of evidence. The rule is based on, three Supreme Court rulings: Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; General Electric Co. v. Joiner; Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael. The main points of the rule are that the judge decides what is admissible (as opposed to judges letting anything be admitted and juries decide what they believe), and must determine that the expert testimony is relevant and reliable (it must be more likely than not that the expert's methods are reliable and reliably applied to the facts at hand). The court adopts the hypothesis\\-testing viewpoint, and proof/falsification is based on criteria for acceptance or rejection: is the theory generally accepted in the scientific community, has it been subjected to peer review and publication, is it even testable and has it been tested, is the (potential) rate of error acceptable, and does the supporting research exist independent of the proposed testimony.\n\nNeither prosecutors not defense attorneys testify, and there is little that can be done to limit the creativity of attorneys to ask questions that have the effect of making people believe that the question was a factual statement. Judgments of \"qualifications\" are extremely hard to make, however in some instances there are certification boards (typically, for any regulated industry such as mechanical engineering or medicine). Since I have no medical credentials, I doubt that any judge would allow me to testify as an expert witness on a medical question. Being a particle physicist is not a regulated industry at least in the US, so the criteria for expertise would be more subjective (judges aren't expected to know who the leading physicists are).\n\nThe general remedy for \"faulty scientific reasoning\" is cross\\-examination and competing testimony. That is, the \"other side\" needs a scientific consultant to point out the flaws in the reasoning. Word\\-of\\-mouth is one way that attorneys learn who to call, when scientific questions arise.",

These include peer review and publication, general acceptance in the scientific community, and an acceptable rate of error. However, the passage does not mention certification by a national board as a criterion. In fact, it states that for some fields like particle physics, \"the criteria for expertise would be more subjective.\" The other options (A, C, and D) are all explicitly mentioned as part of the Daubert Standard in the passage."

I was going to give Nintendo a call to ask if I can develop for a console that is older than I am. Should I do this? I do not want to get sued.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is going to depend on several things. \n\nFirst of all, do you have a lawful, licensed copy of the SDK? My understanding is that Nintendo only licensed the SDK to selected game companies. If what you have is an unauthorized copy, you do not have the legal right even to use it. If what you have is properly licensed, then you do. \n\nOr is what you have an unofficial SDK created by someone other than Nintendo?\n\nSecondly, what does the license agreement that comes with the SDK provide? Does it require developers to register with Nintendo? If it does, you will need to comply.\n\nNintendo cannot prevent others from writing programs designed to run on their hardware. But they can control who uses their development software, if they choose to. \n\nYou cannot reproduce in your game any of Nintendo's copyrighted software (or anyone else's) without permission. That applies even more strongly if you intend to sell the software. \n\nBut you can use any development software for which you have a valid license in whatever ways its license permits.

Using the SDK legally requires having a lawful, licensed copy and complying with the license agreement. This may include registration with Nintendo if required by the agreement. The developer cannot use unauthorized copies of the SDK or reproduce Nintendo's copyrighted software without permission.

If anything, that level of prescriptive specificity is likelier to be found in statutory law than in common law. That is why [I pointed out](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61436/what-is-the-extent-of-technically-feasible-in-common-law?noredirect=1#comment128617_61436) the relevance of the context, statute, or precedent you have in mind.\n\nLegal precedent in common law jurisdictions tends to focus on whether the reasons and circumstances merit requiring stricter compliance for the matter(s) at issue.

Courts tend to consider the specific context, circumstances, and balance of interests. In this case, a court would likely weigh the benefits of increased data security against the financial burden on the small business and the potential negative impact on users (slower site performance).

For example could a case heard in France (by\n> a French court) apply the laws of the US? If no, then what is the\n> point of such clauses?\n\nYes. This can be done and the example you provide could happen.\n\nThis is done in civil cases, but not in criminal cases. The other main exception is that a court will not apply another jurisdiction's tax laws, although this is less absolute and the other jurisdiction's tax laws may still be considered as relevant to a civil dispute, so long as they are not enforced.\n\nFor example, I have litigated a case where the events took place in France in a U.S. Court where the court had jurisdiction over the parties and the relevant choice of law rules pointed to French law.\n\nThe overarching principle of that the law of the place with the most significant connection to the legal issue decided applies. But there are many subsidiary rules that provide clarity in some areas (although the clarity was reduced with the effect of making forum law apply more often, in the 1960s\\-1980s after a previous regime of more black and white rules).\n\nA clause like this is generally effective if it the parties have any connection to the forum chosen. It is a close cousin, although not nearly so strongly preferred in the law, of an arbitration clause.\n\n> Also do such clauses go by other names than \"attornment\" clauses? This\n> article points out such a name is specific to Canada.\n\nYes. In the U.S. an \"[attornment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attornment)\" clause is a provision that requires a party to a contract to affirmatively declare upon notice from the other party if the attorning party claims that the other party is in breach of the contract or has unfulfilled obligations (with the attorning party waiving any claims for breach of contract not identified at that time). An \"attornment\" clause is normally found in a lease or secured promissory note and facilitates the transfer of the leased property or secured debt in a way that the new owner can know that there is no risk that it is already in default apart from the transferor's representation. Otherwise, the aggrieved party wouldn't have to mention anything until the statute of limitations arrived.\n\nAll of the meanings, including the Canadian one, go back to the notion of affirming the existence of certain rights in advance of a dispute arising between the parties.\n\n> This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and enforced in\n> accordance with, and the rights of the Parties shall be governed by,\n> the laws of the Province of Qu\u00e9bec and the federal laws of Canada\n> applicable therein (excluding any conflict of law rule or principle of\n> such laws that might refer such interpretation or enforcement to the\n> laws of another jurisdiction).\n\nThe language above is a choice of law clause.\n\n> The Parties hereby irrevocably attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of\n> the courts of the Province of Qu\u00e9bec, judicial District of Montreal,\n> with respect to any matters arising pursuant hereto.\n\nThe language above is a choice of forum clause, a.k.a. choice of jurisdiction clause, a.k.a. choice of venue clause.",

The choice of forum clause is particularly strong, using terms like \"irrevocably submit\" and \"exclusive jurisdiction.\" Courts generally respect such clauses unless there are compelling reasons not to do so.\n\nIn this scenario, the New York court would likely recognize the validity of the forum selection clause and dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction. The parties have agreed to litigate any disputes in Quebec, and courts typically enforce such agreements to prevent forum shopping and to respect the parties' contractual choices.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the New York court might apply Quebec law if it heard the case, the forum selection clause would prevent it from hearing the case in the first place.\n\nOption C is incorrect for the same reason as A, and additionally because it ignores the choice of law provision.\n\nOption D is incorrect because US courts generally don't have the power to directly transfer cases to foreign jurisdictions.

After picking up the vehicle he brought ANOTHER vehicle to us to customize and he was happy with that work. Unknown to us he needed to apply for a salvage title for the vehicle. He realized when he went to apply for the salvage title that only certain repair places can do the work for a salvage title so the great person he is decided to blame us and sue us in small claims court. \n\nWe are baffled as to why, but he won the judgement. The judge seemed to ask him all the questions that I would have asked him. Everything the judge asked and said in court seemed as if she was pointing out all of our points showing we performed the work requested and that he was happy enough to bring us more work but alas, we lost. Even more annoying is there was no reasoning for the ruling as the judge is not required in our small claims courts to give the reason, which I would like to know so we can learn from this to protect our business in the future. PS: (although I wanted to appeal for principal, I\u2019m learning as a new business owner that the time and money involved doesn\u2019t always make sense so we begrudgingly did not file an appeal). \n\nOnto my question: \nThe customer won the judgement. We have not paid the judgement yet but we\u2019re just recently notified of winning. \n\nToday we received notification from square that the customer has requested a chargeback. \n\nMy question is if the customer took the steps to get the courts involved, can they now ask for chargeback? Our initial thought is it should be handled through the courts to ensure the proper steps are taken through the court to show our payment of said judgement. \n\nIf it should be handled through the court instead of the customer now initiating a chargeback, what should my response be to American Express (the card that the customer used)? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't see any obvious reason that he can't make a charge back. Indeed, the judgment would solidify his ability to do so.\n\nYou would be justified in turn to insist that he treat the charge back as a satisfaction, or at least a partial satisfaction, of his judgment depending upon the amount involved. A charge back in this context is really just a form of payment. Money leaves your bank account and goes into his, just as it would if you had written him a check.\n\nThere should be a form of filing a satisfaction (or partial satisfaction) of judgment with the court to reflect your payment (or partial payment) of the judgment.",

The customer has now initiated a chargeback on their credit card for the original payment. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The customer cannot initiate a chargeback because they have already won a court judgment.\n\nB) The chargeback invalidates the court judgment, and the business owner no longer needs to pay the court-ordered amount.\n\nC) The chargeback can proceed, but the business owner should file for a satisfaction or partial satisfaction of judgment with the court to reflect this payment.\n\nD) The business owner must refuse the chargeback and only pay through court-ordered channels.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the expert response, there is no obvious reason why the customer cannot initiate a chargeback, even after winning a court judgment. In fact, the judgment may strengthen their ability to do so. The chargeback is essentially a form of payment, where money moves from the business owner's account to the customer's. \n\nThe business owner should treat this chargeback as a satisfaction (if it covers the full judgment amount) or a partial satisfaction of the judgment. To properly document this, the business owner should file a satisfaction or partial satisfaction of judgment with the court. This ensures that the payment is officially recorded and credited towards the court-ordered amount.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the customer can still initiate a chargeback despite the court judgment. Option B is wrong because the chargeback doesn't invalidate the judgment; it's a means of satisfying it. Option D is incorrect as there's no requirement to refuse the chargeback or pay only through court channels."

Isn't it entirely a state matter?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The constitution delegates the power of selecting Electors to the states themselves, through whatever method the state legislature so chooses (today it is always through a popular vote, in most cases statewide but in two cases it is done also by district). Elections for the Senate and Congress are also specifically delegated as to be done however each state legislature so chooses. A right to vote isn't mentioned in the constitution until the suffrage amendments. These protected the right to vote independent of race, servitude, and gender. Moreover, they granted Congress the authority to legislate so as to achieve these ends. So there is federal power intersecting with voting, at least.\n\nThose probably aren't the bone of contention here, however. The claimed issue, as I understand it, is actually from the first part. The claim is that what is going on\u2014extending deadlines etc. via decisions of election boards, court orders, or whatever\u2014is a violation of the Constitution delegating control over voting to the legislatures. In the case of decisions by election boards (or similar thing), as the legislature in question will have of necessity passed legislation empowering the board to make such a decision on their own, it boils down to whether or not the legislature is held to have the power to delegate that power or not. There's no hard and fast rule for this: sometimes the US Congress has been held to have delegated too much, other times it's held to be just fine (and Kavanaugh, I think, seems inclined to think it has delegated too much in general and this needs to be addressed). For court orders, it becomes a question of whether the court has the authority to make such orders, or if this is an infringement of a power reserved to the legislatures.\n\nEither way, it becomes a constitutional issue: do actions of election boards, duly enacted by legislation, or court orders, (sometimes) run afoul of the Constitutional grant of this power to the state legislatures? Chief Justice Roberts appears to be trying to toe a line where he does not want to get involved with second\\-guessing state election boards and state courts, wanting to just let those stand as state matters reserved to them by the constitution. His problem, it would seem, is with what federal courts can do, and he seems open to reviewing decisions from federal courts that concern the exercise of state powers on elections. In other words, he seems inclined to let stand a state court ruling to extend a deadline, but may take issue with a *federal* court issuing such a ruling. Of course, there are now 5 other \"conservative\" justices besides Roberts, only 4 of which are needed to hear a case, so the ability for Roberts to get the court to go along with this apparent line of legal reasoning will be strongly dependent on his ability to convince at least two of those conservatives of the correctness, or at least wisdom, of doing so. But that's another matter that goes beyond the question you've asked.",

Are forced contributions to charity, pay reductions during an economic crisis, fines for not meeting performance goals, and others legally above board?\n\nFrom my limited understanding of US labor law, an employer is free to reduce pay going forward for any reason that isn't covered by specific anti\\-discrimination laws. And as a company\\-wide measure applied to future pay this also doesn't seem like it could be construed as an illegal deduction. But I'm not finding a straight answer.\n\nThis question was inspired by [this question about an employer reducing pay to buy the CEO's book](https://workplace.stackexchange.com/questions/157513/) and [this off\\-site article](https://www.askamanager.org/2018/11/my-employer-fined-me-90-for-being-late.html) about an employer fining people for being late.\n\n**Can an employer apply what are effectively one\\-off pay cuts** through enforced contributions, fines or other measures? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can an employer apply one\\-off pay cuts via forced contributions?\n\nNo. This type of issues pertains to state law, and many (if not all) jurisdictions in the U.S. have statutes prohibiting forced deductions that are neither ordered by court, nor pursuant to bargaining agreements, nor as *required or expressly permitted by law*. See, for instance, [MCL 408\\.477](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(urifoxdxvwxdbsl321wg2lo5))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-408-477) and [.478](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(urifoxdxvwxdbsl321wg2lo5))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-408-478).\n\nThe case of the CEO's book sounds in clear violation of MCL 408\\.477(2\\) since the user who asked on Workplace SE mentions that the employees did not consent to that deduction.\n\nEven if an employee consents to the deduction, it is important to discern between (1\\) his *altruistic* consent, and (2\\) his concession for the sake of continuation of employment. Unless the consent is altruistic, the clause(s) allowing for the deduction might be rendered null and enforceable by virtue of [*Restatement (Second) of Contracts*](https://www.fbcoverup.com/docs/library/1981-Restatement-Second-of-Contracts-1981.pdf) at \u00a7 178(1\\) in relation to the aforementioned statutes.\n\nAny form of deductions as a permissible sanction (as fining when the employee gets late to work) would have to be provided in the agreement between employer and employee. Otherwise it is unlawful.",

Deducting money for tardiness without prior agreement would violate this statute.\n\nB) is incorrect as it constitutes a forced contribution, which is not allowed under Michigan labor law.

The Australian example shows severe penalties (up to 10 years imprisonment or large fines) for unauthorized possession of another's passport. The answer also notes that if the true owner asks for the passport's return and is refused, this would certainly be illegal. The severity of the Australian penalties suggests that similar acts in the UK would also be treated as serious offenses.

Some teachers, however, ignore this, and have students use their phones to answer questions in real time (via something like TopHat). \n\nNow let's say Alice has her phone out when she should not, and it is taken away by the teacher. It is returned sometime later. Then Alice's mother tells Alice's teacher that the phone is her property, not her daughter's, not the teacher's, that only Alice has permission to use it, and that if the teacher takes the phone away again, the mother considers it theft and (legal threat here). \n\n**Can the teacher/district take the phone anyway due to In Loco Parentis?**\n\nNote: For the record, the better solution for the district is to simply give detentions every time Alice violates the rule from now on, leading to eventual suspension and expulsion, but I'm far more interested in how much parenting authority a teacher/school can legally exert even when the actual parents are *clearly and conspicuously opposed to such exertion.* \n\n**Bonus Question: The phone is actually Alice's property, bought and paid for with money Alice earned at her job. Does this change the answer?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The school can confiscate a cell phone if you violated phone usage policy, because schools have broad powers to set student conduct policies. Searching the phone is a separate matter: a search requires reasonable suspicion and the search has to be narrowly related to that suspicion. As long as there is an actual policy and a violation of the policy, there seems to be no limit on confiscating phones.\n\nSchool authority over children in the US was historically justified by reference to the *in loco parentis* doctrine since [State v. Pendergrass](https://la.utexas.edu/users/jmciver/357L/19NC365.html), 19 N.C. 365, granting school \"the authority necessary for preserving discipline\", which is \"analogous to that which belongs to parents, and the authority of the teacher is regarded as a delegation of parental authority\". More contemporary rulings on the question of school authority, again in the domain of \ncorporal punishment,\nas articulated in [Ingraham v. Wright](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/430/651/), 430 U.S. 651 find that \n\n> the concept of parental delegation has been replaced by the view \\-\\-\n>  more consonant with compulsory education laws \\-\\- that the State itself\n>  may impose such corporal punishment as is reasonably necessary \"for\n>  the proper education of the child and for the maintenance of group\n>  discipline\".\n\nIn other words, the courts do not rely on the parental doctrine to justify school authority, instead they rely on what is reasonably necessary to achieve an end. Thus in [New Jersey v. T.L.O](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/469/325), 469 U.S. 325, *in loco parentis* was rejected as a rationale for an unconstitutional search, reasoning \n\n> If school authorities are state actors for purposes of the\n>  constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and due process, it\n>  is difficult to understand why they should be deemed to be exercising\n>  parental rather than public authority when conducting searches of\n>  their students.\n\nInstead, the court frames the test in terms of competing interests:\n\n> Against the child's interest in privacy must be set the substantial\n>  interest of teachers and administrators in maintaining discipline in\n>  the classroom and on school grounds.\n\nSince school authority to confiscate cell phones does not rest on acting according to the wishes of the parent, it is irrelevant that the parent approves of the child's actions. They may take the phone away, but it is not because of *in loco parentis*, it's because of necessity. It does not matter whose property it is; and it is not theft, because the confiscation was lawful.\n\n*In loco parentis* is not necessarily dead, see [Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/515/646/), 515 U.S. 646, where compulsory drug testing was justified, finding that\n\n> the Policy was undertaken in furtherance of the government's\n>  responsibilities, under a public school system, as guardian and tutor\n>  of children entrusted to its care...\n> \n> \n> when the government acts as guardian and tutor the relevant question\n>  is whether the search is one that a reasonable guardian and tutor\n>  might undertake\n\nIt is not part of a school's remit to promulgate the drug\\-free life, so drug testing cannot be justified by appeal to necessity. Disciplinary matters are squarely within the scope of what is necessary for schools, so disciplinary questions don't need to rely on *in loco parentis*. In the Vernonia case, the court still finds that the state has limited reach to override the rights of children \u2013 parents still have much broader rights to restrict children than the state does. For the state, the matter has to reduce to a compelling state interest, whereas parental power isn't even subject to [rational basis review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_basis_review).",

Alice's mother claims the phone is her property and threatens legal action if it's taken again. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal basis for the school's authority to confiscate the phone?\n\nA) The school can confiscate the phone based on the doctrine of in loco parentis, which gives them the same authority as parents.\n\nB) The school cannot confiscate the phone because it violates the parent's property rights and constitutes theft.\n\nC) The school can confiscate the phone based on the necessity of maintaining discipline and enforcing school policies, regardless of parental objections.\n\nD) The school can only confiscate the phone if they have reasonable suspicion to search its contents.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Modern court rulings have moved away from relying solely on the in loco parentis doctrine to justify school authority. Instead, schools can take disciplinary actions, such as confiscating phones, based on what is reasonably necessary to maintain discipline and enforce school policies. This authority exists regardless of parental objections or property ownership. The necessity of maintaining a proper educational environment supersedes individual parental wishes in this context. Options A and B are incorrect because they misrepresent the current legal understanding of school authority. Option D is incorrect because it confuses the rules for searching a phone's contents with the authority to confiscate it for policy violations."

For example it increases the penalty for vandalizing government property, creates offenses for assault on a first responder carrying out their duties (depending on the severity of the assault), increases the penalty for aggravated rioting, obstruction of highways and so on. It also clarifies that being assembling or being present at the scene of a riot is not an offense. The only new crime created is assault on a first responder. Unauthorized camping on state property was already a crime: this is an increase in the penalty for committing that crime. It does have a requirement for notice and continued violation for 24 hours, unlike vandalism where if you do the deed, you can be arrested.\n\nThe courts have not held that the First Amendment protects the right to trespass, assault or commit vandalism. The only viable avenue for a legal challenge is that the punishment is cruel and unusual (too severe). A change from Class A misdemeanor to Class E felony is the smallest increment in penalty. The state will argue that the increase in penalty is necessary to maintain public order, and that it is not arbitrary or capricious, because there have been many recent violations of the law. In general, when laws are frequently disobeyed, it is legal for the government to increase the penalty for breaking the law in order to achieve compliance.",

It does not require the condition to be terminal or have a specific time frame for expected death. The key criteria are that the patient's suffering is unbearable with no prospect of improvement.\n\nWashington, California, and Oregon all have more restrictive definitions that typically require the condition to be terminal with an expected death within 6 months. \n\nThe Canadian law, while more flexible than the U.S. states mentioned, still requires that natural death has become \"reasonably foreseeable,\" which might not apply in this case.\n\nThe Netherlands' law focuses more on the quality of life and suffering of the patient rather than a specific prognosis of imminent death, making it the most likely jurisdiction where such a patient could qualify for assisted suicide."

The defense claims that Trigg was not acting in the course of employment or was acting without real or apparent authority. Given this information, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The defense's claim is valid because Trigg may have been acting in his personal capacity rather than as a representative of the company.\n\nB) The defense's claim is inconsistent because as the sole director and shareholder, Trigg always has apparent authority to bind the company.\n\nC) The defense's claim is plausible because even as a director, Trigg might act outside his authority in certain situations.\n\nD) The defense's claim is likely a result of using a standard form without adapting it to the specific circumstances of the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The defense's claim that Trigg was not acting in the course of employment or was acting without real or apparent authority is inconsistent with the facts presented. As the sole director, president, and sole shareholder of Trigg & Co., Jonathan Trigg would typically have full authority to act on behalf of the company. The claim that he was not acting in the course of employment or without authority is implausible given his position.\n\nThe most likely explanation for this inconsistency is that the lawyers used a standard form for the defense without properly adapting it to the specific circumstances of this case. This oversight resulted in including defenses that don't align with the actual situation of Trigg's role in the company.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they attempt to justify the defense's claim, which is fundamentally inconsistent with Trigg's position in the company. Option B, while correctly pointing out the inconsistency, doesn't address the likely reason for this error in the defense."

That's an extreme example. But when you read terms and conditions of popular apps such as Facebook, WhatsApp and many other sites why is it that the person clicking yes or no is not legally challenged about their credentials especially when the party asking has set those terms?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Admissibility is an evidence question. If there is a business record or sworn testimony that can establish a fact, and it is relevant, then it is admissible evidence at trial.\n\nYou really seem to be asking, instead, if this kind of measure, if it is established that it was taken with admissible evidence, should be sufficient as a matter of substantive law, to establish someone's age. Ultimately, Law.SE answers what the law is, of course, and not what it \"should be\".\n\nThere are federal laws and regulations that govern regulating the age of people using websites. Those laws are quite lenient, and really only currently require minimal, easily circumvented measures (although these measures are sufficient to prevent people with computers outfitted with age restricted software parental controls out), in part, because they only prevent people from seeing images or data over the web, and it is inherently difficult to regulate this (an older friend, or a fake login as a parent, for example, could circumvent it).\n\nOne of the main regulations if the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule):\n\n> COPPA imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online\n> services directed to children under 13 years of age, and on operators\n> of other websites or online services that have actual knowledge that\n> they are collecting personal information online from a child under 13\n> years of age.\n\nLots of frequently asked questions about the rule are answered [here](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions-0). One of those rules notes that:\n\n> Although COPPA does not apply to teenagers, the FTC is concerned about\n> teen privacy and does believe that strong, more flexible, protections\n> may be appropriate for this age group. See FTC Report: Protecting\n> Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: Recommendations for\n> Businesses and Policymakers (Mar. 2012\\), at 29, 60\\. The FTC also has\n> issued a number of guidance documents for teens and their parents.\n> These educational materials are available at [www.OnguardOnline.gov](http://www.OnguardOnline.gov).\n\nBasically, for older teens, however, primary responsibility is placed on parents and guardians, and not on Internet Service providers.\n\nMore substantial limitations are generally imposed when web activity has some real world consequence like delivery of alcohol to a home, or purchasing something with a credit card.\n\nThe law could impose more strict standards, but so far, it doesn't.",

If not the only way I can think of getting around this is by using something like having a form on the html email that 'posts' the data to the landing page, but I'm not sure if that would work.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first question is if you have the right to have this data in the first place. E\\-mail and name will typically be covered by contract reasons; you may need consent for other pieces of information if they are not needed to fulfill the contract or legal obligations. Other data may require the user's consent.\n\nSending to a user his own data is not an issue, as e\\-mail is usually considered a safe communication channel.\n\nA different issue is that, by using this mechanism, that data is going to appear in more places than needed. For example, in your server and firewall logs, that registers accesses to `https://business.lee-m123.example/login?email=mysecreteemail@gmail.com&name=DrDoom`, for example. These registers then become affected by the GDPR, and if the person asks you to provide which information do you have about them, you have to include them1.\n\nAdditionally, someone could object to the system on the grounds of data rectification. If a customer tells you \"My name is not Larry, but Lawrence (or, FWIW, Vanessa)\", the link will still fill the fields with the old name. I would say that you would be ok (it is not your data that is wrong), but a less technically savvy person may object and get upset and force you to do some work explaining your system without need; and in the best of cases it is a nuisance to your customer who will be correcting the name each time.\n\nFrom a technical POV I do not understand why you do not just send an ID in the parameters and then, when you get that ID, fill the forms with the data that you have in your database. And of course, keep that form protected2 with a password or whatever so nobody can just pass random IDs and retrieve your users data without proving that it is them.\n\n---\n\n1It would also become an issue if the user asks you to delete your records about him; you might be able to claim \"legitimate needs\" to keep the logs but it is still an unnecessary trouble.\n\n2Because you are already protecting that form from unauthorized access, AREN'T YOU?",

Moreover, license clearly states responsibility of the vendor, what uses are permitted, etc.\n\nIf you visit a site (f.e. law.stackexchange.com), it contains links to a code (javascript) to be automatically loaded and executed by user's computer in a browser.\n\nWhat rules are governing those relations?\n\n1. Browser runs code automatically, and it's by design. Authors put a lot of efforts to make it 'automatically run'.\n2. User hasn't consented to any license before executing a code.\n\nI see two options:\n\n1. Every user run code without a license, and is guilty of breaking copyright.\n2. There is an implicit permission to run a code (by the way it was implemented).\n\nBut if there is an 'implicit permission', where this permission ends? Can user download a code (it's already downloading it), save it (it's already saving it to the browser cache), and run in own environment (it's already running it)? And if so, can user do this (download\\-save\\-execute) in 'unexpected' environment? F.e. instead of browser with UI, execute it in own `phantom.js` or other 'headless' browser for own merits, outside of intentions of code authors?\n\nHow this situation is handled? Is it legal to execute a JS from publicly available site?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This question is somewhat answered [here](https://www.bitlaw.com/copyright/license.html#implied):\n\n> A commonly discussed scenario where implied licenses are destined to\n> play a major role is on the World Wide Web. When a Web page is viewed\n> in a Web browser, the page is downloaded through the Internet and\n> placed on the user's screen. It is clear that a copy of the Web page\n> is being made by the user. It is also clear that the Web page is\n> protected against unauthorized copying by copyright law. But it would\n> not make sense to allow the author of a Web page to sue a user who\n> viewed her page, since the author intended that the page be viewed by\n> others when she placed it on the World Wide Web. Rather, attorneys\n> argue, courts should find that the Web page author has given end users\n> an implied license to download and view the Web page. *The extent of\n> this implied license is unclear, and may someday be defined by the\n> courts*.\n\n[This article](https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=4261&context=nclr) discusses the issue and includes discussion of case law, but your question is not answered, in the US, other than to say that there is an implied license. [Field v. Google](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2408379/field-v-google-inc/), Inc., 412 F.Supp. 2d 1106 seems to be most on\\-point: see the implied license section of the opinion, where the court granted Google access to an implied license defense because plaintiff failed to take the actions standardly taken to override an implied license. But the court did not draw bright lines as to what usage is (in general) implicitly licensed \u2013 that would depends on the surrounding customs of computer usage.\n\nThe basic logic of the implied license is that it would make no sense for a person to put out a web page that executes code and not intend that the code be executed: it it does make sense that they didn't intend the code to be copied and redistributed. The line is somewhere between those two extremes (don't even execute, vs. complete permission).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the concept of implied license for web content, which of the following actions is most likely to be considered legally permissible without explicit permission from the website owner?\n\nA) Downloading and storing JavaScript code from a public website for personal archival purposes\nB) Running a website's JavaScript code in a headless browser for automated data collection\nC) Viewing a website's content in a standard web browser\nD) Redistributing a website's JavaScript code on your own website\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The concept of implied license suggests that when a website owner makes content publicly available, they implicitly grant permission for certain uses. Viewing a website's content in a standard web browser (option C) is the most basic and expected use of web content, and is almost certainly covered by implied license.\n\nOption A (downloading for personal archival) and B (running in a headless browser) fall into a gray area. While the code is technically downloaded and executed when visiting a site normally, using it in ways not intended by the site owner may exceed the scope of implied license.\n\nOption D (redistributing code) is likely not covered by implied license, as it goes beyond personal use and could infringe on the site owner's copyright.\n\nThe correct answer is C because it represents the most fundamental and widely accepted use of web content, which is viewing it in a standard browser as intended by the website owner."

There is no provision in copyright law that forces copyright holders to release or distribute their works, even if they are not actively doing so. The purpose of copyright is to protect the rights of the creator or rights holder, not to ensure public access to the work.

However, this is more restricted than the US \"fair use\" doctrine. To comply with fair dealing, the blogger must:\n\n1. Use the images specifically for the purpose of criticism or review.\n2.

If you stop paying the finance company, they will initiate legal proceedings against you to make good on your obligation, and that won't affect what the contractor does. It might not hurt you to write a formal letter (no phone calls) to the contractor stating that you require them to complete the job by some date certain, and hope that you won't have to take the matter to court. If you decide to write the letter yourself, you want to avoid saying anything that could be held against your interest, for example \"I don't care how crappy a job you do, I just want this job done!\": you need to be sure that what you say in a letter does not put you at a legal disadvantage. The best way to guarantee that is to hire an attorney to write the letter. If you want your money back (plus interest), you will almost certainly need to hire an attorney to write the letter.\n\nIt is possible that there is an arbitration clause in your contract, requiring you to settle disputes with the firm Dewey, Cheatham \\& Howe. In that case, your attorney might not be able to do much for you. There cannot be a clause in a contract that penalizes you simply for hiring an attorney.",

Ukraine has granted the ICC \"ad hoc jurisdiction\" since 2014, which allows the court to investigate potential war crimes and crimes against humanity committed on Ukrainian territory. This is a crucial point because neither Ukraine nor Russia are full parties to the Rome Statute.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there's no mention of the UN Security Council authorizing jurisdiction in this case.

It could be an offer to trade for the information as a trade secret, it could be the disclosure of a method.\n\n> what would be the minimum effort needed to keep the idea free?\n\nPrior art is defined by availability to the **public**. If I invented a new way to make Widgets, that method would need to be available to the public. The cheapest and most efficient way to disseminate the method to create Widget is not to patent it, but to publish it in a scientific or technical magazine in the right area. This not just makes many people aware of it, but it also makes sure that any company worth it's salt might counterclaim any patent filed based on the paper.\n\n> From time to time, I get an idea that seems (to me) marketable.\n\nThough, I need to pull this tooth of yours: 99% of all ideas that people think are marketable are either not developed enough to get to market, lack a market demand, or are already prior art.

I scan it and then file it away in a box.\n\nI have a lot of these certificates, and they take up substantial room in my small office. I've never had cause to use one in any way. When I've had to prove ownership I've always relied on either scans of the certificate or just going directly to the copyright office website.\n\nIs there any realistic situation where a court decision might hinge on producing the original physical paper certificate? Or are they just souvenirs that I can safely shred?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\n> Is there any realistic situation where a court decision might hinge on\n> producing the original physical paper certificate?\n\nYes. But there are alternative options to prove the same thing, even then.\n\nA copyright registration certificate is not like a dollar bill or an original promissory note, where a copy isn't as good as the original, even though it can be slightly convenient to have the original in hand.\n\n> Or are they just souvenirs that I can safely shred?\n\nIf you scan them and then shred them, nothing horrible will happen. In the rare worst case scenario where the fact of your registration is disputed by a stubborn defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit all of the way up to trial, you could get a replacement certified copy from the Copyright Registrar, or you could prove your registration with other evidence.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nRegistration is not required for a copyright to come into being in U.S. law. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102(a) and 408(a). But it is a condition precedent (i.e. a requirement that must be met prior to taking action) to certain legal remedies. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 412\\. So, proving your registration is usually one element of your infringement claim in a typical copyright infringement lawsuit.\n\nIn that lawsuit, if you actually go to trial, you need to prove that the copyright was registered in a timely fashion, if the other side won't stipulate to that fact.\n\nBut it would be rare for a defendant who had been presented with a copy to insist that the fact of registration be proven at trial because being that stubborn is likely to piss off the judge unless they can successfully prove that you have faked your claim to have a registered copyright, which is something that almost no intelligent lawyer in a copyright infringement lawsuit wants to do, since judges have broad discretion on so many issues, even in a jury trial.\n\nThe easiest way to prove the fact that your copyright was registered on a particular date is to offer up a certified government document like the ones that you have in your office into evidence as an exhibit (typically, one of your very first exhibits in your infringement case). This is because an official government certificate is exempt from the hearsay rule, is \"self\\-authenticating\" ,and its contents are admissible if not barred by another rule of evidence (which it almost never would be). The legal reason for keeping these paper documents is to get that evidentiary benefit at trial. *See* Federal Rules of Evidence [803(8\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_803) (exceptions to the hearsay rule), [902](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_902) (self\\-authentication) and [1005](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_1005) (admissibility of public records).\n\nOf course, mostly, these fancy certificates are issued as a matter of pride and ego and customer satisfaction. Prior to an actual trial or evidentiary hearing in a copyright infringement lawsuit, a copy, supported by your declaration under penalty of perjury that the copy isn't a fake, would be the usual way to establish your registration in documents that are e\\-filed through the federal electronic e\\-filing service called CM/ECF rather than presented in person on paper anyway.\n\nTypically, pretrial document disclosure is done via an electronic transmission of scanned copies as well.\n\nIn practice, it would be quite rare for a defendant in a copyright infringement lawsuit to insist that you prove up your registration at trial, rather than just stipulating to it. Indeed, it is you who might not want to stipulate in a jury trial, just so you can flash an important looking document in front of the jurors right at the start of the trial for dramatic effect. But you don't have to do that.\n\nUltimately, if the defendant really did insist on proof of your registration, you could get a new certified copy from the Copyright Registrar (which wouldn't be quite as pretty, but would have the same legal effect) for a small fee without too much advanced notice, or you could introduce your scanned copy into evidence and authenticate it through, for example, your testimony on the stand under oath that you scanned the original and that it is a true and correct copy of the original.\n\nYou also might want to keep a paper copy because it will still be around if all of the relevant electronic records are destroyed or inaccessible for some reason. But if that happens, copyright infringement may be the least of your worries.",

While the original paper Certificate of Registration can be useful in court, it is not absolutely necessary. In most legal proceedings prior to trial, a scanned copy of the certificate, accompanied by a sworn declaration of its authenticity, is typically sufficient. This is especially true for electronic filings and pretrial document disclosures.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because, although the original certificate can be convenient, there are alternative ways to prove registration, including obtaining a certified copy from the Copyright Office or using other forms of evidence.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the paper certificate does have legal value, particularly as a self-authenticating document exempt from the hearsay rule in court. However, it's not the only way to prove registration.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because courts do not exclusively rely on electronic records from the copyright office website. While this information can be useful, courts will accept various forms of evidence to prove copyright registration, including copies of the paper certificate or testimony authenticating a scanned copy."

Some searches have a $3 cap, others have no cap, meaning that a query with many results can cost literally hundreds of dollars. (Be VERY careful what you search for).\n* Dockets (long tables listing the documents in cases) cost 10\u00a2 per \"page\" with the now\\-familiar $3 cap.\n* There's $30 free per user per calendar quarter (January\\-March, April\\-June, etc). Exceed that amount you get charged the full price; stay under that amount and it's free for that quarter.\n\nSearch results and dockets are priced by the \"page\", but if you dig deeply, few people within even PACER itself know what a \"page\" of a docket or search results is, because those are just web pages (how many pages is this webpage??).\n\nIf you dig deeply enough, you'll eventually learn that [web pages are priced by the amount of data retrieved from their back end database, at a cost of 10 cents per 4,320 bytes of data](https://free.law/2016/11/03/what-is-a-pacer-page) (it took me two weeks to get that answer). The Judicial Branch makes about $140M/year this way.\n\nAll is not lost however!

If you install this before you log into PACER, you will send us copies of anything you buy and we will give you a free copy of anything somebody else has ever bought.\n\nFinally, you need to know that PACER isn't a single system, but rather is about 200 separate installations of the same system, one per courthouse, each with its own website.

Essentially, someone prepares a map of the initial boundaries of the municipality and a proposed name and proposed charter to a court of general jurisdiction in that area in a petition that also recites that all requirements to form a municipality have been met, and then gives public notice to everyone owning property in the area, usually by both mail and publication.\n\nOne or more hearings are held at which the court determines if notice was adequate and that the petition complies with the statute, and hears any objections (e.g. that some of the land is subject to some other municipality, or that someone doesn't want to be in the municipality, or that the population is insufficient to qualify).\n\nIf every property owner has consented in writing and it meets the requirements either with no objection, or with objections not supported when an evidentiary hearing is held on the objections, then the municipality is created. Otherwise, if any objections are overcome following hearings on them, then the judge orders that a vote be conducted, and if a sufficient percentage vote and a sufficient percentage of voters support creating it, then the municipality comes into being. An election for initial elected officials is held either contemporaneously with the formation vote or separately shortly afterwards.\n\nSometimes, much less commonly these days, a municipal government or local government is created by a law passed to create it.\n\nIn Colorado, the relevant statute is Colorado Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 [31\\-2\\-101](https://codes.findlaw.com/co/title-31-government-municipal/co-rev-st-sect-31-2-101.html) to 31\\-2\\-109\\.\n\nIn practice, it is now very rare that new municipalities are created. Most developers (developers were the usual creators of municipalities in earlier days), instead, establish large homeowner's associations and/or special district in lieu of a municipality, as it provides for more developer control and is not subject to the limitations particular to general purpose governmental entities.",

I'm still worried that what I'm doing might be illegal, though.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm pretty sure the basic thrust of the matter is \"you're protected by the first amendment protections of speech and journalism\", though I think formally speaking the exact legal status of nuclear weapons publications are not entirely clear. Cases about it have tended to fall apart and get dropped before precedents got set.\n\nThe [Atomic Energy Act of 1946](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Energy_Act_of_1946) ostensibly automatically classifies and controls any and all information about nuclear weapons, regardless of the circumstances of their creation. [United States v. Progressive, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Progressive,_Inc.) was a case about a publication purporting to reveal the secrets of the H\\-bomb, and based on unclassified/public information, that was challenged under this provision. Ultimately the case was dropped by the government, and many legal pundits believed it likely that SCOTUS would have ruled the provision an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech. But it otherwise appears to be valid law, at least in the sense of not having been struck down by a court, to this day. [The government has tried to censor publications even within the last decade](https://www.afr.com/world/north-america/hydrogen-bomb-physicists-book-runs-foul-of-us-energy-department-20150401-1mcp4g), though with limited success, in part because of the [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect): aggressively trying to prevent people from looking at it just gives it free publicity and makes more people look at it. A more successful attempt by the government appears to be the case of [\"The A\\-bomb kid\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Aristotle_Phillips), who wrote a college paper with a design for a nuclear weapon, and made a mockup of the design, both of which were confiscated by the FBI, but this was back in 1976 (and said kid later wrote a book about the whole thing).\n\nThat said, there are quite a number of ways of easily finding varying levels of nuclear weapons designs online already. [Including on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon). Government policy across the world has usually been to never acknowledge any purported leaks in any way; the US Department of Energy calls it their \"no comment\" policy. But such purported leaks do exist and can be found with relative ease, and many of the weapons designs you can find are based both on such leaks, as well as reverse engineering from non\\-weapons nuclear technologies such as nuclear reactors. The government is far more likely to try to restrain those who have actually encountered actual governmental nuclear weapons information, and have signed NDAs, but even then it rarely succeeds or pushes too hard. Most of the scientists who worked on developing the first nuclear weapons have published or publicly stated information concerning such endeavors, after all (though usually not terribly deep and technical; scientists have self\\-censored on nuclear weapons pretty much since German scientists first made public their possibility in the early 1930s).\n\nAs such, you are most likely just fine, and any attempt by the government to stop you is probably just going to result in more publicity and potentially more sales and money for you. But this is technically still a bit of a grey area, and consulting with a lawyer may be worthwhile.",

While there are strong First Amendment arguments for protecting such speech, the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 ostensibly classifies all nuclear weapons information regardless of its source. Cases challenging this, like United States v. Progressive, Inc., have been dropped before setting clear precedents. The government has occasionally attempted to censor such publications, but often with limited success. This creates a situation where publishing such information is neither definitively legal nor illegal, but rather exists in a gray area with potential First Amendment protections balanced against possible government attempts at restriction."

A few weeks ago I wanted to give it a try and was shocked to find a Purchase button instead of a Play button. The support from Steam explained to me that the demo was removed by the publisher. I understand that the demo therefore is no longer available in the Steam store. However, the demo was already downloaded to my PC and was in a playable state at some point. Is it legal for Steam to disable content on my PC?\n\nI should point out that this question is not about the legality of the publisher removing their content from the Steam platform. But the publisher would technically not be able to disable the demo without the help from Steam.\n\nAnother pecularity I don't want to withhold is that the support from Steam insists, that nothing has been disabled on my PC! That the demo is no longer playable seems not to constitute a disablement in the eyes of the Steam support. But hey, maybe this wordgame has legal consequences I don't understand.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes, it is legal** for Steam to disable content on your PC because when you downloaded the Demo for the game \"Observer\", you \"clicked through\" and agreed to either a TOS (Terms of Service) and/or a EULA (End User License Agreement) which was a legally binding contract.\n\nThat contract stated the terms of use of the demo and when Steam can disable or expire the demo, as well as the fact that Steam can change the terms of the contract itself. Steam can close your entire account if they choose for any of very wide ranging reasons, as outlined in the contract.\n\nThe demo wasn't your property; it was software licensed to you by Steam, and they can delete or disable as outlined in the contract.\n\nSteam will be very careful, however, to not delete or damage anything else you have installed, or Windows itself, while respecting the Microsoft Windows TOS/EULA.\n\nTake some time to read the TOS and/or EULA for Steam, or any software for that matter; you'll see that in most cases, you only have a license to use the software, and don't actually own the software and don't have a right to modify it.",

Steam's actions are legal because when users download content from their platform, they agree to the Terms of Service (TOS) and/or End User License Agreement (EULA). These agreements typically allow Steam to disable or expire content as they see fit. Users don't own the software; they merely have a license to use it under specific conditions. The contract also often allows Steam to change the terms themselves. While the demo was downloaded to the user's PC, Steam retains the right to control access to it. Answer A is incorrect because the download doesn't grant ownership. B is incorrect because Steam support confirmed the demo is no longer playable, not just a UI change. D is incorrect because while the publisher may have initiated the removal, Steam has the technical means and legal right (via their TOS) to disable the content on users' PCs."

I take a mortgage completely on my own name and start living in the apartment with my girlfriend. Now I have several questions in case we would break up:\n\n1. Let's assume I pay for mortgage on my own, but she buys some furniture, paints walls, etc. Does she have any rights on my apartment, or not?\n2. Let's assume that officially I was paying for mortgage myself, but she is generous so she sends me 50% of my monthly mortgage payments to by bank account as an unofficial help. I don't think there is anything illegal with that. However, now if we would break up, she could go to court, show transactions and say that she was paying part of my mortgage. Is it possible that court would say that now part of the apartment belongs to her, or there is no way for her to prove that I was using that money as mortgage payments?\n3. Similar situation in 2nd question, but additionally, I would like to note that in The Netherlands banks usually will not allow you to rent out apartment if you still own bank and are paying a mortgage. How would I prove to the court or bank that those payments were not her monthly rent payments to me?\n\nWhen I say 'girlfriend', I mean completely unofficial. I am not sure how much would situation change if she would become my wife after me buying an apartment.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. As she lives in the apartment, she has certain rights. In particular, she cannot be evicted without due process. The joint investment confirms she's more than a squatter. It's unlikely that the paint would cause joint ownership, as painting is considered maintenance. Furniture is fully separate from the apartment.\n2. Certainly not illegal. It's not even qualified as a gift. It's a contribution to a joint household. But as you suspect, things can get messy at a break\\-up \\- and doubly so when you haven't arranged matters formally. It's pretty unlikely the court will rule that she co\\-owns the apartment \\- ownership of real estate generally can only be transferred by formal contract (via Notaris/Kadaster \\- Dutch notaries and Land Title Agency). However, she can be awarded a financial claim on you. (Verrekenovereenkomst).\n3. The burden of proof is on the bank, not you.

However, if Anna contributes significantly to the household and mortgage payments, she may have grounds for a financial claim (Verrekenovereenkomst) in case of a breakup, even though she wouldn't gain ownership of the property. Option A is incorrect because painting and buying furniture doesn't confer ownership rights. Option B is wrong because regular bank transfers alone wouldn't be sufficient to claim ownership in court.

That the fence is on your property, but adjacent to the school's property, is a complication. The school, observing that there is a boundary fence, might reasonably rely on that to exclude people from entering other than at desired entry points. So it might be that your entry over the fence would be unauthorized and thus technically trespassing. If you were to put a gate in your own fence, the school's reliance is probably less reasonable. Or if you were to formally notify the school that you intend to enter the school grounds over your own fence.\n\nHowever, in practice, you are not trespassing until you are notified by the owner or owner's agent or someone with proper authority.

Additionally, by uploading the video to YouTube, the creator agrees to YouTube's terms of service, which include granting the platform a broad license to copy and distribute the content. Option A is incorrect because formal registration is not required for copyright protection. Option B is incorrect because uploading to YouTube does grant the platform certain rights. Option D is incorrect because discussing a product or system does not negate copyright protection for the original presentation of that information."

Other people can duplicate your work with a different \"expression\" and not be infringing on copyright. And if there is nothing creative in your work then it's not even eligible for copyright in the first place.\n\nFor example, if you figure out how to sort an array with fewer computational steps than what anybody else is doing then that is functional code, not creative code, and anybody can reverse engineer/duplicate your sorting algorithm.\n\n---\n\nHowever, patents do provide the protection you're looking for. If you want to protect your fancy algorithm then apply for a patent. Patents expire an order of magnitude sooner than copyright, but they are the only means of legally protecting this type of intellectual property.\n\nUnlike copyright, patent protection is only available if you apply for it, and it has to be approved by the relevant government department in your country (although you can start using the patented technology before approval has gone through).",

They upload the source code to a public repository with a copyright notice. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the protection of the algorithm?\n\nA) The copyright alone is sufficient to prevent other companies from using or implementing the algorithm in their own software.\n\nB) Copyright protects the specific code implementation, but not the underlying algorithm. A patent would be necessary to protect the algorithm itself.\n\nC) The algorithm is automatically protected by both copyright and patent law once it's published online.\n\nD) There is no legal way to protect novel algorithms in software development.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Copyright protection only covers the specific expression of an idea, not the idea itself. In this case, the copyright would protect the exact JavaScript code written by the developer, but not the underlying algorithm or its functionality. Other companies could implement the same algorithm using different code without infringing on the copyright.\n\nTo protect the algorithm itself, the developer would need to apply for a patent. Patents are designed to protect novel, non-obvious inventions, including algorithms. Unlike copyright, which is automatic, patents must be applied for and approved by the relevant government agency.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright alone cannot prevent others from implementing the same algorithm differently. Option C is wrong because patents are not automatically granted and require a separate application process. Option D is false because patents do offer a way to protect novel algorithms, although the process can be complex and expensive."

By requiring that the qualifications for voting in U.S. Senate elections be the same as those for the \"most numerous branch of the State legislatures\" (typically the state house of representatives), the amendment ensures consistency in voting rights between federal and state elections.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because this clause does not refer to Electoral College electors, but to the general voters in each state.\n\nAnswer B is mistaken as it confuses the qualifications of the elected officials (Senators) with those of the voters (electors).\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the clause actually aims to prevent states from setting different voting qualifications for federal and state elections, not to allow it.\n\nThis question tests understanding of constitutional language, the concept of voting rights, and the relationship between federal and state election systems."

If you copy material from website A to website B, that would be copyright infringement when done without permission. However, you can post the URL to a website (not effective if it's behind a paywall, for example Netflix): a URL is not copyright\\-protected (it's a \"fact\", not an expression).

The primary explanation for that is the contempt or ignorance that people have regarding the law.

We're staying at a friend's house across town while we sort things out.\n\nThe home is one which we have lived in for decades, with some of those years pre\\-dating my step\\-father's presence in our lives. So, naturally, we would like to return to it as soon as possible. But we still don't feel comfortable going back with him living there.\n\nI don't know exactly what my mother is planning to do about the situation in general \\- she may not even know herself. But this did make me curious about one possibility.\n\nCould one of us get a restraining order against my step\\-father, and then return to our home, thereby forcing his ejection from the house? If this is legal, is there any reason not to do this in terms of how a judge may look upon it in later proceedings?\n\nJurisdiction is Orange County, Florida\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most common situation when a homeowner would be ejected from a home that he owns or co\\-owns would be as temporary orders in a divorce case, pending a permanent orders award governing all issues in the case. In part, this is because a divorce court could usually award the house to either party without regard to title if it were owned by either party (there are exceptions when the court couldn't do that which are beyond the scope of this answer). \n\nThe next most common situation where this might happen would be incident to a criminal case against the homeowner, during the pendency of the criminal proceedings.\n\nOne can imagine a civil temporary restraining order doing this, but it would be less likely to for a TRO court to eject a homeowner while allowing one or more non\\-owner's to stay, because a TRO baring a homeowner from using his own home could not be made permanent, and normally a TRO is only issues when a permanent order could also be issued of that type.\n\nIn the long run, the non\\-owners of the property may stay only at the sufferance of the property owner, even if a temporary order mitigates this in the short term.\n\nIn a case with co\\-owners of property, either have a right to use it absent a court order, so a TRO excluding one, pending a divorce or a partition action to force the sale of the property and division of the proceeds, would not be too unusual.\n\nIf he was not a homeowner, in contrast, a simple eviction action would probably suffice, possibly with a TRO to protect the persons and property from his misconduct if necessary pending and following the eviction.",

The first part, Torah\n>  Or, was first printed in 5597 (1837\\) in Kopust, with treatises, most\n>  of them from 5556 (1796\\) through the end of 5572 (1812\\), covering\n>  Genesis and Exodus, the first two books of the Pentateuch, with\n>  several discourses on Shavuot and Pesach. The second half was\n>  published in Zhitomir in 5608 (1848\\) under the title Likutei Torah,\n>  covering Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy, the final three books of\n>  the Pentateuch, Song Of Songs, the festivals, Rosh Hashana and Yom\n>  Kippur.[2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUUWE.png)\n\nSo it was published in two parts, but the latest the original versions were published were 1848\\. Now, the cover page of the modern printing says:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUUWE.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUUWE.png)\n\nThe key part of the statement is the following line: \n\n```\nAll rights reserved, including the right to reproduce this book or portions thereof, in any form, without prior permission,\nin writing, from the publisher, except by a reviewer who wishes to quote brief passages.\n5761 \u2022 2001\nManufactured in the United States of America\nLibrary of Congress Cataloging-in-Publication Data\nShneur Zalman, of Lyady, 1745-1813\n\n```\n\nSo there seems to be 2 contradictory things in that statement: \\#1, it says that it's copyright and published in 2001, but at the bottom, it mentions the original authors name, and says explicit when we lived, which based on that, seemingly would mean that it is in the public domain. Possibly when it was first published, it wasn't necessarily copyrighted, so maybe that changes things. From the official [copyright law website](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap3.html), section 302:\n\n> 302. Duration of copyright: Works created on or after January 1, 19784 (a) In General.\u2014Copyright in a work created on or after January 1,\n>  1978, subsists from its creation and, except as provided by the\n>  following subsections, endures for a term consisting of the life of\n>  the author and 70 years after the author\u2019s death.\n> \n> \n> (b) Joint Works.\u2014In the case of a joint work prepared by two or more\n>  authors who did not work for hire, the copyright endures for a term\n>  consisting of the life of the last surviving author and 70 years after\n>  such last surviving author\u2019s death.\n> \n> \n> (c) Anonymous Works, Pseudonymous Works, and Works Made for Hire.\u2014In\n>  the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made for\n>  hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year of\n>  its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its\n>  creation, whichever expires first. If, before the end of such term,\n>  the identity of one or more of the authors of an anonymous or\n>  pseudonymous work is revealed in the records of a registration made\n>  for that work under subsections (a) or (d) of section 408, or in the\n>  records provided by this subsection, the copyright in the work endures\n>  for the term specified by subsection (a) or (b), based on the life of\n>  the author or authors whose identity has been revealed. Any person\n>  having an interest in the copyright in an anonymous or pseudonymous\n>  work may at any time record, in records to be maintained by the\n>  Copyright Office for that purpose, a statement identifying one or more\n>  authors of the work; the statement shall also identify the person\n>  filing it, the nature of that person\u2019s interest, the source of the\n>  information recorded, and the particular work affected, and shall\n>  comply in form and content with requirements that the Register of\n>  Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation.\n\nSo, this is if the work was published after 1978, in this case, sometime in 2001 or 2002, it says that it's \"70 years after the authors' life\", but in this case, the orginazation that published the works is not the author, they just got it from somewhere else and published it, so I'm not sure if that would still be the case here, since, as mentioned before, the author was from 1813, and 1813 \\+ 70 \\= 1883, long ago, so seemingly it should be ok. However, maybe this would then fit under subsec. \"c\", \"Anonymous works etc...\", which states, as quoted above: \n\n> In the case of an anonymous work, a pseudonymous work, or a work made\n>  for hire, the copyright endures for a term of 95 years from the year\n>  of its first publication, or a term of 120 years from the year of its\n>  creation, whichever expires first.\n\nSo in this case, the first publication (although not in the US) was in the year 1848, and 1848 \\+ 95 \\= 1943, which has already passed. Or, it said, 120 years from \"its creation\", lets see: it doesn't say in the wikipedia page when it was created (as opposed to published), but even assuming it was created right before it was first printed, that would be 1848 \\+ 120 \\= 1968, still a year that has already passed.\n\nSo, can someone explain to me how the modern day book publishing company can copyright this work that was first published way more than 120 years ago? Do they own the rights to it at all? Can anyone republished (the original text of) it? If not, this seems to be similar to copyrighting a bible or Torah text itself, which I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to do, meaning copyrighting it has no effect, since its so old.\n\nSo what's the law here?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They have copyright in their additional text, and possibly in things like their visual design choices (fonts, layout etc). They may also have introduced a few deliberate typos to detect any literal copies from their version (rather as mapmakers add a few imaginary features to their maps). None of this creates any rights to the original text.\n\nYou are still free to produce your own copies of the original text.

The Supreme Court held in [*Feist v.

According to the information provided, tag assignments on Stack Exchange questions are likely not copyrightable under U.S. copyright law. This is because they probably lack the minimal level of creativity required for copyright protection, as established by the Supreme Court in Feist v. Rural Telephone. The U.S. Copyright Office's Compendium provides examples of works that do not meet this standard, which are analogous to tag assignments. These include brief synopses and simple combinations of public domain elements with short phrases. Since tag assignments are typically brief and functional rather than creative, they would fall into this category of non-copyrightable works. As a result, the concept of licensing these tag assignments doesn't apply, as anyone would be free to copy them without needing a license.\n\nOption A is incorrect because tag assignments are not always copyrightable or licenseable. Option B is incorrect as the number of tags doesn't determine copyrightability. Option D is incorrect because if something is not copyrightable, the question of licensing doesn't arise at all."

I worked for an Internet company that not only dealt with User Generated Content on our own servers, but also browsed the web looking at other sites quite a lot. This gives me an odd perspective.\n\nThere is a US law called [18 USC 2257](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2257), and I fully expect Europe has similar laws. It requires any porn provider who shows people with genitals displayed in a suggestive manner to \n\n* obtain **informed\\-consent**, in writing.\n* obtain *in advance* certain specific **documents to confirm legal age** (you can thank [Traci Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traci_Lords) for that) and make good copies of them\n* **retain these documents on file**.\n* Keep these files in an **office which is staffed Monday\\-Friday 9\\-5**, effectively so Feds can walk into that office anytime and inspect the records.\n\nThe record\\-keeping requirements were originally thought to be the government harassing the porn industry, since it [had a long history of doing so](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_People_vs._Larry_Flynt). However in actuality, the porn industry was developing a very professional and cordial relationship with the Attorney General's office. The process got smoothed out: the \"staffed office\" requirement could be subcontracted to third party companies, so it became like a Registered Agent, something every company must have. \n\nAs Internet porn took off, they worked out ways for Site X to license content from Provider Y, and have the 2257 stuff work smoothly. Federal prosecution for porn had fallen to almost nil. Even amateur producers were entering the scene and not having any trouble with compliance.\n\nEnter revenge porn\n------------------\n\nNow you can see, under the 2257 legal framework, revenge porn is impossible because it does **absolutely none of this stuff**. It tossed the \"known rules\" and the working relationship right out the window. \n\nI expected revenge porn to end with door kickdowns and 2257 prosecutions, but it never happened. I suspect the Attorney General's office is a heavy \"ship of state\", and it is unable to make a \"snap turn\" from the cordial relationship with the porn industry, and feared damaging the relationship while the EFF screams about the bad old days. \n\nHowever, 2257 is still on the books, and *still* binds anyone who publishes porn. \n\nThe casual publisher\n--------------------\n\nThe Internet has created a real problem for the old model of \"all porn coming from companies with lawyers and 2257 offices\". Is it reasonable to hold a 16 year old boy with a smartphone to the 2257 laws? If you never meant to publish, but someone hacked your phone, who's responsible? That's for the courts to decide, but yeah, my intuition is that courts will seek to find an original *publisher* of a work, i.e. the guy/gal who turned it from a private document into \"one that is loose on the Internet\". **So to answer your question, it's not on the *producer*, it's on the *publisher*.** If you re\\-post porn that you \"found somewhere\", then you're the publisher, unless you can document a prior source.\n\n**But then, there are the child porn laws**. Mere possession of any pornographic photo of someone under 18 is an essentially automatic lifetime branding as a sex offender in the US, and most likely, a trip to prison. Publication is a confession to possession. On the other hand, the person actually being 18 is an absolute defense; the 2257 law doesn't apply to *mere possession*. Europe may be more lax, it's difficult to imagine them being more draconian. \n\nAnd then, you have all the common law that comes from the **basic sexual assault** that it is to publish someone's sexy pics without permission. And both state attorneys (criminally), and victims' attorneys (civilly), have a variety of legal approaches to go after you, if they want to. I can't guess at the risk of this happening over a random posting on the Internet, but it is certainly all downside risk, and no measurable benefit for you. So why do it? \n\nAlso, it's a completely horrible and evil thing to do. There's plenty of mainstream, *consensual* porn that you can infringe copyright on, and that won't ever be more than a civil matter.",

Professional adult content producers are required to maintain documentation of consent and age verification under 18 USC 2257. Reposting such content, while potentially a copyright issue, is less likely to violate laws around consent and underage subjects.\n\nOption A involves non-consensual footage, which is illegal. Option C lacks consent documentation and could be considered revenge porn. Option D ignores consent issues and the legal requirements for publishing pornographic content. Reposting any pornographic content without verifying age and consent carries significant legal risks."

This is somewhat less blatantly interstate commerce, although the power to regulate interstate commerce has been held to be very, very broad (e.g. encompassing growing grain for personal consumption on your own farm that is entirely within a single state).",

The documentation indicates that Congress's power to limit states from criminalizing travel for abortion purposes flows from its Article I, Section 8 power to regulate interstate commerce. This type of legislation is described as \"likely to be upheld\" and potentially even reflective of what courts might decide even without legislation.

I suspect it requires company B to get consent from its subjects, but I cannot find any specific support for this in GDPR.\n\nEDIT: As people have pointed out in the comments, companies A and B are *controllers* here and not *processors*; excuse me for my misuse of the terminology.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If companies A, B are *processors* in the sense of the GDPR, the processors cannot decide whether to collect consent. This is the obligation of the *data controller*. Any processing by a data processor happens under the authority of the controller. This also means that it doesn't necessarily make sense to protect the data stored at company B with a \u201cthis does/doesn't exist\u201d response.\n\nIt is the controller's job to determine the purpose of processing \u2013 why are they querying the B email list? Then, the controller must find a legal basis for this processing. Consent is only one legal basis among many. Consent is only explicitly required for a few narrow cases, however certain use cases effectively require consent as well, such as email marketing without a prior business relationship.\n\nBy itself the queries to B's list are not an actual purpose of processing so it depends on *why* these queries will be done.\n\nFor example, if membership in B's list is used to infer interests for marketing purposes that would be a purpose that would make it possible to discuss whether consent would be required. My hunch is that for that specific example, an argument could be made for legitimate interest instead. But the processing might be considered to be profiling, in which case additional restrictions might apply (e.g. some kinds of profiling do require consent).\n\nIf personal data was collected for one purpose but shall be used for another, Article 6(4\\) requires the controller to perform an analysis to determine whether this repurposing is possible: just because you have the data does not mean you can use it towards your goals. In particular, repurposing is not allowed if the legal basis for collecting the data was consent. In contrast, it may be allowed if the legal basis was legitimate interest.",

According to the GDPR, when personal data collected for one purpose is intended to be used for another purpose, Article 6(4) requires the controller (in this case, Company X) to perform an analysis to determine whether this repurposing is compatible with the original purpose of collection. This is especially important when the original legal basis was legitimate interest, as is the case here. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because freely using the data for a new purpose without any assessment violates GDPR principles. \n\nAnswer B is not necessarily correct because explicit consent is not always required for repurposing data; the compatibility assessment might determine that the new use is allowable under the existing legal basis.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because Company Y's consent status is irrelevant to Company X's obligations regarding their own database.\n\nThe compatibility assessment will help Company X determine if they can proceed with the new use under their existing legal basis, or if they need to seek a new legal basis (such as consent) for this specific purpose."
