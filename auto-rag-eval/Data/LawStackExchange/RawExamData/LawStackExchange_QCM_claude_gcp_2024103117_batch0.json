However, you as copyright owner can subpoena records from a service provider under [17 USC 512(h)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512). There is no records\\-retention law in the US, so there may be nothing to subpoena. Furthermore, the law only allows you to subpoena records from the providers that host material, not the \"infrastructure\" provider, such as Verizon. This was first sorted out in [RIAA v. Verizon](https://www.epic.org/privacy/copyright/verizon/dc-cir-op.pdf). There is no chance that you could subpoena records from a third party like Google on the chance that they might have some record.",

According to the documentation, copyright owners can subpoena records from service providers that host potentially infringing material under 17 USC 512(h). This is the only legally permissible method mentioned for copyright owners to obtain information about potential infringers.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because copyright infringement does not involve the police, as stated in the documentation.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the documentation specifically mentions that copyright owners cannot subpoena records from \"infrastructure\" providers like Verizon, as established in the RIAA v. Verizon case.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that there is \"no chance that you could subpoena records from a third party like Google on the chance that they might have some record.\"\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the legal process for obtaining information in copyright infringement cases, including the limitations and specific provisions of the law."

In this case, a provisional license number could be created to track penalties associated with the accident. This approach allows the state to maintain a record of the incident and any associated fines or penalties, which could affect the minor's ability to obtain a driver's license in the future. Options A, B, and C are less likely, as they don't account for the need to track infractions for unlicensed minors, don't align with typical liability practices for driver's education, or incorrectly assume minors are exempt from consequences in such situations."

Since the original story, though, the [Biden campaign has said](https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-campaign-admits-removing-redkins-logo-photo) that they supplied the altered photo to CNN and the campaign had removed the logo because it is \"copyrighted\" and that such a step is \"a very common practice on campaigns.\"\n\nThe [original photo](https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/photos/a.10150487089926104/10157136950891104) is still located on Facebook where it was initially used to celebrate Father's Day.\n\nIs there anything about copyright, or trademark, law that would require such editing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I am aware both these answers are incorrect, but as I am not a lawyer let me quote the World Intellectual Property Organization (part of the UN):\n\n> Photos of trademarks\n> ====================\n> \n> \n> Unlike copyright law, trademark law as such does not restrict the use of a trademark in a photograph. What it does forbid is the use of a trademark in a way that can cause confusion regarding the affiliation of the trademark owner to the image. If consumers are likely to mistakenly believe that the trademark owner sponsored a photograph, then there may be trademark infringement. For example, if a **Nike logo was visible on the t\\-shirt** worn by the boy in our photo\\-shoot scenario, **this could be seen as an attempt to appropriate consumer goodwill associated with the Nike trademark**. So, caution is required if photographing someone wearing or consuming a trademarked product.\n\nSource: [IP and Business: Using Photographs of Copyrighted Works and Trademarks](https://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2006/02/article_0010.html) (*emphasis mine*)\n\nSo the basic idea is that **if** the Washington Redskins would not want to be associated with the Biden campaign, they could file a lawsuit claiming that the photo suggests there might be an affiliation between the campaign and the sport organization. In other words, the question one has to ask is: Is there a chance we might benefit in any way from the goodwill associated with the trademark?\n\nThe way it was explained in a copyright course1 I watched was that:\n\n* you *don't need to* worry about a McDonald's in the background of your photo\n* you *need to be careful* where you use a general photo of a specific McDonald's\n* and taking a photo of a political candidate in front of a McDonald's is *not acceptable* without permission2\n\nThe verdict\n===========\n\nThe biden campaign claimed that\n\n> A campaign aide told Fox News the logo was removed from the photo because it is \"copyrighted\" and claimed that such a step is \"a very common practice on campaigns.\"\n\nTo my knowledge that are no actual copyright concerns here, but \\- just like with the aforementioned course \\- trademark matters often get covered in the same setting as copyright laws, so I have a very easy time believing that this is 'a very common practice on campaigns'. It's incredibly unlikely that for this specific photo the Washington Redskins would have actually claimed that Biden was benefiting from the goodwill associated with their brand (especially considering all the controversy surrounding them), but it's a completely believable general policy. The interesting thing is that they didn't care as much about postings on social media compared to more traditional channels, but this is in line with what I have seen in many companies and organizations.\n\n1 \\- This course was trying to generalize international law in a way that content producers won't get in trouble anywhere rather than exclusively explain US law.  \n\n2 \\- The example didn't use a 'political candidate' explicitly, but something along the lines of a recognizable public figure who is not just getting a burger",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal considerations for using this image?\n\nA) The campaign must remove the logo due to copyright infringement, regardless of the context.\n\nB) The campaign can freely use the image without any modifications, as logos in the background of photos are always considered fair use.\n\nC) The campaign should consider removing or blurring the logo to avoid potential trademark issues, particularly if the image could suggest an affiliation between the campaign and the company.\n\nD) The campaign is required to obtain explicit permission from the company before using any image containing their logo, even if it's in the background.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While copyright law doesn't typically restrict the use of a trademark in a photograph, trademark law is concerned with the potential for confusion regarding affiliation. The key consideration is whether consumers might mistakenly believe there's a connection between the trademark owner and the campaign. Removing or blurring the logo is a cautious approach to avoid any potential legal issues related to trademark infringement, especially in a political context where association could be particularly sensitive. This practice is common in campaigns to avoid any implications of endorsement or affiliation. Options A and D are overly restrictive, while B doesn't account for the nuances of trademark law in this context."

The company distributing this firmware has an obligation to provide you the source code, but this obligation is to the copyright holder. You are not the copyright holder. The copyright holder would have to sue them for license compliance.\n\nDoes this change for someone who wrote some of the code and the copyright of that portion is under their name? For example, would someone like Ulrich Drepper (the author of several components of the Linux kernel) be in a different situation than the OP of that question with regards to having rights to the source code if other copyright holders (like SFC) don't sue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the license the code comes under and whether theres a copyright\\-assignment requirement for that project.\n\nIn the case of the Linux kernel, the license is the GPLv2, and there is no copyright assignment requirement \\- so anyone who can prove ownership of code within the shipped binary (important caveat there \\- the Linux kernel is configurable, so parts of it can be excluded from the binary) can pursue a claim of copyright infringement if the source code is not distributed according to the license.\n\nWith the case of things like GCC (until the most recent version), while the project uses the GPL (v3\\), it also required copyright assignment to the FSF, meaning the original authors do not hold the copyright and thus have no standing to sue (authors rights not\\-with\\-standing). They have now dropped this requirement in the latest GCC version, but it stands for older versions.\n\nAs copyright holder, you have no ability to actually force the binary distributor to comply with the terms of the license \\- you can merely threaten them with, and pursue, a claim of copyright infringement. In court, you can sue to stop them from infringing further and to pay punitive and actual damages.\n\nYou may be able to get them to agree to conform with the license terms, but its highly doubtful that a court would agree to force them to conform with the license terms (there has yet to be a copyright\\-infringement case orientated around open source software that has resulted in a court forcing the infringing company to GPL their own code they were trying to protect by non\\-compliance).\n\nSo, to answer your question, theres no actual avenue here which results in you obtaining the source code you have copyright ownership of \\- the legal actions you can take are ones of stopping infringement and claiming damages. You might be able to come to an out\\-of\\-court settlement or a voluntary agreement to provide the code, but court actions will be about stopping the infringement and damages.",

However, legal action typically focuses on stopping infringement and claiming damages, rather than forcing the release of source code.

On the other hand, if the beneficiary has a \"future benefit\", then no Gift Tax is triggered. Correct me if I am wrong on this. \n\nSo the question I have is how far into the future do you have to go to convert an \"immediate benefit\" into a \"future benefit\"?If the beneficiary won't be able to touch the balance for 20 years, that is probably a \"future benefit\". How about six months? What is the smallest amount of time that would count as the \"future\" based on IRS rules?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your understanding is basically completely wrong. You pretty much have it backwards. It is easier to explain how the law really is than to try to correct your assumptions.\n\nIn the U.S., the general rule is that if you create a trust and transfer property to the trust, then the transfer of property to the trust is a gift for purposes of federal gift taxation (unless an exception applies). \n\nIf the transfer of property to the trust is a gift for purposes of federal gift taxation, then the gift must be reported on a gift tax return (Form 709\\). Usually, no gift tax will be due upon the filing of the Form 709 unless you have made more than $11\\.58 million of gifts in your lifetime.\n\nThere are two main exceptions to this rule.\n\nFirst, if you retain certain rights in the trust that causes the property of the trust to be treated as if it is owned by you for gift tax and estate tax purposes, such as the right to revoke the trust, or the right to distribute funds from the trust to yourself not subject to any fiduciary duty, the transfer of property to the trust is not treated as if it happened at all, and there is no gift for tax purposes at that time. \n\nIf you die, or you otherwise subsequently cease to have the rights in the trust that caused the property in the trust to be owned by you for gift and estate tax purposes, the law treats this as a transfer of the property in the trust that is subject to gift or estate taxation at that time.\n\nSecond, a transfer of property to a trust that has a \"Crummy Power\" that belongs to one of the beneficiaries of the trust (who is not you) is not a taxable gift if the value of the property transferred to the trust over which there is a Crummy Power is less than the annual exclusion for gift tax purposes (currently $15,000 per donor per beneficiary per year). (The term \"Crummy\" is surname of the taxpayer in the tax law case that established the legality of this form of gift tax planning method.)\n\nIf a trust has a Crummy power, then a beneficiary of the trust (other than you), has the unilateral right to withdraw the contribution you made to the Trust in their name immediately, if that right is exercised within a certain amount of time. If the right is not exercised, it lapses and subject to certain IRS regulations, the lapse of the power does not constitute a gift from the beneficiary of the trust to the trust either for gift tax purposes. \nNobody ever actually exercises their right to withdraw the amount contributed to the trust. But, the right to do so turns the gift from a gift of an interest in a trust to the beneficiary (which is subject to gift taxation), to a transfer of a present interest in property to the beneficiary (which is not subject to gift taxation to the extent that the value of the present interest in property is less than or equal to the annual exclusion for gift tax purposes (i.e. $15,000 in the year 2020\\)).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John creates an irrevocable trust for his daughter Sarah. He transfers $100,000 to the trust on January 1, 2023. The trust document states that Sarah has the right to withdraw up to $15,000 of the contribution within 30 days of the transfer. After 30 days, any unexercised withdrawal right lapses. The remaining funds will be distributed to Sarah when she turns 25, which will occur in 5 years. How should this transfer be treated for federal gift tax purposes?\n\nA) The entire $100,000 is a taxable gift that must be reported on Form 709\nB) Only $85,000 is a taxable gift that must be reported on Form 709\nC) The entire $100,000 is exempt from gift tax and does not need to be reported\nD) Only $15,000 is exempt from gift tax, and $85,000 must be reported on Form 709\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In this scenario, the trust includes a Crummey power, which allows Sarah to withdraw up to $15,000 within 30 days of the transfer. This $15,000 is considered a present interest gift and qualifies for the annual gift tax exclusion (which was $15,000 in 2023). Therefore, this amount is exempt from gift tax. The remaining $85,000 is considered a future interest gift and must be reported on Form 709. It's important to note that while this amount must be reported, it may not necessarily incur gift tax if John hasn't exceeded his lifetime gift tax exemption. Option A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the Crummey power. Option C is incorrect because only the amount covered by the Crummey power is exempt. Option D reverses the taxable and non-taxable portions."

Let us further suppose that there was no continuing exchange of information and **no continuing provision of services**. There was no continuing monitoring of the Data Subject by the provider. Consent was freely given by the person at the time of the original transaction. The only continuing processing of this person's data is to store it, and to make the items previously consented to as public available on the relevant web page.\n\nThe provider specifies policies and purposes, and also stores an manipulates the information, and thus it would be both a Controller and a Processor in GDPR terms. The provider does provide services to EU residents, although it is primarily targeted on the US market.\n\nSeveral years later, the person moves to the EU, say to Spain. Subsequently, the person sends either a data access request fort all information that the provider has on the person, or a \"right to be forgotten\" request to have all personal information deleted from the provider's records. The person has clearly established that s/he is the same person who provided PI from Mexico years before.\n\nNo services have been requested by, or provided to, this person for some years, since before the person was an EU resident. The provider **may** be providing services to **other** people who are present in the EU.\n\nUnder these circumstances, does the GDPR require the provider to provide the requested information, or to delete information from its records, given that the information was not collected from a person present in the EU at the time of collection?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a very interesting question about the territorial scope of the GDPR. As previously discussed on this site and as supported by Art 3(2\\) GDPR and [EPDB guidelines 3/2018](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/riktlinjer/guidelines-32018-territorial-scope-gdpr-article-3-version_en), the GDPR only applies to non\\-EU data controllers for processing activities relating to the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU.\n\nHere, the controller *offered* services to a person not in the EU, who then moved to the EU. The controller is continuing to *process* personal data of the person who is now in the EU.\n\nBut processing data for a service is not the same as offering it. An offer would imply that the controller actively targets persons in the EU, and intends for people in the EU to use their service. The mere availability of a service such as a website is not a targeted offer.\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether the data controller is offering services to people in the EU, so let's quickly look at both alternatives.\n\nIf the controller isn't targeting people in the EU with their services, the GDPR does not apply, and the right to access or erasure doesn't apply. The controller can reject any such requests.\n\nIf the controller is targeting people in the EU, the GDPR does now apply to any processing of personal data relating to this offer of services. Clearly, the GDPR will not retroactively cover processing activities back when the data subject was not in the EU. However, the GDPR *might* apply to continued processing activities (including continued storage of previously collected personal data), now that the data subject is in the EU. Which processing activities are related to the offering of services would need individual analysis, and it's likely that a court would come to different conclusions than I would.\n\nIn practice, a data controller would likely avoid the difficulty of trying to untangle which processing activities are subject to GDPR, and either clearly avoid GDPR obligations for all their processing activities, or fully comply with GDPR for all processing activities relating to an EU data subject. E.g. one data controller might terminate or suspend the service when the data subject has permanently moved to the EU, whereas another might migrate user data to an EU data centre when the user updates their location.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A US-based company collected personal data from a Mexican resident who later moved to Spain. The company primarily targets the US market but also provides some services to EU residents. The former Mexican resident, now in Spain, requests their data be deleted. Under what circumstances would the GDPR likely apply to this situation?\n\nA) The GDPR applies retroactively to all data collected from the individual, regardless of their location at the time of collection.\n\nB) The GDPR does not apply at all because the data was initially collected from a non-EU resident.\n\nC) The GDPR applies only if the company is actively offering services to people in the EU, and only to ongoing processing activities after the individual moved to the EU.\n\nD) The GDPR applies to all data processing activities related to this individual as soon as they became an EU resident, regardless of the company's target market.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The GDPR's applicability in this scenario depends on whether the company is actively targeting EU residents with its services. If it is, the GDPR could apply to ongoing processing activities (including storage) of the individual's data after they moved to the EU. However, it would not apply retroactively to data collected when the person was not in the EU. The GDPR's territorial scope is based on the location of the data subject when the data is collected or processed in relation to offered services, not on the data subject's current residence. If the company is not targeting EU residents, the GDPR would not apply at all in this case."

Other party was not seriously injured (paramedics left after thoroughly inspecting the other party for 5 minutes and getting the signature of the other party for refusal of ambulance and further medical treatment). Police left after 3 minutes after seeing no one was seriously hurt and getting consent of both drivers.\n\nIn the past, experienced a case where GEICO just paid out the full policy limit right away, even though other party's total medical bills and treatment were less than 1/10th of that (minor injuries). Other party in that case had radio silence for a year and ignored GEICO's attempts to reach out, then suddenly hired an atty. Other party's attorney tacked on bogus items to the claim to make it ***exactly*** the policy limit and GEICO did not bother to fight, even though some items would have clearly had no evidence to substantiate them.\n\nAm concerned that this case might turn into last time again. How can I encourage GEICO to fight bogus claim items assuming that I give them permission to disclose? Is this just a thing where they don't bother, simply pay the limits and move on, since they'll just collect higher premiums anyway?

But I can't find what is required for non\\-documentary exhibits. The 2 kinds of exhibits I'm thinking of are \\- \n\n1\\) DVD of digital photos (where prints don't show the detail needed or the photo will need to be viewed using pan/zoom)\n\n2\\) Cumbersome exhibits where the other side disputes some matter about them, and the original object will need to be brought to the court and shown during the trial. (The objects would be the size of a small briefcase, but need to be shown to the court directly, not just by photograph, and there could be disputes of fact where the court needs to see the actual object and not just a 2d photo)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On the first point: there's no great problem with filing a DVD in court (so long as it is properly labelled) and you can reasonably assume that any member of the judiciary will have a laptop and normal software available. If you want a larger screen or specific software, you will need to discuss the matter with the court, which leads into your second point.\n\nAt the hearing of your case, it will be necessary to identify the exhibits to which you refer, and a location where they can be kept safe and unmolested. Normally, this would be the solicitor's office or barrister's chambers (on an undertaking that they will not be interfered with in any way); but it can be anywhere, so long as the Court agrees.\n\nSource : many years in the High Court, where IP cases led to filing of everything from vodka bottles to an Imperial Stormtrooper uniform. \n\nEdited addition (rather late) to deal with comment below: This is not a specific law or rule, but a matter of natural justice. Exhibits serve the purpose of helping the court to understand what is said in a specific affidavit or given in evidence by a specific witness; it is therefore necessary that anybody who later needs to understand the evidence (perhaps an appeal judge or a party who was not present, but now wishes to dispute the evidence) has access to that exhibit, and that the identity of the exhibit is beyond dispute. A document or CD is labelled and kept in the Court file; anything too large to go in a filing box must be labelled and kept safe elsewhere, which must be a decision of the Court.",

The answer states that DVDs can be filed with the court as long as they are properly labeled, and it's reasonable to assume the judiciary will have means to view them. For larger objects that need to be presented in court, the correct procedure is to discuss the matter with the court and identify a safe location where they can be kept, typically a solicitor's office or barrister's chambers, with an undertaking that they will not be interfered with.

So, they write a will in which you supposedly leave everything to them, put a gun to your head and make you sign it. The signature has not been forged \\- you signed; and the text isn't changed after your signature. But clearly that is not your will, and in some legal systems (e.g. the [UK's forgery act of 1981](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/45/contents/enacted)) would be considered a forged document AFAICT.\n\nAnother example: You're about to sign your will; but as you look away, someone exchanges the page for a different page which gives them more and others less. So, the signature wasn't forged, but the signed document is not your will.\n\nThese are the sorts of situations about which I'm interested in rulings on the question of forgery.\n\nNotes:\n\n* I realize that a document can be an \"invalid will\" as opposed to a \"forged will\", and that undue influence is often invalidating. I'm interested in cases where the question of forgery was discussed.\n* I'm particularly interested in cases of softer coercion to sign than a literal gun to one's head.\n* The higher the legal forum the better.\n* Rulings that also kind of survey the legal situation rather than simply deciding a case are preferable.\n* Have a non\\-common\\-law example? Please provide a link a comment.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not forgery in the usual common law country sense of the word (the statute linked has a definition broader than the usual legal meaning of the term, and I don't have an opinion on what is fraud in a will under that statute). I've never seen the word \"forgery\" used in the sense of the question in any U.S. case or statute.\n\nThe first example (gun to head) is a will invalid as a result of duress (very unusual for a will, although the related notion of [undue influence](https://www.elderlawcolorado.com/articles/contesting-a-will-in-colorado-testamentary-capacity-and-undue-influence/#:%7E:text=Undue%20influence,-A%20will%20may&text=In%20Colorado%2C%20this%20occurs%20when,would%20not%20otherwise%20have%20included.) which is generally much softer is the most common ground for a will contest, something I've probably litigated a dozen times). The following is from a brief that I wrote in an undue influence will contest where I successfully defeated a will contest based upon undue influence allegations:\n\n> Undue influence means words or conduct, or both, which, at the time of\n> making a will (1\\) deprived the person making the will of his free\n> choice; and (2\\) caused the person making the will to make it or part\n> of it differently that he otherwise would have. *Scott v.

Chamblin*, 94 Colo. 367; 30 P.2d 325 (1934\\);\n> *David v. Davis*, 64 Colo. 62, 170 P. 208 (1917\\); *Lehman v.

Ary*, 205 P.3d 1150 (Colo. 2009\\).\n\nThe second example is called *[fraud in the factum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud_in_the_factum)* and is quite rare but has been litigated and is discussed in detail in [this 1920 law review article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1111266?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). In twenty\\-five years, I've litigated two fraud in the factum cases, one involving the substitution of language in a long contract at the closing table in a complex business deal and the other involving a deed in a quiet title dispute involving a long and messing chain of title with wild deeds, etc., but none involved a will.\n\nI am aware of one will case involving a genuinely forged will, where a client of the first law firm where I worked brought in a woman whom he represented to be his wife to sign his wife's will and deeds from the wife (who was actually an imposter), that took place shortly before I joined that firm as an associate attorney. The notary and witnesses to the will signing were later called in after the death of the wife in a will contest as trial witnesses to describe the woman who signed the documents which established the forgery since she looked nothing like the actual wife (different hair color, different height and build, twenty years younger, different handwriting, etc.). Spoiler alert: The husband didn't win that case.\n\nThe 1920 article also addresses the vanishingly rare case of a will procured not by duress or undue influence, and not by *fraud in the factum*, but instead by fraud in the inducement (e.g. telling someone who is about to write a will that they did something highly disrespectful to a parent causing the parent to write that person out of their will when in fact the account was a total fabrication).\n\nThere is a specific doctrine that provides that the federal courts do not have jurisdiction over probate cases, recently reaffirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case involving Anna Nicole Smith, so it is unlikely that there is much relevant and authoritative case law in the will context in federal court.",

        "answer": "Question: Based on common law principles discussed in the documentation, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered fraud in the factum in the context of a will?\n\nA) A testator is pressured by family members to leave more assets to them, eventually giving in to their persistent requests.\n\nB) A person tricks an elderly testator into believing their child has died, leading the testator to remove that child from their will.\n\nC) Someone holds a gun to a testator's head, forcing them to sign a will leaving everything to the assailant.\n\nD) As a testator is about to sign their will, someone quickly swaps the document for a different version that significantly alters the distribution of assets.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption D represents a classic case of fraud in the factum, where the actual document signed is different from what the testator believes they are signing. This aligns with the example given in the documentation about exchanging pages just before signing.\n\nOption A describes a situation of potential undue influence, but not fraud in the factum.\n\nOption B is an example of fraud in the inducement, where false information is used to influence the content of the will, but the testator is aware of what they're signing.\n\nOption C is a clear case of duress, which would invalidate the will but is not considered fraud in the factum.\n\nFraud in the factum is described in the documentation as quite rare, involving situations where the signed document is fundamentally different from what the signer believes it to be, making option D the most accurate representation of this concept."

At least one (Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley), was declared king consort, and both he and his predecessor Francis II of France sought recognition as king *jure uxoris* (under a proffered theory of the \"Crown Matrimonial of Scotland\"), but the title and powers of the consort were a constant issue during Mary's reign and remained unresolved when Mary was captured and executed.\n\nPhilip was not Prince Consort, he was made a [British Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_prince) \\- the same title held by his sons.\n\nThe only legal requirement is the [oath](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/WillandMar/1/6)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Coronation Oaths Act 1688 requires the oath to be taken by the Monarch and specifies its form.

It's blackmail.\n\nSo, what's different with the case at the top? Well, I believe there may be an exception to the above assumed law. Court cases are generally public; that means that, presumably, the sensitive information used by the blackmailer would also become public.

The act states that a demand with menaces is not unwarranted if the person making it believes they have reasonable grounds for making the demand and that the use of menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand. In this case, telling someone to stop blackmailing you or you'll inform the police can be considered a reasonable response to criminal behavior, and thus would likely fall under this exemption.

The tenant and landlord entered into an agreement where the tenant paid October rent early in exchange for not having to pay December rent. This constitutes a binding agreement, regardless of whether it was written or verbal. The landlord's subsequent financial difficulties do not invalidate this agreement.

If I claim you damaged my car which cost $10,000 to repair, it's not only that *you* lose $10,000 if you lose the case, but *I* lose $10,000 if you win the case. Therefore the burden of proof should be equal in both directions. \n\nAssume a kid at an expensive boarding school is accused of causing $10,000 damage to the headmaster's car, and instead of suing for damages, the headmaster took the $10,000 out of the kid's school fees and tells the parents that the kid will be thrown out if they don't pay another $10,000\\. We have the exact same argument, but now the headmaster would be in court and accused. \n\nIf the burden of proof was \"proven beyond reasonable doubt\", in the first case the parents would have to pay if it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that the kid was responsible; in the second case they would only get their money back if it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that the kid was *not* responsible.",

In civil cases, such as disputes over property damage, the standard of proof is typically \"preponderance of evidence\" rather than \"beyond reasonable doubt\" to ensure equal stakes for both parties involved. This is because in a civil case, both sides have equally important interests at stake. If one party claims the other caused $10,000 in damages, either the plaintiff loses $10,000 if they fail to prove their case, or the defendant loses $10,000 if the case is proven against them. The lower standard of proof balances the potential losses for both parties.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while expediting the legal process might be a side effect, it's not the primary reason for the different standard of proof.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the severity of the offense doesn't determine the standard of proof in civil cases. Even high-value civil disputes use the \"preponderance of evidence\" standard.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while it's true that civil cases don't typically involve loss of liberty, this isn't the reason for the different standard of proof.

The message that employees received said that they could claim their holiday bonus by submitting their contact details on some website:\n\n> **From:** Happyholiday@Godaddy.com  \n> \n> **Date:** Mon 12/14/2020  \n> \n> **Subject:** 2020 Holiday Party\n> \n> \n> Happy Holiday GoDaddy!\n> ----------------------\n> \n> \n> **2020 has been a record year for GoDaddy, thanks to you!**\n> \n> \n> Though we cannot celebrate during our annual Holiday Party, we want to show our appreciation and share a **$650 one\\-time Holiday bonus!** To ensure that you receive your one\\-time bonus in time for the Holidays, please select your location and fill in the details by Friday, December 18th.\n> \n> \n> (Link for US)\n> \n> \n> (Link for EMEA)\n> \n> \n> Any submittals after the cutoff will not be accepted and you will not receive the **one\\-time bonus of $650** (free money, claim it now!)\n> \n> \n> We look forward to celebrating with you again, in person next year!\n\nThe company is making the \\~500 employees who followed the link retake their Security Awareness Social Engineering training, and presumably not paying out.\n\nSo, does that constitute a breach of contract? There was an offer, acceptance, and consideration (the victim submitted personal information). The only thing that makes this exchange not routine is that the transaction happened on a medium that the employer deemed inappropriate. But that's an arbitrary designation on the part of the employer that can't invalidate the contract, right?\n\nThe difference between usual phishing and this situation is that you usually can't pin down the identity of the scammers, and therefore can't enforce compliance. But the company, in their follow\\-up e\\-mail, has pretty much admitted to having authored the offer and confirmed that they received the payment request from victims:\n\n> \u201cYou\u2019re getting this email because you failed our recent phishing test,\u201d the company\u2019s chief security officer Demetrius Comes wrote. \u201cYou will need to retake the Security Awareness Social Engineering training.\u201d\n\nSure, the victim employees will now have to retake a training course, but they should be eligible for the $650 bonus now, and could sue for breach of contract to claim it, right? Is there any flaw in this reasoning?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Could the GoDaddy employee self\\-phishing test constitute a breach of contract?\n\nNo. There is no contract. It was only the announcement of a *gift*. That gift might have been unexpected, especially if no similar bonus was given in previous years.\n\nThe employee's act of filling in his information does not seemingly amount to \"consideration\". Filling the data was portrayed as the step to *facilitate* the delivery of the bonus. Your description \\-\\-or the article you shared\\-\\- has no indication that the employee's fill\\-in details were devised to benefit the company.\n\nHad the company's message been drafted in a way that qualifies it as an offer of contract, the description would be inconclusive because there are no details about:\n\n* The exact URLs for \"*(Link for US)*\" and \"*(Link for EMEA)*\": If the URLs were an alteration of the company's domain, it would be unreasonable for the employee to presume that the offer was legitimate.\n* What data the \"failed\" employees filled in: Being asked to provide information unrelated to the alleged bonus should have raised suspicions.\n* The contents of the Security Awareness training and what alertness could be reasonably expected from the email recipients even if no training were provided. In the case of companies such as [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ph) (being in the business of web domains and hosting), one would expect many of its employees (except janitors, etc.) to be more careful or judicious on matters of social engineering than in other industries with less exposure to Internet scams.",

It was a simulated phishing attempt, not a genuine offer.\n\nB) is incorrect for the same reason as A. There is no valid contract to breach, so employees cannot sue on these grounds.\n\nC) is correct. The test was designed as a security awareness exercise, not a genuine offer. It lacks the elements of a binding contract, particularly mutual intent to create legal relations.\n\nD) is incorrect. While the test may be controversial, it is not illegal. Companies often conduct such tests to improve security awareness among employees.\n\nThe key point is that this type of security test, while potentially misleading, does not create legal obligations for the company to fulfill the false promises made in the test email."

The purported basis for this was that he was a potential future subject of the investigation. \n\nAttorney General Barr stated, during a *previous* Congressional testimony, that he intended to pursue an **investigation** of the *genesis of the collusion allegation* against the President. \n\nAfter yesterday's Congressional testimony, a number of Congressmen twitted that Barr should resign. As potential subjects of Barr's investigation into the origins of the genesis of the collusion allegation, did these Congressmen not commit obstruction of justice with their twits? \n\nSpecifically, \"[Whoever knowingly **uses intimidation**,... or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, **with intent to hinder**, delay, or **prevent the communication to a law enforcement officer** or judge...of information relating to the commission or **possible commission** of a Federal offense shall be fined under this title or imprisoned...](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512)\"\n\nIt seems to me that either both Trump and anyone demanding that Barr resign committed obstruction or none of them did. \n\nAm I missing something?

The judge's quick intervention prevents the defendant from answering, which helps mitigate immediate prejudice. However, the fact that the question was asked at all could potentially influence the jury's perception, even subconsciously. This creates a dilemma for the judge: allowing the trial to continue risks a potentially tainted verdict, while declaring a mistrial immediately may be seen as an overreaction. \n\nThe most likely scenario is that the judge will instruct the jury to disregard the question and continue the trial.

The context in which it was discovered\n2. The explanation provided by the individual (such as the intention to rescue a child)\n3. The time gap between the search and any alleged criminal activity\n4. Other evidence present in the case\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the search itself is not a criminal offense. Answer B is incorrect because while the search can be used as evidence, its admissibility and weight would be determined by the court. Answer D is overly extreme and incorrect, as a single Google search does not automatically prove criminal intent or guarantee legal consequences, especially given the potentially justifiable explanation provided in the scenario."

Would a University (excluding campus police) renting rooms to students be able to search the rooms or would this violate California Civil Code 1954\\.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have two questions here. A search by the government must be reasonable, under the 4th Amendment, meaning that a warrant is required or exigent circumstances must exist. Simple entering (without searching) is governed by Civil Code 1954\\. [The law governing residential rentals](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&chapter=2.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=5.) is not explicit, because a a dormitory might be considered not to be a \"residential dwelling unit\". Some states explicitly exclude university dormitories, but that seems not to be the case in CA. There are some specific exclusions where dormitories are excluded (such as 1946\\.2 regarding termination), so the lack of an exclusion for dormitories can't follow from an assumption that a dormitory is not a residential dwelling unit. Clearly, a normal apartment that happens to be owned by the university and is rented out to students (as exist in many universities) clearly is an ordinary rental. So it seems that a dormitory is not legally exempted from 1954: they can only enter with permission or in specific circumstances.",

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. California Civil Code 1954 appears to apply to university dormitories, as there is no explicit exclusion for them in the law.\n2. The law restricts landlords (including universities acting as landlords) from entering rented spaces except under specific circumstances or with tenant permission.\n3. While dormitories might not be explicitly defined as \"residential dwelling units,\" the lack of a specific exclusion suggests they are covered by the general landlord-tenant laws.\n4. The 4th Amendment's warrant requirement primarily applies to government searches, not routine entries by landlords.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because they assume dormitories are exempt from landlord-tenant laws, which is not supported by the information provided. Option B is too restrictive, conflating government searches with landlord entries."

Do these extensions break into the source\\-code of such websites? Also, do the websites have to give permissions for such extensions to be created?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a free country nobody has to justify why their actions are legal. They are unless there is a specific, constitutional, law against them.\n\nBrowser extensions (barring the malware ones) are there because the user of the browser finds them useful. The function of a browser is to access information on the web and display it in the manner the user wishes; sometimes content creators think they have a right to control the end user experience, which is not only misguided but can amount to illegal discrimation (e.g. under the ADA).\n\nNow there are two main ways website owners can try to prevent this: firstly, they can claim that the browser extension is making a unlicensed derivative work and thus breaches copyright; and if it breaches a technical control, violates the DMCA also. The other is to add wording in their terms of service to prohibit it.\n\nViolation of the terms of service might be enforceable but only against the end user, and (almost) no company wants to be known for suing its customers. One might make the copyright argument stick but this is part of a long battle between content creators and third party add\\-on manufacturers, which goes back to at least 1984 when [Disney sued Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Corp._of_America_v._Universal_City_Studios,_Inc.) to get them to stop making VCRs.

The passage states that in a free country, actions are legal unless there's a specific law against them. It emphasizes that browsers are meant to display information as users wish, and that content creators don't have an absolute right to control the user experience. The text cites legal precedents where attempts to restrict similar technologies (like VCRs and ad-skipping DVRs) have failed in court. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage doesn't support the idea that extensions are always illegal.\n\nOption B is partly true about extensions being legal by default, but it overstate the ability of website owners to successfully sue users for terms of service violations. The passage notes that companies rarely want to sue their customers.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the passage suggests that copyright arguments against extensions might be difficult to win, citing previous cases where similar arguments failed."

It turns out that Norway is not the only country that can do this. Other nations may also revoke naturalizations, for example [the US](https://www.uscis.gov/policymanual/HTML/PolicyManual-Volume12-PartL-Chapter2.html), [Canada](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/cit/acquisition/revocation.asp) and [Finland](http://www.migri.fi/finnish_citizenship/losing_your_citizenship). I am sure others can as well.\n\nNow, this got me thinking. I know that having a [citizenship is a human right](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Pages/Nationality.aspx), so that leads me to assume that only dual nationals can have their naturalizations revoked. Otherwise, revocation would render the person stateless.\n\nSo, let's say someone was under investigation for something serious enough to potentially lose them their naturalized citizenship. Could they then hurry up and renounce their native citizenship? This would then leave them with only one citizenship, the naturalized one. I figure that would make it impossible for the government to revoke it, because it would render them stateless, making revocation a violation of international human rights law. Is that correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two approaches to determining citizenship: where you are born (jus soli \u2013 this holds in the US), and who you were born to (jus sanguinis \u2013 the case in India). There are mixes of these systems, such as where a person born to an American but not in the US is still an American citizen (e.g. Ted Cruz). Canada allows Canadian citizenship to be inherited outside Canada by 1 generation, so a child born outside Canada to Canadian parent born in Canada is a Canadian citizen. A child born outside Canada to Canadians born outside Canada is not a Canadian citizen. If that child is born in India and the parents do not have dual citizenship, the child is stateless because at least one parent has to be Indian to acquire Indian citizenship at birth. \n\nThere are various exceptions to the generalization about only revoking citizenship with dual nationals. In 1962, about 20% of the Kurdish population in Syria [had its citizenship revoked](https://www.hrw.org/reports/1996/Syria.htm). [Albert Einstein](http://www.einstein-website.de/z_information/variousthings.html#national) was stateless for 5 years, after he renounced his (German) Baaden\\-W\u00fcrttemberg citizenship. There is no law in the US that prevents you from renouncing your citizenship, there is simply a particular formality that has to be followed. Wikipedia names a half\\-dozen [US citizens who relinquished their US citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_former_United_States_citizens_who_relinquished_their_nationality) and had no other citizenship (thus were stateless).\n\nThe [Japanese Nationality Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_nationality_law) limits dual citizenship and requires children to make a decision at age 22\\. Iran, however, prohibits renunciation of citizenship to the offspring of an Iranian male (it is automatically assigned to the child). A Japanese\\-Iranian child born (in Japan) to an Iranian father would might seem to have to become Iranian; but apparently Japan requires you to perform the act of renouncing, and does not require that the other country recognize the renunciation. The point is that renouncing citizenship involves the laws of two countries: the country that you renounce may or may not accept the renunciation, and the country that you renounce in favor of may or may not accept the renunciation.\n\nSection 10 of the [Norwegian Nationality Law](http://app.uio.no/ub/ujur/oversatte-lover/data/lov-20050610-051-eng.pdf) exemplifies a further variation in concepts of renunciation as part of gaining Norwegian citizenship, and statutorily acknowledges the problem or countries not allowing citizens to renounce citizenship. There is a requirement of naturalization that \"the applicant must be released from any other nationality before the application may be granted\", which also allows that it's okay if you can be so released after being granted Norwegian citizenship: or, ultimately, \"An exemption may be granted from the requirement regarding release if release is deemed to be legally or practically impossible or for other reasons seems to be unreasonable\". (The law in Norwegian is [here](https://lovdata.no/lov/2005-06-10-51/%C2%A710): a Norwegian lawyer would be better able to comment on the interpretation of the text, but my reading of the law, especially the requirement to be \"l\u00f8st fra annet statsborgerskap\", specifies the realized result of being released, and not the act of renunciation, hence \"release\" in the translation).\n\nIf a person has dual US\\-Ukrainian citizenship, they might symbolically renounce their Ukrainian citizenship to avoid an expected revocation of US citizenship and deportation to Ukraine. But the US has no law that says that it *must* recognize the renunciation of a foreign citizenship. Canada and Australia do not allow you to renounce your citizenship if it would result in statelessness, but not all countries have such a requirement. See for instance [sect. 9 of the Citizenship Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-29/section-9.html) of Canada:\n\n> Subject to subsection (2\\.1\\), a citizen may, on application, renounce\n>  his citizenship if he (a) is a citizen of a country other than Canada\n>  or, if his application is accepted, will become a citizen of a country\n>  other than Canada...\n\nThere is, however, no specific law that compels Canada to recognize a person's renunciation of some other country.\n\nSo whether the described strategy would have any effect depends on the extent to which the \"retained\" state is compelled to recognize a renunciation of a foreign citizenship.",

Fearing potential revocation of their US citizenship, they decide to renounce their Ukrainian citizenship. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The US is legally obligated to recognize the renunciation of Ukrainian citizenship, preventing them from revoking the person's US citizenship.\n\nB) Renouncing Ukrainian citizenship automatically protects the individual from having their US citizenship revoked, as it would render them stateless.\n\nC) The US has no legal obligation to recognize the renunciation of Ukrainian citizenship and may still proceed with citizenship revocation if fraud is proven.\n\nD) The individual cannot renounce their Ukrainian citizenship without first obtaining permission from US immigration authorities.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The United States has no law that requires it to recognize the renunciation of a foreign citizenship. As stated in the passage, \"the US has no law that says that it must recognize the renunciation of a foreign citizenship.\" This means that even if the individual renounces their Ukrainian citizenship, the US government can still proceed with revoking their US citizenship if fraud is proven, regardless of potential statelessness. The strategy of renouncing the original citizenship to prevent revocation of naturalized citizenship is not guaranteed to be effective, as it depends on whether the \"retained\" state (in this case, the US) is compelled to recognize the renunciation of foreign citizenship, which it is not."

In the US product liability arena is there really such a paralyzing disincentive for manufacturers to make safety improvements to their products? Does a manufacturer really incur risk by making safety improvements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In order to avoid this perverse incentive, Rule 407 prohibits the use of subsequent safety measures as evidence for liability:\n\n> ### Rule 407\\. Subsequent Remedial Measures\n> \n> \n> When measures are taken that would have made an earlier injury or harm less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove:\n> \n> \n> * negligence;\n> * culpable conduct;\n> * a defect in a product or its design; or\n> * a need for a warning or instruction.\n> \n> \n> But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as impeachment or \u2014 if disputed \u2014 proving ownership, control, or the feasibility of precautionary measures.\n\n<https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_407>",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A manufacturing company, XYZ Corp, has been producing table saws for decades. Recently, they developed a new safety feature that significantly reduces the risk of injuries. In a product liability lawsuit against XYZ Corp for injuries caused by an older model saw, the plaintiff's attorney wants to introduce evidence of this new safety feature. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 407, how should the court rule on the admissibility of this evidence?\n\nA) The evidence is admissible to prove XYZ Corp's negligence in not implementing the safety feature earlier.\nB) The evidence is inadmissible for any purpose in the product liability lawsuit.\nC) The evidence is admissible only if XYZ Corp disputes the feasibility of implementing such safety measures in their older models.\nD) The evidence is admissible to prove the defective design of the older model saw.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Federal Rule of Evidence 407 generally prohibits the admission of subsequent remedial measures as evidence to prove negligence, culpable conduct, a defect in a product or its design, or a need for a warning or instruction. This rule is designed to encourage manufacturers to make safety improvements without fear that such improvements will be used against them in lawsuits involving older products.\n\nHowever, the rule does allow for exceptions. One such exception is when the evidence is used to prove the feasibility of precautionary measures, if disputed. In this case, if XYZ Corp claims that implementing such safety features in their older models was not feasible, the court may allow the evidence of the new safety feature to be admitted to challenge this claim.\n\nOptions A and D are incorrect because using the evidence to prove negligence or a defect in the product is explicitly prohibited by Rule 407. Option B is too broad, as it doesn't account for the exceptions allowed by the rule. Therefore, C is the most accurate answer, reflecting the nuanced application of Rule 407 in product liability cases."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There are 2 parcels of land purchased by different but (family) related parties at the same time. One of the properties (A) contained a well; the other (B) contained the pumps and equipment required to operate the well. For some period of time the owner of B operated and maintained the pumps (including a major upgrade costing $4,000\\) and both properties used the water. \n\nRecently, the owner of property A installed a storage tank and the water now goes from the well to the tank and then to both properties. A has sent B a bill for the water being supplied via the tank.\n\nNegotiations about agreeing on the water rights having failed, B has requested the return of their pump and equipment. A has refused saying B has no claim since it was B's responsibility to keep the well in working condition.\n\nWho owns the pump?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I know this is not what you've asked (I will get to that too), but I figured I would take the opportunity to state that the owner of the well cannot send you an invoice for the water unless you **agreed to a price and entered into a binding agreement**. They cannot just decide their water is worth X and then tell you that the amount is due. Just as you cannot send them a bill, in the same amount, for the use and maintenance of the pump.\n\nWhile the well may be located on one parcel of land, with the pump on the other, chances are, the properties were linked at one point and that is why there is a separation of the two (unless you bought it as one and divided it yourselves). This should have been dealt with on the deed, with easements appurtenant to the neighboring land regarding water rights. A contractual agreement could have been attached by reference that dictated the land with the well would maintain the well, while the landowner with the pump would maintain the equipment (or whatever you both agreed to regarding upkeep and the like). \n\nDepending on the state you live in, the property itself may not even \"own\" the well. For instance, in Colorado, water rights typically come by way of 100 or 200 year leases, as the native american tribes of the area \"own\" the water rights. Other states have laws that declare that nobody owns the water table, hence land is only owned as far down as the water table and then it is owned by the county, or state, with easements running with the deed. Other states, (I'm wondering if this is your issue) the water runs in veins and does belong only to the property that it is below \u2013 as there is no water table, so to speak. Regardless, I would talk to your title insurance policy company and ask why this easement was not addressed in the deed.\n\nI'm assuming that you did not divide the land yourselves, post purchase, and the land with the pump cannot access the water table without going onto the land of the other. Otherwise, it would be very easily solved by drilling your own well (and much cheaper), whereby you already own all of the equipment to run the water to the dwelling. You just divert your equipment to the running of your own well. It's only a few dollars a foot to drill a well, unless you live in the Granite State!\n\nLikewise, you should check with your land assessor's office, or registry of deeds, and see how the title ran back regarding water. Again, depending on jurisdiction, you may be able to drill down and over. You cannot divert, but you can access, in most jurisdictions. I say to contact your title insurance company, because the water issue should have been dealt with at title examination, and further, if your land is inaccessible to any water, it would not be sub\\-dividable for dwelling purposes under almost any zoning law I have ever heard of. A property that is land locked, or utility inaccessible, cannot be zoned for dwellings, without irrevocable easements or rights of ways, respectively. Just because you purchased near family doesn't have anything to do with any of this analysis. They could be anyone, or you could end up at odds, the **water cannot be relationship dependent and you cannot be held hostage over natural resources**. If so, I would sue the title insurance policy for a refund of the purchase price or the negotiation of the purchase price of an easement to the well/water table, assuming you have none under your land and have no existing right to it.\n\nIf you just happen to have the pump, and they have the well, you own the pump and they own the well. Simple as that. You do not have to allow the pump to be used for their well. Assuming you can drill your own well, but may not want to, you can just rent them the use of the pump at the same rate they are charging you for the water. You can agree to split the cost of maintenance of each, since you've invested in the upgrade of the pump.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, where two related parties own adjacent parcels of land with a well on one property (A) and pumping equipment on the other (B), what is the most appropriate legal approach for resolving the water rights dispute?\n\nA) Property A can unilaterally bill Property B for water usage without a prior agreement.\nB) The pump equipment automatically belongs to Property A since it's their responsibility to maintain the well.\nC) The owners should seek to establish a formal easement and contractual agreement regarding water rights and equipment usage.\nD) Property B should immediately remove their pump equipment from Property A's land.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate legal approach is to establish a formal easement and contractual agreement regarding water rights and equipment usage (option C). This solution addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. It emphasizes the need for a binding agreement before any billing can occur, as stated in the answer: \"the owner of the well cannot send you an invoice for the water unless you agreed to a price and entered into a binding agreement.\"\n\n2. It recognizes the likely historical connection between the properties and the need for proper documentation, as mentioned: \"This should have been dealt with on the deed, with easements appurtenant to the neighboring land regarding water rights.\"\n\n3. It avoids the unilateral actions suggested in options A and B, which are not legally sound according to the documentation.\n\n4. It provides a long-term solution that doesn't depend on the family relationship, adhering to the principle that \"water cannot be relationship dependent and you cannot be held hostage over natural resources.\"\n\n5. It allows for a fair negotiation of responsibilities and costs, addressing issues like maintenance and equipment ownership that were raised in the original scenario."

On the other hand, if she had had the bike for a long time or if it was her brother's bike and he was out of the country for a year, then she could make a sensible argument that you were only given the bike to use temporarily.",

Should the SDK provide a way (set of get/set functions) for publisher to read/write the GDPR data? I talk here about the values of `IABConsent_SubjectToGDPR`, `IABConsent_ConsentString`, `IABConsent_ParsedPurposeConsents` and `IABConsent_ParsedVendorConsents` in user defaults or shared preferences...\n2. If yes then should the SDK parse the `IABConsent_ConsentString` and store the parsed data to `IABConsent_ParsedPurposeConsents` and `IABConsent_ParsedVendorConsents`?\n3. Or, maybe the SDK should ask the user by itself for the consent data?\n4. Even if none of the above has to be implemented in the SDK, it still has to read the GDPR related data from `NSUserDefaults`/`SharedPreferences`. So should it read the `IABConsent_ConsentString` and parse it by itself? Or can I just rely on the parsed values (`IABConsent_ParsedPurposeConsents` and `IABConsent_ParsedVendorConsents`)?\n5. And, in general, who is responsible to collect this data from the user, build consent string and parse it to vendors and purposes lists? Is it the publisher (app developer) or each one who touches this data (e.g. SDKs in use)?\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally if an app is using a third party add service, the app handles the GDPR rules. \n\nThat could change with future court rulings, but ,for now, the app should tell the user what info is being shared with the third party advertisers and let the users consent.\n\n> Additionally, if you are using a 3rd\\-party to show ads (aka using an ad network/exchange), it's possible you'll need to mention all those involved (the ad server, exchange, DMPs, DSPs, etc), which makes getting consent for programmatic ads infeasible. That said, it may be that a broader statement of \"we'll be sharing with various advertising partners\" would be enough. [https://adzerk.com/blog/gdpr\\-ad\\-tech/](https://adzerk.com/blog/gdpr-ad-tech/)\n\nThe app may use other ad networks in addition to the one you work for, so it is best left up to the app so you don't force the user to go through multiple GDPR notices.",

The SDK should provide functionality for app developers to manage GDPR data, but the actual collection of consent and informing users about data sharing should be done by the app. This allows for a more comprehensive approach, especially if the app uses multiple ad networks. The SDK providing functions for reading/writing GDPR data (option B) aligns with this interpretation, allowing app developers to manage consent while giving the SDK access to necessary information for compliance."

In most jurisdictions, including the United States (and likely similar in Germany), work created during employment or internship is typically considered \"work-for-hire.\" This means the employer owns the rights to the code, even if not explicitly stated in the contract. While interns may desire to keep copies for educational purposes, they don't have an automatic right to do so. The employer has the authority to restrict access to the code they own.

However,for games like WOW, In short, yes if the server is profiting or If the server is running stolen or leaked software or If the server is distributing client files.\n\nIf the server was recreated from the developers own mind, and was only compatible with the WOW server, then it's a bit more gray and depends on the Judge's level of understanding of technology.\n\n3 \\& 4\\) This comes down to the EULA. If the EULA is like MineCraft, then you are good to go. If the EULA is like WOW, which forbids both modification of the client **and** participation on emulated servers then it is a violation of EULA. If WOW did not have the second part of \"participation on emulated servers\", then a user could modify on the router level to point to a private server.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A group of friends decides to set up a private server for World of Warcraft (WoW). Which of the following scenarios is most likely to be considered legal?\n\nA) They recreate the server code from scratch, don't distribute any official WoW client files, and don't charge players to access the server.\nB) They use leaked WoW server software but don't charge players to access the server.\nC) They create their own server code and charge players a small fee to cover server costs.\nD) They set up the server using official WoW software and allow free access to anyone who wants to join.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is the most likely to be considered legal because it avoids the main issues that make private servers illegal. By recreating the server code from scratch, they're not using stolen or leaked software. Not distributing client files and not charging players helps avoid copyright infringement and profiting from Blizzard's intellectual property.\n\nOption B is illegal because it uses leaked software, which is a form of copyright infringement.\n\nOption C, while using original code, becomes problematic by charging fees. This could be seen as profiting from Blizzard's intellectual property (the game concept and compatibility with WoW clients).\n\nOption D is clearly illegal as it uses official WoW software without authorization, which is a direct violation of copyright laws and Blizzard's terms of service.\n\nIt's important to note that even option A exists in a legal gray area. While it's the least likely to be illegal, it could still potentially face legal challenges depending on how closely it mimics WoW and how it's interpreted by the courts."

This is the document authored by a judge (or judges) giving their decision on a case.\n\nHowever, this information is by definition incomplete. I would like as complete a description of the case as possible, in particular including the submissions from the plaintiff/petitioner, as well as responses etc. The judgment by itself just includes whatever the judges feel like mentioning from the case documentation, and it's wholly inadequate as documentation of a case. If the other information is not recorded in an accessible form, that would be most unfortunate.\n\nSo, I was wondering whether this information was available online, possibly as a paid service. If not, why not? While this seems like a obvious and simple question, I've not found any clear statement of this anywhere. However, given that I have failed to find it so far, it at least seems that this information, even if available somewhere, is not very accessible.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The judgement is the definitive record\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe [*Destruction of Records Act*](https://legislative.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1917-05.pdf) 1917 allow the high court to set [rules](https://highcourtchd.gov.in/sub_pages/left_menu/Rules_orders/high_court_rules/Vol-V--PDF/chap5partCV5.pdf) on what records are to be kept and for how long. In summary, a very small number, including the judgement are kept indefinitely and the remainder are split into Part A (important stuff) and Part B (less important stuff) and kept for 30 and 6 years respectively.\n\nThere is no obligation for these to be publicly available so, generally, they aren\u2019t. They are usually publicly *accessible* by going to the register of the relevant court and asking to see them which may involve payment of an administrative fee. Some records are, however, classified or confidential depending on the nature of the case (e.g. national security, cases involving children etc.)\n\nOnce a case is completed and all avenues of review have been exhausted, the submissions and evidence are of no value.

According to the information provided, there is no legal restriction preventing the Van Gogh Museum from displaying replicas of famous paintings housed elsewhere. The museum's decision not to show replicas is a matter of curatorial policy, as art museums typically prefer to display original artworks rather than reproductions. This choice reflects common practices in the art world, where museums focus on exhibiting their own collections rather than providing comprehensive coverage of an artist's entire body of work through replicas.

That's why *mediation* is a popular tool for resolving conflicts.\n\nUsing lawyers as mediators has some added benefits:\n\n1. Lawyers know the law and rules of litigation better than laymen and so they can tell their clients what the range of possible outcomes are, and when communicating with opposing counsel they both know what is realistic.\n2. Lawyers are (at least in principle) [forbidden to lie in the course of their professional conduct](https://professionalliabilitymatters.com/legal-malpractice/lying-during-settlement-negotiations/).\n\nI.e., using lawyers should reduce the amount of gaming involved in resolving a conflict.\n\n**And if that's not reason enough to get opposing lawyers speaking directly:** [Rules of litigation ***require*** opposing counsel to \"meet and confer\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/meet_and_confer) regarding many procedural issues.\n\nA typical example is [CCP \u00a72023\\.010](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/code-of-civil-procedure/ccp-sect-2023-010/) which requires the court to sanction a party for \"*Failing to confer in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing party or attorney in a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve informally any dispute concerning discovery.*\"\n\nThe judicial system thinks it's *always* a good idea for opposing lawyers to speak directly because it can only reduce the burden on the public courts. Lawyers are officers of the courts to which they have been admitted to practice, and so while their primary duty is to their clients, they also have an obligation to uphold the law and avoid misusing the courts. [Here's an essay published by the ABA](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/pretrial-practice-discovery/practice/2017/tips-on-meet-and-confer-conferences/) that further explains, \"cooperation represents the shortest, fastest, and least costly path to what the rules, as applied, ultimately would require the parties to do anyway.\"\n\nFrom the perspective of the client, the only drawback to conference that I can think of is the theoretical risk that one lawyer will unnecessarily divulge some piece of information that the other party can exploit to its advantage. Such a mistake would be grounds for a malpractice claim against the lawyer who committed it. And if it is brought to the attention of a court overseeing the process then the court may take steps to mitigate the damage to the party so disadvantaged. A common example is in criminal law where a judge will prohibit improper statements or evidence from being exposed to the jury.",

The documentation explicitly states that \"The judicial system thinks it's always a good idea for opposing lawyers to speak directly because it can only reduce the burden on the public courts.\" This practice is designed to resolve issues informally and efficiently without unnecessarily involving the court system.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because increasing billable hours is not a goal of the judicial system. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the \"meet and confer\" requirement is specifically for attorneys, not clients.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the goal is to expedite the process, not prolong it.

This establishes a clear record of the employee's ownership and creation of the work prior to sharing it with the employer. It provides a timestamped public record that can be used as evidence if any disputes arise later.

There's a more complete explanation [here](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/06/11/us/ap-us-tax-workarounds.html?searchResultPosition=30). \n\nBefore 2017, if you paid, say, $30,000 in state taxes, you could take a $30,000 deduction from your federal taxable income, thus reducing your federal income taxes by some fraction of $30,000 (depending on your tax bracket). The 2017 tax bill placed a $10,000 limit on this deduction. Some states responded by creating a provision where you could donate $30,000 to the state and receive a $30,000 credit against your state taxes owed \\- so you end up paying the same amount to the state, but now you characterize it as a charitable donation, which is still deductible from your federal taxable income.\n\nThe new IRS regulation says that such a \"donation\" will no longer be deductible from your federal taxable income; that's all. Your state can still issue you a tax credit for such a donation if they want \\- the federal government has no control over that \\- but any such credit will reduce the amount you are allowed to deduct on your federal return, making the whole exercise pointless.\n\nThe federal government certainly has the power to determine how you should compute your income for the purposes of your federal income taxes, including what you may or may not deduct. That's the power they're using here.",

The IRS did not impose new tax laws at the state level or ban states from offering tax credits (eliminating options A and C). Instead, it used its authority to determine what can be deducted on federal tax returns.

According to labor laws and the principle that notice periods should be the same for both employee and employer, Professor Singh is entitled to full salary for May and June. By terminating his work duties early (on April 30th), the university effectively chose to reduce the notice period. However, they are still obligated to honor the original three-month notice period specified in the faculty handbook and Professor Singh's resignation letter. The university cannot unilaterally change the notice period without the employee's agreement. Since Professor Singh was presumably a salaried employee (as is common for university faculty), he should receive his normal salary for the full notice period, including May and June, even though he did not work during this time. This situation falls under the category where the employer chooses to release the employee earlier than the stipulated notice period, and thus must pay for the entire notice period as originally agreed upon."

Specifically because the landlord is out of town that day. Can a landlord demand full rent for me being one day over my 30 day notice because he is out of town to do a walk through? Seems illegal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming you have a lease of a year which expires on the 24th, you are supposed to surrender the premise by the end of that day. If you don't, then you are engaging in \"unlawful detainer\", and the landlord could go ahead with the legal process of booting you out. Supposing that in the meantime you do surrender the premise, then per \u00a71952\\.3, then it becomes an ordinary civil action. Either way, the landlord would be entitled to some relief (there is no law saying that you can stay an extra day). According to the [Department of Real Estate](http://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/refbook/ref09.pdf) (p. 17\\), the court can award owed\\-rent damages to the landlord up to the date of the judgment. It's hard to say when that judgment would be handed down, because it depends on how busy the courts are, plus if the matter goes from (high\\-priority) unlawful detainer to (low\\-priority) regular civil procedure, that would extend the time to judgment and potentially the size of your liability. Typically, when you become a holdover tenant then you are in the \"month\\-to\\-month\" realm, so your rent obligation would extend for another month (by default, an agreement [is assumed](http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/civil-code/civ-sect-1944.html) to be for a month).\n\nHowever: it's generally easy to get out of an apartment by the deadline and hand over the keys to the landlord or his agent. A \"walk\\-thorough\" can be scheduled for the next Monday (for example), though you might want to take pictures before you go. There is actually [no legal requirement](http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/sec-deposit.shtml) that the landlord allow you to be present for the post\\-move\\-out inspection, so in the worst case, you might have to get into a separate legal squabble over the security deposit, if you think he is making up damage.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in California has given a 30-day notice to vacate their apartment, which expires on July 31st. The landlord is out of town on that day and cannot conduct a walk-through inspection. The tenant stays one extra day (August 1st) to wait for the landlord's return. What are the potential legal consequences for the tenant?\n\nA) The tenant is not liable for any additional rent or penalties, as the landlord's absence excuses the extra day.\nB) The tenant may be liable for a full month's rent, as they have become a holdover tenant on a month-to-month basis.\nC) The tenant is only responsible for paying 1/30th of the monthly rent for the extra day stayed.\nD) The landlord cannot pursue any legal action or damages against the tenant for the one-day overstay.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, when a tenant stays beyond their notice period, they become a holdover tenant. In California, holdover tenancies are typically treated as month-to-month agreements by default. This means the tenant may be liable for a full month's rent, even if they only stayed one extra day. The landlord's absence does not excuse the overstay, and there is no legal requirement for the landlord to be present for a walk-through inspection. The tenant should have vacated the premises by the end of their notice period and handed over the keys, regardless of the landlord's availability. Option B is correct because it accurately reflects the potential financial liability the tenant may face under California law for becoming a holdover tenant."

For example, if someone were to walk into a NJ government office and loudly proclaim that they had just arrived from Texas and won't be self\\-quarantining, is there anything they can do except appeal to the person's conscience? In other words, is the description of the quarantine as \"voluntary\" more a recognition that public health authorities are not actively monitoring and pursuing visitors as a matter of practice or is it a recognition that the state literally has no legal means to force visitors to comply?\n\n*Also to be clear*, I'm asking solely about the general quarantine described above. Cases where someone has tested positive for COVID\\-19 or been specifically identified as a close contact of someone who did are out of scope for this question.\n\n*Why* someone would want to travel to New Jersey is out of scope for this question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is the New Jersey quarantine rule a legal requirement or merely a recommendation?\n\nEven if the rule had force of law, the language indicates that self\\-quarantine is optional. The term \"expectation\" merely indicates the government's preference.\n\n[Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines *voluntary* as \"*unimpelled by another's influence \\[...]. Proceeding from the free and unrestrained will of the person. \\[...] Produced in or by an act of choice*\".

The authorities could monitor merely for purposes of doing projections, that is, without penalizing the people who decide not to self\\-quarantine.\n\nThe excerpt reflects that in the government's opinion the circumstances do not warrant making \\[self\\-]quarantine compulsory.",

The hub states that \"compliance is expected\" but also describes the quarantine as \"voluntary.\" Based on this information and legal interpretation, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The self-quarantine is legally mandated and non-compliance can result in legal penalties.\n\nB) The self-quarantine is a strong recommendation but not legally enforceable.\n\nC) The self-quarantine is only applicable to those who have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nD) The self-quarantine is mandatory only for visitors from specific high-risk states.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The language used in the New Jersey COVID-19 Information Hub suggests that while the government strongly recommends self-quarantine and expects compliance, it is not a legal requirement. The use of terms like \"voluntary\" and \"should\" indicates that it is a recommendation rather than a mandate. The phrase \"compliance is expected\" reflects the government's preference and desire for people to follow the guideline, but it does not imply legal enforceability. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the quarantine is explicitly described as \"voluntary,\" which means it cannot be legally mandated with penalties for non-compliance.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the question specifically states that cases where someone has tested positive for COVID-19 are out of scope for this particular guideline.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the guideline applies to travelers from \"any U.S. state or territory\" beyond the immediate region, not just specific high-risk states."

Is the common conceptual figures like flowcharts of compilers, and list of programming keywords or ASCII table comes under copyright?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Putvi's answer is basically correct, but there are some points that should be further elaborated on. [This is a flow chart](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Flowchart-Illustrating-The-BPSK-None-Return-to-Zero-NRZ-Converter-b-QPSK-Modulation_fig2_313243090) that reduces a concept to a standard notation.

The same is true of many mathematical equations or structural formulae in chemistry. However, those ideas have often been instantiated in publications with the element of creativity required for copyright protection: a flowchart could be a piece of art (that is how graphic designers see their work product). Directly copying that artwork would be infringement of the artist's copyright. Since the ideas which the art expresses are unprotected, you can create your own art following standard conventions, and the result will look very similar to the protected artwork in a published book. That similarity is because there are very limited possibilities for variation, under those standards. A publisher may, however, insist that you get permission from an author, if they are not familiar with the presentation standards in your field (so you may have to argue with the publisher).",

Yet, she received several thousand dollars in medical bills recently, from the institution itself and not her insurance company.\n\nShe has received some things in writing, but not as much about the financial process as she would have hoped (and nothing related to the bill she currently has). Thus, she is wondering if she can record her verbal interactions with hospital staff in order to hold them accountable if she is *told* that insurance will cover the costs, but she *still* receives a medical bill.\n\nThis could be seen as an invasion of privacy of the care provider(s); yet it pertains to her case and since they have sidestepped conversations about giving her the official financial paperwork, or written consent that what they say is actually true (they could be *saying* it's true just to get more money out of her), it seems that this would be legal to do.\n\nAs far as I understand it, HIPAA is meant to protect patients from care providers disclosing their medical information. Nothing I've read ([HIPAA Patient rights](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-individuals/guidance-materials-for-consumers/index.html); [HIPAA disclosures to family and friends](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/disclosures-to-family-and-friends)) has anything about a patient's right to disclose their *own* information to whomever they want (in this case, family).\n\n**Can she legally record her conversations with her care providers under HIPAA?** If so, what would be required on her part in order to ensure that said recordings would hold up in court if, in fact, staff were intentionally or unintentionally lying to her in order to bill her?\n\nYes I know it's highly unlikely that they would bother *not* billing insurance and try to screw her over. It's a long story, insurance claims have been difficult, just trying to figure out how to help her *not* rack up $10k\\+ in medical bills due to unintentional or intentional fault on the side of the care providers.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is correct that HIPAA does not restrict what patients do. Recording a conversation may be governed by federal or state law: [this](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations) is a good guide (check the relevant state law, in particular whether this is in a two\\-party state). Insurance companies never bill patients, but they do send notices saying \"here's what you must pay\" (which should match what the hospital bills). Note that apart from the billing department (whom patients do not see), medical staff including check\\-in receptionists do not and cannot know in real time what is actually covered for an individual, and they only give guesses. [This article](http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2013/11/11/health-insurance-patient-responsibility-part-i/) and [the follow\\-up](http://blogs.harvard.edu/billofhealth/2013/11/25/health-insurance-patient-responsibility-part-ii/) lightly discusses patient\\-responsibility issues.

HIPAA does not restrict patients from recording their own medical interactions. However, the legality of recording conversations without all parties' consent varies by state (one-party vs. two-party consent laws). If legal in the patient's state, such recordings could potentially be useful evidence if staff provided incorrect information about insurance coverage, although it's important to note that most medical staff cannot guarantee coverage in real-time. Options A and B are incorrect as HIPAA does not prohibit patients from recording, and such recordings could be admissible if obtained legally.

However, the child is likely eligible for both Indian citizenship through the father and Bangladeshi citizenship through the mother. The correct answer notes that while the child is eligible for both, applying for dual citizenship may be discouraged by Indian law, making this option potentially problematic.

In Germany, access to information about civil or criminal complaints and court proceedings is generally limited due to personality rights protections. The documentation emphasizes that there is a balance between personality rights and public interest. Court proceedings are generally public, but the information released about them is restrictive. Indictments cannot be published before proceedings begin, and law enforcement is even more restrictive about publicizing information on criminal complaints or investigations. The answer explicitly states that there is no way to check this information on Google from official sources.

Then it was announced that the DOJ Chief of Staff, Matthew Whitaker would be the Acting AG and according to the [Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/415591-acting-ag-to-take-over-oversight-of-russia-probe), NyPost, and others:\n\n> \"The Acting Attorney General is in charge of all matters under the purview of the Department of Justice,\" DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nAnd yet, on the basis of this legal analysis in [Slate](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/07/if_donald_trump_fires_jeff_sessions_here_s_how_he_ll_appoint_a_successor.html) over a year ago, there are only three things that the President can do with respect to this without going through the Senate:\n\n1. He could\n\n> ... follow the terms of the DOJ succession statute and his own executive order on DOJ succession, under both of which the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, would automatically become the acting attorney general ...\n\n2. The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998:\n\n> A more complicated scenario would be to rely on the provision codified at 5 U.S. Code Section 3345(a)(2\\), which states: \u201cnotwithstanding \\[the default rule that the deputy becomes the acting], the President (and only the President) may direct a person who serves in an office for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity...\n\n3. An interim appointment of an actual AG.\n\nTo the best of my understanding none of these things have happened. He did not appoint the Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein, Whitaker as DOJ Chief of Staff has not gone through Senate approval, and he is not making an interim appointment. And yet I cannot find a single journalistic, legal, or even political source that has questioned the authority or the legality of the President's actions in this matter today.\n\nCan someone who understands the legal issues here please explain to me what is going on (legally and/or constitutionally)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Based on [5 U.S. Code Section 3345](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/3345), Matthew Whitaker appears to fulfill the criteria for subsection (a)(3\\):\n\n> notwithstanding paragraph (1\\), the President (and only the President) may direct an officer or employee of such Executive agency to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity, subject to the time limitations of section 3346, if\u2014\n> \n> \n> \n> > (A) during the 365\\-day period preceding the date of death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve of the applicable officer, the officer or employee served in a position in such agency for not less than 90 days; and\n> > \n> > \n> > (B) the rate of pay for the position described under subparagraph (A) is equal to or greater than the minimum rate of pay payable for a position at GS\u201315 of the General Schedule.\n\nHe has held the Chief of Staff position for a little over a year, and the Chief of Staff position is almost certainly an [SES Pay Scale](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/compensation/) position which would be higher than a GS\\-15\\. The time limitation in section 3346 mentioned only refers to the length of time he can serve as the acting attorney general.\n\nIt's worth noting that the next part is:\n\n> (1\\) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1\\), a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section, if\u2014\n> \n> \n> \n> > (A) during the 365\\-day period preceding the date of the death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve, such person\u2014\n> > \n> > \n> > \n> > > (i) did not serve in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer; or\n> > > \n> > > \n> > > (ii) served in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer for less than 90 days; and\n> > \n> > \n> > (B) the President submits a nomination of such person to the Senate for appointment to such office.\n\nAs Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the \"first assistant\" for the purpose of this section (see [28 U.S. Code Section 508](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/508)), this means that if the President decides to nominate Whitaker to the position, he would have to resign his acting position.",

As DOJ Chief of Staff for over a year, Whitaker meets these criteria.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the point of this provision is to allow temporary appointments without Senate confirmation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Whitaker was not Deputy Attorney General, and this refers to the automatic succession rule which wasn't used here.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the President has the authority to choose Whitaker over Rosenstein using the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that if Whitaker is nominated for the permanent position, he would need to step down as Acting AG during the confirmation process."

The location of the employee (BC) and the company office (Ontario) does not change this fact. The 24-hour notice mentioned by the manager is not a legal requirement for avoiding payment in either province.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I moved into a rental home around 2 years ago immediately on the heels of a previous tenant. I experienced the usual \"mail overlap\" period of a few weeks, during which I was happy to pass letters \\& small packages either back to our carrier. These trickled away and I felt like things had settled. \n\nThen, the first \"big box\" came. \n\nIt seems the previous tenant works in sales/marketing, and about once a month I've gotten large packages from various marketing firms. Most of these are shipped via non\\-USPS carriers (UPS \\& FedEx are most prevalent here, though I've occasionally seen DHL as well). Initially, I tried taking these to our property managers, but they informed me that they had no forwarding info for the previous tenants and that I should follow up with the delivery folks instead. Our landlord was similarly stumped regarding getting in touch with the former tenants. I spoke to a couple drivers and was told that they could take them, but that they would likely be redelivered. I tried this and had the packages redelivered multiple times by different drivers before giving up.\n\nI called both UPS \\& FedEx and was told that I could hang onto the packages for the tenant or destroy them (I got this from both different companies twice \\- I didn't believe it the first time, either). FedEx offered me the option of adding a special rule that packages addressed to the previous tenant would not be delivered here, but there's a further complicating factor \\- *we share almost the same name*.\n\nWhereas I'm \"Kyle Robins\" (pseudonym), the former tenant was \"Kyle Robinson\" (also pseudonym \\- but really, the similarity is kind of creepy). So when I suggested taking advantage of the \"don't deliver to this person\" feature, the rep was kind enough to warn me that there may be some missed mail due to name confusion. I do a significant portion of my business online and a few missed packages could translate to \"can't pay my rent this month\", so that's a pretty big concern for me. Ultimately, the same rep informed me that I could hold or destroy the packages.\n\nI tried calling some of the companies listed on the package return addresses, but most of them are just printshops and couldn't give me any info about specific ordering companies I could call to try and rectify the situation. A few suggested I open the packages to get more info, but honestly opening a package not meant for me scares me more than just throwing the whole box out uninvestigated.\n\nAfter over a year of having these poster\\-sized packages accumulating in a corner, I tossed the lot of them into the bin. Since then I've received others and done the same, but it worries me more every time I do so. I'm approaching the 2\\-year mark with no contact from the former tenant, and I'm curious: is there a proper way to handle this situation? Does the [US Code mentioned here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3636/is-it-illegal-to-throw-away-the-previous-tenants-mail) apply to non\\-USPS vendors as well? I feel like I've done everything I could be reasonably expected to so short of buying a shed to store \"other\\-Kyle\"'s boxes for him, but I don't want something important to slip by for both of our sakes!\n\nAs a clarifying point: These are all large, mostly unmarked boxes \\- nothing hand addressed or customized. There were some similar packages left in the attic when we moved in full of pamphlets/foldouts/posters, leading me to believe these are the same sorts of things. Anything obviously personal has come \\& gone via USPS \\- I suppose I would just hold an obviously personal package or Amazon delivery from another carrier indefinitely.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Focusing on the legal question, the obstruction of correspondence statute would not be applicable to UPS package deliveries. To repeat 18 USC 1702,\n\n> Whoever takes any letter, postal card, or package out of any post\n>  office or any authorized depository for mail matter, or from any\n>  letter or mail carrier, or which has been in any post office or\n>  authorized depository, or in the custody of any letter or mail\n>  carrier, before it has been delivered to the person to whom it was\n>  directed, with design to obstruct the correspondence, or to pry into\n>  the business or secrets of another, or opens, secretes, embezzles, or\n>  destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not\n>  more than five years, or both.\n\nPrivate package delivery services deliver to the porch (pr similar), not to an authorized depository (such as a mailbox). They are not \"mail\", and they have not been in the custody of the postal service (unless they have, where USPS actually makes the delivery).\n\nSuch deliveries constitute unsolicited goods / unordered merchandise, since they were not things that you requested. There are state and federal rules to the effect that you may accept such goods as gifts, and you have no obligation to return the goods. Here is the [Washington state law](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=19.56.020) for example, and [here](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0181-unordered-merchandise) is what the FTC says about it at the federal level.

These deliveries are considered unsolicited goods, and the recipient (in this case, Kyle Robins) has no legal obligation to return or store them. Both state and federal laws, such as Washington state law and FTC guidelines, allow recipients to treat such goods as gifts.

According to EU law, specifically the Solvency II Directive, in which country should the insurance premium tax be levied?\n\nA) Country A, because it's the country of incorporation and location of physical assets\nB) Country B, because it's the country of tax residence and effective management\nC) Both Country A and Country B, with the tax split based on the proportion of business conducted in each\nD) The country where the insurance company is based, regardless of TechCorp's location\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the complex interplay between EU insurance premium tax laws, corporate structure, and the concept of establishment. The correct answer is B, based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. The Solvency II Directive states that for legal persons, the risk is situated in \"that policy holder's establishment to which the contract relates.\"\n\n2. While Country A is the place of incorporation and physical asset location, the concept of \"establishment\" in EU law often aligns more closely with the place of effective management and control.\n\n3. The fact that TechCorp is tax resident in Country B and effectively managed from there suggests that its primary establishment, for legal purposes, is in Country B.\n\n4. The \"place of establishment\" typically considers factors such as where key decisions are made and where the central administration is located, which in this case appears to be Country B.\n\n5. The location of servers and official headquarters is less relevant than the place of effective management when determining establishment for tax and legal purposes.\n\nThis question highlights the complexity of determining establishment in cases where a company's formal incorporation and effective management are in different EU member states, reflecting real-world challenges in applying EU directives to multinational corporations."
