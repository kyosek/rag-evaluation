I have recently been told that when you are in traffic court there are no references to federal law and to try to use federal law would be considered \"pseudo law\" , or a sovereignty issue. But from what I can find , the real rule is The U.S. Constitution declares that federal law is \u201cthe supreme law of the land.\u201d As a result, when a federal law conflicts with a state or local law, the federal law will supersede the other law or laws. This is commonly known as \u201cpreemption.\u201d\n\nI am the \\-3 and deleted [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/61313/36788). I am guessing I will be kicked off the site but I don't understand, because I am being told I can't use federal law when I have very effectively. So I am confused on how I win in court. Is it always a fluke ? Please don't consider this a rant. It is a legitimate legal question that I assumed was answered when a judge took a fix\\-it ticket and turned it into a $1200 ticket (because I was fighting it) and then apparently just gave me the win even though I was using the Federal Law from the USC Title 18 to define what a motor vehicle was in a State court. But I am not ranting, or upset at all. I'm just wondering, could a judge made such a simple mistake and cost the courts all that money ? Not the $1200, but to pay all the overhead of appearing 4 times and the warrant. Granted, I do believe my answer was PERFECT, I also know I could be wrong. And with my answer being pulled so easily, I must be missing something. I'm looking at 10 votes for an \"answer\" to this question, and yet it doesn't answer the question whatsoever. So if my question falls against this site, I apologize. That is not my intention. Please help me understand. Was my judge just uneducated?\nThis question cannot be answer simply by claiming the question is frivolous. That would be absurd. I think I need to make this point , I have successfully used this in court, and it's a good thing that we all can because some judges (1 in particular) would stoop so low as to say neither \"the United States Constitution nor the Supreme Court rulings matter in court since California is not a state\". When in fact The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution Under the Supremacy Clause, found in Article VI, section 2 of the U.S. Constitution, both the Constitution and federal law supersede state laws.\n\nThe Federal law being applied is the United States code definition of Motor Vehicle, what shows that the state laws are in direct conflict with the Constitution and the federal laws. And no State can take a right and turn it into a crime and issue a license and a fee for it. In a sense saying that you can have your right if you pay us for it. That would not be a right.\nA couple other important points that may clear up some \" answers \". When the case is called, I tell the judge I am here in propria persona speaking for the named defendant, all I say is for the record and I invoke art. 4 sec. 4 of the Constitution which guarantees me a Republican form of Government. Im not a US Citizen but an American National (non statutory citizen) and I set my court. When I asked him if it was civil or criminal, he said \"you tell me\". I said it can't be either since there is no injured party and no contract.\nI believe that locks the court up.\nThey cant throw statutory at me because there is no written rule for a criminal case thats statutory jurisdiction and so I couldnt have a fair trial.\nAlso by using the Constitution and Supreme Court cases that say I have the right of motion /travel then I would have a perfect case for willfulness. Immunity.\nFailure to show a cause of action in which relief could be granted.\nAs far as I can see, all the rules I am using are theirs.\n\nThe right of the citizen to travel upon the highway and to transport his property\nthereon, in the ordinary course of life and business, differs radically and\nobviously from that of one who makes the highway his place of business for\nprivate gain in the running of a stagecoach or omnibus.\" State vs. City of\nSpokane, 186 P. 864\\.\nWhat is this Right of the Citizen which differs so \"radically and obviously\" from one who\nuses the highway as a place of business? Who better to enlighten us than Justice Tolman of\nthe Supreme Court of Washington State? In State vs. City of Spokane, supra, the Court also\nnoted a very \"radical and obvious\" difference, but went on to explain just what the difference\nis:\n\"The former is the usual and ordinary right of the Citizen, a common right to all,\nwhile the latter is special, unusual, and extraordinary.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is true that in the US, valid Federal law supersedes state law or regulation when there is a conflict. Precisely because of this, state laws and regulations are normally carefully written to avoid such conflicts.\n\nIt is very unusual for a federal law issue to apply in traffic court. The question does not say what Federal law issue you think will apply to your case. Most issues where Federal law might plausibly affect a state court process, such as a fourth amendment violation on a search and seizure issue, would not apply in traffic court, although they might apply in a criminal court proceeding. Federal law does not generally deal with traffic issues, nor does it preempt state traffic laws, because there is normally no conflict.\n\nThere is a group of people, who often call themselves [\"sovereign citizens\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement) who have a habit of making wildly invalid legal claims, and trying to claim that much of the law does not apply to them. Such people often assert elaborate theories about why certain laws do not apply, not infrequently involving the Federal Supremacy Clause. Such claims are invalid, and will not be received well by a court. A claim that one travels by \"conveyance\" rather than by \"car\" and thus state laws do not apply is such an invalid claim.\n\nThe argument made in [this answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61251/no-blinker-in-a-left-turn-lane-is-it-illegal/61313#61313) is such an invalid claim. Chapter 18 of the US code does regulate commercial vehicles to some extent. Therefore **in that chapter** \"motor vehicle\" does mean \"commercial vehicle\" because those federal regulations do not apply to private vehicles. This does **not** mean that state regulations that apply to private vehicles are preempted or otherwise invalid.\n\nIf you think a Federal Issue will apply during a traffic court session, it would be wise to consult a lawyer in advance. Many lawyers offer free or low\\-cost initial consultations.\n\nIf you think a relevant legal issue is not being addressed, politely, briefly, and clearly explain the issue that you think applies. Do not yell at the judge or other court personnel. Do not try to \"make up your own rules\". You will be given a chance to indicate your side of the issue.\n\n**Response to recent edit, and related comments**\n\nWithout a record of the actual court hearing you describe, there is no way to determine if the judge was acting correctly or not. Even with the record there might well be no way to determine what the judge had in mind, or why s/he acted as s/he did.\n\nI maintain that any argument that state traffic codes are in fact preempted by federal law, or apply only to commercial vehicles, or that an ordinary personal car is not a \"motor vehicle\" because of a definition in Blacks or any other dictionary, is legally unsound and frivolous, and could well subject a person who makes it in court to penalties for contempt. A particular judge might not want to bother with the matter, of course.\n\nI think i have answered the question as asked, in a way likely to be most helpful to people in general.

The judge seems skeptical but allows the argument. Which of the following best explains the legal complexities in this scenario?\n\nA) The driver's argument is likely valid, as federal law always preempts state law in traffic matters\nB) The judge is obligated to dismiss the case due to the invocation of federal supremacy\nC) The driver's argument probably misapplies the federal supremacy principle to traffic law\nD) State traffic courts are constitutionally prohibited from considering federal law arguments\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the complex interplay between federal and state law in the context of traffic regulations. The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced reality of the situation:\n\n1. Federal supremacy is a valid legal principle, as stated in the U.S. Constitution. However, its application in traffic court is often misunderstood.\n\n2. While federal law can preempt state law when there's a direct conflict, this rarely applies to traffic regulations. Most traffic laws are within the state's jurisdiction and don't conflict with federal statutes.\n\n3. The driver's argument likely stems from a misinterpretation of federal vehicle definitions or regulations, which are often specific to commercial vehicles or interstate commerce, not generally applicable to all traffic situations.\n\n4. Judges in traffic court may allow such arguments out of procedural fairness, but this doesn't mean the arguments are legally sound.\n\n5. Option A is incorrect because federal law doesn't always preempt state law in traffic matters. Option B is wrong as judges aren't obligated to dismiss cases merely because federal law is invoked. Option D is false because state courts can consider federal law when relevant, though it rarely applies in traffic cases.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, integrate multiple ideas (federal supremacy, state jurisdiction, traffic law), and understand common misconceptions in legal interpretation.

The terms and conditions for the game state (as many other games do), and I'm paraphrasing here, that items within the game may not be traded for outside of the game for real currency.

If an entity does not hire a lawyer, a default judgment will enter against it.\n\nIn other words, a CEO or manager or managing member of a company isn't allowed to speak for it in court.

Over the next 15 years, they create several improved versions, each with new features that enhance processing speed and capabilities. All these enhancements rely on the original chip's fundamental architecture. Twenty years after the initial patent, a competitor plans to manufacture chips based on the original design.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. Patent protection lasts for a limited time (typically 20 years from the filing date). Once a patent expires, the invention enters the public domain and can be freely used by anyone.\n2. The original chip design's patent has expired after 20 years, making it available for public use.\n3. Newer patents only protect the specific improvements and new features added to the original design, not the core design itself.\n4. The competitor can use the original design without infringing on any patents, but they cannot incorporate any of the patented improvements made in the last 15 years without licensing them.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the company cannot sue for infringement based on newer patents if only the original, now-public domain design is used. Option C is wrong because waiting for all related patents to expire is not necessary; the original design can be used once its patent expires. Option D is incorrect because there's no legal basis to prevent marketing the chips as compatible with newer versions, as long as no patented improvements are used without permission.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to integrate multiple concepts from patent law, apply them to a complex scenario, and understand the limitations and expiration of patent protection."}, "7": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4588/what-are-freemen-of-the-land-or-sovereign-citizen-theories-and-do-they-hold", "docs_id": 4588, "title": "What are &quot;freemen of the land&quot; or &quot;sovereign citizen&quot; theories and do they hold any water?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Various questions so far have asked about the constitutionality, or not, of various freemen theories, which include \"Fourteenth Amendment\" citizens and is quite possibly a variant of the Sovereign Citizen movement.\n\nEssentially, these are theories that treat the government and its laws as a contract, that can only be enforced with the consent of the governed.\n\nWhat I'd be interested in is **have these theories *ever* been upheld by a court of law**? For example, freemen theories have been used at times to reject courts' jurisdictions, attempt to enforce or invalidate debt, and many others.\n\nIt might be difficult to prove a negative, but with theories like these, I'd be willing to bet that if there's a court anywhere that has upheld any of them, we'd know all about it.\n\nI'm looking for a detailed response that describes and debunks prominent variants of these theories \u2013 or shows that they've succeeded.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My research has turned up no instances of anyone successfully advocating these ideas in court.\n\nThese are crackpot pseudo\\-legal theories that have no legal validity whatsoever.

Under their theory, natural laws require only that individuals do not harm others, do not damage the property of others, and do not use \"fraud or mischief\" in contracts. They say that all people have two parts to their existence \u2013 their body and their legal \"person\". The latter is represented by the individual's birth certificate; some freemen claim that it is entirely limited to the birth certificate. Under this theory, a \"strawman\" is created when a birth certificate is issued, and this \"strawman\" is the entity who is subject to statutory law. The physical self is referred to by a slightly different name \u2013 for example \"John of the family Smith\", as opposed to \"John Smith\".\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington tried and convicted Kenneth Wayne Leaming for retaliation by making false claims and wrote:\n\n> Defendant \\[Kenneth Wayne Leaming] is apparently a member of a group loosely styled \"sovereign citizens.\" The Court has deduced this from a number of Defendant\u2019s peculiar habits.\n> \n> \n> First, like Mr. Leaming, sovereign citizens are fascinated by capitalization. They appear to believe that capitalizing names has some sort of legal effect. For example, Defendant writes that \"the REGISTERED FACTS appearing in the above Paragraph evidence the uncontroverted and uncontrovertible FACTS that the SLAVERY SYSTEMS operated in the names UNITED STATES, United States, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, and United States of America . . . are terminated nunc pro tunc by public policy, U.C.C. 1\\-103 . . . .\" (Def.\u2019s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 2\\.) He appears to believe that by capitalizing \"United States,\" he is referring to a different entity than the federal government. For better or for worse, it\u2019s the same country.\n> \n> \n> Second, sovereign citizens, like Mr. Leaming, love grandiose legalese. \"COMES NOW, Kenneth Wayne, born free to the family Leaming, \\[date of birth redacted], constituent to The People of the State of Washington constituted 1878 and admitted to the union 22 February 1889 by Act of Congress, a Man, \"State of Body\" competent to be a witness and having First Hand Knowledge of The FACTS . . . .\" (Def.\u2019s Mandatory Jud. Not. at 1\\.)\n> \n> \n> Third, Defendant evinces, like all sovereign citizens, a belief that the federal government is not real and that he does not have to follow the law. Thus, Defendant argues that as a result of the \"REGISTERED FACTS,\" the \"states of body, persons, actors and other parties perpetuating the above captioned transaction(s) \\[i.e., the Court and prosecutors] are engaged . . . in acts of TREASON, and if unknowingly as victims of TREASON and FRAUD . . . .\" (Def.\u2019s Mandatory Jud.

Mr. Burns from the simpsons comes to my mind immediately.\n\nIs there any truth behind this assumption? Can a large lawyer team render you invulnerable to certain lawsuits? I have no experience with any real applications of jurisprudence, so I find it really strange.\n\nSome points I can think of:\n\n* When the lawsuit is so large and complicated that you need the manpower to sift through all its aspects. Still, if you poisoned an ecosystem your guilt should be provable and you would be condemned no matter the number of lawyers.\n* Intimidating your opponent with the number of your lawyers to make them concede to a extrajudicial solution.\n* It's just a code for bribing the judges.\n\nBut none of those would explain this phenomenon properly. Is it even a real thing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are times when having a large law firm work on a case can be an advantage.\n\nIt is rare for the number of lawyers working on a particular case to be more than three or four plus a few paralegals, even in a case where there are virtually unlimited resources at a party's disposal.\n\nIn those cases, the primary benefit of having a large law firm at your disposal is that by paying top dollar for those attorneys, you may (but certainly don't always) get particularly competent attorneys at firms that have good systems in place.\n\nIf you are willing to spend the money you can also have the attorney and paralegal team work exhaustively to leave no stone unturned in terms of legal research, style and proofreading, \"wild goose chase\" factual and legal research of matters like trial court arguments from other cases that the opposing counsel has participated in, and trial presentations with lavish presentation quality.\n\nFor example, in one case where my firm was litigating against a large law firm in state supreme court arguments, the firm had seven law firm partners who had served as clerks in that court earlier in their careers participate in mock oral arguments to help the appellate lawyer who would be presented the case in oral arguments to the Colorado Supreme Court prepare (with four members of your core team and seven mock justices plus some paralegals participating this was a $5000\\+ per hour activity).\n\nA typical run of the mill appellate brief prepared competently might take 100 hours, while a large firm might devote 800 hours to the same task (both of these are hypothetical round numbers suggested just to get the point across).\n\nThis incredibly intense working up of cases, moreover, often involves attorneys who aren't really starting from scratch as they has handled many similar cases before in their careers, while their smaller firm competition may have only encountered the issues presented for the first time.\n\nYou are also paying for connections and experience. For example, a large law firm may have an easier time retaining the most decorated expert witnesses to argue on their behalf. These attorneys may also have handled numerous cases in front of the judge or judges who will be deciding the case (and if they haven't someone else in the large firm probably has) and thus can better predict what approach will be received best by that particular judge.\n\nThe exception to the rule that the maximal economies of scale are reached with a quite small group of lawyers is that in addition to this core group of lawyers, some cases, such as class action lawsuits, or cases involving complex transactions (e.g. construction project disputes in a large project with hundreds of contractors) may require an immense amount of factual discovery in the trial court in the form of depositions of dozens or hundreds of people with relevant knowledge, and/or review of vast volumes of documents (e.g. I've had several cases with whole rooms stacked floor to ceiling with relevant documents in banker's boxes).\n\nIn cases like those, you need an army of senior paralegals and junior attorneys to interview witnesses, take depositions and review and summarize documents to get to the bottom of the factual matters needed to prove a case.\n\nThe down side of this approach, however, is that it is extremely expensive relative to the alternatives per task, and frequently impossible to recover your costs and attorney fees from the other party, perhaps because they aren't permitted to be awarded, perhaps because a judge would find some or all of your fees and costs to be unreasonable, or perhaps because the other side simply can't afford to pay them.\n\nSo, using a firm like this really only makes sense if the stakes involved are very high, or if there are long term strategic reasons to litigate. Spending $1,000,000 on attorneys' fees and costs is a very expensive way to litigate a $100,000 one off dispute. But spending $1,000,000 on attorneys' fees and costs is perfectly sensible if there is $100,000,000 in controversy in the case at hand, or if a favorable outcome will influence the outcome of a large number of future disputed of the same type.\n\nThe other dirty little secret is that lots of the work done by large law firms for which their clients pay an immense amount of money isn't done very well. One inherent down side of being large is that a large law firm is bureaucratic and prone to the kinds of mistakes that all large organizations have, for example, in diffusing responsibility for mistakes that can allow mistakes to fall through the cracks. Also, while the typical large law firm lawyer is typically more knowledgable than the typical small firm lawyer about the field at issue, this doesn't always happen. Sometimes junior attorneys get assigned too much responsibility on cases in areas where they have blind spots in their knowledge, and sometimes a large firm attorney ends up working a case due to personal connections with the client rather than because that attorney is the most qualified person in the firm to handle it.\n\nAlso, while some very brilliant lawyers do indeed work at large law firms, technical competence isn' the only consideration in hiring. Successful large firm lawyers need to be team players, need to conform and function well in a large bureaucracy, and need to have the social capital to be comfortable on a day to day basis with the firm's other lawyers and their affluent and big business clients. Many large firm lawyers have those soft skills while having only competent rather than excellent legal acumen.\n\nFurther, since most large law firm lawyers go straight from law school to a big firm (sometimes with a detour clerking for a judge for a couple of years), and large law firms handle mostly very big cases that are usually settled by lead attorneys before going to trial, most large law firm attorneys aren't particularly experienced at trial work. Some large law firms compensate for that by laterally hiring former prosecutors, former criminal defense lawyers and former high volume personal injury litigators to do that work, but often, large law firms have few lawyers in the courtroom with much trial experience relative to how many years they have practiced law. They may be very well prepared, but often there is no substitute for hands on trial experience.\n\nStill large law firms tend to fight extremely hard in trial, but tend to be pushovers in settlement discussions. This is driven by the reality that the client will incur huge amounts of attorneys fees and costs to go the distance, and by the fact that professionally, the worst thing that a large firm lawyer can do it to have an unexpected and unpredictable bad outcome at trial. So, large firm attorneys seek to give their clients low expectations about what is possible in litigation in order to make it possible to make cases with significant uncertainty go away with settlements larger than would really have been necessary to settle the case with a more total client litigation and settlement cost sensitive law firm.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about the impact of large legal teams, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A multinational corporation is facing a complex environmental lawsuit involving multiple stakeholders across several jurisdictions.

Perhaps they deleted their email address and someone else with the same name took it up. Or many other reasons it would be hard to tell.

Proof, in a scientific or mathematical sense, is something that is irrefutable and conclusively proves the point unless the assumptions it is based on are proven false. Evidence, on the other hand, is merely something that tends to make a fact at issue in the case more or less likely to be true. (Paraphrasing Federal Rule of Evidence 401, which determines relevant evidence)\n\nTrying to create proof that would be irrefutable such as proof of original authorship is very difficult. But amassing a bunch of evidence is usually pretty easy and often what wins court cases. If you offer a hand\\-written and dated ledger entry that you created a work on a certain date, and you testified to its veracity in order to get it properly admitted at court, you would likely have more proof than most people for many crucial facts in court cases. Unless there is a reason to suspect the entry is fraudulent, then often the other side won't be allowed to opine that it might be fraudulent. In civil trials, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, however the plaintiff only needs to persuade by a standard of \"more likely than not\" or to put it another way 51% of the evidence. If your evidence shows that you most likely created the work, simply saying the evidence might have been faked isn't usually enough to get the defendant into a winning \"less likely than not\" analysis of the situation.\n\nI have seen court cases won on the file system date in a computer, which are pretty easy to tamper with, but absent a reason to suspect tampering, was treated as strong evidence of the date of a document.

Are there any international laws on that, or does it depend mostly on the laws of the countries involved? I do know that there have been some polls about regions changing state in the past (e.g. the [1919 poll in Vorarlberg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksabstimmung_1919_in_Vorarlberg)), but I don't know of a recent one and I don't know of any successful ones.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So generally, when a region of a nation tries to break away and form a new nation or join a nation, it's acceptance as a nation is generally based on the **Diplomatic Recognition** of other Nations. This can either be *de facto* or *de jure*, with the former acting in a manner of having some acknowledgement of a government of a territory, while a *de jure* recognition typically is stronger with embassies, consulates, and treaties between the two nations. For example, the United States has *de jure* recognition of France and vice versa, while they merely have *de facto* recognition with Iran (They recognize there is a government of the territorial area known as Iran, but they feel that the current government is illegitimate and refuse to engage with it in diplomatic relationships. Iran similarly knows there is a United States, but refuses to recognize it for political reasons as well.). When two nations do not have *de jure* recognition they will often appoint another nation \"Protecting Power\" who will act as a representative of the appointing nation in the nation they do not recognize. Currently, the Swiss Embassy in Iran has an office dedicated to U.S. affairs as it is the Protecting Power of the United States in Iran. Iran has asked Pakistan to have the same duties. And before you ask, yes, it is the geopolitical equivalent of two people in the same room not speaking to one another, but telling a third person to give the other person a message (U.S.: Switzerland tell Iran that they will give us back our citizens who are being held in their jail cells or we will drop bombs on them. Switzerland: *rolls eyes* Iran, the U.S. says they want their guys back or they will bomb you. Iran: Oh yeah? Tell U.S. 'Death to America!' Switzerland: *eye roll* They said... U.S.: Already routing the bombers!)\n\nIf a region is claimed by more than one government, than it becomes disputed territory. Presently China has a lot of disputed territory with its neighbors and Maritime neighbors. Ongoing disputes include territories also claimed by India, Bhutan, Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, and The Philippines. Interestingly, the dispute with Taiwan is over who is the real government of China... Taiwan claims much of the other disputed territory China does... plus some territories which China has resolved disputes over.\n\nThe Russia\\-Ukraine situation will likely leave the territory in question (The Donbas and Crimea Regions) listed as disputed. Generally, disputed territory doesn't mean nations cannot be friendly, as the United States has a number of territorial disputes with Canada, despite being very strong diplomatic allies (with the single largest land boarder between two nations in the world, disputed territory was bound to happen). Perhaps the most interesting is the now resolved dispute of the San Juan Island in Washington State.

Which of the following scenarios would most likely lead to widespread de jure recognition of Novoland as an independent state?\n\nA) Novoland conducts a referendum where 95% of voters support independence, but international observers report voter intimidation\nB) Oldstate agrees to a peaceful separation process, including a gradual transfer of power and equitable division of assets\nC) A major world power unilaterally recognizes Novoland and establishes full diplomatic relations\nD) Novoland's military successfully defends its borders against Oldstate for five years without international intervention\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the complex factors involved in international recognition of new states. Option B is the most likely to lead to widespread de jure recognition because it involves a mutual agreement between Novoland and Oldstate, which would significantly reduce international controversy.\n\nOption A, while showing high voter support, is problematic due to the reported intimidation, similar to the situation described with Russia's referendum in occupied Ukrainian regions. This would likely lead many countries to reject the results.\n\nOption C, involving unilateral recognition by a major power, might lead to de facto recognition by some countries but is unlikely to result in widespread de jure recognition, as other nations may view it as an illegitimate interference in Oldstate's sovereignty.\n\nOption D, while demonstrating Novoland's ability to maintain independence, does not address the legal and diplomatic aspects necessary for widespread recognition.

To be clear, this is not really about the money, but about the principle. I believe the landlord is attempting to take advantage, and many tenants more timid than myself would simply knuckle under and pay. I want to make the landlord understand she won't get away with treating people this way.\n\nThe DPS provides a dispute resolution service which the landlord is proposing to use, if I do not pay up the \u00a3150 she wants to replace the hob. The only circumstances I would pay up, rather than go to the dispute resolution, is if I were exposing myself to some significant risk by choosing the latter. \n\nIOW: is it plausible that the dispute resolution service would hand me a significantly bigger bill than this landlord is demanding? Is it likely that they could turn around and say 'she only asked for \u00a3150, but actually you have to pay her \u00a32000', or something like that? (for reference, the deposit is \u00a31200\\)\n\n\\*\\*Edit: A user asked why I would think that a bill of (say) \u00a32000 is a possibility. As it happens, I *don't* think that such a big bill is a possible consequence of going through the DPS resolution process. I am asking because my partner wants to just pay up and be done with it, because she is afraid of unforeseen consequences. I want to be able to reassure my partner that those fears are unfounded.\n\nThe point is, it commonplace for the DPS to look at the evidence and decide the landlord deserves more than the landlord asked for?\\*\\*\n\n**The background**\n\nI have recently moved out of rented accommodation. I am having a dispute with my landlord over the deposit, which is lodged with the DPS (I checked, it is).\n\nThe dispute is over a gas hob. The hob is controlled by plastic nobs, one of which I broke while cleaning.\n\nMy ex\\-landlord believes that this means the hob is now unsafe and unusable. She wants to replace the whole hob with a new one, and charge us for it.\n\nI think this is absurd, because:\n1\\) The hob was not new when I moved in two years ago, let alone now. Buying a new hob is not mitigating her losses.\n\n**edit: clarification regarding above \\-\\- I'm no lawyer. But it's my understanding that if the hob is indeed broken, I only have to pay what it was worth at the moment before it was broken. If it was only as good as a second hand hob going for e.g. \u00a340, then \u00a340 is what I have to pay. As I said I'm no lawyer, so please advise me if I am mistaken. I also believe, per number 2\\) below, that the hob can be economically repaired in any case**\n\n2\\) I do not accept that there is anything wrong with the hob apart from the absence of one plastic knob which could be easily replaced.\n\nThe landlord is also contending that one of the taps is 'jammed down' and can't be turned. I don't know what she means by that, except that I was able to turn them. One of them was stiffer than the others, but I do not think that is as a result of me removing and replacing the knobs to clean the hob.\n\nI asked the landlady who says the hob is unsafe, and she said 'the gas inspector'. She gave me his mobile number, but not his name or credentials.\n\nI strongly suspect she is getting advice from people who stand to benefit from fitting a new gas hob instead of repairing it. She says that cooker companies have advised her that no\\-one fixes gas hobs because it's too dangerous, which again I believe is ridiculous. A google search in my local area reveals a dozen companies who do this.\n\nOne other thing: the landlady has known for months that the knob was broken because this 'gas inspector' came round and looked at the hob. If it was indeed damaged by my act and unsafe, he would have known that then, and reported it to the landlady. In that case the landlady would have known that I was living with an unsafe appliance, and would have been breaking the law in a pretty serious way by not addressing that problem... right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **The landlady is trying it on.**\n\nThe purpose of a deposit is to protect the landlord from being left out of pocket by:\n\n* damage to the property\n* rent arrears\n\n[Reasonable wear and tear does not constitute damage](https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/tenancy_deposits/tenancy_deposit_deductions_your_landlord_can_make). It seems unlikely that the stiff tap is as a result of damage.\n\nThe hob is not so clear cut: the landlady could argue that it was damaged, albeit by accident, and the cost of repair taken from your deposit.\n\nIf she insists that the only remedy is to replace the hob, she should make an appropriate deduction to reflect the fact that it is several years old and will be replaced by one that is new (thereby gaining her some value).\n\nIt would be reasonable for you to expect to see the written report from the gas inspector who has condemned the whole hob in that case.\n\nBut I find it hard to believe that:\n\n1. the plastic knob cannot be replaced\n2. doing so would make the hob unsafe, if the knob can be removed for cleaning\n\n> it's my understanding that if the hob is indeed broken, I only have to pay what it was worth at the moment before it was broken.\n\nYour liability is to **return her to the position she would have been in had the damage not occurred**.

Option B is the most effective action because:\n\n1. It directly addresses the landlord's claim of the hob being unsafe, which is the core of their argument for replacement.\n2.

Bob has repeatedly asked Rob to keep the bull out, but Rob has not been caring enough. Bob has also informed the local animal control authorities but they are taking time to react.\n\nThe fencing around Bob's property is such that if the bull is pushed out on the street (as opposed to back to Rob's property), he is much less likely to come back.\n\nCan Bob push the bull out on the street? Would Bob be liable if the bull causes any trouble there?\n\nI have found that \"any person may seize the stock\" if \"[Stock straying or wandering on roads](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0108/latest/whole.html#DLM294189)\". But can any person (apart from the stock owners of course) do the opposite \u2014 push them out?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **It depends on whether \"person\" means \"owner\"**\n\nIf Bob is liable, it's not under the *Impounding Act of 1955\\.* In that Act, the occupier of land is *allowed,* but *not required* to impound trespassing animals. This is made clear in s 21 of the [Act](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1955/0108/latest/whole.html#DLM294165), which says \"the occupier...**may** seize and impound any stock trespassing on the land.\" A quick search finds no sections of the Act *requiring* an occupier to impound trespassing cattle. So it seems *Bob is free to send the cattle on their way,* at least under the *Impounding Act.*\n\nHowever, liability for cattle and cars is also covered by the *\"Animals Law Reform Act of 1989\\.\"* The two subsections of *\"[Section 5](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1989/0097/latest/whole.html#DLM191765)\"* of that Act appear to broaden the class of people who could be held liable for damage \u201ccaused by an animal straying onto a highway.\u201d *Neither subsection explicitly mentions the owner.* Instead, both talk about the \"person\" who is liable. The first, s 5(1\\) says the part of the common law that \u201cexcludes or restricts\u201d \u201cthe duty that **a person** might **owe to others to take reasonable care**\u201d to prevent damage no longer applies in New Zealand. The second, s 5(2\\), says a court must determine \"whether **a person** is *liable...for damage* caused by an *animal straying onto a particular highway...*\"\n\nGiven that *Impounding Act* explicitly says \"owner\" not \"person,\" common sense suggests the use of the word \"person\" rather than \"owner\" in the *Animals Law Act of 1989* means that Act allows others besides the owner to be held liable for damages. Whether New Zealand courts agree, and whether they have interpreted the \u201cAnimal Laws Act\u201d in a way that would include Bob is a matter of fact that can only be answered by someone who knows New Zealand law.\n\n**Added: Something fun to read**\n\nLaw professor Robert Ellickson studied how people actually resolve disputes over wandering cattle in Shasta county in northern California. There's a readable summary of what he found [here](https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1465&context=fss_papers#page=35). (The title of his book, \"[Order without law](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674641693),\" sums up his main finding \\-\\- there are rules that are enforced, but those rules have little to do with the formal law or law enforcement.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: Bob is facing recurring issues with Rob's bull trespassing on his urban property, causing damage. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to resolve the situation with Rob and slow response from local authorities, Bob is considering pushing the bull onto the street. Which of the following best describes the potential legal implications for Bob in this scenario?\n\nA) Bob would be fully protected from liability under the Impounding Act of 1955, as it allows occupiers to remove trespassing animals.\nB) Bob could be held liable for any damage caused by the bull on the street, as the Animals Law Reform Act of 1989 extends liability beyond just the animal's owner.\nC) Bob would face no legal consequences, as the law only holds the animal's owner responsible for damages in all circumstances.\nD) Bob would be required by law to impound the bull on his property until animal control authorities arrive.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts from the provided documentation. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The Impounding Act of 1955 does allow Bob, as the occupier of the land, to remove trespassing animals. Section 21 of the Act states that an occupier \"may seize and impound any stock trespassing on the land.\" This eliminates option D, as Bob is not required to impound the bull.\n\n2. However, the Animals Law Reform Act of 1989 introduces broader liability considerations. Section 5 of this Act uses the term \"person\" rather than \"owner\" when discussing liability for animals straying onto highways. This suggests that liability can extend beyond just the animal's owner, which rules out option C.\n\n3. The use of \"person\" instead of \"owner\" in the 1989 Act, contrasting with the specific use of \"owner\" in the Impounding Act, implies that courts could potentially hold non-owners liable for damages caused by stray animals on highways.\n\n4. While the Impounding Act does provide some protection for Bob's actions on his own property (ruling out option A's claim of full protection), it doesn't necessarily shield him from liability under the broader scope of the Animals Law Reform Act if he deliberately pushes the bull onto the street.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple legal concepts, consideration of different acts, and analysis of the potential implications of legal language.

Such a judgment *might* only be vulnerable to appeal, but in no way to judicial discipline / misconduct investigation. If not successfully appealed, it becomes case law \u2014 binding on all inferior courts. Where rights of appeal do not exist (e.g. the court is the top court in its jurisdiction), the judgment becomes set\\-in\\-stone law \u2014 until cancelled either by the same court or via legislation.\n\nSo, let's consider the same example as in [that](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51084/can-it-be-judicial-misconduct-to-not-rebut-arguments-of-losing-party) question, but more specific one:\n\nBob contends:\n\n> I am right and Rob is wrong because blablabla... 2\u00d72\\=4 ...blablabla.\n\nRob defends:\n\n> No Bob is wrong, because blablabla... and 2\u00d72 actually equals 5\\.\n\nBob replies:\n\n> But look, lets see what 2\u00d72 equals to \\[math proof follows].

Option C suggests explicit consent, which is problematic in employment contexts due to the power imbalance between employer and employee. Consent in such situations may not be considered freely given under GDPR.\n\n4. Option D correctly identifies legitimate interests as a potential legal basis for processing, as mentioned in the documentation. It also incorporates key GDPR principles:\n   - Data minimization (implying only necessary data is collected)\n   - Providing data subject rights (access and erasure)\n   - Acknowledging the need to handle data appropriately after employment ends\n\nThis approach balances the employer's need for performance data with employee privacy rights, aligning with GDPR requirements while still allowing the company to achieve its objectives.

For [security reasons](https://tor.stackexchange.com/a/23778/31208), I used Tor Browser. I loaded money onto my account and purchased their services. I used their services several times without issue.\n\nRecently I tried to log\\-into my account, but I got stuck in an [infinite loop on CloudFlare](https://superuser.com/questions/1795620/cloudflare-infinte-loop-checking-if-the-site-connection-is-secure/1796006#1796006), so I could never access their website. It should go without saying that I'm not doing anything malicious, but I'll say it: this is reproducible when launching a fresh version of TAILS, opening the browser, typing the naked domain into the address bar and pressing `<enter>`. I'm never allowed into the store.\n\nSo it appears to me that this website is denying me access to their business services, my account, and the funds on my account for one reason: because they don't like the way I look.\n\nIs this legal for them to do to their customers? I'm also curious if the same thing would be legal in the IRL analog, for example:\n\n1. Would it be legal for a brick\\-and\\-mortar store to deny me from entering their shop purely on the basis of the way that I look?\n2.

That makes Tor browsers hilariously easy to detect: nobody knows where the real browser is, but it is hilariously easy to block all Tor users for using Tor, or at least those that the server knows are Tor IPs. **Using Tor is an action,** not how you look.\n\nThe closest Brick and mortar equivalent would be \"Show me your ID please\" and you show them a paper cutout of something that has Sample stamped over it.\n\n\"No shirt, no shoes, no service\" in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes, most places can deny service based on how you dress or your state of hygine. These two would in most cases not extend to the protections under the [Civil Rights Act](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/oasam/civil-rights-center/statutes/civil-rights-act-of-1964), which protects some characteristics like race and sex, but not visual factors like \"being dressed\" or \"smelling of cow\". There can be a fine line where religious dress code is concerned, but in general and broad strokes, the restaurant can deny you for wearing the wrong clothes.\n\nActually, the slogan is much broader than it appears: as long as an establishment's dress code is not violating discrimination law (like the CRA), they can enforce it under their freedom to contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A web-based business has implemented a security measure that inadvertently blocks a customer using Tor Browser from accessing their account and funds.

I assume that if tracking data is connected to an individual, the individual gave their consent to that by signing up to a Google. The only thing the snippet does is telling Google's servers when a conversion takes place and that somehow they do some cross\\-site tracking.\n\nIs running the Google Ads snippet something that visitors of my website should consent to, before I do this?\n\nMy assumption for now is that disclosing this in a privacy statement should suffice.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are responsible for what data is being processed by your website. When you embed third party components on your website (e.g. iframes, scripts), you are at least jointly responsible with the third party providing these components. You are only responsible for what happens on the website (i.e. what processing is under your control), not for what the third party provider does with collected data on their services. However, note that information will be transferred to Google's servers regardless of whether the visitor has a Google account! The *Fashion ID* case is relevant case law establishing and explaining these points.\n\nSince you are (jointly) responsible, you need a legal basis for collecting personal data through the tracking snippet and sharing it with the third party (here Google). For example, the legal basis could be a *legitimate interest*, or could be *consent*. A legitimate interest requires that you balance this interests against the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject (the site visitor). If the data subject wouldn't reasonably expect this tracking, you cannot rely on a legitimate interest. Consent can always work, except that it is a freely given, informed opt\\-in \u2013 likely unsuitable for conversion tracking. Which legal basis to use is primarily your responsibility.\n\nYou argue that the tracking snippet does not collect personal data. However, this argument is not well supported. Under the GDPR, personal data does not only include directly identifying information such as an email address, but also any information \u201crelating\u201d to an identifiable person. Identification includes the ability to single out someone, e.g. by a browser fingerprint. For purposes of conversion tracking, Google will clearly try to collect data that allows the visitor to be singled out, thus collecting personal data. Furthermore, specific kinds of information are regulated by the ePrivacy directive. This includes \u201ctraffic data\u201d and \u201cinformation stored on a terminal device\u201d, regardless of whether this information is personal data under the GDPR. Under ePrivacy, such information can only be used as strictly necessary to provide the service requested by the user (and conversion tracking is not strictly necessary), or when the user gives their consent. Depending on what information is collected by the tracking snippet and on whether you are subject to ePrivacy, you would have to collect consent anyway.\n\nThere is also the issue that Google Ads is an US\\-based service, and transferring data to the US is largely illegal since the 2020 Schrems II ruling. The US do not provide an adequate level of data protection, so that transfers would require additional safeguards. Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for Controller to Controller transfers are not sufficient by itself. Of course those extra safeguards are effectively impossible to implement and no one is doing this correctly, but it's worth considering that there is additional legal risk. Explicit consent can provide a legal basis for transfers even to a country with inadequate protections, but that mechanism is intended for occasional transfers.\n\nIn conclusion:\n\n* you have wrongly concluded that no personal data would be involved\n* you are jointly responsible with Google for whatever data is processed by the conversion tracking snippet\n* you need a legal basis for sharing this data with Google\n* legitimate interest may be sufficient, depending on what data is involved (consider ePrivacy) and depending on the result of your legitimate interest balancing test\n* alternatively, you may require every visitors consent to track their conversions \u2013 unlikely to result in good data\n* additionally, such use of Google Ads may run into issues around international transfers due to the Schrems II ruling\n* this kind of stuff is difficult, and no one is really doing this correctly :/", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A website owner uses Google Ads for conversion tracking but claims their site doesn't use cookies or collect personal data.

Joint responsibility: The website owner is jointly responsible with Google for data processed by the conversion tracking snippet, even if they don't directly collect the data themselves.\n\n2. Personal data collection: Despite the owner's claim, the snippet likely collects personal data as defined by GDPR, which includes any information that can be used to single out an individual, such as browser fingerprints or other identifiers used for conversion tracking.\n\n3. ePrivacy considerations: The snippet may collect \"traffic data\" or \"information stored on a terminal device,\" which is regulated by the ePrivacy directive and requires user consent unless strictly necessary for providing the requested service.\n\n4. Inadequate legal basis: Legitimate interest is unlikely to be sufficient here, as users wouldn't reasonably expect this tracking, and it's not strictly necessary for the core function of the website.\n\n5. International data transfer: Using Google Ads involves transferring data to the US, which presents additional legal challenges following the Schrems II ruling.\n\nGiven these factors, the most appropriate action is to obtain explicit user consent before implementing the Google Ads snippet.

There is a copyright in someone, although the absence of a copyright notice limits the remedies available for infringement.\n\nSecond, a link is not a copyright violation.\n\nThird, copyright protects an exact manifestation of an idea or description of a fact, not the idea or fact itself.\n\nFourth, there are two different doctrines that could protect an exact copy of a press release.\n\nOne of two doctrines, which applies if the press release has been released to the public, is an implied license. Press releases are meant for the general public and reprinting them when that is their intended purpose is an implied grant of permission. In the same way, if you have an unfenced front yard to a concrete path leading to your front door, anyone who wishes to meet with you has an implied license to walk up to your door and knock. Whether this implied license can be revoked or not is a harder question.\n\nThe other of the two doctrines, which is not limited to press releases that have been released, is \"fair use\". In this situation, when the work was short, has been released to others, has limited literary value, transmits unprotected facts relevant to you, relates facts that may also be a matter of public record (the sale anyway), and you aren't trying to profit from the text of the press releases themselves just from the facts that they convey, the case for fair use is pretty decent even though this is a business use.\n\nUltimately, however, to be squeaky clean and avoid litigation, you can link rather than regurgitate the press releases, and can write your own statements about the facts in them from scratch.\n\nThis information is not privileged or trademarked. \n\nIf you didn't sign a non\\-disclosure agreement (NDA) or if they were released to the public, they aren't subject to trade secret protection either.

Keep in mind its a college leasing company so they do require a guarantor.

The top answer clearly states, \"You were required to get a guarantor and you didn't - that might allow the landlord to terminate the lease but it certainly doesn't allow you to.\" This means the student's failure to provide a guarantor doesn't automatically void the lease or give them the right to terminate it.\n\nThe advance payment of $4,000, the lack of a security deposit, and the absence of renter's insurance don't change the fundamental binding nature of the lease.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The original developer only made the source code available for inspection purposes, with no explicit rights granted. The \"All rights reserved\" statement, while not providing complete protection, does indicate that no usage rights were given.\n\n2. The user who downloaded, modified, and commercially distributed the software likely committed copyright infringement, as they had no explicit permission to do so.

After leaving Company A, the developer posts a vague description of technologies used in their work on LinkedIn. Company B sends a cease and desist letter. Which of the following actions would be the most appropriate and legally sound response for the developer?\n\nA) Ignore the cease and desist letter, as Indian law doesn't recognize US-based NDAs\nB) Comply with all demands immediately, including signing additional non-solicitation agreements\nC) Remove the LinkedIn post, but seek legal counsel before agreeing to any further demands\nD) Counter-sue Company B for harassment in an Indian court\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This situation involves complex international legal issues. The developer should take the cease and desist letter seriously, as they did sign an NDA, even if its enforceability across borders is questionable. Ignoring it entirely (option A) could lead to legal complications, especially if the developer ever wants to work with US companies in the future. \n\nComplying with all demands immediately (option B) is not advisable, especially regarding additional agreements not mentioned in the original NDA. This could further restrict the developer's rights without proper legal consideration.\n\nCounter-suing (option D) is likely premature and could escalate the situation unnecessarily, potentially harming future employment prospects.\n\nThe most appropriate action is to remove the LinkedIn post to show good faith compliance with the core issue, but then seek legal counsel before agreeing to any further demands (option C).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Minimum wage laws are not necessarily violated if the professor is not required to perform work during the unpaid leave. The documentation states, \"minimum wage laws are not engaged even if the professor is not exempt as teachers since he is not being required to do any work.\"\n\n2.

The\n>  content of the drawings may also be considered ...\u201d\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Literal support means that the words of the claim are identical to words in the description. It does not have any particular nuanced meaning.\n\nThe purpose of that presentation is to demonstrate that the requirements for written description in the US go far beyond literal support. That is, even if the claims are replicated in the description, that is not enough to satisfy the written description requirement (or indeed, the enablement or best mode requirements).\n\nIn fact, the presentation you link to includes a nice quote from *In re Kaslow*, 707 F.2d 1366, 217 US PQ 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1983\\):\n\n> The test ... is whether the disclosure of the application as originally filed \n>  reasonably conveys to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter, rather than the presence or absence of literal support in the specification for the claim language.\n\nLiteral support therefore does not have much place in US law.\n\nHowever, historically, countries inheriting their patent system from the UK had a requirement for fair basis, where the claims had to be fairly based on the description. For example, the now superseded [Patents Act 1949 (UK) s 4(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/12-13-14/87/section/4) provided:\n\n> The claim or claims of a complete specification must relate to a single invention, must be clear and succinct, and **must be fairly based on the matter disclosed in the specification**.\n\nThis was a low bar, and literal support (where the wording of the claims are identical to words in the description) would be sufficient (though not required). This gave rise to the practice of having consistory clauses, where the claims were literally copied into the summary of invention section. However, most (or possibly even all) countries have moved on to a support requirement now. Yet the practice of consistory clauses lives on.\n\nLiteral support also appears in some guise in European law. [Art 123(2\\) EPC](http://www.epo.org/law-practice/legal-texts/html/epc/2016/e/ar123.html) provides:\n\n> The European patent application or European patent may not be amended in such a way that it contains subject\\-matter which extends beyond the content of the application as filed.\n\nThis is often imprecisely glossed as a requirement that the wording of an amendment must appear verbatim in the description as originally filed. That is, an amendment is generally allowable if it has literal support in the application (and does not otherwise impermissibly combine embodiments and the like). In practice though, literal support is only one factor for compliance with Art 123(2\\) EPC, and is neither necessary nor sufficient on its own.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about patent disclosure and literal support, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A startup has developed a novel drug delivery system and wants to file a patent application.

The correct answer is A because the documentation emphasizes that literal support is not equivalent to meeting the written description requirement in U.S. patent law. \n\nThe quote from In re Kaslow states that the test is whether the disclosure \"reasonably conveys to the artisan that the inventor had possession at that time of the later claimed subject matter, rather than the presence or absence of literal support in the specification for the claim language.\" This means that even if the startup includes word-for-word descriptions (literal support) from their lab notes, it may not be sufficient to meet the written description requirement if it doesn't adequately convey possession of the invention.\n\nOption B is incorrect because literal support is explicitly stated not to be sufficient on its own in U.S. patent law.

The agency's offer to allow the tenant to find a replacement is a form of mitigation.

IANAL, but my opinion is that it doesn't. Denying service to an unvaccinated individual is not the same as *compelling* them to get vaccinated. As a precedent, I refer to the [Masterpiece Cakeshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission) decision, which allowed a cake shop to refuse to sell a wedding cake to for a same\\-sex wedding; they weren't forcing the couple to stop being gay. And it's not a civil rights violation, as being unvaccinated is not a protected class.\n\nIs my interpretation reasonable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that is not a \"reasonable\" interpretation of the order, but that's separate from the question of what will be enforced. Focusing on the word of the order,\n\n> No entity in Texas can compel receipt of a COVID\\-19 vaccine by any\n> individual, including an employee or a consumer\n\nWhat does it mean to \"compel\" a person to do something? A court can compel a person to stay in jail for some period of time, and can order the police to use force to enforce that requirement \u2013 that's the classical example of compulsion. Nobody *except* the police can compel a consumer to do anything. All of the words of the order have to be given meaning, and it is not reasonable to say that \"compel\" is limited to \"actions backed up by police action\". The government does not separately compel \"consumers\" and \"employees\" to do things.\n\nIn order to sensibly interpret \"compel\" and \"consumer\", this has to interpreted as including things other than \"pointing a gun at a person\". The only sensible interpretation is one that includes denying service to those who do not comply. In addition, the series of \"Whereas's\" clearly indicate a ban on \"no shots, no service\" conditions. It remains to be seen in court whether this is found to be enforceable (via the \"failure to comply\" clause, exactly analogous to other emergency powers allowing restrictions on gatherings etc. previously).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: The American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) is planning to host its national tournament in Austin, Texas, requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for all participants.

The fabricator fails to pay me in the stipulated 30 days. Can I sue the fabricator in Maine, or do I have to file suit in California?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\nIn the absence of additional jurisdiction establishing facts like a choice of forum clause in the contract or in person negotiations in Maine, the Maine seller would probably have to sue the California buyer in California.\n\nIf Maine does have jurisdiction to hear the case, for example, due to a choice of forum clause in the contract, the merits of the amount owed could be litigated to judgment in Maine. But, even then, if the buyer only had assets in California, the Maine judgment would have to be recognized in a California court (which is fairly quick, easy, and non\\-discretionary for the California court to do) and then the post\\-judgment collection activities would have to be conducted in courts located in California.\n\nIf the California purchaser went bankrupt, the bankruptcy case would also be in California in all likelihood.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nYou can always sue where the defendant is located, which is also the place of performance of the contract. This has a 100% chance of succeeding as to jurisdiction and venue (and could be done in federal court if one feared being hometowned by local counsel my familiar with California law than your lead Maine counsel).\n\nIn a consumer contract, you must sue where the defendant is located pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and a contrary contractual term is void as contrary to the controlling federal law.\n\nIn a business to business contact, however, the parties may include a choice of forum and choice of law clause in the contract that would be controlling, and the Uniform Commercial Code \"battle of forms\" provisions permit the seller's form to be binding in some circumstances even if that term is not in a document signed by the other side. This would be upheld if the forum had any meaningful connection to either of the parties. (Also, for what it is worth, once there is part performance of the contract due to the delivery of goods, the Uniform Commercial Code's statute of frauds no longer bars enforcement of the contract.)\n\nIn the absence of a choice of forum term in the contract, the analysis in the case of a Maine forum would be to determine whether California company had sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Maine in this transaction to have \"purposefully availed itself\" of the laws of Maine by doing business in Maine. This is a fact rich inquiry in which almost any fact that you can imagine about the transaction could be relevant.\n\nIn this fact pattern, the personal jurisdiction issue is less open and shut, especially if no one affiliated with the buyer has ever been present in the seller's state. The odds of a Maine court determining that it doesn't have jurisdiction are not zero but I'd hesitate to put an exact percentage on it.\n\nThe most factually similar case that I could locate held that Maine courts did not have jurisdiction over a similarly situated purchaser, where a headnote to the case explains that:\n\n> Where only contact between purchaser of spiral staircase and\n> manufacturer\\-seller arose from purchase, there was no indication that\n> purchaser ever set foot in or conducted any business in state, and\n> only affiliating circumstances were that purchaser ordered staircase\n> from manufacturer\\-seller, and he communicated with seller by telephone\n> and mail with respect to that order, district court lacked personal\n> jurisdiction over purchaser in manufacturer\\-seller's action seeking\n> damages from purchaser for breach of contract and conversion after\n> purchaser stopped payment on check for staircase but retained\n> staircase.\n\n*Architectural Woodcraft Co. v. Read*, [464 A.2d 210](https://casetext.com/case/architectural-woodcraft-co-v-read) (Me. 1983\\).\n\nSo, to successfully sue in Maine, one would have to distinguish this binding precedent of Maine's highest court with additional facts showing that the purchaser had a greater connection to the State of Maine than this one did.\n\nAnother worthwhile point to consider is that any determination that Maine did not have jurisdiction would be made very early in the case, with the matter full briefed and ready to rule upon or to call for a hearing upon within perhaps two months of service of process on the defendant. The issue probably gets resolved with a hearing if necessary within six months or so. Litigating jurisdiction is much cheaper than litigating the entire case, and if you lose in Maine you just refile in California (probably with acceptance of service of process by the lawyers who appeared on behalf of the California firm in Maine). As long as you aren't close to the statute of limitations, that isn't a huge deal, even though it is a bump in the road.\n\nAs a practical matter, one reasons that a Maine company might want to sue in California is that it removes one step from the collection process. If the Maine company gets a judgment against the California company in a Maine court (possibly removed to federal court), the judgment entered would then have to be registered in California before it could be enforced if the debtor only has assets in California. California has to recognize the judgment if it was entered with valid personal and subject matter jurisdiction in Maine (under the U.S. Constitution's full faith and credit clause), but it still involves an extra step that requires time and money, and if the debtor only has assets in California, subsequent collection of the transferred California judgment, by garnishment of bank accounts, garnishment of amounts owed to the debtor, placing judgment liens on real property, and using a writ of execution to attach tangible personal property of the judgment debtor and having the seized property sold to pay the debt, as well as service of interrogatories on the debtor regarding where its assets are located, would all have to be done in the California court system or in the federal courts of California.\n\nIf the judgment in Maine was entered by default, the judgment debtor could collaterally attack jurisdiction in the California enforcement proceeding. If the judgment in Maine was entered after the defendant in California contested jurisdiction (which consists of personal jurisdiction authority, service of process, and subject matter jurisdiction of the court in question) in Maine (which is the only way it could contest the merits if the Maine court found that it had jurisdiction over the California firm), however, it could not collaterally attack the Maine Court's jurisdiction in California during the enforcement proceedings.\n\nIn real life, a lawyer and client have to assess the risks and benefits and costs of each approach and decide how to handle it, based in part upon how they think that the defendant will behave in litigation. If the merits are likely to be contested and the defendant is easily collectible, fighting in Maine is more desirable to push for even if it isn't a sure thing. If the merits are a foregone conclusion but collection may be more involved, starting in California may make sense.\n\nAlso, if the merits are undisputed, often the case will end up in a debtor forum bankruptcy case before the judgment obtained in either location can be used to collect that judgment in the California courts. This is because companies that don't pay undisputed debts are usually unable to pay many creditors and not just one in particular.\n\nFurthermore while in theory, this case would present distinct issues of state law and federal law, Maine, like most states, takes the position that its state courts have jurisdiction over essentially all cases over which the U.S. Constitution allows it to assert jurisdiction, so the ultimate analysis pretty much boils down to one under federal constitutional law.\n\nSo, while you look to state court precedents first, those precedents are driven by U.S. Supreme Court precedents that greatly narrow the range of discretion which state courts may exercise in deciding these cases. As a result, the outcome is likely to be reasonably similar in pretty much any combination of two U.S. states, even though it wouldn't be precisely uniform and the determinations are highly amenable to being distinguished factually from each other.\n\nThe substantive law of the case, as opposed to the jurisdictional law, would be governed almost entirely by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code which while it is enacted separately as state law in each state is almost identical in every U.S. state. There might be a difference in the statute of limitations, and there might be civil procedure differences, however (although the civil procedure differences would be muted by the power of either party to remove the case to federal court if the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner in Maine sells $500 worth of steel plates to a fabricator in California.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Stack Exchange's Terms of Service explicitly state that users release Stack Exchange \"from all liability for Subscriber having acquired or not acquired Content through the Network.\"\n\n2. When users contribute content to Stack Exchange, they license it under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license, which includes a disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability.\n\n3. The Terms of Service also state that Stack Exchange has no control over how users interpret or use the content, or what actions they take as a result of being exposed to the content.\n\n4. While the user could still attempt to sue the blogger, the existence of these terms would likely lead to the case being dismissed early in the legal process.\n\n5. Option A is incorrect because the blogger's popularity doesn't override the legal protections provided by Stack Exchange's Terms of Service.\n\n6. Option B is incorrect because Stack Exchange explicitly disclaims responsibility for user-generated content.\n\n7. Option D is incorrect because the Terms of Service protect both Stack Exchange and content contributors from liability.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, integrate multiple aspects of the Terms of Service, and understand the practical implications of these terms in a potential lawsuit scenario."}, "65": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53681/can-an-employee-complete-the-i9-form-remotely", "docs_id": 53681, "title": "Can an employee complete the I9 form remotely?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [This](https://www.uscis.gov/completing-form-i-9-for-remote-hire) USCIS instruction says that:\n\n> Employers may designate an authorized representative to fill out Forms I\\-9 on behalf of their company, including personnel officers, foremen, agents or notary public.\n\nOn the other hand, the Employment Eligibility Verification consists of [three sections](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/complete-and-correct-form-i-9).

The correct answer is B for the following reasons:\n\n1. The USCIS instruction allows employers to \"designate an authorized representative to fill out Forms I-9 on behalf of their company, including personnel officers, foremen, agents or notary public.\" This enables the company to have representatives in different countries.\n\n2.

These are small programs that are run on your machine. By accessing the website you implicitly give permission for this to occur.\n\n(Aside: I'm not aware of any case law on exactly what this implicit authorisation covers. [CFAA case law](https://www.eff.org/issues/cfaa) on \"authorised access\" suggests that this is going to be complicated if it ever becomes an issue).\n\nJavascript is supposed to be run within a limited framework which allows the website to control the rendering of the website and track how you use it. So they can track your mouse clicks when the browser window has \"focus\", but not clicks you make when accessing something else.\n\nLike all software, the Javascript programs and the web browser \"interpreter\" that runs them can contain bugs. Javascript has to work on lots of browsers, so its not surprising when things don't always work properly.\n\nComing on to [the CFAA](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030), criminal penalties only apply to intentional access.\n\n> 5 (c) intentionally accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, causes damage and loss.\n\nSo if a website runs Javascript on your computer with the *intention* of crashing it, that is a crime. However if the crash is inadvertent due to ordinary programming errors then it isn't. In this case it is almost certainly innocent.

The question of liability only arises when there is some harm done and the court either determines that you are responsible (liable), or not. Until there is harm, there is only a risk. In general, you would be held liable if a child came on to your property, got in the pool, and drown, even if you had signs saying \"Don't get in the pond\". The general rule comes from [R.R. Co. v. Stout](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/84/657/), 84 U.S. 657, that in dealing with hazards that would be attractive to a child of \"tender\" years, you have a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the dangers of the attraction.\n\nWhat constitutes \"reasonable care\" is hard to define, except in the most tautological sense \"the care that a reasonable person would have\". Case law in your state may specifically address the question. As a general rule, you should get legal advice from lawyers, not from city engineers. The doctrine may be spelled out as more specific rule such as in Washington ([Schneider v. Seattle](https://casetext.com/case/schneider-v-seattle), 24 Wn. App. 251, the requirements are\n\n> that a condition or instrumentality existed which was dangerous in\n> itself and likely to or probably would cause injury to those coming\n> into contact with it;\n> \n> \n> that it was attractive or enticing to young children;\n> \n> \n> that plaintiff was incapable, by reason of his age, of comprehending\n> the danger involved;\n> \n> \n> that it was left unguarded and exposed at a place where children of\n> tender years were accustomed to resort, for play or amusement or\n> gratification of youthful curiosity; and\n> \n> \n> that it was reasonably practicable and feasible either to prevent\n> access by children or else to render it innocuous without obstructing\n> any reasonable purpose or use for which it was intended.\n\nThe record does not indicate the details of the injury, except that the area was in fact fenced with a cyclone fence. There may have been a gap in the fence, or the child (who was 10\\) may simply have climbed the fence (the latter seems likely since the ruling also invokes questions of contributory negligence \u2013 \"even if the child is held to be within the attractive nuisance doctrine, the question of his contributory negligence, in the light of all relevant circumstances, will have to be decided\"). FYI the final outcome was that the plaintiff lost the case.\n\nA gate is less of a precaution against trespass than an impenetrable fence, especially if the fence is solid wood and makes it impossible for the child to see the attractive nuisance. A locked gate a more of a precaution than an unlocked gate. Your reference to illegal means of entry is a bit misguided, because the doctrine say that adult trespassing standard don't apply to children, therefore you cannot assume that the child will always act in compliance with the law. A latch at the top of a 6 ft. tall gate cannot be defeated by a \"tender\" child wandering in a curious manner (unlike a latch at 3 ft.).\n\nAs I say, you have to research the specific liability states and case law of your state.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner installs a decorative koi pond in their backyard, surrounded by a 6-foot tall fence with a locked gate.

In a subsequent lawsuit, which factor is most likely to influence the court's decision regarding the homeowner's liability under the attractive nuisance doctrine?\n\nA) The presence of exotic fish in the pond, increasing its appeal to children\nB) The height of the fence, which exceeds local building code requirements\nC) The homeowner's failure to install additional warning signs around the property\nD) The reasonable practicality of preventing access while maintaining the pond's intended use\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of the attractive nuisance doctrine in a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer, D, aligns with the fifth element of the attractive nuisance doctrine as outlined in the Schneider v. Seattle case: \"that it was reasonably practicable and feasible either to prevent access by children or else to render it innocuous without obstructing any reasonable purpose or use for which it was intended.\"\n\nOption A, while potentially relevant to the pond's attractiveness to children, is not as crucial as the practicality of prevention.

For example, in inheritance law it is often agreed that two people will be considered to have died at the same time, so that neither inherits from the other, if they die within 30 days of each other. (Before this was a common agreement inheritance sometimes depended on establishing which of two people died first, perhaps only by a matter on minutes, which was not always easy to do.

The correct answer, C, aligns with the documentation's mention of using escrow as a valid method to achieve simultaneity. This approach addresses the challenges of different time zones and the need for all parties to commit without giving any party an advantage.\n\nOption A, while technologically advanced, isn't mentioned in the documentation and may introduce unnecessary complexity. Option B (rolling close) doesn't achieve true simultaneity and could give later signers an advantage. Option D (global video conference) is similar to one method mentioned in the documentation but doesn't account for time zone differences and may be impractical for a complex merger.\n\nThe escrow solution (C) allows for flexibility in signing times while ensuring that the deal only becomes effective when all parties have committed, effectively creating a simultaneous execution.

People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture, such as \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d and \u201cWhite.\u201d People who identify their origin as Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish may be of any race.\n\nWhich makes it sound as though *everybody* in the US can put in, say, *Alaska Native*, on the grounds that *self\\-identifying* is a *choice*, without lying or committing a crime. \n\n(Imagine the top TV show in the US was a revival of *Nanook of the North*, with a terrific charismatic cast, and which promoted *\"the eskimo way\"*, (akin to the *\"the cowboy\"* way in singing cowboy westerns), which advocated that if you followed *\"the eskimo way\"*, then you too were an eskimo. And alienated Americans resonate with this, as they have with so many fashions, fads and creeds, that that's what they wished themselves to really be.)\n\nIs it possible to (unlawfully) lie about one's race given the current US census race categories? In other words, has the 2018 govt. any power to prosecute for lying about race on a census? \n\nIf there are no lies, what purpose is served by having such a definition?  \n\nWhat's the value (who benefits) in making what used to be a fuzzy but more or less factual item about national and ethnic origins into a belief\\-based one, in effect making race into a religion.\n\n---\n\nThis is a spin\\-off of [What are the political benefits and inversely disadvantages, if any, of individually self\\-identifying as \u201cwhite\u201d in the United States?](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/31431/what-are-the-political-benefits-and-inversely-disadvantages-if-any-of-individu/31432?noredirect=1#comment116022_31432).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nYou can be prosecuted for lying about race on the census, but it takes some pretty specific and narrow conditions and isn't a concern for the vast majority of people.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\nThere are two analytically distinct questions.\n\nThe first is whether you can lie on the census about race. The answer is \"yes\", you can lie on the census about race. You would do so by providing an answer that is insincere, which is to say, an answer that is not consistent with how you self\\-identify. If you believe yourself to be and identify as African\\-American, for example, but answer \"Alaska Native\" not because you identify as an Alaska Native, but because you want to screw with the census, then you have lied about race on the census.\n\nSimilar issues of sincerity have been addressed [by the U.S. Supreme Court](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/380/163/case.html) in the context of the much higher stakes issue of conscientious objector status for someone seeking to avoid the draft. A [2014 law review article](https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/questioning-sincerity-the-role-of-the-courts-after-hobby-lobby/) explores how courts test sincerity claims in practice.\n\nThe second is whether you can be prosecuted about lying on the census.\n\nThere is indeed a law that makes lying on a census form a crime.\n\nRefusing to answer either the short Census form or the longer American Community Survey form is a violation of federal law (Title 13, United States Code, Section 221\\). Refusing to answer is punishable by a fine of $100, while giving false answers carries a fine of up to $500\\. (As a practical matter, the Census says fines of up to $5,000 can be imposed under Title 18, Section 3571\\.)\n\nSo, again, the answer is \"yes\" you can be prosecuted for lying on the census, but due to the obligation of the census to maintain confidentiality, knowing that a crime was committed or proving that you lied would be hard unless you did something to waive that right to confidentiality.\n\nStill, the person about whom the confidential information is maintained by the census can waive this confidentiality. 13 USC 9(a)(3\\).\n\nIn practice, a prosecution for lying about race on the census would probably be most viable if, for example, you did a TV interview or posted a YouTube video in which you took video of yourself filling in the race item on your census form with an answer while stating that you didn't self\\-identify as this race but were just screwing with the government, and then showed yourself submitting that form.\n\nThus, while the prohibition against lying on the census about race is virtually toothless, it does have enough teeth to make it possible to prosecuted someone who openly and publicly defies the requirement to be truthful on the census and admits to doing so, which can still have some utility in discouraging some kinds of open revolts calculated at undermining the integrity of the census.\n\nAlso, even if you don't \"admit\" that you are insincere that isn't the end of the analysis. They can't dispute your self\\-identification with biological facts, but they can dispute that your answer is a sincere self\\-identification with either your own confession to the contrary or with circumstantial evidence that indicates you are lying (e.g. you fill out every other form before and after with a different answer and have a known animosity towards the census). If a jury believed beyond a reasonable doubt based upon circumstantial evidence that your answer was not sincere, it could find your testimony to be not credible and convict you anyway.\n\n> If there are no lies, what purpose is served by having such a\n> definition?\n\nThe vast majority of people, facing no negative consequences for telling the truth, if they have cooperated enough to fill out the form at all, will try to fill it out consistently with the instructions. And, a significant share of all census responses are provided by government employees whose duty and purpose is to try to provide a correct answer.\n\nAlso, most people comply with the laws even in the face of zero enforcement. For example, [it has been more than 40 years since the last person was prosecuted for not filling out a census form](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jan/09/us-census-bureau/americans-must-answer-us-census-bureau-survey-law-/), even though it is crime not to do so, in part, because most people try to obey the law. And, compliance with the burden of filling out a census form is quite high.\n\n> What's the value (who benefits) in making what used to be a fuzzy but\n> more or less factual item about national and ethnic origins into a\n> belief\\-based one, in effect making race into a religion.\n\nMany countries (not the U.S.) have a religion question in their census as well, and this isn't problematic where it is done, or in surveys asking questions about religion, although being clear on definitions can be important (e.g. in the case of a religious v. ancestral or ethnic v. self\\-identified definition of who is a Jew).\n\nI strongly suspect that the differences in how people respond to the question arising from a national or ethnic origin definition, and a definition based upon self\\-identification, are negligible at the statistical level. A century or so from now, when census records are made public, it will be possible to confirm this definitively by examining how the same individual's race was reported on half a dozen or more successive census forms. In non\\-census contexts, this shift in the definition has not produced any statistically meaningful differences in how people respond.\n\nAlso, if anything, the new definition based on self\\-identification may be more useful to researchers who are trying to examine socially coherent communities, and it makes the race data slightly more comparable to data, for example, on religion and on sexual orientation (from non\\-census sources).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about race classification in the US Census, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A social media influencer with millions of followers starts a viral trend encouraging people to identify as \"Martian\" on the upcoming US Census, claiming it's a form of protest against racial categorization. Many of their followers publicly pledge to do so.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. While the Census Bureau allows for self-identification of race, lying on the Census is still a federal crime. The key factor is sincerity of the response.\n\n2. The documentation states that prosecution for lying about race on the Census is possible, but difficult due to confidentiality requirements. However, it specifically mentions that prosecution becomes more viable if someone publicly admits to being insincere, such as through social media or interviews.\n\n3. Option A is incorrect because while free speech protects the influencer's ability to encourage this action, it doesn't protect against consequences of actually lying on an official government form.\n\n4. Option C is incorrect because the Census Bureau is not obligated to add new categories based solely on write-in responses.\n\n5. Option D is tricky but ultimately incorrect.

Or, if a person has been ordered to leave, the person could comply and then seek an injunction forbidding future enforcement of the regulation. Such methods have been used in the past to challenge the lawfulness of administrative regulations.\n\nThe [Colorado code CRS 24\\-90\\-109\\.

Two of the three include an explicit appeals process for serious violations.\n\nYou do not indicate what sort of behavior you have encaged in for which the library may wish to ban you.\n\nIn general, government facilities are allowed to make reasonable regulations for members of the public using those facilities, and it is not a violation of people's Constitutional rights to make and enforce such regulations. However, that depends highly on what the regulations are. A regulation limiting access by race would obviously be struck down.

If the prosecutor does not file such a case, Alice's worst possible outcome is to get no damages, with costs and fees awarded to Bob (or his estate).\n\nIf Bob dies and Alice wishes to drop the case, there is no obvious reason not to permit it, unless Bob or his estate has counter\\-sued.

The case would be *Alice C vs Bob D*.\n\nHowever, if Alice accuses Bob of having stolen from her, or punched her, or raped her, that woulds be a criminal accusation. The police would investigate, and if they found evidence to support the accusation, the local prosecutor could (but need not) file a case, which would be something like *State of Franklin vs Bob D* IN THE CRIMINAL COURT.

As to whether or not US citizens actually have these rights, Constitutional scholars can and will argue back and forth on that without making a real decision, partly due to the non\\-specific nature of the rights described in your quote.\n\nIt's important to note that the quote you provided is actually from the [US Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence), which declared that the 13 colonies were no longer going to be British colonies, but rather their own separate nation (keep in mind that from a British perspective, this was treason).\n\nThe actual rights that US citizens possess are granted primarily by the [US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution) and its amendments (especially the first ten, also known as the Bill of Rights). This forms the basic foundation for our governmental system, on which all other parts of it are built.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation clearly states that the quote about unalienable rights comes from the Declaration of Independence, not the Constitution.\n2.

First of all, we never received notice from either company that their would be any, let alone a substantial, change in service provisions. Second, Insight Pest Solutions never cashed our last check payment from August 2018, and our bank credited us because it was a Wells Fargo Bill Pay check that is debited when initially sent.

Also note that warnings carry a \"prominence\" requirement, which does not exist for ordinary ingredients which are typically in illegible microprint.

He hires a good lawyer to defend him in criminal court, and so while charges are pressed by a number of his guests his case doesn't make it to trial. However, he's sued in civil court and found to owe medical fees and compensation equalling $50,000 per guest, for 40 guests, for total damages of $2 million. Bob earns roughly $45,000 per year, and so paying back these damages would take him 45 years, therefore he decides to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nIs he still required to pay back his $2 million in debts? What about the guests, do they simply not receive their compensation? What if they depend on this compensation to pay medical expenses?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a comprehensive overview of Chapter 7 bankruptcy at [http://www.uscourts.gov/services\\-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy\\-basics/chapter\\-7\\-bankruptcy\\-basics](http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics).\n\nGenerally, Chapter 7 bankruptcy does *discharge* debts, so that they are no longer legally owed. (The word \"forgiven\" isn't usually used in this context, since it tends to refer to voluntary action by the creditor.) This happens *after* the debtor's assets (with certain exceptions) are liquidated by the bankruptcy trustee to pay the debts as much as possible, so in any case, the creditors would collect as much as those assets were worth.\n\nThere are several exceptions to discharging debts:\n\n> An individual receives a discharge for most of his or her debts in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. A creditor may no longer initiate or continue any legal or other action against the debtor to collect a discharged debt. But not all of an individual's debts are discharged in chapter 7\\. Debts not discharged include debts for alimony and child support, certain taxes, debts for certain educational benefit overpayments or loans made or guaranteed by a governmental unit, debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity, debts for death or personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle while the debtor was intoxicated from alcohol or other substances, and debts for certain criminal restitution orders. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a). The debtor will continue to be liable for these types of debts to the extent that they are not paid in the chapter 7 case. Debts for money or property obtained by false pretenses, debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, and debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity will be discharged unless a creditor timely files and prevails in an action to have such debts declared nondischargeable.\n\nIn your example, if the guests can prove that Bob caused them \"willful and malicious injury\" then those debts will not be discharged, and Bob will continue to owe them whatever his assets didn't cover.\n\nIt might not help much. They might be able to [garnish Bob's wages](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/question-what-percentage-of-wages-can-28048.html) up to 25% of his disposable income. If we suppose Bob can show he needs half his income for basic living expenses, that leaves them $5625 per year, or $140 per guest per year. \n\nThere are other reasons why Bob might not be able to successfully file Chapter 7 at all. See the link above; for instance the rules on \"abusive\" filing.\n\nOtherwise, yes, the debts would be discharged. \n\n> What about the guests, do they simply not receive their compensation?\n\nRight, if the debt is discharged, they will get whatever Bob's assets can cover and then no more. But as we've seen, Bob's income is so small relative to his debts that they were never going to receive much anyway. A debtor can only pay what he has, court order or no. The court can't create money out of thin air.\n\n> What if they depend on this compensation to pay medical expenses?\n\nThen that is too bad.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: Bob, who secretly poisoned his pool party guests, is sued in civil court and ordered to pay $2 million in damages.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Chapter 7 bankruptcy generally discharges debts, meaning they are no longer legally owed.\n2. However, there are exceptions to debt discharge, including \"debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity.\"\n3. In Bob's case, if the guests can prove that he caused them \"willful and malicious injury\" by intentionally poisoning the pool, those debts will not be discharged.\n4.

Option B is incorrect as it assumes bankruptcy has no effect on the debt, which is not generally true. Option D is incorrect because bankruptcy courts don't create such specific payment plans in Chapter 7 cases, and it ignores Bob's limited income relative to the debt.\n\nThis question challenges test-takers to consider the nuances of bankruptcy law and its application to intentional torts, requiring higher-order thinking skills."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19512/a-contract-has-a-penalty-depending-on-choices-made-by-unrelated-3rd-party", "docs_id": 19512, "title": "A contract has a penalty depending on choices made by unrelated 3rd party", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose a contract is signed by two parties, Party A and Party B.

ByteTech has no control over or relationship with CloudServe. If CloudServe independently releases a similar product 4 months later, what is the most likely legal outcome?\n\nA) The contract is void as it resembles gambling, and ByteTech is not liable for any payment.\nB) ByteTech must pay the fee as stipulated in the contract, regardless of their lack of control over CloudServe.\nC) The clause is likely unenforceable as a penalty, but ByteTech may be liable for DataCorp's actual damages.\nD) The contract is automatically converted to an insurance agreement, requiring ByteTech to obtain an insurance license.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts presented in the documentation. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Contracts can allocate risks, including events outside the control of the contracting parties. This means the clause itself is not inherently invalid just because ByteTech can't control CloudServe's actions.\n\n2. The contract is not considered gambling or insurance. It's a business agreement allocating specific risks, which is different from general indemnification (insurance) or primarily wagering on an outcome (gambling).\n\n3.

Instead, I inherited U.S. citizenship at the moment I became an LPR (Legal Permanent Resident), because I [both had a parent with citizenship and I was under the age of 18](https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/citizenship-through-parents).\n\nThere is no paperwork to file to inherit citizenship this way, it is completely automatic and as a result there are people in the U.S. that do not know they are citizens. In order to assert that I was now a U.S. citizen, I just had to apply for either a U.S. passport, or a Certificate of Citizenship. There is no deadline to do this, because I was a fully\\-fledged citizen from the day of approval of my Permanent Residence application.\n\nWhen I applied for my U.S. passport, I simply had to prove that I was a child at the time of receiving my Green Card, and that one parent was a U.S. citizen.\n\nThis is exactly what I had to provide the German consulate. I provided my own birth certificate, my I\\-485 form (with approval date) and my father's naturalisation certificate. Those were accepted without question.\n\nTo obtain a copy of my Form I\\-485, I had to file a FOIA request\\-\\-I used a Form G\\-639 to make it easier\\-\\-and I emailed it to [uscis.foia@uscis.dhs.gov](http://mailto:uscis.foia@uscis.dhs.gov).\n\nI did attempt to get a copy of my passport application, as I filed that while under 18, but I was told by the State Department that they did not have a copy of it *(curiously, several months later a full copy of my original passport application arrived by post from the State Department...)*. The response was not a surprise as when I applied for a passport at the age of 17, I was told by the official that they do not keep a record of my application, so I should also have a Passport Card in case my passport goes missing and I must prove citizenship.\n\nUnder German citizenship law, one loses citizenship when \"voluntarily\" obtaining another citizenship. The reason that I did not lose my citizenship when I became a U.S. citizen was because: I was a child, and it happened automatically. Therefore, it is not considered voluntary. Luckily, I did not have to explain this, since it was a consulate in the U.S. (Houston, TX) that I visited, they were well aware of the way in which I inherited U.S. citizenship. However, I had some trouble when dealing with the London embassy as they did not understand all of the U.S. citizenship qualifiers.\n\nI hope this helps anyone else that finds themselves in a similar situation!

The WTO, for instance, operates a sophisticated dispute resolution mechanism (see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispute_settlement_in_the_World_Trade_Organization)). If a particular treaty contains no such stipulations, it us up to the parties to decide what course of action they intend to pursue if they believe that another party does not fulfill its treaty obligations. States are generally bound by art 2(3\\) of the UN Charter, which provides that \"all Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered\". In resolving disputes, they must furthermore obey art 33(1\\): \"The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.\"\n\nJudicial means of dispute resolution are available, most notably in the form of arbitration courts/panels and the ICJ; however, this always requires that the two countries agree to bring their dispute before such a body. It is important to keep in mind that there is no \"World Court\". If country A believes that country B violates a treaty and B refuses to take action, then that's it. This might be cause for political sanctions by other countries, but there is no body that could somehow \"make\" B comply with its treaty obligations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about international law, treaties, and agreements, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A small island nation, Zephyria, signed the Paris Agreement on climate change but has failed to meet its emission reduction targets for the past five years. Neighboring countries are concerned about rising sea levels affecting their coastal regions. Which of the following best describes the most likely and appropriate course of action in this scenario?\n\nA) The United Nations Security Council will impose economic sanctions on Zephyria for violating international law.\nB) Affected countries can unilaterally take military action against Zephyria to force compliance with the Paris Agreement.\nC) Neighboring countries may seek negotiation or mediation with Zephyria, potentially escalating to arbitration if agreed upon.\nD) The International Court of Justice will automatically hear the case and issue a binding ruling on Zephyria's non-compliance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question tests the understanding of international law, treaty obligations, and dispute resolution mechanisms at a high cognitive level. The correct answer, C, aligns with the principles outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. According to the UN Charter Article 33(1), parties to a dispute \"shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.\"\n\n2. The documentation emphasizes that there is no \"World Court\" that can automatically enforce treaty obligations. Instead, countries must agree to bring their disputes before a judicial body.\n\n3. The question involves a real-world scenario applying climate change treaty obligations, requiring analysis of multiple concepts.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the UN Security Council doesn't typically impose sanctions for climate agreement violations. Option B is wrong as it violates the principle of peaceful dispute resolution outlined in the UN Charter. Option D is incorrect because the ICJ cannot automatically hear cases; both parties must agree to its jurisdiction.\n\nThis question challenges test-takers to apply their understanding of international law principles to a complex, real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27665/schengen-visa-refusal", "docs_id": 27665, "title": "Schengen visa refusal", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am an Indian citizen based in the UK. I intend to make a series of trips to France in the next few months, but firstly, I intend to visit the Netherlands in April. In keeping with the rules in the Schengen handbook, I had applied for a multiple entry visa at the French consulate through TLS.\n\nHowever my visa was refused, with the reason that my main destination was the Netherlands. This goes against the rule in the Schengen handbook, and the TLS authorities were also saying stuff that went against the guidelines in the handbook.\n\nThe exact example relevant to my case in the visa handbook:\n\n> Example: A Senegalese national regularly visits her family in France but also travels to other Member States for business purposes once or twice per year. The destination of her first journey is Switzerland.\n> \n> \n> In this case the French consulate should deal with the application because it will be the most frequent destination.\n\nDue to this unfair refusal, I am losing out on a lot of money \\- the travel costs to the Netherlands, the trips to London for the visa process, and the accommodation charges. We are depressed that in spite of following the Schengen rulebook to the letter and spirit, due to the ignorance of the consulate officials, we have had to lose out on so much money.\n\nWe have an appeal process, but is it possible for us to get compensated for these losses too? We are not keen on a situation where we simply get the visa again without any monetary compensation.\n\nAlso is there any UK\\-based legal recourse for us? Or can we only appeal in France, through the CRRV, [as mentioned in this site](https://fr.tlscontact.com/gb/lon/page.php?pid=faq)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a governmental decision of the government of France and due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, you cannot get compensation unless the specific law specifically allows for it.\n\nI cannot speak for France but allowing compensation in immigration matters is virtually unheard of except for egregious and malicious conduct which refusing a visa, even incorrectly, isn\u2019t.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An Indian citizen living in the UK plans multiple trips to France but first intends to visit the Netherlands. Their Schengen visa application to the French consulate was refused, citing the Netherlands as the main destination. Given this scenario and the Schengen visa rules, which of the following actions is most appropriate and likely to yield the desired outcome?\n\nA) File a lawsuit in the UK courts for monetary compensation due to the visa refusal\nB) Appeal the decision through the CRRV in France, requesting both visa approval and financial compensation\nC) Reapply for the visa through the Dutch consulate, abandoning the appeal process\nD) Appeal the decision through the CRRV in France, focusing solely on visa approval without seeking compensation\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation and Schengen visa rules. The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. The refusal appears to contradict the Schengen handbook rules, as exemplified by the Senegalese national example provided. This suggests grounds for appeal.\n\n2. The appeal process should be conducted through the CRRV in France, as mentioned in the documentation. This eliminates option A, which suggests UK courts.\n\n3. While the applicant desires compensation, the concept of sovereign immunity (mentioned in the top answer) makes it highly unlikely to receive monetary compensation for visa refusals, even if incorrect. This rules out option B.\n\n4. Reapplying through the Dutch consulate (option C) would abandon the legitimate grounds for appeal and potentially weaken the applicant's case for future French visas.\n\n5. Option D is the most appropriate because it focuses on correcting the visa decision through the proper channels (CRRV in France) without pursuing the unlikely goal of compensation.\n\nThis question tests the applicant's ability to integrate information from the Schengen rules, the specific case details, and the legal principle of sovereign immunity to determine the most practical and legally sound course of action."}}
