I have had no contact with her since then, but I have a phone number on the sheet the officer gave us at the scene.\n\nI had a preliminary estimate of $1,800 to repair the damage to my car. I have uninsured motorist coverage, but I carry a $1,000 deductible. My truck is 14 years old, worth only maybe $5,000\\-$6,000\\. The damage is cosmetic and my truck is still able to be driven.\n\nI'm assuming that for these modest numbers it is not worth the expense of hiring an attorney (or is it?).\n\nI realistically have only a few options to try and recover any damages:\n\n1. Small claims court\n2. Open a claim with my insurance company, and let them try and collect from her\n3. Contact her directly and ask nicely :)\n\nI'm thinking that small claims court might be a victory only in principle. As I understand it, even after getting a judgement collecting the money is a whole other matter.\n\nAre there other options I should be considering? Or is this basically a lost cause?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Did you get a copy of the accident report from an officer on scene (the one time I've been a crash, I was given a slip of paper similar to a ticket with some basic info and the full report was available for request a few days later when in the system). For the insurance company it was enough just to get the case number on the ticket and they did the leg work. Consider yourself lucky it was only cosmetic. You can also reach out to the officer in the report OR the prosecutor's office. Although they might reach out to you, don't expect it, as they only need you to testify in court if a plea agreement isn't struck (90% of all criminal cases in the U.S. end in a plea bargin of some sorts.).\n\nEither way, it's prudent for your own records to get copies of the reports as well as the estimation for the repairs. As you said, it is cosmetic, so it's not like the repairs are necessary to the safe operation of the car (However, if you can clarify what the truck is used for, it might make a difference. It's one thing if it's your own pickup truck used for hauling stuff for weekend projects you have to fix up the house... it's another thing if it's a pickup truck you use to carry your equipment for your landscaping company, as the \"cosmetic\" damage impacts your proffessional image in that people will be less likely to contract with you, in addition to any custom paint job with contact information needing specialty repairs.\n\nSuing for damages will likely put this in small claims court, which is helpful as it's more friendly to pro se litigants and if you have all your above information in order, it should be sufficient to win (Civil courts do not need to meet \"Beyond Reasonable Doubt\" standards of evidence, but Preponderance of evidence (i.e. it's more likely that it happened one way vs. the other) which this should cover.). The down side is a lot of people who drink and drive are often not financially well off... and a lot of people who don't have insurance do so because they can't afford it... I'm not saying this is 100% of the case, but if she can't afford auto insurance, well, she's not likely to afford a $1800 repair job, oh, and she's likely going to do some jail time, as DUI with a collision normally carries jail time, and that's before the fact that she was driving without insurance (usually a fine). So she's going to be out a good chunk of cash from criminal cases. You don't have to wait for criminal proceedings to occur, but having the conviction as evidence helps a lot... but this means you have to wait for her to get out of jail to really begin to start the legal process of trying to collect.\n\nSure you can sue, but you still can't get blood from a stone (As Lawyers say, there may be a case, but it's not worth it if they can't even pay).\n\nAt the end of the day, no matter what you do, try and keep some perspective. As unlucky as it is that this happened to you, there are lots of DUI victims out there who would gladly give their first born son (or any child of your choosing, it's 2020\\) to come out of their experiene with only cosmetic damage that did not total a 14 year old vehicle. After all, for so many who have been the victim of drunk driver... they already paid that price of a child and sometimes... the drunk driver took more than just one.

Your truck sustained $1,800 in cosmetic damage, and you have uninsured motorist coverage with a $1,000 deductible. Which of the following strategies is most likely to result in financial recovery while considering long-term implications and effort required?\n\nA) File a claim with your insurance company and let them pursue the driver\nB) Pursue the driver directly through small claims court\nC) Contact the driver personally to negotiate a settlement\nD) Absorb the loss and focus on ensuring your insurance coverage is adequate for future incidents\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple factors and real-world implications. Option A is the most strategic choice for several reasons:\n\n1. Insurance companies have more resources and experience in pursuing uninsured drivers, increasing the likelihood of recovery.\n2. It minimizes your personal time and effort in legal proceedings.\n3. You'll receive compensation (minus the deductible) regardless of the driver's ability to pay.\n4. If the insurance company recovers funds, you may get your deductible back.\n\nOption B, while potentially successful, requires significant time and effort. Even with a judgment, collection could be challenging given the driver's likely financial situation (unable to afford insurance, potential legal fees from the DUI).\n\nOption C is risky and unlikely to succeed given the driver's arrest and probable financial constraints.\n\nOption D, while pragmatic, doesn't attempt recovery and misses the opportunity to use your uninsured motorist coverage.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about risk, effort, and potential outcomes in a complex real-world scenario, integrating multiple concepts from insurance, legal processes, and practical considerations."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3951/i-have-a-private-lot-parking-permit-but-there-are-no-spaces-available-legal-rem", "docs_id": 3951, "title": "I have a private lot parking permit but there are no spaces available, legal remedies?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I bought a parking permit for a private lot attached to my apartment but today when I came to park I found that no spaces were available.

The correct answer, C, is based on the documentation stating \"Your permit entitles you to what it says it does in the contract.\" The most effective strategy is to carefully review the permit agreement for specific language about availability and limitations. This approach addresses the core issue of contract interpretation.\n\nOption A is a distractor based on the common misconception that a parking permit implies guaranteed availability, which the documentation contradicts.

Leaking information through metadata is a *potential* risk, but it's not a risk in every context. Thus, data controllers *should* consider whether metadata could pose a privacy problem in their workflows, but they are not necessarily required to redact such metadata.\n\nThis provision of the UK GDPR is already enforceable, but it would need a case by case analysis to determine whether the risk analysis and selection of technical and organizational measures have been conducted incorrectly.\n\nThe documents you linked are a HMRC internal manual. These are not normative \u2013 they do not bind other organizations.

But their website not being completely correct doesn't mean their service isn't, that's why I'm asking the question\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Mailchimp as a company is probably mostly GDPR\\-compliant. But this doesn't mean that *using* the Mailchimp service would be compliant as well.\n\nThis is because the GDPR has different compliance obligations for \u201cdata controllers\u201d and \u201cdata processors\u201d. The data controller is responsible for the compliance of all processing activities they determine the purposes and means for, regardless of whether those activities are actually outsourced. In contrast, the primary responsibility of a data processor is to only use the data as instructed by the controller, but not for the processor's own purposes.\n\nSo Mailchimp probably doesn't abuse its customer's data, and offers an Art 28 GDPR conformant data processing agreement as part of its contracts. Mailchimp also offers features that assist with related privacy laws, such as collecting proper consent as required by the EU ePrivacy Directive.\n\nAnd Mailchimp has a page about [European data transfers](https://mailchimp.com/help/mailchimp-european-data-transfers/). This is where it gets tricky. Not the Mailchimp service, but the customer is the data exporter / data controller and is responsible for compliance with Chapter V of the GDPR. The data controller must decide *themselves* whether the international transfer into the US is legal. Briefly, the GDPR allows the following grounds for an international transfer of personal data:\n\n* target country has an adequacy decision from the EU \u2013 no, because the EU\u2013US Privacy Shield was invalidated in the *Schrems II* ruling\n* Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) \u2013 maybe, see below discussion\n* Binding Corporate Rules \u2013 not applicable\n* exceptions, including explicit consent or only occasional transfers \u2013 not applicable\n\nThe Mailchimp guide about EU data transfers correctly states that the *Schrems II* decision only invalidated the Privacy Shield, and did not invalidate the concept of SCCs. That means it is still legal to use SCCs as a basis to transfer personal data in non\\-EU countries. But this doesn't imply that SCCs can serve as a basis for transferring personal data specifically to Mailchimp in the US \u2013 a case by case analysis is necessary that determines whether security of processing is guaranteed and whether data subjects would have effective legal remedies if their rights were breached.\n\nIt now happens that exactly the same reasons that caused the Privacy Shield to be invalid must also make us doubt whether SCCs can be valid in their place. The problem with transfers to the US never was the risk that the recipient would sell the personal data to the highest bidder, but that the US\\-based company is subject to US spy laws like FISA 702 and EO 12333 that do not provide effective legal remedies for foreign affected persons. (Mailchimp explicitly confirms that it is subject to those spy laws as an \u201celectronic communication service\u201d.)\n\nIn the wake of the *Schrems II* ruling the EDPB has published a document with recommendations for supplemental safeguards that could make SCCs permissible, but these recommendations (like end to end encryption, or only transferring pseudoymized data) cannot work for US\\-based cloud services such as Mailchimp. Some (such as the US government) have argued that *Schrems II* was based on outdated information, but this standpoint is not shared by European regulators.\n\nSo, the data controller \u2013 the Mailchimp customer \u2013 has to make their own judgement about this international transfer.\n\n* If SCCs combined with Mailchimp's supplemental measures provide sufficient safeguards, then the international transfer is legal and GDPR\\-compliant. Mailchimp offers all the necessary paperwork such as DPAs, SCCs, and so on.\n* If there are no sufficient safeguards, then the transfer is clearly illegal.\n\nMy personal opinion is that Mailchimp's supplemental measure fall far short of what would be required per the EDPB recommendations. Lower courts in the EU now routinely consider all transfers to the US as illegal. A company using Mailchimp was also an early target of a post\\-*Schrems II* enforcement action, though it wasn't fined since it immediately stopped using the service.\n\nSo while it's not possible to *definitely* say that using Mailchimp would be a GDPR\\-violation, it's very difficult to argue that such use could be compliant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small European e-commerce company is considering using Mailchimp for its newsletter service.

I'm not a native English speaker, and thought 'derivative' means 'inspired or motivated by something'...\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Derivative Works under US law and the Berne Convention\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nUS Copyright law defines \"derivative work\" in [17 USC 101](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101) as:\n\n> A \u201cderivative work\u201d is a work based upon one or more preexisting works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications, which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a \u201cderivative work\u201d.\n\nArticle 2 of the [Berne Copyright Convention](https://wipolex.wipo.int/en/text/283698) reads, in relevant part:\n\n> (3\\) Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work.\n\nUnder [17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) one of the things that a copyright owner has the exclusive right to do or authorize is:\n\n> (2\\) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work;\n\nNote that under the US definition, a derivative work is one **based on** an earlier work, not one that merely **refers to** a derivative work. Merely mentioning or citing a previous work is not enough to make the later work derivative. It must, in some substantial way, **use** and be developed out of the previous work.\n\nThe classic examples of a derivative work are: a translation into another language; an adaptation into another medium or form (such as making a novel into a play or film); and making a sequel. But derivative works can be derivative in various other ways.\n\nExamples from the Question\n--------------------------\n\nLet us look at the examples mentioned in the question:\n\n> * an academic paper that cites or refers to other papers\n\nThis is a mere reference and is not at all derivative. However a paper that contained little or no original content, but consisted almost entirely of such citations might be considered derivative.\n\n> * a discussion thread on Internet (or each comment or reply on it) about a work\n\nDiscussion or criticism of a work, or a reply to it, is not normally considered derivative. Such comments are not derivative of the work under discussion, nor of the previous comments. Quotations of either are likely to be permitted fair use, and so not infringing, although that will depend on the exact details of each case.\n\n> * a fanart or a fanfiction\n\nThis is likely to be a derivative work, depending on how much of the source work is used, and whether distinctive details are reproduced. Note that **ideas** cannot be protected by copyright. (See 17 USC 102(b) for this.) So the idea of a person who turns into an animal of a particular type, or has some special power or ability or characteristic is not protected by copyright. But the details expressed in the source work, such as the mannerisms or appearance of a character, or the specific nature of a setting, can be protected, and to draw on them may be infringement, unless fair use applies.\n\n> * metadata\n\n\"Metadata\" is a very general idea. Typically the kind of information included in metadata is not protected by copyright, but in some cases it may be.\n\n> * a review or a criticism\n\nA review, criticism of, or comment on an existing work is not normally considered a derivative work. Quotes used in a review or criticism are often protected by fair use under US law, but if the quotation is excessive, and particularly if it allows the review to serve as a replacement for the original and to harm the market for the original, it may be infringement.\n\n> * a work inspired by other works\n\nAgain, this depends. If only the general idea is imitated, then the later work is not derivative If detailed, distinctive, and specific characters, settings or plot lines are imitated, then the later work may be considered derivative, and infringing if permission is not obtained.\n\nThe *Nichols* Case\n------------------\n\nIn the case [*Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corporation*, 45 F. 2d 119 \\- Circuit Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit (1930\\)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14991934121439658064&q=Nichols+v.+Universal+Pictures+Corp.&hl=en&as_sdt=6,33) Judge Learned Hand, a famous judge, wrote a very influential and often cited opinion describing when two similar plays are, and when they are not, infringements of one another. It is worth reading to better understand this issue, even though it is over 90 years old.\n\nWhat makes a Work Derivative\n----------------------------\n\nSo in general a work is derivative when it uses significant, distinctive, and detailed elements of a previous work, or is a revised or altered version of the previous work.\n\nCopyright in a Derivative Work\n------------------------------\n\nIf a derivative work is made with proper permission, or the source work is out of copyright, the author of the derivative work has copyright in all the original parts of the derivative work. However if the derivative work is infringing, and was created without permission, the author has no valid copyright in it at all.\n\nFair Use and True Parody\n------------------------\n\nIf a work is held to be a ***fair use*** of the original, it is not infringing even if it is a derivative work, this is an ***exception to copyright*** in US law. It may still be important to note that the work is derivative, because the author has copyright only in the original aspects.\n\nIf a work is a ***parody***, it is likely to be held to be a fair use. Note that in copyright law a **true** parody is a work that comments on the source work by imitating or mocking it. A work that imitates a source work merely to be funny, or to comment on general social conditions, or to make some other point, but **not** to comment on the original, is not a parody in US copyright law. Courts often refer to such a work as a \"satire\", even though this is not the standard literary definition of \"satire\". A Satire will usually not be a fair use of the source, or if it is, it will be for other reasons.\n\n**Addition** (in response to an addition to the question)\n\n> * original work : poem \"Eloisa to Abelard\" by Alexander Pope(1688\\-1744\\)\n> * (potential) derivative work : film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" directed by Michel Gondry\n> \n> \n> The film's title is a quotation from the poem, and the quoted part is cited within the film. Does it make the film a \"derivative work\" of the poem?\n\nNo. First of all, any copyright on the poem has long expired, it is in the public domain.\n\nSecondly, merely referring to a previous work in the title and citing it in the body does not make the later work derivative, it is merely a ***literary reference***. A significant part of the earlier work would need to be used to make the film derivative. Unless much more was used than is mentioned above, this would not qualify even if the poem were still in copyright.\n\n### Meaning of \"Derivative\"\n\nLike many other words of the English language, the word \"derivative\" has several different senses. The sense leading to the definitions:\n\n> * imitative of the work of another person\n> * inspired or motivated by something\n\nis mostly used in the context of criticism and review of works of art or literature. In copyright law, \"derivative\" is a technical term, defined by the definition section of the law, and by previous court cases. It is not unrelated to the meaning from literary or art criticism, but it is specific and by no means the same. The word \"derivative\" also has other specialized meanings, for example in chemistry, and in mathematics.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about copyright law and derivative works, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A popular fantasy novel series features a protagonist who can control the weather.

The novelist claims copyright infringement, asserting the movie is a derivative work. Which of the following best describes the legal situation?\n\nA) The movie is clearly a derivative work and infringes on the novel's copyright\nB) The movie is not derivative because it only uses the general idea of weather control\nC) The movie is automatically protected as fair use because it's in a different medium\nD) The movie's status as a derivative work depends on how closely it mimics specific, distinctive elements of the novel's character\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of copyright law concepts, particularly regarding derivative works. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. As per the documentation, ideas themselves cannot be copyrighted (17 USC 102(b)). The general concept of a weather-controlling character is an idea, not a copyrightable expression.\n\n2. However, specific, distinctive details of how the character is portrayed, their mannerisms, or unique aspects of how their powers work could be protected by copyright.\n\n3. The definition of a derivative work requires that it be \"based upon\" the original work, not merely inspired by it. This necessitates using substantial, distinctive elements from the source material.\n\n4. The question doesn't provide enough information to determine if the movie uses such distinctive elements. Therefore, its status as a derivative work depends on a closer examination of these details.\n\n5. Option A is incorrect because it assumes derivation without evidence of specific copying. Option B oversimplifies the situation, ignoring the possibility of copying specific expressions.

Amateur radio equipment (option D) is not covered by the provided regulations for Personal Radio Services, and frequency-hopping spread spectrum is a form of encryption, which is generally prohibited in amateur radio communications.\n\nOption C represents the most legally permissible approach, as subtle contextual references in GMRS communications, while potentially providing some privacy, are less likely to be considered \"coded messages\" or \"messages with hidden meanings\" compared to the other options.

According to the documentation, libel is \"the use of false, defamatory claims about someone in written or printed form.\" While the influencer's claim was spoken in a video, the key factor is that it was published in a permanent, shareable format (video posted on social media). This aligns with the documentation's note that false claims on the Internet are considered libel, as per the Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v.

Option C is a common misconception; while some social media posts may be protected as opinion, factual claims that are demonstrably false can still be considered defamation.

The documentation states that \"Minors can't sign legally binding contracts unless there's an exception.\" As a CTO and board member, the minor would be expected to engage in and approve various business contracts. However, these contracts could be considered voidable, as they likely wouldn't fall under the \"necessities\" exception for minors.

The money was intended for a business. They are aware that this must be an error but spend the money anyway. The bank wants the money back. The couple quits talking to the bank. The couple is charged with theft and receiving stolen property.\n\nI am very confused how they can be charged with either of these things. In the case of theft, I think it is fairly plain the couple did nothing to receive the money. No act on their part caused the money to enter their account. I think most reasonable people would agree that at that point, they \"have\" the money, and what they do with it after that is irrelevant to whether it was stolen. *If this is not the case, and the act of spending the money is the theft, then it implies that any money in anyone's account is not theirs, which I seriously doubt a jury would agree with.*\n\nWith regards to receiving stolen property, there are two options.\n\n1. My claim above is true, and the couple did not steal the money. If the property then is \"stolen,\" the uncomfortable implication is that the bank stole the money. (Teller Error, I don't think, counts as theft).\n2. My claim above is untrue, in which case, it's hard to argue they received it at all, since they are the thieves (the reception becomes trivial).\n\nIt seems to me that the prosecution is doomed if the couple decides to go to trial.\n\n**What's going to give the prosecution a chance to succeed? If they are doomed, why bother filing the charges at all?**\n\nNote: I am aware of statues in the case of mail where receiving mail which is not yours and failing to make a reasonable attempt to return it is theft.

I simply don't see how either choice in charge by the prosecution results in a conviction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Broadly speaking, theft offences in common law jurisdictions are defined as the dishonest appropriation of property that belongs to another with intent to deprive the rightful owner of it, without proper authority (e.g. permission or legal right to do that). \n\nAppropriation means the assumption of the rights of ownership of the property, i.e. behaving as if you were now its owner, not simply or solely the taking of the property.\n\nPossible defences include absence of intent to deprive the rightful owner of the property and intent to search for the rightful owner of the property and return it to them.\n\nYou say:\n\n> The facts are presented as follows: One day, couple wakes up to\n>  $120,000 extra dollars due to teller error.

Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A couple in Pennsylvania discovers $120,000 erroneously deposited into their bank account. They spend the money, knowing it's not theirs, and subsequently face criminal charges. Which of the following best explains why the prosecution might succeed in a theft case against the couple, despite the money being initially deposited due to bank error?\n\nA) The couple's act of spending the money constitutes \"appropriation,\" a key element of theft, regardless of how they initially received it.\nB) Banking statutes specifically criminalize the retention of erroneously deposited funds, similar to laws regarding misdirected mail.\nC) The couple's refusal to communicate with the bank after spending the money proves their intent to permanently deprive the rightful owner.\nD) The initial erroneous deposit by the bank legally transfers ownership to the couple, making their subsequent spending irrelevant.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The key to understanding why the prosecution might succeed lies in the legal definition of theft in common law jurisdictions. Theft is broadly defined as \"the dishonest appropriation of property that belongs to another with intent to deprive the rightful owner of it, without proper authority.\" \n\nCrucially, \"appropriation\" in this context means the assumption of the rights of ownership of the property, not just the initial taking. By spending the money they knew wasn't theirs, the couple assumed the rights of ownership, thus potentially fulfilling the \"appropriation\" element of theft. The fact that they didn't initially take the money through their own actions is less relevant than their subsequent behavior.\n\nThis question requires analysis of legal concepts (L3 in Bloom's taxonomy) and integration of multiple ideas from the documentation. It also presents a real-world scenario that tests critical thinking about how legal definitions apply in practice.

It seems like that would be reserved to the states under the 10th Amendment.\n\nIs the interstate commerce clause? That seems iffy to me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's the interstate commerce clause. Because of how the modern economy works. there's really pretty much nothing that's confined to a single state in its effects and doesn't affect other states. Almost any law can be justified as a regulation of interstate commerce these days, especially if that law is actually directly about commercial activity.\n\nThe big case to cite here is *United States v. Darby* ([312 US 100](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1183543472021488573)). This case tested a federal minimum wage law which banned shipping goods in interstate commerce where they were produced by people paid less than minimum wage, and also banned the employment of those people at less than minimum wage in that context. The Supreme Court found this law constitutional, even though the manufacturing employees weren't personally engaged in interstate commerce, because the employer *was* engaged in interstate commerce and regulating production was a permissible way to regulate that commerce.\n\nNow, after that decision, there was a major broadening of what was allowed to be regulated under the interstate commerce clause. In *Wickard v. Filburn* ([317 US 111](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17396018701671434685)), the Supreme Court ruled that the appropriate test to see whether something could be regulated as interstate commerce was whether it had a \"substantial economic effect\" on interstate commerce. Under this rule, federal regulation under the commerce clause is very far\\-reaching. It supports extending a minimum wage to domestic service workers ([*Marshall v. Rose*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6853240429044189885), a Fourth Circuit case from 1980\\); it supports extending EEOC rules to state employers ([*EEOC v.

She argues that since her business doesn't ship products across state lines, the federal minimum wage shouldn't apply. What is the most likely legal outcome if this case were challenged in court?\n\nA) The business owner would prevail, as the 10th Amendment reserves wage regulation to the states.\nB) The federal minimum wage would apply, based on the \"substantial economic effect\" test from Wickard v. Filburn.\nC) The business would be exempt from federal minimum wage laws due to its lack of direct interstate commerce.\nD) The court would require a detailed economic analysis to determine if the business indirectly affects interstate commerce.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is B, based on the following key points:\n\n1. The interstate commerce clause allows the federal government to set a minimum wage, as established in United States v. Darby.\n\n2. Wickard v. Filburn broadened the interpretation of the interstate commerce clause, introducing the \"substantial economic effect\" test. This test allows for very far-reaching federal regulation, even when the business itself doesn't directly engage in interstate commerce.\n\n3. The case of Marshall v. Rose extended minimum wage regulations to domestic service workers, showing that the commerce clause can apply to local employment situations.\n\n4. The business owner's argument about not shipping across state lines is not relevant under modern interpretations of the commerce clause. The court would likely find that even a small, local business has a \"substantial economic effect\" on interstate commerce in today's interconnected economy.\n\n5. The 10th Amendment argument (option A) is addressed in the question's context and is not the prevailing legal interpretation for minimum wage laws.\n\n6.

Is\n> this correct?\n\nYes. This is an annualized interest rate of 715,586,124,880,210%, which is far, far in excess of the maximum interest rate allowed by law.\n\nThe maximum legally allowed interest rate in British Columbia is 60% per annum. So, an interest rate of 65 cents or more in a five day period on a loan of $100\\.00 is illegal.\n\n> I don't know his current address.\n\nLending money without collateral to people without knowing their current address is just plain stupid when it comes to lending practices. Nobody does that without a primarily donative intent.\n\n> Would have holding collateral been a legal solution?\n\nPotentially. This is essentially the business model of a pawn shop.\n\nIn the case of a pawn shop, the borrower delivers tangible personal property to the pawn shop owner who takes custody of it, which serves as collateral for a small loan with a set, legal interest rate, for a fixed period of time much greater than five days (typically several weeks or to several months). If the loan is not repaid, the collateral becomes the property of the lender in full payment of the loan, and the parties haggle in advance over the fair market value of the collateral against which the customer may borrow the full amount.\n\nA pawn is essentially equivalent to an outright sale of tangible personal property (almost always used) in exchange for cash, with a right to rescind the deal for a modest interest charge within X number of days after the sale.\n\nSince the pawn shop owner has some asset of the borrower to collect from in the event of non\\-payment, and the loan is \"non\\-recourse\" (i.e. collection rights are limited to taking ownership of the collateral), it isn't important to even know the address of the borrower, and no lawsuits are necessary for the lending pawn shop owner to be made whole if the loan is not repaid.\n\nThe down side of running a pawn shop is that the owner needs to have considerable skill to value the collateral at a price sufficient to repay the loan together with a fair share of the administrative expenses of the operation on a case by case basis, for the very modest profit margin associated with a typical pawn shop.\n\nMost people who are skilled enough to value tangible personal property accurately enough to make money running a pawn ship are also skilled enough to do other things that pay better.\n\n> Late Charge: Any payment not remunerated within 10 days of its due\n> date shall be subject to a belatedly charge of 5 percent (%) of the\n> payment, not to exceed $500 for any such late installment.\n\nLate charges are considered in the maximum interest rate calculation, so you need a much longer term loan and a much lower interest rate for this to be legally permissible.\n\n> Collection fees: If this note is placed with a legal representative\n> for collection, then Borrower agrees to pay an attorney's fee of ten\n> percent (10%) of the voluntary balance. This fee will be added to the\n> unpaid balance of the loan.\n\nNot sure what is meant by the \"voluntary balance.\" It isn't inherently improper to include the costs of collection in a loan agreement, and indeed, I think that this may be the default rule of law in British Columbia without any contractual term under loser pays rules of civil procedure.\n\nBut, a court can decline to award more than the \"reasonable\" legal fees incurred to collect a debt, and it is not at all clear that even the minimal amount of legal fees one could incur to collect a debt would be reasonable to collect a loan of $100 and interest.\n\nLikewise, while there are \"hard money loans\" (i.e. loans secured only by collateral and no personal obligation to pay that can be enforced against an individual's assets in court), where it is customary for the legal costs of drafting the loan documents to be paid by the borrower rather than the lender, for the most part, this simply makes no sense, because even 12 minutes of legal time (0\\.2 hours in the typical legal billing format) is an excessive amount to charge for a $100 loan for a five day period of time. This would typically be $50\\-$60 or more. It would probably be treated as an interest charge and hence would be illegal in British Columbia.\n\n> Would a term like \"if the lender needs to resort to legal action to\n> enforce a term of this agreement, the borrow will reimburse him for\n> all related expenses and his time\" be enforceable?\n\nReimbursement for out of pocket court filing fees and any photocopying costs and process server costs is likely to be enforceable. Reimbursement for the lenders own time to enforce the loan in the event of a default is probably not enforceable in the case of a $100 loan, even at minimum wage.\n\nMaking small loans has historically been a marginal economic sector for precisely this reason. Even if the default rate is low, the administrative costs associated with making and enforcing (in the event of defaults) a small loan and the administrative costs associated with making and enforcing these promise for a much larger loan are similar. But the dollar amount of interest generated by a small loan is much smaller relative to the administrative costs involved than the interest on a large loan.\n\nCredit card companies and similar lenders make small loans affordable by automating the lending process, screening borrowers based upon credit ratings, making many loans each month to the same borrower, and making loans to many, many borrowers to spread the risk out. But making small loans on a one\\-off basis is not a profitable venture.\n\nBusiness models that charge enough to be profitable with small loans, like payday lenders and car title lenders in the United States, usually have some sort of collateral or *de facto* collateral (like a post\\-dated check), and tend to be shut down by regulators because their interest rates typically need to be on the order of 150%\\-400% per annum to make a profit, due to high administrative costs involved in making small loans relative to the amount of the loan. But interest rates this high are considered exploitive and are illegal.\n\nAnother business model, which essentially describes the business model in the question except for the enforcement method, is called \"loan sharking\". The main difference between legitimate or almost legitimate small loan lending and loan sharking, is that loan sharks enforce their loans by having organized crime enforcers beat up people who don't pay, rather than using lawsuits to deal with loan defaults.

Which of the following actions is most likely to effectively protect the student's property rights while adhering to legal principles?\n\nA) Immediately report the threats to the local police and request their intervention\nB) Contact the university administration to mediate the dispute\nC) Send a formal notice to the acquaintance outlining the agreed-upon terms and potential legal consequences of discarding the property\nD) File for an emergency injunction with the local court to prevent the property's disposal\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate action because:\n\n1. It addresses the legal principle of \"reasonable notice\" mentioned in the documentation. By sending a formal notice, the student is creating a paper trail and clearly communicating their intent to collect the property on the agreed-upon date.\n\n2. It acknowledges the potential existence of a contract between the parties, as mentioned in the documentation. Outlining the agreed-upon terms in the notice reinforces this contractual nature.\n\n3. It serves as a deterrent by informing the acquaintance of potential legal consequences, which aligns with the student's request for a legal action to use as a deterrent.\n\n4. It's a measured response that doesn't immediately escalate to involving third parties, allowing for the possibility of \"common sense to prevail\" as the student hoped.\n\nOption A is less appropriate because police intervention may be premature at this stage and may not be warranted for a civil dispute.

The key document that you need here is a copy of the registration of birth document that the Indian mission gives you from the previous step.\n\nAfter acquiring the Indian passport of your child, you can go ahead and then apply for an American passport. Do note that a minors passport is only valid for 5 years at a time and you will need to renew this every 5 years. And when the child turns 18 then they will need to either renounce their foreign citizenship or Indian citizenship.

On the facts in your question, it is clear that no such Final Charging Order was issued before the bankruptcy commenced.\n\nAn Interim Charging Order will by necessity end unless a Final Charging Order is made. Since no such Order was made, it would seem that the Interim Charging Order has ended: the interim order is designed to stop someone from disposing of assets until the court can decide whether a final order is necessary.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. According to the case Nationwide Building Society v Wright [2009] EWCA Civ 811, bankruptcy is a barrier to a Final Charging Order being issued if the bankruptcy commenced before the Final Charging Order could be issued. In this scenario, the bankruptcy was declared the day after the Interim Charging Order, preventing a Final Charging Order from being made.\n\n2. An Interim Charging Order is temporary by nature and ends if no Final Charging Order is made. Since no Final Charging Order was issued due to the bankruptcy, the Interim Charging Order would have ended on its own.\n\n3. The Limitation Act 1980 provides time limits for creditors to enforce their rights. For enforcing judgments, creditors have six years from the date of judgment. For recovering money secured by a charge, they have twelve years. In either case, after 13 years, any enforcement action would likely be statute-barred.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Interim Charging Orders are not designed to remain valid indefinitely. Option B is wrong because bankruptcy does affect the ability to obtain a Final Charging Order. Option D is a plausible distractor but isn't necessary; the Interim Charging Order should have ended on its own, though checking the Land Registry and potentially applying to remove any remaining notices might be prudent.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a real-world scenario, and understand the implications of time passage on legal rights and obligations."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28337/is-destroying-a-mailbox-a-felony", "docs_id": 28337, "title": "Is destroying a mailbox a felony?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am wondering specifically about juvenile mischief, i.e. driving past a mailbox and teeing off on it with a baseball bat, or similar weapon.\n\nIf such a juvenile were to be successfully prosecuted to the full extent of the law, does that mean that he or she would have a felony (or misdemeanor) on his record for life?

The Department of Justice's Criminal Resource Manual has a [section on misdemeanor offenses that apply to postal crime:](https://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-1468-misdemeanor-postal-crimes)\n\n> Among the misdemeanor dispositions available are: 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701 (obstruction of mails generally); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(b) (opening,destroying, or detaining mail without authority); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1707 (theft of property used by postal service); and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 (misappropriation of postal funds). **When the charge might best lie under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1705 (destruction of letter boxes or mail) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1706 (injury to mail bags) and in other appropriate circumstances, an applicable misdemeanor may be found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 641 (theft of government property); or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361 (destruction of government property).**\n\nThat suggests (at least to me) that federal prosecutors are supposed to at least consider misdemeanor instead of felony charges for minor cases of mailbox destruction. [Under normal circumstances,](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1361) destruction of federal property only becomes a felony if the damage (or attempted damage) is more than $1,000\\.\n\nThis is a pretty good example of how US laws are written with prosecutorial discretion in mind. In other systems, the law about destruction of mail or mailboxes would lay out when it's a serious crime and when it's minor. In the US, it's always considered a serious crime because the assumption is that prosecutors won't charge it in minor cases (in fact, official guidance to prosecutors lays out ways they can charge it without charging the felony).\n\nIt's also possible to be prosecuted at the state level for this, and if you're actually a juvenile that's much more likely than federal prosecution. The feds don't really like handling juvenile cases; they normally leave those up to the states unless there's some good reason not to. Even if you're an adult, the feds may well leave the issue up to the state for prosecution. At the state level, the threshold for felony vs. misdemeanor vandalism would depend on the state.

Rooke, wrote a decision which ran to 176 pages and contained what was essentially a thesis on Sovereign Citizens and similar persons who use pseudo\\-legal arguments to attempt to achieve their ends in court. The case of [*Meads v Meads*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2012/2012abqb571/2012abqb571.html) has become fairly famous and [somewhat influential](https://ablawg.ca/2013/04/08/what-has-meads-v-meads-wrought/), which seems to have been what the judge was hoping for.\n\nHowever, on what basis did the judge decide to stray beyond the matter immediately before him (a divorce dispute)? The *Meads* decision categorised several different (albeit related) types of vexatious litigant. Surely Meads himself was just one type, so the others were not relevant in the immediate context of the case. In terms of court procedure, it seems to me that J.D. Rooke probably *should* have written a much shorter decision, relevant only to the facts immediately before him, and published the rest as an article in a law journal.\n\nIs there any reasonable constraint on how much a judge can or should write in a decision? How common is it for judges to sneak essays into their rulings? Given that this was a civil case between two private citizens, using the opportunity to address the nation, as it were, seems out of place.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: These decisions are inherently individual. The judge in this case explained the reasons why he thought it would be helpful to set out the full context of organized pseudo\\-legal commercial arguments. *Meads v. Meads*, [2012 ABQB 571](https://canlii.ca/t/fsvjq):\n\n> \\[2] Over a decade of reported cases have proven that the individual concepts advanced by OPCA litigants are invalid. What remains is to categorize these schemes and concepts, identify global defects to simplify future response to variations of identified and invalid OPCA themes, and develop court procedures and sanctions for persons who adopt and advance these vexatious litigation strategies.\n> \n> \n> \\[3] ... One of the purposes of these Reasons is, through this litigant, to uncover, expose, collate, and publish the tactics employed by the OPCA community, as a part of a process to eradicate the growing abuse that these litigants direct towards the justice and legal system we otherwise enjoy in Alberta and across Canada. I will respond on a point\\-by\\-point basis to the broad spectrum of OPCA schemes, concepts, and arguments advanced in this action by Mr. Meads.\n> \n> \n> \\[5] The Meads case illustrates many characteristic features of OPCA materials, in court conduct, and litigation strategies. These Reasons will, therefore, explain my June 8, 2012 decision and provide analysis and reasoning that is available for reference and application to other similar proceedings.\n> \n> \n> \\[6] Naturally, my conclusions are important for these parties. However, they also are intended to assist others, who have been taken in/duped by gurus, to realize that these practices are entirely ineffective; to empower opposing parties and their counsel to take action; and as a warning to gurus that the Court will not tolerate their misconduct.\n\nOne of the roles of a judge in the common\\-law legal system is to guide the development of the law. By describing this collection of vexatious tactics, the judge was hoping to allow future courts to simplify court responses to these tactics in future cases.\n\nWhile the reasons in *Meads* were written prior to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in *Hryniak v. Mauldin*, 2014 SCC 7, it is consistent with the Supreme Court's direction to create an environment that promotes timely access to justice.\n\n> Increasingly, there is recognition that a culture shift is required in order to create an environment promoting timely and affordable access to the civil justice system. This shift entails simplifying pre\\-trial procedures and moving the emphasis away from the conventional trial in favour of proportional procedures tailored to the needs of the particular case. The balance between procedure and access struck by our justice system must come to reflect modern reality and recognize that new models of adjudication can be fair and just.\n\nBy helping other judges efficiently understand and dispose of pseudo\\-legal commercial arguments, the reasons in *Meads* further the goals of access to justice. This implication was recongized in *Jarvis v. Morlog*, [2016 ONSC 4476](https://canlii.ca/t/gsdr5):\n\n> In my view, precious judicial time should be spent on resolving real matters. Simply taking judicial time to respond seriously to OPCA claims gives the claimants a measure of success in advancing their improper purposes. Associate Chief Justice Rooke spent more than enough of his very valuable time creating a textbook of abusive OPCA practices in *Meads v. Meads.* In my view, not another moment of judicial resources or party expense should be invested on OPCA claims.\n\nThe legacy of *Meads* is examined by Donald J. Netolitzky, \"[After the Hammer: Six Years of *Meads v. Meads*](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/2019CanLIIDocs2094)\" (2019\\). He argues that the judge was successful in this goal. He also agrees with you that this decision is \"exceptional\": in the breadth of its investigation and its choice of audience (at times speaking \"directly to those who use and promote OPCA concepts\"). He notes that *Meads* has been accepted in subsequent jurisprudence as a \"critical resource\" in Canada and around the world.\n\nWhile one might expect that the material in *Meads* would have been the more appropriate role of an academic article, Netolitzky observes that \"\\[i]n Canada, legal academia has paid essentially no attention to pseudolaw, both before and after *Meads*.\" Perhaps had there been a helpful body of academic literature, *Meads* would have been unnecessary.\n\nNetolitzky argues that the reasons in *Meads* reflected \"trial court expertise.\" These matters tend not to end up in courts of appeal. He also agrees with your analogy to an academic article, calling this a \"review judgment\" (like a \"review article\"). He says that *Meads* \"atypical content\" was needed to \"fill a gap in legal literature\" and that it was sufficiently connected with the materials and arguments put forward in the case. \"Without that context, Meads is a bizarre, inexplicable actor, a caricature of vexatious litigation.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about the Meads v. Meads case and judicial decisions, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A judge is presiding over a routine divorce case but notices that one party is using arguments characteristic of Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Argument (OPCA) litigants. The judge is considering writing an extensive decision that goes beyond the immediate case to address the broader issue of OPCA tactics. Which of the following considerations would BEST justify this approach from a legal and procedural standpoint?\n\nA) The opportunity to publish personal views on a controversial topic in the legal community\nB) The need to simplify future court responses to OPCA tactics and improve access to justice\nC) The desire to gain recognition and influence in international legal circles\nD) The obligation to address all possible legal arguments, even those not directly raised in the case\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because it aligns most closely with the justification provided in the Meads v. Meads case and subsequent analysis. \n\nThe documentation explains that Justice Rooke's extensive decision was intended to \"categorize these schemes and concepts, identify global defects to simplify future response to variations of identified and invalid OPCA themes, and develop court procedures and sanctions.\" This approach was later recognized as furthering the goals of access to justice by helping other judges efficiently understand and dispose of pseudo-legal commercial arguments.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while judges may have personal views, the primary justification should be rooted in improving the administration of justice, not publishing personal opinions.\n\nOption C, while potentially a consequence of such a decision, should not be the primary motivation for a judge's actions. The focus should be on improving the legal system rather than personal recognition.\n\nOption D goes too far - while judges should address relevant arguments, there's no obligation to address all possible legal arguments, especially those not raised in the case. The Meads decision, while extensive, was still connected to the arguments and materials presented in the case.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, including the purpose of judicial decisions, the role of judges in common law systems, and the balance between addressing immediate cases and broader legal issues.

The United States ruling and the enactment of the Controlled Substances Act. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was ruled unconstitutional in Leary v. The United States, removing the primary federal mechanism for cannabis prohibition.\n\n2. While the Narcotics Control Act of 1956 and the Boggs Act existed (option B), they depended on the Marihuana Tax Act, which had been invalidated. This created uncertainty in their enforcement.\n\n3. Cannabis wasn't completely legal and unregulated (option A) because some federal regulations still existed, such as FDA labeling requirements.\n\n4. Although FDA labeling requirements applied (mentioned in option C), this alone doesn't fully describe the legal status.\n\n5. The situation was indeed a legal grey area (option D).

Absent a license allowing you to reuse the text, you will not be allowed to do so.\n\nThe fact that you were a party to a contract represented by the text does not change your position: your contract does not have anything to do with the copyright of its text, therefore you still need to honor the copyright as if you were not a party to the contract.\n\nIt is not uncommon that the copyright will be owned by the lawyer who drafted the text.

Don't you already get the permission to copy and modify the contract from the original party when they send it to you? (Is such right only limited to original execution?)\n\nThe original party, whether it is the copyright owner or just a license holder, can send the text to you for possible copy and modification in the course of executing the contract **with that party** only. The copy that you receive is provided solely with the express purpose to make you an offer (so that you know the terms of the contract) and give opportunity to suggest modifications i.e. make a counter\\-offer.\n\nTo reuse the text with another party you need a permission/license from the copyright owner.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1.

My research has found answers varying from \"No,\" to, \"No if defending someone in the same district for which you work.\"\n\nFor reference, I'm wondering about U.S. jurisdictions and would be interested in hearing how the answer may vary by state. Also, while *pro bono* work is the focus of my question, I'd also be interested in knowing whether the answer changes when money's involved.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most prosecuting attorney positions in a District Attorney, or State Attorney General's office are full time salaries positions that prohibit individuals holding those positions from having any other legal employment. They are also, often, conceptually a division of state government, even if the DA is locally elected. So, any criminal defense engagement in the same state court system would also be a conflict of interest, and the reality of joint task forces discussed below would also make almost any federal case criminal defense engagement in the same state a conflict of interest in most cases because state prosecutors would gain confidential information about pending federal criminal prosecutions (and vice versa).\n\nIn theory, a criminal defense engagement in the next state over, for example, say, in Gary, Indiana for a prosecutor employed in Chicago, Illinois, would not be a conflict of interest, but it would still be prohibited in most cases because the prosecutor is a full time salaried employee whose full efforts are required to be devote to that position. (In practice, *de minimis* civil transactional work for the assistance of friends and family members, even for a small fee, or representation of such persons in small civil lawsuits would probably be tolerated, however, and maybe even a defense of a civil ordinance violation like a traffic ticket brought by a separate local government as discussed below, for a friend or family member for free, might be tolerated.)\n\nLocal governments such as cities, towns, and counties, however, sometime have an office separate from the DA's office or State Attorney General's office often called a city attorney, town attorney, or county attorney, who works part\\-time on a contract basis for that government and has limited authority to prosecution violations of that local government's own ordinances in the name of that governmental entity, rather than on behalf of the People as part of the state government.\n\nIn those cases, it is generally ethically permissible for the city attorney (for example) to serve as a criminal defense attorney in cases outside that city that do not otherwise pose a conflict of interest from having been adverse to various criminal defendants in the city attorney role. But there might be a conflict of interest, if, for example, there was a joint task force of the city attorney, the local DA, and the federal assistant U.S. attorney to prosecute people in a coordinated fashion on federal, state and local charges of various kinds, in connection with a rash of gun violence. And, if one of the city attorney's clients were arrested for an ordinance violation in the city, a non\\-conflicted counsel would have to be retained by the city for that case.\n\nOften, in those cases, however, even though it is not a prohibited conflict of interest, the lawyers involved would view a criminal defense representation as a \"business development conflict\" that would risk non\\-renewal of the city/town/county attorney position if undertaken.\n\nIncidentally, government attorneys, unlike almost all other government employees, are usually employees at will, as a matter of legal professional ethics, unlike almost all other fixed term contract or civil service employees, even if they have other contractual or civil service employee rights.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A full-time prosecutor in the Chicago District Attorney's office is approached by a close friend seeking pro bono representation for a misdemeanor charge in Gary, Indiana.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that \"Most prosecuting attorney positions in a District Attorney, or State Attorney General's office are full time salaries positions that prohibit individuals holding those positions from having any other legal employment.\" Even though the case is in a different state (Gary, Indiana vs. Chicago, Illinois), which might initially seem to avoid a conflict of interest, the prosecutor's full-time status prevents them from taking on any other legal work, even if it's pro bono.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the full-time employment restriction.

The U.S., like all other countries, is fully sovereign in executing its laws over its territories (land, air, space, aircrafts, ships etc.) regardless of the legal fiction of passing through the customs and border controls, subject to its laws and international treaties it has agreed to and ratified.\n\nEven in a country with exit control or separate areas for international departure, its law still fully applies after exit control or at the departure area, but certain legal provisions may not apply in a certain area for certain purposes (customs, taxation, VAT, etc.), **only because that country's law says so**.\n\nFor example, with respect to criminal offences, the Tokyo Convention limits (and extends) the exercise of criminal jurisdiction over an aircraft in flight:\n\n> *Art. 1, para. 3* For the purposes of this Convention, an aircraft is considered to be in flight\n> **from the moment when power is applied for the purpose of take\\-off** until the moment\n> when the landing run ends.\n\n> *Art. 4* A Contracting State which is not the State of registration may not **interfere with an\n> aircraft in flight in order to exercise its criminal jurisdiction** over an offence\n> committed on board except in the following cases:\n> \n> \n> * (a) the offence has effect on the territory of such State;\n> * (b) the offence has been committed by or against a national or permanent resident of such State;\n> * (c) the offence is against the security of such State;\n> * (d) the offence consists of a breach of any rules or regulations relating to the flight or manoeuvre of aircraft in force in such\n> State;\n> * (e) the exercise of jurisdiction is necessary to ensure the observance of any obligation of such State under a multilateral\n> international agreement.\n\nhowever, Art. 4 is a limitation of the manner of exercising a State's criminal jurisdiction over foreign vessels (you cannot interfere with operation of international flights except in limited circumstances); it does not abrogate the claimed jurisdiction itself, nor does it limit the State's authority of aircrafts registered under its laws:\n\n> *Art. 3, para. 3\\.* This Convention does not exclude any criminal jurisdiction exercised in\n> accordance with national law.\n\nThe United States (the federal government) claims a [special aircraft jurisdiction](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-1405-special-aircraft-jurisdiction-us) as well as a special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States in regard to [various offences](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/46506) (e.g. offences against aircrafts, murder, certain sex offences etc.).

The correct answer is D because issuing any kind of degrees, even if marked as fictional, could potentially be interpreted as fraud or misrepresentation of educational credentials.\n\nOption A is likely permissible, as the documentation suggests there are no specific restrictions on using \"university\" in a URL for a clearly fictional institution. Option B is also likely acceptable, as creating fictional content for entertainment or artistic purposes is generally protected. Option C, allowing free registration for fictional courses, is probably fine as long as it's clearly communicated as part of the fictional universe.\n\nHowever, option D crosses a line by creating documents that could be misconstrued as actual educational credentials, even if marked as fictional. This action has the highest potential for legal issues, as it could be seen as diluting the value of real degrees or enabling fraud if someone were to misuse these \"fictional degrees.\" The top answer in the documentation warns about \"giving away degrees,\" suggesting this could lead to legal trouble.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (legal restrictions, potential for fraud, limits of fictional representation) and apply them to a nuanced scenario, requiring critical thinking beyond simple recall of the documentation."}, "58": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5725/model-release-forms", "docs_id": 5725, "title": "Model Release forms", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I found a model release form:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id\\=1LkkT\\_XwXwnnzwOxtGAirvVvVXzbU2YVUQeZ0kiqbGmQ](https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1LkkT_XwXwnnzwOxtGAirvVvVXzbU2YVUQeZ0kiqbGmQ)\n\nI was wondering how binding this form is, and how necessary including the address is.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As with all contracts, ***how*** binding depends on ***all the facts and circumstances*** relevant to any challenges to it's validity.

Still, we will have to wait to see what the courts rule, if it goes that far. We should start with [Terry v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/392/1/), 392 U.S. 1, which found that\n\n> in justifying the particular intrusion, the police officer must be\n>  able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together\n>  with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that\n>  intrusion. The scheme of the Fourth Amendment becomes meaningful only\n>  when it is assured that, at some point, the conduct of those charged\n>  with enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral\n>  scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate the reasonableness of a\n>  particular search or seizure in light of the particular circumstances.\n>  And, in making that assessment, it is imperative that the facts be\n>  judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the\n>  officer at the moment of the seizure or the search \"warrant a man of\n>  reasonable caution in the belief\" that the action taken was\n>  appropriate?\n\nThe Montana officer did \"articulate\" a reason, in saying \"Ma\u2019am, the reason I asked you for your ID is because I came in here and I saw that you guys are speaking Spanish, which is very unheard of up here\". In articulating an excuse, the officer has not passed the test of providing \"rational inferences from those facts\". Of course, the law also does not require an officer to explain his reasoning to the suspect. In *Terry*, the officer\n\n> had never seen the two men before, and he was unable to say\n>  precisely what first drew his eye to them. However, he testified that\n>  he had been a policeman for 39 years and a detective for 35, and that\n>  he had been assigned to patrol this vicinity of downtown Cleveland for\n>  shoplifters and pickpockets for 30 years. He explained that he had\n>  developed routine habits of observation over the years, and that he\n>  would \"stand and watch people or walk and watch people at many\n>  intervals of the day.\" He added: \"Now, in this case, when I looked\n>  over, they didn't look right to me at the time.\"\n\nThe reasoning in these cases is quite parallel: an appeal to a subjectively felt unusualness of a circumstance. There may be a factual dispute over how often Spanish (or Nakhota) is spoken in public in Havre, but we may assume that Spanish is spoken much less often than English. Still, a well\\-grounded belief that a person speaks Spanish (let us stipulate that it is fluent) is not at all evidence that a person has committed a crime. The inference is no more rational than McFadden's inference from \"I don't know you\" to \"You must be a criminal\". \n\nSee [US v. Brignoni\\-Ponce](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/422/873/), 422 U.S. 873, which held that\n\n> an officer whose observations lead him reasonably to suspect that a\n>  particular vehicle may contain aliens who are illegally in the country\n>  may stop the car briefly, question the driver and passengers about\n>  their citizenship and immigration status, and ask them to explain\n>  suspicious circumstances...

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The case of US v. Brignoni-Ponce established that the Fourth Amendment forbids stopping persons for questioning about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they may be aliens. \n\n2. The court has refused to find that Mexican ancestry alone supported such a \"founded suspicion.\" By extension, speaking Spanish (which is not even definitive proof of ancestry) cannot alone constitute reasonable suspicion.\n\n3. US v. Manzo Jurado, which specifically occurred in Havre, MT, further reinforced that the inability to speak English and proximity to the border, combined with unsuspicious behavior, do not constitute reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the country.\n\n4. Terry v. Ohio requires that an officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant an intrusion. Simply hearing Spanish spoken does not meet this standard.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the rarity of Spanish in an area does not make speaking it suspicious of illegal activity. Option C is incorrect because while Border Patrol does have broader authority near borders, it does not override the need for reasonable suspicion.

It is my right to have prior knowledge about the all the fees if I have a $400 withdrawal fees right?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When you have a contract, such as a lease, the party making the offer has to provide all of the terms, so that you can decide if you accept the offer or not. That does impose on you an obligation to read the paperwork and any materials referenced by the lease. When you have accepted the offer (especially after you have handed over money as a deposit), they cannot unilaterally change the offer. Signing the lease is legal proof that you have accepted the contract, but your prior conduct (giving them money) is also proof of acceptance.\n\nThey are free to politely (or impolitely) *ask* you to pay them extra money, so you just have to bear in mind that you have no legal obligation to comply with their wish. On the remote chance that you missed something, you could ask there where in the agreement this extra charge is specified.\nIt is entirely legal to decline their request and to insist on compliance with the original contract terms. You can read [this document](https://proxy.lsnj.org/rcenter/GetPublicDocument/Sites/LAW/Documents/Publications/Manuals/TenantsRights.pdf) on NJ landlord\\-tenant law.

The tenant wants to withdraw their application but is told they'll lose their $400 security deposit. Which of the following best describes the legal situation and the tenant's options?\n\nA) The landlord can legally charge the $500 fee and keep the deposit, as verbal agreements during tours are not binding.\nB) The tenant can withdraw without penalty, as the $500 fee represents a unilateral change to the contract terms after acceptance.\nC) The tenant must pay the $500 fee but can recover the $400 deposit, as it wasn't explicitly tied to the new fee in the application.\nD) The landlord must return the $400 deposit but can still legally require the $500 fee for a short-term lease.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This situation involves several key legal concepts related to contract law and tenant rights in New Jersey. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. Contract formation: The initial agreement between the tenant and landlord was established when the application was submitted and the security deposit was paid. This represents an offer and acceptance of the original terms.\n\n2. Material changes: The introduction of a $500 short-term lease fee after the initial agreement represents a unilateral and material change to the contract terms. In contract law, one party cannot unilaterally modify the terms of an agreement after it has been accepted.\n\n3. Disclosure requirements: Landlords are required to disclose all fees and terms upfront, allowing tenants to make informed decisions. The failure to mention the $500 fee in any of the preliminary materials (tour, database, application) violates this principle.\n\n4. Right to withdraw: Given that the landlord attempted to introduce a significant new term ($500 fee) that wasn't part of the original agreement, the tenant has the right to withdraw from the contract without penalty. This is because they're not agreeing to the new terms, but rather enforcing the original agreement.\n\n5. Security deposit: The $400 security deposit was given under the terms of the original agreement. Since the tenant is withdrawing due to the landlord's attempt to change the terms, rather than breaching the original contract, they should be entitled to a full refund of the deposit.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple legal concepts, including contract formation, material changes to agreements, disclosure requirements in leasing, and tenant rights.

Which of the following outcomes is most likely, based on the exclusionary rule and its exceptions?\n\nA) All evidence, including the victims' testimony, will be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.\nB) Only the police officer's testimony will be admissible, while the victims' testimony and physical evidence will be suppressed.\nC) The victims' testimony will be admissible, but the police officer's testimony and all physical evidence will be suppressed.\nD) The victims' testimony and any subsequently discovered physical evidence will be admissible, but the police officer's initial observations will be suppressed.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts, including the exclusionary rule and its exceptions. The correct answer is D because it accurately reflects the interplay between the exclusionary rule and the independent source and attenuation doctrines.\n\nThe exclusionary rule would typically suppress evidence obtained through an illegal search. However, the victims' testimony is considered an independent source, separate from the illegal search. Their testimony would be admissible because it's not directly tainted by the officer's illegal action.\n\nFurthermore, the victims' testimony would allow for the independent discovery of physical evidence in the property. This means that any physical evidence corroborating their claims would likely be admissible, even if it was initially discovered during the illegal search.\n\nThe police officer's initial observations from the illegal search would still be suppressed, as they directly result from the Fourth Amendment violation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it fails to account for the independent source doctrine. Option B misunderstands the application of the exclusionary rule, incorrectly allowing the officer's testimony while suppressing independent evidence.

Governments are often required to, sometimes by their own rules, but this is to protect against corruption and cronyism, rather than an absolute. For example, there is not a public posting for, say, US Supreme Court Justices or Cabinet Secretaries.\n\nLarger corporations, especially publicly traded ones, often adopt similar rules, to protect the company and shareholders from internal corruption (e.g. a manager hiring a friend to a position that they are not qualified for, or receiving a kickback bribe for their hiring decision), but they are not required to unless a specific law or program they are enrolled into requires them to do so. For example, some Federal Contractors are required to post their positions publicly, as a condition of their contracts.\n\nSo, in summary, there is no reason why a business cannot arbitrarily hire a homeless person specifically for being homeless, unless a) homelessness becomes a legally protected category, or b) a specific rule or government contract provision requires public posting of open positions.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner wants to create a job program specifically targeting homeless individuals in their community.

One need not worry about it until the papers are served, but it might be wise to read the legal ads in any nearby large newspapers for a few weeks, in case of service by publication.

There may well be a docket no or case no or some other identifying umber, as well. This will help in verification.

If the defendant has left any property or assets in the country, the plaintiff may be able to get a court order to seize and sell these assets to satisfy the judgment.\n\nOption D is not viable because the State Department typically does not revoke passports for civil judgments, and this would likely be beyond the scope of what a plaintiff can request in a civil case.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze a complex legal situation, understand the limitations of legal remedies, and identify the most practical course of action given the constraints of the scenario.

This will be a hypothetical example. \n\nHypothetically, if a 19 year old male (living overseas, say in Turkey) sexts/exchanges nudes with a female who says she is 18 (living in the US) and then it turns out that she lied about her age and she's 16 or 15, for example, and 2 years later her parents discover about this sexting and decide to take legal action against the person living overseas, what could be done?

But I still would like the opinion of people well\\-versed in law please. Assume it happened on a fake Facebook account or the Kik app for instance. \n\nAs you know, there's a lot of scams like this but my question assumes that the situation isn't a scam.

I talked him out of hanging himself recently and told him that nothing is going to happen and he should breathe easy. But he's genuinely afraid and keeps getting paranoid. If you have noticed, I keep posting here about related subjects trying to find answers for this guy. He contacted a lawyer who basically said that the chances he will be prosecuted are slim but not impossible. This even made him more paranoid.

The first is \"guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\" In an entrapment case, the police have recordings or documents claiming that the \"girl\" was underaged. If there is no such smoking gun from the (real) girl, the case (probably) would not be prosecuted in the U.S. He doesn't have to prove that she told him she was 18; \"she\" (or the police) has to prove that she told him she was \"not.\"\n\nThe second factor is \"remoteness\" in time, and distance. Two years after a U.S. state sent me a \"nasty letter,\" I asked my lawyer if the state would ever come after me. He answered, \"If they were going to do this, you would have heard further by now.\" The other factor, distance and cross border, (three countries: Turkey, the U.S., his home country) further militates against prosecution except for highly aggravating circumstances such as drug dealing, gambling, or sex for pay. \n\nA third factor is that your friend would not come close to qualifying as a \"serious offender.\" This would be someone like a drug dealer, or the head of a \"call girl\" ring. The cops concentrate their effects on big \"busts\" like this that make their careers, not \"small fry\" like your friend. But of course they use the publicity from the big catches to scare everyone else.\n\nWhile there is no \"guarantee\" against \"the worst possible consequences,\" the chances of them happening are similar to his getting hit by lightening, and less than his chances of being hit by a car crossing the street.

The husband earns 150K before tax, has no saving, no properties and won't take anything from the 2 houses. \n\nThe wife doesn't want any alimony but only child support. The 2 kids are to stay with mom. What would be a fair amount for child support?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are statutory guidelines that are based upon the gross income of each parent, the number of children, the extraordinary expenses of the children, and number of nights a child spends with each parent, which are adopted by states in order for the states to be eligible for federal welfare programs; although standards vary somewhat. Income can be imputed if a party has an ability to earn income but does not exercise it. But, assets owned aren't considered unless they produce or could produce income.\n\nIn the absence of a showing of unfitness sufficient to terminate the parental rights of a parent for abuse or neglect, or some extremely unique circumstance (e.g., one parent is on the space station 365 days a year), no parent ever has 100% of the nights with the children.\n\nWithout having a more realistic estimate of the number of nights with each child, and a fair guess of the capacity of mom to earn income including income from stock trades, it isn't possible to make a realistic estimate.\n\nTo get the correct estimate, you would need to do a full fledged child support guidelines calculation, but this question doesn't have enough information to do that. A good rule of thumb is that child support for two children is typically about 25% of the difference in income of the couple times the number of days that one parent has a child more than the the parent, divided by the number of days in the year. \n\nFor a pretty typical parenting time division, that would work out to about 10% of the difference in income between the parties paid by the higher income party to the less high income party within a normal range. But this is strictly a rule of thumb.\n\nHowever, in a case like the one you describe, the rental value of one of the houses would probably be imputed as income to the wife, as would the profits she makes in an average year from stock trades. The rental value of a $1\\.25 million house is probably about $72,000 a year. It is hard to value stock trades which depend upon the size of the portfolio and the skill of the trader. \n\nIf the stock trades generated $28,000 of income a year and the wife has the kids 5 nights a week, and there were no extraordinary expenses, child support might typically be on the order of $416 a month. If wife made $78,000 from stock trades, child support would be nominal (they would have equal incomes, but she would have a few more days a year).\n\nBut, that involves some very specific assumptions.\n\nAlso, in situations like this one where the facts are so extraordinary relative to a typical divorced couple and the family is very affluent on a combined basis, the judge has wide discretion to deviate from the guidelines on a case by case basis. In reality, no case like this has a clear fair or typical resolution and it would depend a great deal upon how the case was argued and how the facts were developed by the parties and their counsel.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A couple is going through a divorce with unique financial circumstances.

The correct answer is B because the documentation states that \"the rental value of one of the houses would probably be imputed as income to the wife, as would the profits she makes in an average year from stock trades.\" This reflects the principle that while assets themselves are not directly considered in child support calculations, the income they generate (or could generate) is relevant.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it ignores the potential income from the wife's assets and stock trading, which would be considered in a realistic scenario. Option C is a misconception based on the \"rule of thumb\" mentioned in the documentation, but it oversimplifies the calculation and ignores critical factors like the wife's imputed income and the actual parenting time arrangement.

Does \"social networking\" include maintaining your own blog, or are they only referring to your activities on Facebook and similar \"social\" media where you obviously are *not* the controller (the controller is who owns and runs the platform)?\n\nA key question, partly arising from a lengthy discussion thread under the answer by @Greendrake in this [related question](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/28070/957), is whether this means that\na publicly accessible, personal blog is *excluded* from the scope of the GDPR?\n\nTo answer this question, one need to consider that the GDPR [Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) definition 1 says that:\n\n> \u2018personal data\u2019 means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (\u2018data subject\u2019); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person;\n\nWe know from EU case law that this also includes *IP\\-addresses*, since such online identifiers *indirectly* makes people who is visiting such a publicly available personal blog *identifiable*.\n\nAlso, note that the *scope* of the GDPR is *processing* of personal data. This is defined in GDPR [Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) defintion 2:\n\n> \u2018processing\u2019 means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction;\n\nSome critics of the GDPR have objected that such a definition of \u2018processing\u2019 is *over\\-reaching*. However, it being over\\-reaching does not mean that we should ignore it.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to link to two seminal cases heard by the ECJ:\n\n* [C\\-101/01](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=48382&pageIndex=0&doclang=en&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=322419)\n* [C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=160561&pageIndex=0&doclang=EN&mode=lst&dir=&occ=first&part=1&cid=322511)\n\nCentral to both cases was the question of whether the processing activities of an individual was covered by personal use exemption under article 3(2\\) of Directive 95/46\\. In both these cases, the ECJ took an extremely restrictive view, and concluded that the personal use exemption did *not* apply to the processing done by these individuals.\n\nThe questions is: Is it *possible* for a publicly accessible, personal blog to make use of the personal use exception of the GDPR to avoid having to comply with the regulation? If \"yes\": What need to be considered by its owner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that one cannot answer a question such as \"Will the personal use exception in the GDPR apply to personal blogs?\", because it is unclear if you refer to:\n\n1. personal information published on the blog pages\n2. personal information collected from the Website, by way of forms, cookies, server logs, strictly collected and processed for the purpose of operating the Website for your own personal purposes as a blogger (by yourself of through a subcontractor in the sense of GDPR)\n3. and not personal information collected from the Website's operation, transferred or provided to third parties for their own purposes (this would include cookies used to identify and track users across multiple domains)\n\n**Regarding 1\\.**, a personal blog wanting to benefit from the exemption should not publish third party's personal information without their consent or another legal basis, and [C\\-101/01](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-101/01) certainly applies here.\n\n**About 2\\.**, if the information is strictly collected and used for the own personal purpose of the operation of the blog, I would tend to agree that it should benefit from the exemption. I feel that [C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-212/13) would not necessarily be an indication that because the blog is publicly accessible it is then \"directed outwards from the private setting\" in the sense of this ruling, and should not be considered as \"purely \u2018personal or household\u2019 activity\".\n\n[C\\-212/13](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-212/13) case was relating to a camera installed by an individual on his family home for its own security purposes which was also monitoring a public space. The persons filmed on this public space had absolutely no direct connexion with the person collecting their images. In case of a blog, the visitors of the blog interact with the blog for fulfilling the own personal purpose of the operation of the blog of the publisher of the blog.\n\nAnother argument is given by the [Recital 18](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/) which you quote: a personal blog can be viewed as a type of social networking or related online activity.\n\nFinally, **about 3\\.**, there is no doubt for me that, in this case, the publisher of the blog is engaged in an activity which is not personal, since it willingly provides personal information to third parties which they use for their own purposes (and not as subcontractors in the sense of GDPR).\n\nThere may be other approaches apart from these 3, but that's a start for your considerations.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A freelance journalist maintains a personal blog where they publish articles about local events and occasionally mention individuals they've interviewed.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the blog's status under the GDPR's personal use exemption?\n\nA) The blog is fully exempt from GDPR compliance as it's a personal activity\nB) The blog is partially exempt, but must comply with GDPR for the comment section only\nC) The blog likely falls outside the personal use exemption and must fully comply with GDPR\nD) The blog is exempt as long as it doesn't process data for commercial purposes\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple GDPR concepts and their application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The blog likely falls outside the personal use exemption due to several factors:\n   - It's publicly accessible, which aligns with the ECJ's restrictive interpretation of the exemption in cases C-101/01 and C-212/13.\n   - It processes personal data of third parties (interviewees and visitors) without being limited to a purely personal or household context.\n   - The use of analytics involves processing IP addresses, which are considered personal data under GDPR Article 4.\n\n2. While Recital 18 mentions social networking as a possible exempt activity, a publicly accessible blog used for journalistic purposes goes beyond typical personal social networking.\n\n3. The processing isn't limited to purely personal use, as it involves publishing information about others and collecting visitor data.\n\n4. The presence of a comment section further complicates the situation, as the blogger becomes a controller for this user-generated content.\n\n5. Even without direct commercial purpose, the blog's nature as a platform for journalistic content pushes it beyond the narrow scope of the personal use exemption.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the blog's activities extend beyond purely personal use. Option B oversimplifies the GDPR's application, as all aspects of the blog involve personal data processing. Option D is a common misconception; the absence of commercial purpose alone doesn't guarantee exemption if other factors push the activity beyond personal use.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple GDPR concepts, apply them to a complex scenario, and understand the nuanced interpretation required for the personal use exemption."}, "80": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13188/penalties-for-speeding-on-private-roads", "docs_id": 13188, "title": "Penalties for speeding on private roads", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Washington State, a private road is just that: a road on private property, as opposed to a road on a public right\\-of way.

However, if you speed on my uncle's farm, that's just trespassing because that isn't one of the specified community types.

When I clicked on it, I saw my name in a school blog post.\n\n> John Doe's remarkable feat in Blah Blah Invention Competition\n> \n> \n> John Doe, Class of 2000 has won an honorable mention in ...\n\nI was so surprised that they heard the news in the first place, considering the fact that I cut off all contact with the school admin and peers after I became an adult. I didn't want my name on that page, especially given the fact that some alumni have started to come out about what they suffered in school in recent years. Can I prevent them from using the fact that I graduated their school on their website by citing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act(FERPA) or others? Or is this fair game per first amendment grounds and am I out of luck?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The privacy rule is spelled out [here](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-34/subtitle-A/part-99). Subpart D addresses disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, saying when consent is required vs. not required (there being 16 conditions under which consent is not required). Mostly this refers to \"required by law\" exceptions, or \"for school\\-internal use\", but also includes \"directory information\". Information may be disclosed if the student (as an adult) or a parent (of a minor) has consented to disclosure.\n\nUnder the legal definition of \"record\", that simply means \"tangible information\" (not \"conversations\"). An education record is one that is \"directly related to a student; and maintained by an educational agency or institution or by a party acting for the agency or institution\", possibly including the information that you cite \u2013 providing that the information is maintained and disclosed by the school. In addition, though, certain information can be freely disclosed, namely \"directory information\" which is:\n\n> Directory information includes, but is not limited to, the student's\n> name; address; telephone listing; electronic mail address; photograph;\n> date and place of birth; major field of study; grade level; enrollment\n> status (e.g., undergraduate or graduate, full\\-time or part\\-time);\n> dates of attendance; participation in officially recognized activities\n> and sports; weight and height of members of athletic teams; degrees,\n> honors, and awards received; and the most recent educational agency or\n> institution attended.\n\nThe regulation explains that this is information that \"would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed\". Privacy standards have changed since the law was passed \u2013 but it is allowed by the existing law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A private high school has published a blog post celebrating an alumnus's recent achievement in an invention competition, including the alumnus's name and graduation year.

According to the documentation, certain information can be freely disclosed by educational institutions as \"directory information.\" This includes \"the student's name; ... degrees, honors, and awards received; and the most recent educational agency or institution attended.\" The blog post mentioning the alumnus's name, graduation year, and recent achievement falls within this category of directory information. \n\nFERPA explicitly states that such information \"would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.\" While the alumnus may have personal reasons for wanting to disassociate from the school, legally, the school is within its rights to publish this type of information without obtaining specific consent.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the school is not in clear violation of FERPA; the information falls under allowed disclosures. Option C is incorrect because the First Amendment right to disassociation does not apply in this context and doesn't override FERPA regulations for schools. Option D is too restrictive; FERPA does allow disclosure of certain information without explicit consent.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the FERPA regulations, application to a real-world scenario, and understanding of the nuances between protected educational records and allowable directory information disclosures."}, "87": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50981/does-youtube-legally-need-proactive-takedown", "docs_id": 50981, "title": "Does YouTube legally need proactive takedown?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: YouTube needs to figure out what to do about people posting copyright material. The actual solution they arrived at, after some negotiation with the media companies, includes programs that scan uploaded content and proactively block material that matches a copyright database. (Inevitably these programs sometimes get it wrong, which is a problem.)\n\nA friend of mine has claimed they are not actually required to do this. That US safe harbor law only requires them to take down copyright material after it has been brought to their attention. That they could stop using the proactive programs completely, and just replace them with a call center to take and act on copyright infringement notices.\n\nI'm not sure about that; it seems to me that Napster is case law to the contrary, and anyway Google employs a bunch of expensive lawyers who wouldn't have advised them they needed a negotiated solution unless they really did.\n\nWhich of us is right? Could YouTube really revert to a purely reactive system, or could the media companies sue them if they didn't continue the proactive takedown measures?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under the DMCA(United States Federal Law: Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and its Safe Harbor provisions, yes, Youtube is protected from copyright claims, provided they comply when they receive a notice. *But*....the DMCA that gives Youtube (and its parent company Google/Alphabet) this shield is US law, but Youtube does large amounts of business in other countries, making it liable in those countries, which don't necessarily have the same protections. Case\\-in\\-point, the EU.\n\nUnder some other nation's law, Youtube may be liable for infringement if they wait to be notified. Alternatively, part of the agreement that was being hammered out between Youtube and the content companies might very well be some sort of indemnity agreement, that protects Youtube from the content companies so long as they uphold their end of the agreement.\n\nAdditionally, even if Youtube isn't liable for the copyright infringement itself, since they serve ads on such videos, they could conceivably be sued under the theory of \"unjust enrichment\". (Similar to the logic that the EU is currently trying to get Google to pay their \"link tax\" for Google News on).\n\nThere are also non\\-legal considerations to consider:\n\n* Benefit to Self: Youtube is now selling/renting copyrighted content such as movies and TV shows as well. By becoming a distributor, it's in their interest to not also allow free versions of what they are selling on their platform.\n* Cost\\-to\\-implement: As Ron Beyer points out, a call center/email center/mail room to receive the DMCA notices would be an enormous cost. What's more, it's a continuous, recurring and likely\\-growing cost. Youtube/Google is also not short on software engineers. It's much cheaper to pull some devs off of their current project for a couple days, implement a solution and call it a day, with occasional maintenance, especially as they are going to be paying those engineers' salaries anyway.\n* Business Relationships: Youtube/Google make most of their money from advertising (and off of user data, but that is often tied to advertising in the other direction). The content companies are often their customers. Angering your customers is generally not a good idea.\n* Ultimate Desires/Future View:Youtube doesn't care about the lost content. They don't care about the fight. If the copyrighted material is blocked, their users are far more likely to find something else than leave the site; if the material is blocked before uploading, most users won't even realize it was ever there.

Any of you who are no longer working for the school are no longer bound by FERPA.\n\n**Step Two: Is your information an \"educational record\"?**\n\nFERPA links federal funding to policies governing the the release of \"educational records,\" which are defined in the other answer.\n\nThe information the other TAs would give you does not sound like it would not be an educational record, as it is an oral account of their memory, not a record maintained by the educational institution. But if TAs normally maintain a record of the kinds of interactions we're talking about, and they consulted those records to answer your question, the answer might be different.\n\nIt's less clear whether the statement you're talking about providing would be an educational record. If neither you nor the university \"maintain\" the record, then it doesn't sound like it would fall within the language of the rule.

So unless you are a school policymaker, *you* cannot violate FERPA. Of course, the school probably has nondisclosure agreements or other policies in place to ensure that educational records are not released improperly. You need to also consult those rules to determine your obligations.\n* FERPA is very poorly enforced by the federal government. At least as of the last time I looked at this question, no school had ever lost any funding due to a FERPA violation.

The correct answer, C, is the most legally sound approach based on the information provided.\n\nOption A is incorrect because directly publishing information about a student's academic record could violate FERPA if the TA is still employed by the university and the information is considered an \"educational record.\"\n\nOption B is problematic because it involves asking current TAs, who may still be bound by FERPA, to disclose information about a student. This could potentially violate FERPA or university policies.\n\nOption D, while seemingly cautious, is not the best approach. The university's legal department is likely to be conservative in interpreting FERPA and may not grant permission to release the information.\n\nOption C is the most appropriate because it navigates the FERPA constraints creatively. By having a non-university entity draft and maintain the document, it potentially avoids being classified as an \"educational record\" maintained by the educational institution. The TA signing it without keeping a copy further reinforces this separation. This approach addresses the key points in the documentation:\n\n1.

Fees and Costs 22A \u00a7 3-4, which explicitly states that for violations of Title 39 (traffic violations), the court has discretion to impose costs \"up to but not exceeding $33.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the judge's discretion is not unlimited but capped at $33. This option represents a common misconception that judges have unlimited power to penalize those who contest charges.\n\nOption B is a distractor that plays on the fear of additional penalties for contesting charges, but there's no provision in the statute for automatically doubling costs.\n\nOption C correctly reflects the statute's language, applying to all traffic violations under Title 39, not just speeding.\n\nOption D is incorrect as it suggests that costs are determined solely at the municipal level, when in fact they are governed by state law. This option might be attractive to those who assume traffic court procedures are entirely local matters.\n\nThis question requires integration of legal knowledge, critical thinking about judicial discretion, and application to a real-world scenario of contesting a traffic ticket, targeting higher cognitive levels of analysis and application."}, "93": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35670/if-internet-businesses-need-city-business-licenses", "docs_id": 35670, "title": "If Internet Businesses need City Business Licenses", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Say you have registered a cloud technology business with the state you live in to obtain your Business Entity Number, and you have also obtained your EIN tax number. It seems that the next step is to obtain a Business License in the city you are living in. But I can't tell if that's actually necessary, since the cloud is inherently everywhere. For example:\n\n> If you are planning on starting a business located in the City of Foo or conducting business within the City's limits, you must first complete a business license application.\n\nThis makes sense if you have a storefront or building where customers come within the city. But I am not sure about if you have an internet business. Since internet businesses are potentially mobile, the idea of \"doing business\" is unclear. The actual doing of business, where a transaction occurs (i.e. a customer buys something) likely occurs in the cloud, in some remote Amazon server perhaps. You might do some administrative work at a coffee shop here or there, etc. So I'm wondering if you need to obtain a *city* business tax license at all, or if so, in which cities the license must be obtained. I don't imagine you would need a license in every city you would sell to, as that would be a lot of work. At the same time, you could be a traveling entrepreneur living in a motor home traveling all across the states. Wondering if in that case, too, you would need to register in each city. \n\nBut for the more simple case, of just working from coffee shops or coworking spaces within a single city (or within a few nearby cities), wondering what the consensus is on if you need to obtain a *city* business tax license, or what exactly you need to obtain other than the state entity ID.\n\nFor clarification, let's say the business does one or all of the following:\n\n1. Sells physical goods online.\n2. Sells cloud goods (like data storage space, or compute power).\n3. Has a subscription service for digital products in the cloud.\n4. Does research.\n\nBusiness A does 1, 2, and 3\\. Business B does only 2 and 3\\. Business C does only 4\\. That is, it doesn't sell any products, just does internal research.\n\nIn all cases, there won't be any customers visiting any place physically.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For business A, the place where the person sits who transmits the orders to ship the goods to the customer, the place where the person sits who transmits the orders to authorize customers to access their newly purchased cloud goods, and the place where the person sits who authorizes customer subscriptions are all places where A does business. If any of these are done by an automated script, then the place where the person sits who starts and stops that script, and potentially troubleshoots it, is a place where it does business. \n\nFor D, if it does not sell any of this research, then it does not do business. if it does, then the place where the person (or people) who do the research do it is a place where it does business, and so also is the place where the person sits who takes orders for the research, or runs the script which does this. \n\nIf any of these are multiple variable places, such as cofeeshops with wifi, but they are all within the city Foo, then the company does business within Foo. The Foo City Clerk can probably say how the form should be filled out in such a case.\n\nThis is assuming that Foo has an ordinance requiring a Business License, not all localities have such a requirement. Or the requirement may differ depending on the type of business, all this varies widely depending on the location/jurisdiction.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that business is done \"where a human does it, not in the cloud, even if the human uses cloud tools to do business.\" This principle applies to the engineer's primary work location in City X.\n\n2. The answer acknowledges that the startup is \"doing business\" in City X, where the engineer primarily works from coworking spaces.

Basically, the test is whether a prior acquittal would be inconsistent with a new criminal charge.\n\nFor example, even though there is an additional element of the crime of murdering a postal officer to the crime of murdering someone on federal property, double jeopardy would probably bar a retrial of a murder on federal property case simply because the victim happened to be a postal worker and that element wasn't charged in the original indictment. This is because the acquittal of the first murder charge would almost always imply a jury determination that a murder didn't take place which would be inconsistent with a murder of a postal worker charge.\n\nOn the other hand, a trial on a murder charge would probably not bar, for example, a trial on a burglary charge (which at common law involved trespassing with an intent to commit a crime), even if the burglary charge arose from the same conduct. This is because an acquittal on a murder charge isn't necessarily inconsistent with the existence of a trespass, or with the intent to commit some crime other than the murder for which the defendant was acquitted.\n\nBut the exact way that the line gets draw is tricky and while what I have described is a good general summary of the cases interpreting the double jeopardy clause, it isn't a perfect one. This issue has been litigated many, many tines over the years, so there are a lot of cases that are squarely on point addressing specific fact patterns in precedents that are binding case law that are not always a perfect fit to the general principles. In these circumstances, the binding case law is going to control, at least until a court with appellate authority over the court whose case established the precedent in question decided to overrule a prior precedent from the lower court, or in the case of U.S. Supreme Court precedents, until the U.S. Supreme Court revisits one of its own prior precedents as wrong decided or wrongly interpreted, which happens now and then, although it is a rare event.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is acquitted of manslaughter for a fatal shooting incident.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Double jeopardy prevents retrial for the same offense or substantially similar offenses. An acquittal for manslaughter would likely bar future charges for other forms of homicide (like first-degree murder) arising from the same incident, ruling out option A.\n\n2. Option B is likely impermissible because aggravated assault would typically be considered a lesser included offense of manslaughter, and the acquittal on manslaughter charges would imply a determination inconsistent with assault charges.\n\n3.

The correct answer is C because it most closely aligns with the protection provided by the 24th Amendment against denying voting rights for \"failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.\"\n\nOption A involves tax evasion through falsification, which goes beyond mere failure to pay and involves fraudulent activity.

It tests critical thinking about the intersection of constitutional rights and criminal justice, rather than simple recall of facts."}}
