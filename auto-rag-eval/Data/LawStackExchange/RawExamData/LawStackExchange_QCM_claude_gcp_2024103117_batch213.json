Others such as [this](https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/) are creative commons.\n\nFrom my understanding, on one hand, you can't \"copyright\" something that is recorded (I read that somewhere). You can't copyright a record of the rainfall statistics, or a collection of phone numbers or addresses in a phone book. I am not sure why exactly, but it sort of makes sense. This data is part of \"nature\", it is \"public\". The same with stuff like fossils. They grew out of nature and so are part of the public. But hmm, maybe if they were found on private property (someones private land), maybe then they would be considered not public, not sure. But it makes sense to me that fossils or records of phone numbers aren't copyrightable because they are public / natural data.\n\nWhich makes me wonder about \"data\". If someone has data in a database *about* natural stuff, like the data at the above fossil sites (images of fossils, or metadata of fossils such as [this](https://paleobiodb.org/classic/basicCollectionSearch?collection_no=56767)), then that is still technically something from nature. That is, it is public information / a public resource. But then maybe not. A website that tracks user behavior, that data is private. But that would make sense because the website is like a business with private access and which they own the transactions. So that just gets me more confused.\n\nAlso, I know photographers stuff is protected under copyright, even though it is of nature. But maybe there is a boundary between \"documentation photos\" and \"creative photos\". This may be why the museums can limit the use of their photos to personal/educational use.\n\nSo to summarize, I'm wondering a few things:\n\n1. If database records (just the metadata part) of natural resources can by copyrighted.\n2. If the *use* of database records (metadata) of natural resources can be limited in scope by a provider (not sure if this is the same thing as copyright).\n3. Same for the images.\n\nBasically just would like to understand better what data can and can't be copyrighted to prevent certain uses.\n\nA related example is digitizing a public domain book. The book *content* is public domain. But if someone hosts a digitized book (that is, an image of the content), I wonder if they can say \"you can only use this for personal use\". Or if they go one step further than just pasting an image online of a public domain work (like archive.org does), and instead post the unicode textual data of the book, if that can be copyrighted (that is, if they can say \"you can only use this for personal use\"). By textual form I mean, more than just a PDF/image of the book, but something you can actually copy\\-paste into a Word document or text editor. So we know the *content* is public domain. Then in the case of archive.org we know the *images* of the content are public domain. Next to know is if the text that was taken out of the image and put into a text document is public domain. The reason is because technically it does require technology/work to create the *artifact* at each step ($10,000 digitizing tools to digitize books at scale, or complicated/private OCR technology for getting the text from the images, or the work of manually entering in the text by looking at the image or book directly).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright protects literary and artistic expression, not facts.\n\nSo, in a database, the structure of the tables, the construction of the queries and the presentation of the user interface are all subject to copyright. The data stored in each record is not subject to copyright if it is a fact but is subject if it is a literary or artistic work. For example, in the IMDb database, the name of a film, the year it was made, the director\u2019s name, the actors\u2019 names etc. are not copyright, however, the star ratings, the reviews, the table structure, the queries and the user interface all are.\n\nFor your fossil example, the fossil, where it was found, who found it, when etc. are all non\\-copyrightable facts. Any photographs of it, drawings of it or scientific writing about it are all copyright because they all involve creative transformation of the fossil.\n\nThat creativity is key.\n\nFor the book, if the scanning is automated and the text is generated by OCR then there is no new copyright.

Option C is correct because:\n\n1. The database structure and user interface involve creative choices in organization and presentation, making them copyrightable.\n2.

So, for example, a minority shareholder could essentially have their stake in a company reduced to zero.\n\nThis just seems like theft to me. What is the legal basis for it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Corporations are creatures of statute. In the U.S., the vast majority of corporations (99\\.9999%) are organized under state or territorial, rather than federal law. Those statutes generally authorize the issuance of new shares for new consideration, although the process by which this is authorized differs from state to state.\n\nThese statutes or case law also usually impose fiduciary duties, or at least some sort of duties, on the board and majority shareholders to minority shareholders. Sometimes this is also called the law of \"majority oppression.\" Some corporate statutes also allow minority to cash out if dilution is alleged.\n\nIssuance of new shares only dilutes existing shareholders when the price of the new shares is less that the per share market capitalization of the old shares. If the price is the same, the value of the existing shares doesn't change. If the price is lower, the new shares dilute existing shares. If the price is higher, the new shares increase the value of existing shares.\n\nA bright line rule is difficult because the value of shares is not self\\-evident and is to some extent a matter of opinion upon which informed people can differ to some extent. So, a blanket prohibition makes no sense and it isn't a good fit for \"theft\". \"Theft\" usually involves an actual taking of property (like a share) not merely a change in its value, which can happen for all sorts of legitimate reasons as well as illegitimate ones.\n\nSince shareholders are usually similarly situated, in an arms\\-length transaction, corporations will not knowingly issue new shares that dilute existing shareholders. Instead, this only happens when there is collusion between controlling shareholders/board members and new share purchasers, something that mostly happens in closely held companies and is where the case law on the duties of boards and majority shareholders arises.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A minority shareholder in a closely held corporation discovers that the board of directors has issued new shares at a price below the current market value, significantly diluting their ownership stake.

While the issuance of new shares at a price below market value can indeed dilute the value of existing shares, it is not automatically illegal or considered theft (ruling out option A). Corporations do have the authority to issue new shares, but this authority is not unlimited and is subject to legal constraints (ruling out option B). Option D is incorrect because while some corporate statutes may allow for minority shareholders to cash out in certain circumstances, this is not a universal provision and typically requires specific conditions to be met.\n\nOption C is correct because it accurately reflects the legal reality in many jurisdictions. The board of directors and majority shareholders often have fiduciary duties to minority shareholders. If the share issuance was done in bad faith or primarily to benefit the controlling shareholders at the expense of minority shareholders, it could be grounds for a lawsuit under theories of breach of fiduciary duty or majority oppression.

If you fire the same person, in the same circumstances, because you've noticed that they were late to work by 10 minutes every day this month but recorded their hours as if they came on time, you've acted legally.\n\nIf you shoot someone in bear suit hovering over your toddler in your backyard at twilight believing it is a bear, you haven't committed a crime. If you realize that the person in the bear suit is your husband playing a prank and shoot anyway, you are guilty of aggravated assault or attempted murder if he lives, and murder if he doesn't.\n\nIf you buy a $200 refrigerator thinking that it's a bankruptcy fire sale price, you are not guilty of anything. But, if you know that the refrigerator was stolen because you hear the store owner talking about it in the back room, you are committing the crime of trafficking in stolen goods if you buy it.\n\nIf you record a song because it just comes to you when you've never heard it before, you haven't infringed a copyright. But if you've heard it (at least if you remember it) and then record it, you've infringed the copyright in the song (assuming you don't get permission to do so and the copyright is still valid, etc.).\n\nWhat a person committing an act is thinking is part of what must be proven in court for someone to be guilty or liable in the case of all but a small minority of crimes and torts (i.e. civil wrongs which can be the basis of a lawsuit). Often, the element that involves what you are thinking as one part of a case that must be established in court is described with the latin phrase *[mens rea](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mens_rea)* (which translates literally as \"guilty mind\").\n\nConversely, sometimes thoughts are not crimes or torts unless there are actions taken in connection with the thoughts.\n\nIf you carefully plan out a murder, but take no concrete actions to carry out your plan, you haven't committed a crime or tort. But, if you have planned out a murder and take significant affirmative acts to carry it out, you've committed attempted murder, even if those acts might not have constituted attempted murder if you took those actions for purposes unrelated to a plan to commit a murder.\n\nSimilarly, if you imagine a seven year old having sex with you in your head, you haven't committed a crime (although if you are a sex offender, doing so might prevent you from receiving parole), but if you download or make a video depicting that act, you've committed a crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States legal system, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between thoughts and criminal liability?\n\nA) Thoughts alone, no matter how violent or illegal, can never be the basis for criminal prosecution.\n\nB) Certain thoughts are inherently illegal and can be prosecuted even without any accompanying actions.\n\nC) The legality of an action is solely determined by its physical manifestation, regardless of the actor's mental state.\n\nD) While thoughts alone are not illegal, the mental state (mens rea) of an individual can be a crucial factor in determining whether an action constitutes a crime.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because it accurately reflects the legal principle of mens rea (guilty mind) in the US legal system.

The passage provides several examples where the same physical action could be legal or illegal depending on the actor's mental state, such as firing an employee or shooting someone in a bear suit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while thoughts alone are generally not prosecutable, the mental state during an action is often relevant to criminal liability.\n\nOption B is incorrect as the passage explicitly states there are no \"illegal thoughts\" in the abstract.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it disregards the importance of mental state in determining criminality, which is a key point made in the passage."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/18672/does-shall-in-a-contract-preclude-the-other-party-from-performing-a-task", "docs_id": 18672, "title": "Does &quot;shall&quot; in a contract preclude the other party from performing a task?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I have a firm named Blue.

One possible reading is that \"for repairs to the property motorcycles\" has an implied meaning \"for repairs to all of the property motorcycles of Blue\" and the other is that it has an implied mean \"for repairs to all of the property motorcycles of Blue that it directs us to do work upon.\"\n\nMy first step to resolve that ambiguity would be to look at the definition of \"property motorcycles\" in the contract, and also to any other terms of the contract that would suggest that it is an \"exclusive\" contract as opposed to a master \"supply\" contract with an indefinite amount of work.\n\nFor example, if the price were a fixed one every month, not dependent upon how much work was done, that would tend to suggest an exclusive contract. Similarly, if the contract also contained a geographic scope or a non\\-competition term that would suggest that it was an exclusive contract.\n\nOn the other hand, if the arrangement were a fee for service payment and the mechanics under the contract of arranging for maintenance were such that this was really up to Blue, it might be read differently.\n\nIf the entire language of the contract read together left the ambiguity in place, it would be appropriate to look to extrinsic evidence such as the course of dealings of the parties and the discussions that went into negotiating the contract in order to determine the intent of the parties at the time that the contract was entered into in order to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nIt isn't at all uncommon for the meaning of a contract term in isolation to have more than one possible reading when taken in isolation. Often, it is necessary to refer to a greater context to describe its meaning. Sometimes, the overall context will even demand that a term in a contract be given the reading that is less plausible when it is read in isolation because the overall context of the contract manifests an intent and scheme that makes the more obvious reading a poor fit to the overall scheme of the agreement.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company named AlphaTech signs a contract with BetaFleet for managing its vehicle fleet.

To determine whether the contract grants BetaFleet exclusive rights or merely outlines their responsibilities without restricting AlphaTech's actions, additional context is necessary. This could include examining the entire contract for clauses related to exclusivity, pricing structure (fixed monthly fee vs. fee-for-service), geographic limitations, or non-competition agreements.

But, over time, for a variety of reasons, the consideration requirement of contract law was eroded until it is almost meaningless. And, most of the time \"failure of consideration\" now means something akin to unconscionable, because the payment is too small in a context where a gift is not intended.\n\nConsideration wasn't originally used in any context other than contract law, so the need to distinguish between payment and some other consideration wasn't present as the terminology developed. But, as the concepts were generalized, other reasons for supporting an agreement (e.g. justified reliance) emerged, but the terminology was by then closely associated with a particular fact pattern and so it remained.\n\nUsing new terminology is always disfavored in law because it divorces a decision from the long case law history that uses the term. \n\nAs another example, there is a modern tendency to favor the terminology of issue preclusion and claim preclusion in lieu of collateral estoppel and res judicata.

Instead, it is a question of a common law right of publicity, which in India is recognized in some circumstances, but is not well developed and has many gaps that courts will have to resolve as cases are presented to them.\n\nThe right of publicity is largely a right to sue if another person without permission profits commercially from someone's likeness without their consent and it is unclear to what extent, if any, it encompasses a right to control the use of one's own image otherwise. It is not in and of itself a crime, even though it is a tort which is the basis for a civil lawsuit for money damages and perhaps injunctive relief. As explained [here](https://www.bananaip.com/ip-news-center/india-and-right-of-publicity/#:%7E:text=In%20India%2C%20the%20right%20of,to%20the%20celebrity%27s%20individual%20persona.&text=These%20rights%20are%20transferable%20and,name%2C%20likeness%2C%20and%20persona.):\n\n> In India, the right of publicity is governed by common law and accrues\n> to the celebrity\u2019s individual persona.

However, the two\n> bodies of law can be distinguished as follows: while the right of\n> publicity provides the individual with a property right in his or her\n> identity, the right of privacy protects an individual from the\n> publication of private facts that are embarrassing or intimate, or\n> that portrayal of him or her in a false light is offensive.

The company intended to profit from his popularity and his\n> latest success. Sourav could successfully challenge it in the Court\n> before settling the dispute amicably.\n> \n> \n> The right of publicity protects all persons\u2019 rights from birth to\n> death and beyond. When the right of publicity extends after death, it\n> is called the post\\-mortem right of publicity. However, whether the\n> right of publicity extends beyond life is jurisdiction specific. For\n> example, the post mortem right of publicity has only been recently\n> recognized in the US in California and will soon be recognized other\n> American states too. Legal recognition of post mortem rights of\n> publicity usually permits the deceased\u2019s beneficiaries or heirs to\n> control and financially benefit from the use of a deceased\u2019s image and\n> likeness. The news about the movie Dirty Picture having been\n> challenged by the kin of the deceased actress Silk Smita, claiming\n> that the movie does not depict her personality in the right spirits,\n> is first of its kind in India.\n\nThe linked examples, showing satirical portrays of a famous U.S. politician, hinge on the issue of what constitutes commercial use, as opposed to other uses.\n\nThe right of publicity doctrine arose at common law when images of models were used to market consumer goods, when the models for the painting and photographs weren't paid. It has not generally been used to prohibit political cartoons or their 3D equivalent, the basic thrust of which is political commentary or satire that does not suggest endorsement by the subject of the image. In the U.S., such a broad reading of the right of publicity would probably be overcome by the very strong First Amendment protections of free speech. But while India also protects the right to free speech, it, like most former British colonies, tends to be less extreme in the extent to which other generally applicable laws and protections of other individual rights yield to free speech protections than the United States.\n\nI doubt that a right of publicity lawsuit by the individual depicted in the linked materials which appear to be basically satirical political depiction would be recognized in India, and it is likely the some of the same considerations that apply to fair use of copyrights or nominative use of trademarks without permission would inform its judgment on the scope of this common law right. But because India's common law in this area isn't very well developed it isn't possible to know with certainty how a case like this one would be evaluated by an Indian court.\n\nThis said, there are a couple of caveats that should be added.\n\nFirst, it is easy to imagine that the 3D image is obtained by some illegal means which could be tortious (i.e. the basis for an invasion of privacy lawsuit) or criminal. The illegality in obtaining the information could arise not just from common law protections but also, for example, for statutory or contractual non\\-disclosure requirements.\n\nFor example, if this was obtained obtained from records maintained for health or educational purposes it could violate laws providing privacy protections in those areas. Obtaining the 3D image surreptitiously and without the knowledge of the person whose image is obtained (e.g. through a secret camera in a changing room) would probably be both a crime and a tort.\n\nSecond, if the 3D model were used to defraud someone, e.g., by impersonating them on a Zoom call, this would likely be both a crime and a tort under the general principles that apply to fraud in general, as a form of affirmative misrepresentation, even though it is visual rather than verbal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In India, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal status of using 3D models of celebrities without their consent?\n\nA) It is always illegal and constitutes a criminal offense under copyright law.\nB) It is permitted under all circumstances as a form of free speech protected by the Indian constitution.\nC) It may be subject to civil litigation under the right of publicity, depending on the specific use and context.\nD) It is explicitly allowed by Indian trademark law for any commercial or non-commercial purpose.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. In India, the use of 3D models of celebrities without their consent falls under the common law right of publicity, which is not well-developed but recognized in some circumstances. It is not a matter of copyright or trademark law (eliminating options A and D). While India does protect free speech, it is not an absolute right that would permit unrestricted use of celebrity likenesses (ruling out option B). \n\nThe right of publicity in India allows individuals, especially celebrities, to control and potentially profit from the commercial use of their likeness. However, the extent of this right and its application to different contexts (such as satirical or political commentary) is not fully established in Indian law. This means that the legality of using 3D models of celebrities without consent would depend on factors such as the purpose of use, whether it's for commercial gain, and the nature of the portrayal.\n\nCivil litigation based on the right of publicity is possible, but the outcome would depend on the specific circumstances of each case.

The United States Constitution does not explicitly address a right to health care. The words \"health\" or \"medical care\" cannot be found anywhere in the text of the Constitution. The provisions listed in the Constitution are evidence that the framers were more concerned with guaranteeing freedom from government, rather than providing specific rights to procedures and services related to health care.\n\nLaws such as [\"The Patient Self\\-Determination Act\" of 1991](https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/house-bill/5067), [\"The Affordable Care Act\"](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3590), [\"The Uniform Determination of Death Act\"](https://www.findlaw.com/healthcare/patient-rights/what-is-the-uniform-declaration-of-death-act-or-udda.html), [\"Preventing Maternal Deaths Act\" of 2018](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1318), [\"The Unborn Victims of Violence Act\" of 2004](https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/1997) and so many others were created and defined to protect citizens rights as they relate to the complex issue of life, death, healthcare and patient outcomes.\n\nAt the time that Roe vs Wade was passed there existed few legislative statutes governing a citizens rights with regards to their health care decisions. Now there exists a multitude of federal laws and regulations to define and protect patients. Yet no one has been talking about or whether these laws would protect access to abortion as an healthcare decision even without Roe vs Wade.\n\n\\*\\* I made some edits to the original question to clarify my intent: Do existing laws, which did not exist in 1973, serve to protect the right to choose in the absence of Roe vs. Wade?\n\n\\*\\*\\* Additional Edits\nIn a previous version of this question I made an argument on the legal status of unborn life. It was just intended as an example but it distracted from the main purpose of the question. The core of my question is still valid. I still want to know about any laws that could protect a woman\u2019s right to an abortion as a medical decision. Since posting the question the White House has now quoted the [\u201cEmergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act\u201d](https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EMTALA) as a Federal law on emergency treatment that preempts State Laws and Regulations that ban the procedure without exception. Are there others like this law that provide additional protections?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One question raised here and worth at least noting is that the Texas argument in [Roe](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/410/113/#tab-opinion-1950136) includes the following assertion from Blackmun:\n\n> The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a \"person\"\n> within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In\n> support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well known\n> facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is\n> established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the\n> fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the\n> Amendment.\n\nWhat follows is an investigation of the question whether a fetus is a person \u2013 basically, it has not been legally (constitutionally) determined that a fetus is a person. Issues of dying, being a citizen, being alive etc. are irrelevant since the central concept that relates to right is being a \"person\".\n\nIt is reasonably well\\-known that statutes forbidding abortion were originally passed in order to protect the health of women \u2013 that was the original justification. However, there is a massive disagreement over what things \"protect the health of women\". In some states, it has been decided that allowing abortion is a rational, indeed compelling state interest; in other states, the opposite is the case. Although the federal government does get involved in health care matters, health care is fundamentally a state interest. Federal intervention power in medicine has two sources: the Commerce Clause, and the Tax and Spend Clause (Congress, which dispenses a lot of money, gets to say how the money will be used). There is ample case law saying that Congress cannot force states to repeal their bans against abortion, under penalty of losing federal money. I have yet to see a plausible Commerce Clause argument that would override the states' right to define their \"compelling interest\" in health care. Health care is not a constitutionally defined federal interest and it is a state interest, so we are back to square one, when it comes to using federal power to remove state discretion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best reflects the legal status of abortion rights in the United States after the overturning of Roe v.

It is not, however, illegal.\n\nIn general, the dissolution of a state is not in itself illegal according to national or international law, as long as it happens voluntarily. There are some precedents: For example, during the German Reunification of 1989, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) under the (old) Article 23 of the *Grundgesetz*. One could argue that the German Democratic Republic effectively dissolved itself by that accession.\n\nWhat *would* probably be illegal would be to call for a violent end of the state of Israel, or even for a war.

However, for civil servants specifically there are higher requirements when it comes to respect for the German constitution, specifically for the \"[*freiheitliche demokratische Grundordnung*](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freiheitliche_demokratische_Grundordnung)\" (literally: \"basic free and democratic order\").

The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. Rule 131 states that on wide carriageways divided into lanes, drivers should keep between the lane dividers.\n2. Rule 133 indicates that changing lanes requires checking mirrors and signaling, implying that staying in one's lane is the default behavior.\n3. Rule 143 advises choosing the correct lane for your exit as soon as possible and avoiding sudden lane changes in one-way streets.\n\nTherefore, as long as both vehicles enter their respective lanes without needing to cross paths, there is no requirement for either to yield to the other.

Your own statements and the statements of the officer would be legally sufficient to convict you. \n\nAlso, your statement that you don't believe you are at fault is strongly at odds with a widely held interpretation of the traffic laws (not stated in the formal language of these statutes). The prevailing interpretation of the traffic laws is that you are always at fault if you rear end someone because you failed to maintain a safe distance, pretty much as a matter of strict liability and regardless of the circumstances, because a safe distance is almost by definition a distance that it is possible for you to come to a full stop from if the care in front of you suddenly comes to a stop for any reason. The only situation I can imagine where there wouldn't be liability for rear ending someone would be if you were at rest behind them at a stop light and they actively backed up into you.\n\nIn practice, almost any judge and almost any jury, would convict you of failure to maintain a safe distance if you rear ended someone absent the most extraordinary of circumstances.

So, you are not entitled to rely on a statement made by a police officer.\n\nOf course, it is also certainly possible that his statement is consistent with local practice in your neighborhood traffic court.

Chapter 10 deals with witnesses. Here are some relevant sections:\n\n> \u00a7 108\\. Unless otherwise provided by statute, every person summoned to attend as a witness is bound to do so and to give evidence before the court.\n\nThere follow a number of exceptions (spousal privilege, attorney\\-client privilege, state secrets, etc). None of them seem to apply to your example.\n\n> \u00a7 115\\. The court may decide that a witness who fails to attend or who leaves the place of sitting without a valid reason shall be brought before the same or a subsequent sitting of the court. In special cases the court may decide that a witness shall be detained in custody until he can be examined. \n> \n> \n> \u00a7 128\\. Before the examination the president of the court shall admonish the witnesses to tell the whole truth without concealing anything. He shall inform the witnesses of the liability consequent on giving false evidence or making a false affirmation. \n> \n> \n> \u00a7 137\\. If a witness refuses to give evidence after being ordered to do so by a legally enforceable court order, the court may by a new order decide that the witness shall be kept in custody until he fulfils his obligation. Nevertheless a witness may not be kept in custody for more than three months altogether in the same case or in another case relating to the same matter.\n\nSo effectively, if the witness fails to show up voluntarily, he can be brought in forcibly. He can be ordered to testify, and if he refuses, he can be held in custody (probably a jail) for up to three months.\n\nHowever, the authority to compel testimony is limited to courts; the police cannot compel statements from witnesses.\n\n> \u00a7 230\\. The police may take statements from suspected persons, witnesses and experts but may not order any person to make a statement.\n\nSo in your example, it appears that the witnesses would be free to refuse to speak to the police.

[This document](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/VaccineAllocationPhase1A.pdf) give the Washington state Phase 1A allocation guidelines. Whatever you plan to do, a first step is to *request* to be considered, [here](https://redcap.doh.wa.gov/surveys/?s=KMXJHMALX3) (a \"please contact us\" form). The government may contact you and ask more questions: [here](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/COVID-19-Provider-Enrollment-Guide.pdf) is the enrollment guide (questions you have to be able to answer). I will assume that the parties undertaking this scheme are complying with the law and providing truthful answers. There does not seem to be a question designed to figure out if the facility plans on hiring a thousand temporary workers to get a vaccine. They will ask about number of patients and staff, which would be a problem if the request for 300 doses suddenly became a request for 1,300 doses. There is also a triage system which assigns highest priority to e.g. bronchoscopy specialists in direct contact with infected patients. If people play by the rules, the Washington state system is designed to assure that only those at greatest risk in the health\\-care industry are eligible for Phase 1A doses.\n\nBecause I do not [have a license](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=18.64), I cannot order vaccine from the Dept. of Health, and the DoH information makes it clear that you have to have licensed staff. DoH is constantly suspending credentials for unprofessional conduct, and the above scheme would very likely fall within the sphere of bad behavior that would allow then to pull one or more license. The written guidance is clear enough that your plan is contrary to their requirements that it's not reasonable to say \"But we thought it would be okay\". There may be even stronger reasons that emerge once you apply for vaccines and have to sign some paperwork.\n\nIt is also unclear if nursing homes will even qualify to directly order the vaccine given the storage requirements, instead Walgreens and CVS are administering doses. CVS [gives a hint](https://cvshealth.com/covid-19/vaccine-faq), that\n\n> CVS Health did not select the facilities.

A sudden large increase in requested doses (e.g., from 300 to 1,300) would likely raise red flags. Additionally, the triage system prioritizes those at greatest risk, such as specialists in direct contact with infected patients.

There is no general law making it illegal to lie about debts, or anything else. It is illegal to lie to a law enforcement officer **in the course of an investigation**. (And of course it is illegal to lie in court testimony or when otherwise under oath.) But it is in no way unlawful to decline to answer, unless a proper court order has been obtained, or other lawful means of compelling an answer. I would expect any law office to respond to such a question with something like \"Am I/we being investigated? If so, send the appropriate notice and our lawyer will consider what we should tell you. If not, tell us what information you want, and we will consider and provide a written response in due course.\"\n2. If a taxpayer has been **found** to be delinquent in paying taxes, in some cases a court order may be obtained seizing assets, including unpaid debts. But no IRS agent can make such a claim on the spot, and indeed for a client to make such a payment without such a court order, or the order of an IRS tribunal (or the creditor's written consent) would itself be unlawful and would subject the lawyer to a suit by the PI (Private Investigator).\n\nWhen the lawyer pays a service provider, a 1099 must be filed with the IRS. If the PI is a corporation, a different form is used, but a record of payment is still required. As failure to timely file such a form is a violation of the tax code, an accusation of paying without filing would permit the lawyer to decline to answer under the Fifth amendment. If the lawyer did pay and did file a 1099 or other documentation, the IRS would know what had been payed, and would not need to confront the PI.\n\nAlso, as the comment by Hilmar points out, a PI would be likely to use the cash accounting method, and so would own no tax on work performed but unpaid (as yet). So unless the IRS agent thinks the PI was paid \"off\\-the books\" and is intentionally failing to report the payment, there would be no point to such a question. And if that were he case, the lawyer would be very likely to decline to answer.\n\nI find the story quite implausible.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A private investigator (PI) owes back taxes to the IRS and claims they can't pay due to unpaid bills from lawyer clients.

That is, the criminal system may not be the most effective means of correction and rehabilitation of such young offenders.\n\nThere is no bright line that accurately captures these factors, and thus many jurisdictions have more than one step in transitioning from the incapable child to the fully capable adult. For example, in the US and Canada, juveniles/youth over the age of criminal consent but not yet 18 years old are generally not treated the same as adults.\n\nThe policy goals behind the age of consent relate to understanding of the consequences of sex, vulnerability to people in positions of power or influence, and protection of society's norms of purity.\n\nThere is no reason why these different policy goals would result in the same age threshold.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains the discrepancy between the age of criminal responsibility and the age of consent in the UK?\n\nA) The age of criminal responsibility is lower because children develop a sense of right and wrong before they can fully understand sexual consent.\n\nB) The age of consent is higher to protect minors from exploitation, while the age of criminal responsibility is lower to ensure public safety.\n\nC) The two age thresholds serve different policy goals and are not directly related to each other in terms of cognitive development.\n\nD) The age of criminal responsibility should be raised to match the age of consent to ensure consistency in legal standards.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the age of criminal responsibility and the age of consent serve different policy goals and are not directly related to each other in terms of cognitive development. The age of criminal responsibility is set based on when children are believed to understand societal norms and the wrongfulness of their actions, as well as when they might respond effectively to the criminal justice system. On the other hand, the age of consent is determined based on factors such as understanding the consequences of sexual activity, vulnerability to exploitation, and societal norms regarding sexual behavior.

We asked him to ship the \"found\" package back and he did. He persists in getting a \"reward\" for getting the package back from the tenants. Legally, what should we do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This post is tagged \"fraud\", but it doesn't appear to me that there is any fair indication of fraud in this situation. There is no indication that the customer tried to have the first package delivered to the wrong address. There is also no indication that it was the customer, rather than the new resident of the former address, who was not straight forward in their first communications with each other regarding the first package. And, the customer didn't try to keep the first package for himself.\n\nSo, this is not even remotely a case of fraud.\n\nThe issue seems to be that the customer feels entitled to compensation for benefiting you (a benefit you accepted) by taking efforts that he had no obligation to engage in, in order to cause the first package to be returned to you, on basically a theory of unjust enrichment.\n\nThere is a colorable argument that the customer is entitled to whatever he spent to mail the first package back to you and some nominal amount for his effort in doing so.\n\nIn the law of unjust enrichment, if someone does work with a reasonable expectation of getting paid, in the absence of a contractual agreement, and you allow that person to proceed with working and accept the benefit of his work, he is entitled to the fair market value of his efforts.\n\nThe classic case is that of a house painter who paints your house, rather than the house of a neighbor with whom he actually had a contract, by mistake. In that situation, if you know he is mistaken but allow him to paint your house anyway without objection, you have to pay him for doing so, even in the absence of an agreement to do so.\n\nThe reason that the customer's claim is only colorable, rather than clear, in this case, is that it isn't obvious that the customer had a reasonable expectation that he would be paid or rewarded for his efforts to get the first package returned to you. He clearly did have that expectation, but it isn't obvious that his expectation was reasonable under the circumstances.\n\nMost likely, he would not prevail in a lawsuit against you for a reward and would not even try to bring one unless the first package was extremely valuable (if he managed to cause a $10,000 item to be returned to you the case \"feels\" different than if he managed to cause a $100 item to be returned to you).\n\nBut, while he is unlikely to sue you, so you could just say \"no\", he did do you a good turn and clearly would be quite upset if you said \"no\", which could lead to be reviews and/or publicity about your business. So, to preserve your reputation, you might want to pay him a reward equal to any cost he incurred to ship the first package back to you and some nominal amount of money relative to his efforts and your benefit from his actions.\n\nThis would maintain goodwill, the amount of money involved would be tiny in the larger scheme of things, it isn't likely to bind you to major expenses in the future, and to the extent anyone learns about it, it would encourage future customers to take action that leaves you better off than it they did nothing as the customer could have done.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer who recently moved failed to update their address with an online retailer.

While the customer isn't legally entitled to a reward, the principle of unjust enrichment suggests they might have a weak claim for compensation for their efforts. However, this claim is unlikely to succeed in court unless the package was extremely valuable. The retailer isn't obligated to pay anything, but offering a small reward could maintain goodwill and encourage positive customer behavior in the future.

However, owning the copyright to a specific artifact, such as a digital video clip, does not trump all the other rights and claims that may be made regarding the materials captured within that clip. Which means that there are several rights all in play at the same time, and those rights may conflict. The legal term for getting enough rights so that you can do what you want with the rights you own is called \"clearance\" by those in the industry, and \"collective rights management\" by Wikipedia (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_rights_management>).\n\nThe long and short of it is that it is not enough for you to \"own\" your video clip if you want to use it somehow. Depending on how you want to use it, and your tolerance for risk, you need to get every party who might lay a claim to any copyrighted or trademarked material within your video clip to agree that they are OK with you using it in whatever way you say you want to use it.\n\nSometimes you can ask for, and receive, a \"worldwide, perpetual, royalty\\-free license to use XYZ material in any way, imagined or not yet imagined\". Other times, you might have to settle for more limited rights \"a performance of the video at the ABC Bar in New York City, on December 31, 2015 only, for a fee of $10,000 paid to XYZ Rights Holding Company,\" and agree to a whole bunch of other stipulations to boot.\n\nThere are entire industries that make furniture and automobiles for Hollywood studios so that they don't have to ask for the rights to feature an IKEA kitchen table or a Ford station wagon in a movie.

A documentary filmmaker wants to use a portion of this footage. The contract with the performing band allows the festival to live stream and place the performance on YouTube in perpetuity. It also permits media outlets to use up to 2 minutes of the performance. Who needs to grant permission for the documentary filmmaker to use the footage?\n\nA) Only the festival organizer, as they own the YouTube channel\nB) The festival organizer and the performing band\nC) The festival organizer, the performing band, and the live-streaming company\nD) The festival organizer, the performing band, the live-streaming company, and potentially other parties such as the band's label and individuals visible in the footage\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex copyright and clearance issues. While the festival organizer has certain rights to the footage, they don't necessarily have full control over its use in a documentary. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The festival organizer has rights to the livestream footage, but may not have full rights for third-party use in a documentary.\n2. The performing band likely retains some rights to their performance and may need to approve its use in a different context.\n3. The live-streaming company might have rights to the technical aspects of the recording.\n4. The band's label could have rights related to the music performed.\n5. Individuals visible in the footage might have rights regarding their image or likeness.\n\nTo ensure full clearance and minimize legal risks, it's best to obtain permission from all potentially involved parties.

The concept of \"direct charitable activities\" is mentioned as a potential way to accomplish this goal, but it's emphasized that this requires consultation with a knowledgeable tax attorney.
