What legal remedies are there in such a situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The details depend on the state, of course. The common law thing you are looking for is a writ of mandamus \\-\\- a court order to a public official to do something (or not do something) that they are required to do under the law. Writs of mandamus were traditionally only applicable to *ministerial* tasks (i.e. things that are basically paper\\-shuffling where there is little to no discretion); marriage licenses are typically considered ministerial. With discretionary actions, things are much more complicated because the government official is *supposed* to have significant ability to decide what should and shouldn't be allowed; mandamus doesn't apply unless there's a *right* to the action requested. In some cases, mandamus has been replaced with other forms of judicial review, but in Alabama it is definitely still mandamus that's involved ([source](http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/civpro/2015/03/alabama-supreme-court-issues-writ-of-mandamus-enjoins-probate-judges-from-issuing-marriage-licenses-.html): mandamus is what's previously been used to *stop* issuance of licenses).\n\nFor *federal* review, which is more likely to get somewhere, the approach to use is the exact same thing that led to *DeBoer* (the case bundled into *Obergefell* that was about granting licenses), and *Perry*, and many of the other gay marriage cases: a lawsuit seeking an injunction or declaratory relief under 42 USC 1983, which allows actions in law and equity whenever anyone denies civil rights to a US citizen (or someone in the jurisdiction of the US) under color of law.\n\nThe ultimate result of this kind of suit is a federal court order to issue a marriage license, or a declaration that it's illegal to not issue the license (and so anyone who doesn't will be subject to a court order). Violating this order, like any court order, is contempt of court.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A county clerk in Texas refuses to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. What legal action would be most appropriate and effective for a same-sex couple to take in federal court to compel the clerk to issue them a marriage license?\n\nA) File a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court\nB) Initiate a criminal prosecution against the clerk for discrimination\nC) File a lawsuit seeking an injunction under 42 USC 1983\nD) Submit a formal complaint to the Texas State Bar Association\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate and effective legal action in this scenario would be to file a lawsuit seeking an injunction under 42 USC 1983. This approach is specifically mentioned in the documentation as the method used in many gay marriage cases, including DeBoer (which was part of Obergefell v. Hodges). \n\n42 USC 1983 allows for actions in law and equity when someone denies civil rights to a US citizen under color of law. This would apply to a county clerk refusing to issue marriage licenses in violation of the Supreme Court ruling. The result of such a lawsuit could be a federal court order compelling the clerk to issue the marriage license.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a writ of certiorari is used to ask the Supreme Court to review a lower court's decision, which isn't applicable here. Option B is incorrect because this is primarily a civil rights issue, not a criminal matter.

Would they acquire a status of refugee or something or would they be considered criminals?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A question like that is impossible to answer in general, but your question includes some incorrect assumptions.\n\n* Many countries try to prevent visitors to become *de\\-facto* residents through repeated visits. For instance, the Schengen area limits visitors on short\\-stay visa to 90 days out of every 180\\-day rolling window, and the UK seems to give their immigration officials more discretion on every re\\-entry.\n* Many countries give political asylum to people who are *persecuted* in their home country. A pandemic, or generally bad living conditions, do not count as *persecution*.\n* Many countries give refugee status to people who have to flee war or disaster in their home country. The default case for these rules is a person who is in danger and wants to travel to a safe country.\n* Then there are rules for *force majeure* when a person in the country is forced to overstay through no fault of their own. How that is handled usually depends on how cooperative the visitor was at securing a timely return or a visa extension.\nDuring the early days of the pandemic, there have been blanket extensions in some countries. As travel re\\-opened, these have run out.\n\nOne of the differences between the last three bullet points is how long the stay is permitted.

The FBI, as a federal agency, must adhere to federal laws. The FBI's employment requirements explicitly state that there must be no use of marijuana within the last three years. Additionally, as a law enforcement agency, the FBI is charged with enforcing federal drug laws. Therefore, Bob's use of medical marijuana, even if prescribed and legal in his state, would automatically disqualify him from FBI employment.

What matters is that it was included. Ther are several possible outcomes.\n\nFirst of all neither you nor anyone else is under any obligation to notify the copyright owner on the character used. If the owner does not become aware of this, there are no consequences.\n\nTe movie maker could redo the scenes where the copyrighted character appears. How much time and expense this would require is highly variable. it is the movie maker's choice whether to do this or not.\n\nThe movie maker could contact the copyright owner and ask for permission to use the character. The owner can say yes on whatever terms s/he pleases, including a flat fee or a royalty agreement, or can say no. This involves the movie maker admitting tyhat the copyright owner's work was used.\n\nThe copyright owner could send a DMCA takedown notice. (see [DMCA counter notice and court action](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53689/dmca-counter-notice-and-court-action)) This is a procedure specific to US law, although some people in other countries use it anyway. Some other countries have a somewhat similar procedure. Thew owner sends a notice to the host. The host may, but need not, honor the notice, by taking down of disabling access to the allegedly infringing content. If the host does not, the host loses legal protection and could be liable for damages if the owner files a copyright suit and wins. The host must notify the user who posted the content. If the user sends a counter notice claiming that the content is not infringing, the host must notify the owner. The owner has 10 days to file suit. If the owner does not do so, the host may restore the content and will still be safe from liability. If the host does not restore the content, the host could be liable to the user if they have a contract requiring the host to post the content. This is normally only relevant if the user is paying the host for hosting services or has some other sort of publishing contract with the host.\n\nIf the content is taken down, a revised, non\\-infringing version could be put back up, or the same version could be put up with permission, if that is obtained.\n\nBoth DMCA notices and counter notices are made under penalty of perjury. But in practice, it is rare, almost unheard of, for anyone to be prosecuted for false statements in notices or counter notices, even in pretty blatant cases. a user or host cannot require law enforcement to prosecute such a case.\n\nThe copyright owner could file a copyright infringement suit. This costs significant time and money for court fees, legal preparation, and lawyers fees, so most owners will not do it unless they think there is a good chance of getting more money than the costs.\n\nIf the owner **wins** a US copyright suit, the owner could get either actual financial damages, or statutory damages, but not both. Statutory damages could be anywhere between $750 and $30,000 per work infringed, as the court thinks just. If the infringement is proved to be \"wilful\" the upper limit is $150,000\\. If the infringer is \"innocent\" (that is proves that s/he has no reason to believe that the act was one of infringement, and that there was no intention to infringe), the lower limit is $200\\. The court has wide discretion on what to award for statutory damages, the law only says that the award should be \"just\".\n\nIn addition to damages, the owner could get an injunction (court order) forbidding further distribution of the infringing work(s). In some cases the winner may get legal fees and expenses from the loser in addition.\n\nA major defense, under US law, is often that the use of the work constituted *fair use*. (see [this law.se answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/67034/17500).) Fair use is a specifically US concept in copyright law. It always depends heavily on the specific facts of the use, and there is not nearly enough information in the question here to even start a fair use analysis. Usually a fair use does not have significant economic impact on the copyright owner.\n\nSome EU and other countries have a somewhat similar, but generally narrower, legal concept known as \"fair dealing\". The Berne Copyright Convention provides for \"exceptions so copyright\". Both fair use and fair dealing are examples of such exceptions.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a copyright infringement case in the United States where the defendant used a copyrighted character in their animated movie without permission, which of the following statements is NOT a possible outcome?\n\nA) The copyright owner could send a DMCA takedown notice to the host of the movie.\nB) The defendant could redo the scenes where the copyrighted character appears to avoid infringement.\nC) The copyright owner could file a lawsuit and potentially receive statutory damages between $750 and $30,000 per work infringed.\nD) The court will automatically rule in favor of the copyright owner, regardless of any fair use defense.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is not a possible outcome and is therefore the correct answer to this question.

As per the information provided, each country has the right to set its own protections for national symbols, including names. However, enforcing these protections internationally can be challenging.

Article 13 (now Article 17\\) is harmonization of copyright law, which is part of the civil law. (No EU will not go after you.) It is very difficult to go through a civil dispute even in a different member state of the EU. Only in very huge cases are considered international disputes effective. The content of Article 17 is very vague \"effective and proportionate measures\", \"best efforts\" etc. so there is a small chance to be successful. \nHarmonization of copyright laws has to be implemented in the member states of the EU. In other words, if you have no property in the EU, they can not enforce the law on you. I would not consider \" Blocking EU users\" as effective because copyright can be infringed even if a person outside of the EU has unauthorized access to the author's work. From my perspective there are two sides:\n\n1.

The criterion mostly is in terms of user's financial capability to make the payment.\n\nIf the copyright holder files suit and the defendant alleges he cannot afford the payment, the fact\\-finder would need to assess whether(when) the defendant's finances enabled him to pay the fee.

One would be legally punishing a wrong\\-doer, and the other would be compensating the victim for their losses. Regarding the former, if the act is sufficiently wrongful (in the judgment of the police / prosecutor) and the evidence of guilt is clear enough, the wrong\\-doer might be punished, either given a ticket, or prosecuted in the event of a serious enough wrong. That seems clearly impossible.\n\nCompensation for loss can come from two sources. One is the victim's own insurance. This assumes that the victim has comprehensive coverage on the vehicle (as opposed to just liability). If there is such coverage, the insurance company is obligated to pay for the lass (subject to whatever limits there are by law and under the policy).\n\nIf there is no comprehensive coverage, then the compensation has to come from the wrong\\-doer, who we assume has liability insurance but might not. The insurance company basically indemnifies the wrong\\-doer against his losses due to liability. They might have a lower bar for paying victims without hassle (avoiding the expense of a lawsuit). Let us assume that the wrong\\-doer has no insurance, which means that the matter has to go to court.\n\nWhat then has to be established is who is at fault. That will be decided by an objective third party, either a judge or a jury, who will evaluate the evidence. It then comes down to determining which story is more plausible, given the evidence. Non\\-party eye\\-witness is apparently not available, and it is unlikely that circumstantial evidence would show anything, assuming there is no intersection camera. So the fact\\-finder would have to judge the testimony of the two parties to decide who is more believable. If it is clear that the other person is lying, then you (your father) could present the evidence that makes it clear about the lie. There is some difference between jurisdictions regarding how convincing the evidence of wrong\\-doing has to be. In addition, states differ regarding comparative liability: the amount of any award might be related to the degree of fault of the two parties (e.g. under the circumstances, could your father have avoided the accident even if he had a green light). Being at all at fault is bad for the victim in a pure contributory negligence state (Alabama, DC, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia). At the other end is pure comparative fault, which says that even if a person is mostly at fault, they can recover a portion of their loss (the part that they are not responsible for). Most states are somewhere in the middle.\n\nSmall claims court is the cheapest way to sue a person for property damage, assuming no injury.

The line was removed at drafting because it was redundant: The First Amendment protects the free exercise of religion and barrs the government from declaring religious tennents illegal without a very compelling government interest... the government making war was not compelling enough of an interest to force religious pacifists to take up arms for the government... better that the U.S. should suffer military defeat than violate the beliefs in individual liberty.\n\nIt does not imply that the 2nd amendment was intended for military purposes, but rather for self\\-defense purposes (at the time, militia meant the able bodied men of a community who could muster to defend from attackers. While we think of the \"Wild West\" in terms of the Modern West of the U.S., in 1789 when the Bill of Rights was being drafted, the \"Wild West\" were the western most parts of the states that we today think of as the \"East Coast\" the French and Spain/Mexico and the British controlled much of what is West of the Appalachian Mountains today. The \"wild west\" was closer to home than we tend to think of it and people did live far enough into the wilderness that the \"community\" that could form the militia might just be the patriarch of the homestead. It was so important that not only did the founders think to make sure that the right to weapons was essential, not only did they draft this having just exited a sucessful war where their troops were just that and an armed rebellion that was even fresher in their mind, the match that ignited the powder keg of the Revolutionary war was the British attempting to sieze weapons from Lexington and Concord that the people in those towns needed for survival. The \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" was shot over the right of the colonists to keep and bear arms and the founders were well aware of what they were fighting for.\n\nTo further validate the individual right to the people, President Thomas Jefferson, who had a hand in writing the Bill of Rights, when asked about if this allowed a merchant to place cannons on his ship, responded with essentially \"That's the reason I wrote the Amendment in the First Place.\"", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution has been a subject of debate regarding its intended scope.

The historical context and drafting process of the Second Amendment suggest that it was intended to protect both individual and collective rights to bear arms. The original draft included language about conscientious objectors, but this was removed as it was considered redundant due to First Amendment protections. The amendment was influenced by recent experiences of colonial rebellion and the need for self-defense in frontier areas. Additionally, founders like Thomas Jefferson supported a broad interpretation that included individual rights, as evidenced by his response regarding merchants arming their ships. While militia service was part of the context, the amendment was not limited to organized military units or government-sanctioned militias.

At least according to [this site](http://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2012/09/14/some_clauses_in_apartment_leases_arent_legal.html), in Toronto you can't disallow pets.\n\nI started thinking of it and its actually a little absurd. Trying to apply the same reasoning to other things. Like disallowing musicians, when really you just don't want noise to bother other tenants. Disallowing frat students because you think they ruin your apartment and bother neighbors. Disallowing X because you believe it will cause Y instead of just disallowing Y.\n\nThey are not perfect analogies, but I think the main reason people disallow pets is for damages, and maybe noise. Isn't this discrimination against pet owners?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not all discrimination is illegal. For instance, landlords discriminate against those who can't afford to pay the rent. They might discriminate against former tenants who destroyed several walls during their lease period. They discriminate against those with bad credit, and often might discriminate against the unemployed. Landlords often *do* discriminate against frat students/college students in general.\n\nIn fact, at least in the US, discrimination is generally *allowed* unless it's discrimination for one of a few specifically prohibited reasons (such as race). A lease is a negotiation on both sides; it requires *both* the landlord and the tenant to be satisfied with each other.\n\nAs for why different places have different laws: Toronto is not actually in the United States.

In the United States, landlords are generally allowed to discriminate against potential tenants for various reasons, as long as they don't discriminate based on specifically prohibited grounds such as race.

I was a solid A\\- math student, but didn't have the chops and talent to pursue a PhD in math and make an academic career out of it, even though I was something of a math prodigy. I also didn't have the passion for it. I saw that I was spending my free time focused on the humanities, social sciences and campus politics and journalism, rather than on math (although tutoring and grading paid my way for all of my personal and living expenses).\n\nA legal job definitely provides a secure lifetime of decent employment, can be intellectually challenging in some subfields (other kinds of practices not so much), and provides a certain amount of interpersonal interaction and immediate, easily understood relevance that you can't secure as an academic mathematician.\n\nIt isn't that hard to find a decent job for a graduate of a top law school, and the profession is not meaningfully contracting. Indeed, almost no occupation has been less impacted economically by the pandemic. Post\\-law school compensation is bimodal. A minority (maybe 30\\-40%) start at large law firms (sometimes after a judicial clerkship) and make very good money (low 100s) right off the bat. The rest get decent middle class jobs at first. Most, from both routes, end up eventually self\\-employed in small and medium sized law firms, although a lucky few (maybe 5%\\-10%) end up as partners in big law firms and a similar share end up as senior civil servants.\n\nThe problem is that the instincts you learn getting as far into math as you have are not very advantageous to a Big Law career, which places a huge premium on social skills, upper middle class to upper class social capital, and hard work as what amounts to being a super\\-bureaucrat at relatively menial details for long uncreative hours that are only dimly connected to results. A lawyer needs to be smart, but being a \"genius\" intellectually doesn't provide much marginal benefit. Most economically successful lawyers have quite narrow and specialized practices that present fewer intellectual challenges as you mass produce the same kind of work over and over, and lawyers derive a lot of their income from their capacity to market their services effectively to the affluent and the powerful. Also, a lot of your compensation in law is basically for your marketing, for taking on highly stressful responsibility, and for dealing with very unpleasant situations. It often isn't the most enjoyable life style unless you have a very particular type A, competitive, extraverted personality who understands people extremely well but isn't academically oriented.\n\nCorporate law, in particular, values your interpersonal skills very highly and doesn't place much of a premium on your intellectual legal knowledge and research ability. Those things are factors of production in corporate law but they aren't what leads to success there and are often pawned off on junior associates who never have a shot at making partner.\n\nI could have done better economically (I basically took what amounted to a mommy track for various reasons), but didn't understand the profession, or what the work involved, or what was critical to get ahead at the time and in my early career and had other priorities and a set of values and world views ill suited to the work.\n\nIf I was doing it all over again, I would have chosen a quantitative heavy but non\\-math PhD path (maybe Economics or physics or operations research or statistics) or would have become an actuary, rather than becoming a lawyer. I love knowing the things that I know because I went to law school (which I loved) and because I've have an incredibly diverse (although not terribly well paying) legal practice for 25 years. I was a professor (in a gradate estate planning program for financial planners) for a while, and it was the best job I've ever had and I still enjoy teaching a lot. I also spend lots of time in math related hobbies to exercise and enjoy math related talent that I have but can't use very often at work.\n\nIf I were in your shoes, with publications already and an acceptance in a top graduate math PhD program, I would definitely take that path. It is a field within academia with a healthy trend line of stability or growth within academia, and being a professor (which you have a viable shot at doing) is a wonderful way to live. There are fewer job seekers per open position for PhDs in math than in most academic disciplines.

However, the 1911 Act contains no explicit statement of who adjudicates any disagreement as to whether or not a particular bill contains \"any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years\". Who would adjudicate any such disagreement?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Before getting into the technical answer to this question it is worth noting that when matters of a constitutional nature are involved then in practice it is not just a matter of a technical \"legal\" answer. Students and academics like to pose hypothetical questions such as \"What would happen if the Queen refused assent to a Bill?\" or \"If Parliament is supreme, could it abolish the courts?\" etc. The practical reality is that a liberal democracy, such as ours, ultimately relies on those in positions of power to respect the democratic conventions and preserve the constitution. When there is a legal angle to some constitutional issue the courts will play their part but, whatever legal analysis their judgments may contain, they will always have in mind the importance of maintaining our democratic system. It is also worth noting that where an Act contains an \"ouster\" clause (saying that a certificate of X shall not be questioned in any court of law) the courts always find a way to interpret that so that it does not apply in any case where the courts think they should adjudicate!\n\nThose preliminaries out of the way, I think the technical legal answer to your question is that first of all the Speaker decides and provides a certificate under s.2(2\\). You will see that s.2(1\\) deals with \"any other bill\" (your third bullet point) and s.2(2\\) requires a certificate from the Speaker that \"the provisions of this section have been duly complied with\" (i.e. that it is indeed in the \"any other bill\" category).\n\nOf course there is a further question of whether, if the Speaker gets it wrong, the courts could intervene and exactly how that might happen (the so\\-called \"John Bercow question\" of what if a Speaker goes rogue), but the initial technical answer to you question is \"the Speaker of the House of Commons\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the Parliament Act 1911 in the UK, who has the primary authority to determine whether a bill falls into the category of \"any other bill\" that can be delayed by the House of Lords for one year?\n\nA) The Prime Minister\nB) The House of Lords\nC) The Supreme Court\nD) The Speaker of the House of Commons\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The Parliament Act 1911 gives the Speaker of the House of Commons the authority to provide a certificate under section 2(2) stating that \"the provisions of this section have been duly complied with.\" This effectively means the Speaker decides whether a bill falls into the category of \"any other bill\" that can be delayed by the House of Lords for one year.\n\nWhile option A (The Prime Minister) holds significant power in the UK government, they do not have this specific authority under the Parliament Act 1911.\n\nOption B (The House of Lords) is incorrect because they are the body whose powers are being limited by this Act, and thus are not given the authority to make this determination.\n\nOption C (The Supreme Court) might seem plausible, as courts often interpret laws. However, the Act doesn't explicitly give this power to the courts, and constitutional matters in the UK often rely on respecting democratic conventions rather than purely legal interpretations.\n\nOption D is correct because the Speaker of the House of Commons is explicitly given this authority in the Act, similar to their role in determining whether a bill is a \"money bill\" under section 1(2) of the same Act."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13111/moved-to-colorado-been-here-60-days-my-license-plate-expired-what-can-i-do", "docs_id": 13111, "title": "Moved to Colorado, been here 60 days &amp; my license plate expired.

The question of whether it's refundable or how it's labeled (as first month's rent or otherwise) is less relevant than who is charging it.

An ordinary year to year lease termination requires 90 days written notice to the tenant. Therefore if these things are lacking, (*i.e.* a verbal termination notice of 29 days), the termination would be unreasonable and therefore illegal.\n\nQuoting [Virginia Title 55\\. Property and Conveyances \u00a7 55\\-222](https://codes.findlaw.com/va/title-55-property-and-conveyances/va-code-sect-55-222.html):\n\n> A.\u2003A tenancy from **year to year** may be terminated by either party giving **three months' notice, in writing**, prior to the end of any year of the tenancy, of his intention to terminate the same. \u2002A tenancy from month to month may be terminated by either party giving 30 days' notice in writing, prior to the next rent due date, of his intention to terminate the same, unless the rental agreement provides for a different notice period. \u2002Written notice of termination shall be given in accordance with this chapter or the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act ( \u00a7\u200255\\-248\\.2 et seq. ), as applicable. \n> \n> \n> B.\u2003In addition to the termination rights set forth in subsection A, and notwithstanding the terms of the lease, the landlord may terminate the lease **due to rehabilitation** or a change in the use of all or any part of a building containing at least four residential units, **upon 120 days' prior written notice** to the tenant. \u2002Changes in use shall include but not be limited to conversion to hotel, motel, apartment hotel or other commercial use, planned unit development, **substantial rehabilitation**, demolition or sale to a contract purchaser requiring an empty building. \u2002This 120\\-day notice requirement shall not be waived except in the case of a tenancy from month to month, which may be terminated by the landlord by giving the tenant 30 days' written notice prior to the next rent due date of the landlord's intention to terminate the tenancy. \n> \n> \n> The written notice required by this section to terminate a tenancy shall not be contained in the rental agreement or lease, but shall be a separate writing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A landlord in Virginia wants to terminate a year-to-year lease with a tenant due to substantial renovation plans. Which of the following scenarios would be considered legal under Virginia law?\n\nA) The landlord provides a verbal notice to the tenant 60 days before the lease end date, explaining the renovation plans and asking the tenant to vacate.\n\nB) The landlord sends a written notice to the tenant 90 days before the lease end date, detailing the renovation plans and the requirement to vacate.\n\nC) The landlord includes a clause in the original lease agreement stating that the lease may be terminated with 30 days' notice for any reason, including renovations.\n\nD) The landlord provides a separate written notice to the tenant 120 days before the intended termination date, explaining the substantial renovation plans.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to Virginia Title 55. Property and Conveyances \u00a7 55-222, for a year-to-year lease termination due to substantial rehabilitation, the landlord must provide 120 days' prior written notice to the tenant. This notice must be separate from the lease agreement. Option A is incorrect because verbal notice is insufficient and the time frame is too short. Option B is incorrect because while it's written notice, 90 days is only sufficient for regular lease terminations, not for renovation-based terminations. Option C is incorrect because the termination clause cannot be included in the original lease and 30 days is insufficient notice. Option D correctly states the 120-day written notice requirement for substantial renovation plans, making it the only legal scenario under Virginia law."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44343/can-you-avoid-extra-taxes-by-making-your-children-the-owners-of-your-new-busines", "docs_id": 44343, "title": "Can you avoid extra taxes by making your children the owners of your new business?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My father wants my brother and I to be the owners of his new business in my home city.

Colo. 2003\\) is a \"reverse piercing\" case which involves different considerations than ordinary veil piercing. The Court in that case reasoned that if the debtors in bankruptcy were the only people with any ownership interest in the LLC that the debtors' control passed to the bankruptcy trustee notwithstanding the general rule under Colorado law that a transferee of a member of an LLC loses all control rights in the company. \n\nIn part, this decision flows from the particular feature of Colorado LLC law at the time that the default rule otherwise would have been that no one at all would ever have any right to control the operations or management of the LLC because there was no statute providing for who could control an LLC in Colorado which had no members because all members of the LLC were transferees of members without voting or control rights.\n\nThe fact that the LLC was a single member LLC is really less relevant than the fact that all owners of the LLC were bankrupts and that no one else had any control rights with regard to the company.\n\nAlso, importantly, *Albright* is not, as the question claims, a \"judicial foreclosure\". It is an exercise of the rights of a bankruptcy trustee whose is carrying out right to ownership of the debtor's property in accordance with federal bankruptcy law that overrides conflicting state law. Essentially, the Court ruled that notwithstanding the plain language of state law that a bankruptcy trustee is a substitute member of an LLC with the same control rights as the debtor, rather than an economic interest owner with no control rights as would be the case normally in a voluntary transfer of a membership interest without the permission of the other members to admit the new member.\n\nSo, under the reasoning of *Albright* any bankrupt debtor whose membership interest was transferred to the bankruptcy trustee who had the power to dissolve the company would give the bankruptcy trustee the same power, even if the LLC was not a single member LLC.\n\n[*Olmstead v. FTC*](http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2010/sc08-1009.pdf), Case No . SC08\\-1009 (Fla. June 24, 2010\\) is also a reverse piercing case. It involves a debtor of an owner of an LLC trying to seize the ownership interest, just as a creditor of an owner of a corporation could seize the shares of the corporation that the debtor owns including all voting rights in the corporation. The seizure of the assets of the LLC is only indirect as a result of the control rights obtained by seizing ownership of the ownership interest of the debtor. \n\nBut, unlike *Albright*, *Olmstead* does not involve a bankruptcy court and in instead an attempt to enforce a judgment against the owner of an entity.\n\nIn answer to that question, the Court in *Olmstead* holds that:\n\n> For the reasons we explain, we conclude that the statutory charging\n>  order provision does not preclude application of the creditor\u2018s remedy\n>  of execution on an interest in a single\\-member LLC.\n\nAs a matter of policy, the concerns associated with veil piercing are very different from the concerns associated with \"reverse piercing\" by allowing a creditor to seize by execution the membership interests of a debtor, so I would expect the trend to continue. There is no good policy reason to deny a creditor the right to an ownership interest in an entity of a debtor when the exemption law of a state do not so provide, as they generally do not.\n\nSimilar laws have disregarded self\\-settled trusts as a defense against the settlor's creditors.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of judicial foreclosure on single-member LLCs, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the Olmstead v.

This has to be a course of conduct intentionally calculated to utterly crush someone emotionally without justification, generally through some form of humiliation. The nature of the conduct must far exceed what would ordinarily be considered harassment or taunting. There is also a closely related concept called a [prima facie tort](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/bulr63&div=36&id=&page=) which involves intentional and unjustified harm to others not covered by another recognized tort, which is much less widely recognized.\n\nThe U.S. also recognizes a common law tort known as \"[negligent infliction of emotional distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent_infliction_of_emotional_distress)\" which applies to allow a non\\-economic damages recovery from someone in the \"zone of danger\" of an accident that causes physical injury to another person or to property. The classic case would be brought by a parent holding hands with a child whose child is hit by a car and grievously injured or killed right before their eyes. This tort is not very common and not accepted in all jurisdictions. \n\nClosely related to negligent infliction of emotional distress damages are awards for [loss of consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_consortium), which is a claim for non\\-economic harm caused to a spouse by tortious conduct that injures the spouse by the non\\-injured spouse directly against the wrong doer by the non\\-injured spouse (in some states a parent can also make a loss of consortium claim with regard to a child).\n\nAlso somewhat related is the concept of a wrongful death lawsuit, which is typically vested by statute in the next of kin of the person wrongfully killed, rather than in the decedent's probate estate, and can include both economic and non\\-economic damages. Often in a wrongful death case, rather than seeking economic damages, one can seek a flat compensatory amount fixed by statute called a \"[solatium](https://www.ffcolorado.com/overview-of-damages-available-in-colorado-wrongful-death-cases/)\" that is primarily representative of non\\-economic harm to the next of kin.\n\nThere are also other U.S. torts which can give rise to non\\-economic damages without physical or economic harm to person or physical property.\n\nNon\\-economic damages without physical harm are frequently awarded in civil rights lawsuits brought against someone acting under the color of law pursuant to [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) even when the right violated, such as a right to vote, or a right to use public accommodations in a manner not subject to discrimination, does not involve damage to person or property. Similarly, a violation of a discrimination or sexual harassment statutes, such as the federal [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964), by a private individual can give rise to a claim for non\\-economic damages even without proof of economic damages.\n\nThe U.S. also recognizes some [privacy torts](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/civics/right-to-privacy/privacy-torts) (not all of which are recognized in every state) and claims for [breaches of fiduciary duty](https://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/business-laws-and-regulations/breach-of-fiduciary-duty.html), for which there may be a cause of action for non\\-economic damages even in the absence of proven economic damage. For example, if an attorney breaches his duty of confidentiality to publicly reveal highly embarrassing personal facts about you, you could sue the attorney for non\\-economic damages.\n\nClaims for [nuisance](https://lawshelf.com/shortvideoscontentview/tort-law-the-rules-of-private-nuisance/) (e.g. from a neighbor's noisy or smelly conduct on the neighbor's own property) can give rise to claims for non\\-economic damage, and while they would often include claims for related economic damage (often quantified in the form of lost rental value of property), this isn't always required.\n\nMost U.S. states have abolished their [heart balm torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections) such as alienation of affection (i.e. causing someone to divorce their spouse), \"criminal conversion\" (i.e. adultery), and also torts related to broken engagements to marry, but a few states, most notably, North Carolina, retain them and essentially allow private adultery lawsuits for both economic and non\\-economic harm (or one without the other).\n\nClaims for [libel *per se*](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1154), which involve a false statement about another which accuses him/her of a crime, immoral acts, inability to perform his/her profession, having a loathsome disease (like syphilis) or dishonesty in business, can give rise to a claim for non\\-economic damages, in the absence of any proof of specific economic harm arising from the related damage to your reputation.\n\nThe U.S. [does not recognize defamation lawsuits based upon truthful statements](https://injury.findlaw.com/torts-and-personal-injuries/defamation-law-the-basics.html), even though, under many historical criminal defamation statutes, statements tending to harm the reputations of the dead, and statements calling attentions to the natural deficiencies of the living (i.e. mocking mentally or physically disabled people) were actionable.

Many of the issues now being considered problematic were raised not only at the time, but years earlier.\n\nMy question is:\n---------------\n\nDo the Prime Minister's current statements mean that his previous actions in signing the Withdrawal Agreement were threatening to \"deprive\" the monarch of her territory, and that by pushing it through Parliament at speed and in the manner in which he did, that he \"intimidated or overawed\" at least one of those Houses in this regard?\n\nAs I have no legal training, I cannot trust my own interpretation of the Act: my interpretation would mean all republicans would be in prison for life, which clearly doesn't happen.\n\nI am *not* asking if the Withdrawal Agreement actually has the effect that the Prime Minister claims it has, but rather what would be true if one assumes it has the effect that the Prime Minister claims it has.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do the Prime Minister's current statements mean that his previous actions in signing the Withdrawal Agreement were threatening to \"deprive\" the monarch of her territory, and that by pushing it through Parliament at speed and in the manner in which he did, that he \"intimidated or overawed\" at least one of those Houses in this regard?\n\nNo. The Queen will not be \"deprived\" of any of her territory. She is still Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has not reunified with Ireland, nor has Scotland declared independence and also removed her as Head of State.\n\nHe also did not \"intimidate or overawe\" at least one of the Houses. This is for two reasons:\n\n1. The prime minister has political and legal legitimacy through the holding of a (sometimes substantial) majority in the Commons. If the Act passes the Commons, it will be because the prime minister enjoys the support of the MPs on their side (or at least a majority of MPs in the House, e.g. the Tory\\-DUP agreement of recent years).\n2. Under the Salisbury Convention, the House of Lords will not block any legislation that was promised in a Government's election manifesto. While the prime minister did not enter office on the back of a General Election when he agreed the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU, the subsequent amending and implementing Act of 2020 *was* mentioned in the Government's election manifesto in December 2019 and therefore the Lords will not block such legislation.\n\nGiven these two facts, it is almost impossible to declare that either House were \"intimidated or overawed\". For example, the prime minister did not hold a gun to the heads of his MPs, he did not surround the House of Lords with an army until they voted the way he wanted them to. The fact that the Commons willingly supported his legislative programme, and by convention the Lords didn't block it, is evidence that the prime minister and his government enjoys political, and subsequently legal, legitimacy.\n\nIn any event, the Queen cannot commit treason against herself. Anything done on the advice of her ministers cannot, on the face of it, constitute treason.\n\nFurthermore, the Prime Minister has not, on the facts, done anything that constitutes treason. Even if he were to *technically* commit treason by the letter of the Act somehow, the matter would have to be proven beyond reasonable doubt and it is highly likely that all but the most obvious and egregious examples would not meet the threshold for prosecution.\n\nFor example, it would almost certainly not be in the public interest to prosecute a prime minister for delivering on their legitimate policy aims in line with the legal (correct) functioning of our legislative system.\n\nIndeed, it is hard to imagine any court agreeing that such activities are treason when the relevant Acts passed both Houses, and the Government of the day had legitimacy in the Commons with a substantial majority after a General Election in which the legislation formed a key manifesto commitment, and the Salisbury Convention means that the Lords didn't oppose it; they would likely hold that such activities are the intended outcome of our current democratic system.\n\nI cannot think of any examples (barring something like murdering the monarch) where a sitting prime minister could conceivably be charged with treason. Even advising the Queen to abdicate would not constitute treason, provided that the necessary Act had passed in both Houses. Perhaps it might be treason if the prime minister advised so without any legislation in place, but that would seem more of a political matter for Parliament to deal with in reality.\n\nI suppose it is possible that *if* a prime minister advised the Queen to abdicate without the legitimate consent of Parliament (as expressed through the passing of legislation), it is possible that they would be removed from office if a no\\-confidence motion was passed by the Commons and then they *might* be prosecuted, but it seems most unlikely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation provided, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications of the Prime Minister's actions regarding the Withdrawal Agreement and its potential impact on the monarchy?\n\nA) The Prime Minister's actions in signing and pushing through the Withdrawal Agreement constitute treason under the Treason Felony Act 1848, as they threaten to deprive the monarch of her territory.\n\nB) The Prime Minister's statements about the Withdrawal Agreement's potential effects on Northern Ireland do not amount to treason, as the Queen remains the monarch of the entire United Kingdom.\n\nC) The Prime Minister's method of passing the Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament at speed constitutes \"intimidating or overawing\" the Houses of Parliament, thereby violating the Treason Felony Act 1848.\n\nD) The Prime Minister's actions regarding the Withdrawal Agreement are treasonous because they undermine the territorial integrity of the UK, even if done through legitimate parliamentary processes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B because the explanation clearly states that the Queen is not being \"deprived\" of any territory, as she remains the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The title given to the PKPA in the [US Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738A) says it all: *Full faith and credit given to child custody determinations.* The PKPA tells state courts when they have to give \"full faith and credit\" (ie, recognize and apply) to the custody decisions of courts in other states.\n\nThe PKPA was meant to prevent a parent who *already had a judicial custody order* from *forum shopping,* going to another state hoping to get a better order from its courts.\n\nThe situation you describe is pretty much why the PKPA only applies to parents who have judicial order. When the parents don't have a court order, they will have to get one. That means they first have to find a court to take the case. Then, in order to come up with a custody order, that court will have to sort through a bunch of evidence. The court will ask what the parents have already agreed. It certainly could consider those texts. Depending on what the texts say, and what else is going on, the court may even accept the texts, but it does not have to do so. However, by law the court has to consider a bunch of other stuff, such as the \"best interests of the child.\"\n\nIn such circumstances, whether there is an informal \"agreement\" that courts should follow is an open question that some court will have to answer. Under the PKPA, if there is a court order that meets the PKPA tests, the question is no longer open \\-\\- the court must implement the existing order. That makes the court's job much easier.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: The Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA) is designed to:\n\nA) Prevent parents from taking their children across state lines without permission\nB) Give full faith and credit to child custody determinations made by courts in other states\nC) Automatically grant custody to the parent who files for divorce first\nD) Prohibit parents from moving to another state with their child before a custody order is in place\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The PKPA's primary purpose is to ensure that state courts give \"full faith and credit\" to child custody determinations made by courts in other states. It was designed to prevent forum shopping, where a parent might try to get a more favorable custody order by going to a different state's court. The PKPA does not directly prevent parents from taking children across state lines (A), does not automatically grant custody based on who files for divorce first (C), and does not prohibit parents from moving before a custody order is in place (D).

My understanding is that in the UK, Ireland and Germany, verbal contracts are possible but difficult to prove in court. Strangely, in the UK, in 1990s faxed orders were legally acceptable in a court of law but emails were not (I suspect the law has since revised that but I am not sure).\n\nIn Germany I have been told by a client/boss who went on an HR advisory training course, specifically related to hiring contractors that they had to be careful on how they worded things over the phone and in emails. Supposedly, asking someone to do work without agreeing a start date or pay rate can be seen by the courts as a binding contract. The contractor can technically charge an invoice and if the client refused to pay, a legal avenue can be explored which could fall to either side.\n\nOn the reverse side, I used to have contracts with HP, via a third party recruiting agency. The contract I had with the agency said that I would not work with third parties of HP which in effect meant it would have been impossible for me to seek work with any other agency.

Vacation or Annual may also payout but has a cap on banking (often this bank will be the days per year value of the year. If in year one you take no vacation days, you can still have X vacation days banked in addition to year 2's days, but you need to use that same amount by the end of year two or you will lose the hours banked in year one.

The Act allows for exemptions if existing leave policies are sufficient. As long as the PTO can be used for sick leave and meets the minimum accrual rates and usage rights required by the Act, combining sick leave into a general PTO policy is permissible.

So, the new owners have an \"in rem\" responsibility to pay those taxes that can be collected against them solely by foreclosing on the tax lien and seizing the property if the tax isn't paid. Whether the previous owners also have any responsibility for the unpaid property taxes depends on state law which varies and on the terms of the real estate purchase and sale contract and deed in the transaction.\n\nWhere I live, the real estate buyer is protected against a surprise tax bill once the sale is done in two main ways. \n\nFirst, the title company provides insurance against unpaid real estate taxes and will deduct any potential unpaid real estate taxes from the funds provided to the seller at closing unless the country treasurer has verified in writing to them that there are no real estate tax arrears for that parcel of property.\n\nSecond, if the property is conveyed by a warranty deed that does not exclude a warranty that there are no property tax liens in existence for the relevant years, then the buyer has a right to sue the seller for the unpaid back taxes if that warranty turns out not to be true. Almost all sales of real property for full consideration between unrelated parties are carried out by a general warranty deed of this type that doesn't exclude property tax liens except for the current calendar year.\n\nIf there is no title company involved in the transaction and/or the property is not conveyed by a warranty deed (e.g. it is conveyed by a quitclaim deed), then you could still avoid this risk by checking with the county treasurer to see if any back property taxes are owed on the parcel being sold and getting a certification in writing from the county treasurer of that fact, before agreeing to close on the sale.\n\nThe title insurance company, or you, if there is no title insurance company, should also check the county real estate records normally maintained by a county clerk or recorder, to confirm that the seller really owns the property sold and that it has not been sold in a tax sale which would eliminate the back tax obligation but which would also mean that the seller no longer owns the property.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A real estate buyer is considering purchasing a property and wants to protect themselves against potential unpaid property taxes from previous owners.

A quitclaim deed does not include warranties against liens or unpaid taxes, whereas a warranty deed typically does provide such protections.\n\nD) is incorrect because checking county real estate records is a crucial step in verifying the seller's ownership and ensuring the property hasn't been sold in a tax sale, which would affect both ownership and tax obligations.\n\nThe key here is understanding that a quitclaim deed offers the least protection to a buyer, especially concerning potential liens or unpaid taxes, making it the least effective method for protecting against surprise tax bills after a sale."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53653/how-do-we-sue-an-appraiser-who-violated-professional-standards", "docs_id": 53653, "title": "How do we sue an appraiser who violated professional standards?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We applied for a residential real estate mortgage and the bank sent a licensed appraiser.

The state later found the appraiser to have violated professional standards. The loan application was withdrawn due to an unfavorable loan-to-value ratio, causing the couple financial harm. What is the most likely legal outcome if the couple decides to sue the appraiser for negligence?\n\nA) The couple will likely win the case because the appraiser violated professional standards.\nB) The couple will likely win the case because they suffered financial harm due to the appraisal.\nC) The couple will likely lose the case because the appraiser's duty of care was to the bank, not to them.\nD) The couple will likely lose the case unless they can prove the appraiser intentionally undervalued the property.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The couple will likely lose the case because the appraiser's duty of care was to the bank, not to them. In this scenario, the appraiser was contracted by the bank, and their professional obligation was to their client (the bank), not to the loan applicants. To succeed in a negligence claim, the couple would need to prove that the appraiser owed them a duty of care, which is not the case here. The inherent conflict of interest prevents the appraiser from owing a duty to both the bank and the loan applicants. Even though the appraiser violated professional standards and the couple suffered financial harm, these factors alone are not sufficient to establish liability in the absence of a duty of care owed directly to the couple."}}
