However, a modern English translation of that text would likely involve original creative work by the translator, and therefore could be protected by copyright.

Among the charges is murder.\n\nHere's the thing: in war, it is generally to be hoped that everyone involved has premeditated ending the lives of their opposite number. This would make every soldier ever to serve in war a murderer according to civilian rules.\n\nSo, what is the cutoff for soldiers in an active war to commit murder?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As with all international law, it depends on \"who says so\": I will draw on the [Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/geneva-convention-relative-protection-civilian-persons-time-war) as most relevant. Article 3 distinguishes combatants from non\\-combatants, saying that\n\n> Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of\n> armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de\n> combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in\n> all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction\n> founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or\n> any other similar criteria.\n\nThey then specifically prohibit murder:\n\n> Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds,\n> mutilation, cruel treatment and torture\n\nbut this only applies to non\\-combatants. There simply is no prohibition against killing combatants (unsurprisingly). Liberia acceded to that treaty, so for instance if one of their soldiers murdered a non\\-combatant, in principle they should try that soldier for the crime of murder under Liberian law. If some random dude (not a soldier) murders anybody in Liberia,\nin principle they should try him for the crime. Soldier may kill enemy soldier, even when the killed soldier is sleeping and poses no immediate threat to the soldier who kills him. That's the nature of war.\n\nIn the case of Massaquoi, he might have been prosecuted by Sierra Leone, but negotiated immunity in Sierra Leone in exchange for information on his RUF colleagues. There was no such tribunal or arrangement w.r.t. his involvement in Liberia, and Finland opted to conduct an extraterritorial trial based on war crimes (not the killing of combatants).

While killing enemy combatants is generally considered a part of warfare (options A and B), the convention specifically protects those who are not actively participating in hostilities. This includes civilians (option C) and combatants who have laid down their arms or are otherwise hors de combat (option D).\n\nOption D is the correct answer because it involves killing a person who has surrendered and laid down their weapons, making them a protected person under the Geneva Convention. This action would be considered murder and a war crime.\n\nOption C, while also involving a protected person (civilian), is listed as incorrect to test the student's ability to distinguish between different types of protected persons under the convention.\n\nOptions A and B are not considered war crimes as they involve killing active enemy combatants, which is generally permitted in warfare."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59660/nda-seems-wrong", "docs_id": 59660, "title": "NDA seems wrong?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been asked to sign a non\\-disclosure agreement (NDA).

Often the lowest level of laws and ordinances are only in a city database, and sometimes not on the internet.\n\nAs a result, there is already an impossibility to get all the laws in the US in one database \\- and there are even countries that have not taken any steps to make their laws accessible on the internet at all. For example North Korean Law.\n\nThis is compounded by different entities proclaiming their laws and regulations in only their own language and on different proclamation platforms. Where available at all, the countries have country\\-wide laws and ordinances on their own dedicated websites. But again, federalism for the win: there will be different proclamation platforms for lower levels of legislation.\n\nFor example [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\") has its justice department host [https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/) which hosts all federal german laws. Schleswig Holstein hosts their state\\-level laws in corporation with the service Juris on [https://www.gesetze\\-rechtsprechung.sh.juris.de/jportal/portal/page/bsshoprod.psml](https://www.gesetze-rechtsprechung.sh.juris.de/jportal/portal/page/bsshoprod.psml) and the town of Kiel has all of its ordinances and special orders on <https://www.kiel.de/de/politik_verwaltung/ortsrecht_bekanntmachungen/index.php>\n\nWhy a conglomerate is a bad idea\n================================\n\nNow, making a conglomerate of all the laws is actually a bad idea for several reasons:\n\n1. Updates. The different entities that are in making regulations with the force of law only update their official proclamation site. Often, such changes are not announced too loudly for the lowest levels, and with the number of cities in a single federal state, it's near impossible to keep the database up to date on a complete level. This is why different databases usually only scrape the federal levels.\n2. Scraping will break *quickly*. Each of the websites I pointed to in Germany has a different system setup, making scraping these websites for the relevant information basically useless. Compounding that, City ordinance pages are redesigned at a somewhat elevated pace, resulting in the scraping of these pages to break quickly, even if you manage to set it up.\n3. Citability. In a court of law, only the official text is relevant. If an update is missed, then the whole text is useless \\- you'll have to look up the actual, currently in\\-force version of the law or ordinance, so the conglomerate is not helping.\n4. You want a ginormous database. In some countries, judgments also make law as precedent. So you want **every** judgment in your database.

For example, California's Unruh Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in \"all business establishments of every kind whatsoever,\" which would include a private psychotherapy practice. Other states may have different definitions or exclusions. Additionally, such practices might violate professional ethics codes, even if not strictly illegal in some jurisdictions. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the legality depends on specific state laws, with some states clearly prohibiting such discrimination in all businesses."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73449/are-foreign-workers-who-work-in-a-us-based-company-required-to-pay-us-taxes", "docs_id": 73449, "title": "Are foreign workers who work in a US-based company required to pay US taxes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: US\\-based company A hires worker B, who is a citizen and resident of country C and does not travel to the US for work.\nWill the US government collect any taxes (income, Social Security, Medicare, etc) on B?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nThe company is hiring and paying the worker in country C.

Yet, the Google platform is a commercial product and is there to make money by displaying ads. Even non\\-profit websites like [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) or [CC search](https://search.creativecommons.org/) which ask for donations (i.e. money making albeit not for profit), thereby using images in a ['commercial' (money making) context](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jxKFa.png).\n\nIn the UK, commercial use of images *may* require a licence (a written permission). The licence must be obtained from **the author** (the photographer) **and** sometimes **the landowner** (I believe this is a branch of what is collectively known as 'third\\-party' rights, property rights in this instance, assuming the author didn't obtain such permissions).\n\nOne example could be the UK's famous [Durdle Door](https://www.google.com/search?q=Durdle+Door) which requires a [licence](https://lulworth.com/the-estate/services/film-photography-locations/location-enquiry/), if photographs are to be used for commercial purposes. It appears to be a very similar story for sites belonging to [National Trust](http://www.nationaltrustimages.org.uk/photographic-access) and [English Heritage](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/our-people/terms-and-conditions/). Yet, there is no shortage of images used in a commercial context without obtaining such licences (apparently) e.g. [CC Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/search?q=durdle%20door&license_type=commercial), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/images/search/durdle%20door/), [Trip Advisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g1420384-d546417-Reviews-Lulworth_Cove_and_Durdle_Door-West_Lulworth_Dorset_England.html), Google and many others.\n\nI appreciate this is a branch of the civil law and requires a 3rd party to actually raise it as an issue. I highly doubt any of the websites showing images in a commercial context request a permission from landowners around the UK \\- an unmanageable task. Yet, it feels like Google (or other websites) would not risk a lawsuit to show images unless they had solid basis they are allowed to do so.\n\n**Question**: given that photos of many landmarks in the UK require a written permission (i.e. a licence) to be used for a commercial use, how exactly do websites (e.g. Google, TripAdvisor, Wikipedia and others) operate without infringing on 3rd party copyrights?\n\n---\n\nClarification: I am less concerned with the author's copyright claims (like those in [Perfect 10, Inc. vs Amazon.com, Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_10,_Inc._v._Amazon.com,_Inc.)) and more with the 3rd party claims. The [UK's government website](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/open-access-land-management-rights-and-responsibilities) is pretty clear on that (emphasis mine):\n\n> What people cannot do on your land\n> The CROW Act has a list of general restrictions that limit what people using their open access rights may do, unless you give them permission to do something on the list, or the right to do something already exists.\n> \n> \n> They cannot:\n> \n> \n> \\[..]\n> \n> \n> run commercial activities on the land such as:\n> \n> \n> * trade or sell\n> * charge other visitors for things they do on your land\n> * film, **photograph** or make maps\n> \n> \n> \\[..]\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends.\n\nWikipedia is quite strict on its policies, and it only allows uploading images (and other media) that either are in the public domain or with a licence that allows to be reproduced (often, Creative Commons, CC).\n\nIf you go to the [details of the image](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Durdle_Door_Overview.jpg) it claims that the picture is licenced under CC, with attribution to Saffron Blaze. So most probably Saffron Blaze got permision to take the picture, and he distributed it with the CC\\-Attribution licence.\n\nWhen scrapping a web site for data, Google and other engines usually search for metadata (the *robots.txt* file) that tells them what to index and what to not. If a user gives them permission to index a picture by not stating restrictions in the robots.txt, they can do index it.\n\nOf course, in both cases it might be that someone uploads a picture that he does not have permission to share. In this case the situation will, of course, depend on jurisdiction, but many laws have provisions that ensure that, if the content provider is dilligent in addressing copyright issues caused by the users, they are protected.\n\nFor example in the USA the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) establishes \"safe harbor\" provisions that protects content providers if they give a way to denounce copyright infringiments and address those in a given timeframe.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A popular travel website displays user-uploaded photos of Durdle Door, a famous UK landmark, without obtaining explicit permission from the landowner.

Foo is, however, planned to also be produced in large numbers for a market segment which is unable or unwilling to pay for Bar, but it has a very small profit margin. Bar, on the other hand, is planned to be sold at a very high profit margin.\n\nThe problem is, that Foo can be converted into Bar by adding a relatively simple mechanical part.

They publish a standard, [NFPA 1710](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=1710), which outlines emergency response time goals. Unfortunately, the only places I can find the actual standard requires membership in the NFPA to view it.\n\nI have, however, been able to find summaries. In [this summary](https://services.prod.iaff.org/ContentFile/Get/30541) you can see Emergency Medical Services (EMTs, Paramedics) are expected to leave the station within one minute of a call being dispatched. Note that being dispatched isn't the time from when one initially calls emergency services; it is the time from when emergency services is able to determine what is needed and issue the dispatch request. [This article describes](https://www.lexipol.com/resources/blog/understanding-and-measuring-fire-department-response-times/) how fire and rescue organizations differ in how they measure responsiveness including identifying how some organizations start measuring response time at the point a call is first received.\n\nFirst arrival on scene for EMS is targeted at four minutes after \"turnout,\" when EMS is dispatched. EMS treatment levels include:\n\n* First responder (includes provisioning of an Automatic External\nDefibrillator (AED))\n* Basic Life Support (BLS)\n* Advanced Life Support (ALS)\n\nNote that this standard is based on how quickly life sustaining measures can be delivered to the person or people who need them. Transportation times to hospitals will depend on the specific transportation protocols that will be implemented once EMS has assessed the situation.\n\nThe State of Maryland, as an example, manages protocols through the [Institute for Emergency Medical Services Systems](http://miemss.org/home/) (MIEMSS). Their [current protocol is available](http://www.miemss.org/home/Portals/0/Docs/Guidelines_Protocols/MD-Medical-Protocols-2018-WEB.pdf?ver=2018-04-11-134820-493) for reading. On page 17, one of the steps EMS has to determine is the \"mode of transportation.\"\n\nMaryland's protocols highlight that transportation isn't to the closest hospital but, rather, to the closest ***appropriate*** hospital. The closest appropriate hospital is determined by EMS in consultation with their support system. The protocols and infrastructure that Maryland has put in place are designed to get the patient stabilized and to the most appropriate treatment facility based on the patient's need.\n\nThe NFPA is a recommended code and it is up to each state or local governing body to determine if and how they will implement them.\n\nFor the State of Maryland, the MIEMSS is an independent state agency appointed by the Governor.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 1710 standard, what is the target time for first arrival on scene for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) after dispatch?\n\nA) 1 minute\nB) 4 minutes\nC) 6 minutes\nD) 10 minutes\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The NFPA 1710 standard sets a target of 4 minutes for first arrival on scene for EMS after \"turnout,\" which is when EMS is dispatched. This is separate from the 1-minute target for leaving the station after dispatch. The 4-minute target is based on how quickly life-sustaining measures need to be delivered to those in need.

So in VA, you can do many things to someone who is asleep provided that if they wake up and tell you to stop, you stop.\" (quote from friend paraphrasing investigator).\n\nI find it extremely hard to believe that you can sexually assault a person so long as they remain unconscious don't resist you. Is this really how the law in Virginia works? What are the limits of what you are legally permitted to do to an unconscious person?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Short Answer\n============\n\nNo. This is not legal under Virginia law. It is a serious crime.\n\nLong Answer\n===========\n\n### The basic reasoning\n\nThis would be actionable as aggravated sexual battery and punishable by up to 20 years in prison, because the facts demonstrate a touching of intimate parts with an intent to molest (i.e. sexual abuse) and this is accomplished through the victim's physical helplessness, which includes being unconscious at the time for any reason.\n\n### Intent to Molest, Gratify or Arouse\n\nContrary to user6726, I don't think that groping in the factual context of the question can be reasonably interpreted as lacking an intent to molest under the statute. An interpretation that requires an effect on the victim would be contrary to the fact that the statute is talking about the intent of the perpetrator and to the fact that the statute expressly authorizes prosecutions in cases where the victim is physically helpless a definition that includes unconscious or drugged. One could probably get the court to provide an extra non\\-standard jury instruction if this was raised by the defense at trial as an issue.\n\nThe intent to molest, gratify or arouse intent requirement is designed to distinguish between, for example, giving a sponge bath to an unconscious patient at a medical facility or by a family member, or touching someone's breasts in order to get a bra size for a tailor, and \"groping.\" The intent requirement also excludes unintentional conduct such as slipping and falling into someone by accident. The admission by the perpetrator in the question doesn't suggest any possible non\\-sexual reason for the contact, and is inconsistent with unintentional conduct.\n\n### Corroboration From Actual Recent Prosecutions\n\nThis reading is consistent with the fact that Virginia prosecutors have brought charges in similar circumstances such as [the rape of an unconscious woman at a house party](http://www.eveningsun.com/story/news/2017/03/22/two-men-charged-rape-unconscious-woman-house-party/99453734/?cookies=&from=global) and [charges against a Virginia DJ for his conduct towards unconscious women](http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Man-Accused-of-Assaulting-Unconscious-Women-215867991.html). The only material difference between rape and aggravated sexual battery under Virginia law is that rape requires penetration, while sexual battery merely requires sexual contact.\n\n### Additional Commentary\n\nReaching this conclusion is a bit tricky, because usually aggravated sexual battery would have a narrower definition of the crime than \"plain vanilla\" sexual battery.\n\nBut, in Virginia, there is conduct that constitutes aggravated sexual battery which does not constitute \"plain vanilla\" sexual battery, including molestation by accomplished through physical helplessness which is defined broadly in the relevant statute.\n\nIn other words, in this fact pattern, \"sexual battery\" is not a lesser included offense of \"aggravated sexual battery\" under subsection A(2\\) of \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3 of Virginia's statutes. Plain vanilla sexual battery includes the circumstances of subsection A(4\\) of \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3 of Virginia's statutes and some special \"statutory rape\"/\"position of trust\" type conduct that is outside of the scope of both A(4\\) type conduct and aggravated sexual battery generally.\n\nI would attribute the statements of the investigator as symptom of poor training about sexual assault cases and a generally regressive state of law enforcement attitudes about sexual assault in Virginia. Your friend should insist on talking to the investigator's supervisor and reviewing the relevant legal citations, with a lawyer, if necessary, if she wants to press charges.\n\nOf course, the prosecutor has no obligation to prosecute the case even if the prosecutor had a videotaped confession to every element of the crime. But, there is no reason for a prosecution to be prevented due to a non\\-lawyer investigator's misunderstanding of the law. A letter of complaint to the investigator's supervisor or the head of the department or the politician to whom the department reports would also be in order.\n\nThe Statutes\n============\n\nThe statute creating the crime is as follows, with all of the pertinent language in bold. I have put the word \"or\" when necessary to see how the statute fits together (which could be omitted in a block quotation showing omissions with \". . .\") in italics and have left the remainder of the relevant statutes in plain text to allow a reader to confirm that the reading I am giving to the statute is correct.\n\n> \u00a7 18\\.2\\-67\\.3\\.

It is not for the victim to punish or take revenge on an attacker\n* Self\\-defence should be proportional to the harm prevented\n* Deadly force should be a last resort\n\nDeadly force is typically only acceptable when the victim is (or believes they or someone else is) in danger of death, rape, abduction, or serious bodily harm **and** when there is no other option. It is almost never legal to kill someone over property and the law does not have provisions for someone who you think is \"asking for it\"\n\nAs the article says, he could have called the police. It's a car. Not only is it a possession, legally it must be insured.

Self-defense laws generally allow the use of deadly force only as a last resort when there is an immediate threat of death, rape, abduction, or serious bodily harm, and no other options are available. \n\nOption A is incorrect because using deadly force solely to protect property is typically not legally justified. \n\nOption B is wrong because self-defense laws are designed to prevent harm, not to allow for punishment or revenge. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the law does not consider a criminal's actions as justification for deadly force unless they pose an immediate threat of severe harm.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the core principles behind self-defense laws, including proportionality, prevention of harm, and the limited circumstances where deadly force may be legally justified."}, "17": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52036/why-wasnt-acosta-arrested-on-conspiracy-charges-and-or-the-obstruction-of-justi", "docs_id": 52036, "title": "Why wasn&#39;t Acosta arrested on conspiracy charges and/or the obstruction of justice?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the Jeffrey Epstain case in which a pyramid scheme of international sex trafficking and abuse came to light, the FBI filed a fifty three page indictment in June 2007\\.\n\nHowever, the then Attorney\\-General of South California.

If the intent of the authority was that you were allowed to drive at 45 mph, you would have a speed limit of 45 mph, not a speed limit of 40 mph. If you go at 41 mph, you are breaking a law and can be punished.\n\nThat said, law enforcement officers usually have some leeway on how to enforce the law, and they could very well let it pass with just a warning (or even ignore it if they have more pressing issues); the circunstances of it are specific to every situation and officer.\n\nThe only point that could be made would be if the difference was so small that it could be argued that it can invalidate the evidence on the basis of margin of errors. If the radar catches you driving at 41 mph but the error margin of the radar is 5%, you could argue that you were driving at 39 mph and that the reading is due to the error in the radar1.\n\nThat would enable you to challenge the evidence (but here the point is not that you are allowed to drive at 41 mph but that there is no proof that you were driving at 41 mph). From what I know, most police forces will be aware of that and avoid issuing fines unless you are well above that margin of error2.\n\n---\n\n1In fact, in Spain word of the street is that radars are set to account to possible margin of error of the radar, plus possible margin of error of the vehicle speedometer \\-*even if it is the vehicle owner's responsibility to ensure that it works correctly*\\- and some leeway.\n\n2Some people post on the internet the \"magic formula\" of how many % of speed you can go over the posted speed limit based on those calculations.

Technically, any speed above the posted limit can be considered a violation. However, law enforcement officers often have discretion in how they enforce these laws. For such a minor infraction (2 mph over the limit), many officers would likely choose to issue a warning rather than a ticket, especially if there are no other aggravating factors.

If the text had said \u201cAgreement, and Schedule and Attachment\u201d, we could parse this as two things to be distributed \u2013 but that\u2019s not what it says. If \u201crespectively\u201d distributes Agreement, Schedule and Attachment, that would have to mean three different parties: the agreement\\-parties, the schedule\\-parties, and the attachment\\-parties. The problem is, you can be a party to an agreement, but it makes no sense to be a party to a schedule or an attachment. The interpretive canon known as the last antecedent rule favors assigning meaning to the nearest preceding referent (the three\\-term conjunction), but that has to give way to \u201csensible interpretation\u201d, and the problem of being a \u201cparty to a schedule\u201d. (\u201cAgreement\u201d is both a document and an act: being a party being \u201cbeing a party to an act\u201d).\n\nThe clause can, however, be sensibly divided at the level of the verb \u201cincorporate\u201d, though the interleaving of conjunctions makes this hard to see. Editing the snippet down to essentials, it says \u201cThis agreement \u2026 incorporates by this reference\u2026 \\[the terms and conditions set forth in the Schedule \u2026], and \\[the Agreement and Attachment(s) set forth \u2026by \u2026 the parties to the Agreement, Schedule and Attachment], respectively\u201d. The first bracking is the noun phrase \u201cT\\&C\u201d terminating with the first comma (for conjunction). The second comma, \u201cin such Schedule, by and between the parties\u201d is the non\\-restrictive relative clause reducing comma, which is equivalent to \u201cin such Schedule, where the Agreement and Attachment(s) are set forth by and between the parties\u2026\u201d. That comma is necessitated by the fact that \u201cin such Schedule\u201d has been shoved in between \u201cset forth\u201d and \u201cby and between\u201d.\n\nWe still have to deal with the meaning of \u201cparties to the Agreement, Schedule and Attachment\u201d. It makes no sense if you interpret this as identifying three independent sets of parties. However, you don\u2019t have to interpret this as a three\\-way conjunction of parties, instead, it refers to simple unconjoined parties, and they are parties to the \\[Agreement, Schedule and Attachment], that is, the whole shebang. \n\nGiven the linguistic challenges of the text, the courts will probably have to look at the entire document and surrounding circumstances to discern the true intent of the parties.\nIt would be better to rewrite the sentence.

When these job postings are then translated into English, this distinction is kept by including \"(m/f)\" or \"(m/f/d)\" in the job title, despite the fact that (the vast majority of) job titles are ungendered in English, so it makes the company look like they don't understand how English works.\n\nIs keeping this distinction in English a legal requirement, or are companies just doing it to be safe against any hypothetical legal challenges?

A plaintiff in a civil case can compel disclosure prior to trial of all evidence in the custody, control, or possession of the defendant that is relevant or is reasonably calculated to be relevant to a disputed issue identified in the complaint, answer, and other pleadings (e.g. counterclaims, replies to counterclaims, third\\-party complaints, cross\\-claims, etc.).

First of all, a failure to disclose when there is a duty to do so is a ground to exclude presentation of that evidence at trial.

A debt can be as small as 100 bucks for the credit card bill.

But still it will help a great deal if you mention the country whose laws you are explaining in the answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [Civil law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)) jurisdictions, the heir of a deceased person will generally inherit all the **possessions, rights and obligations** \\- this **may include debts**.\n\nSo if a borrower passes away, the lender will typicall find out who is the heir, and ask them to pay. The heir will be required to pay, and the creditor can use the usual channels (reminders, collection agencies, court judgements) to make them pay.\n\nHowever, if the inheritance is \"under water\" (has more debts than assets), there are ways to avoid having to pay the debts:\n\n* In Civil law jurisdictions, acceptance of an inheritance usually means being liable for all the debts, too. Details vary between jurisdictions \\- in Germany, for example, acceptance of an inheritance is automatic, and a heir must file a document to refuse it (this is called **disclaiming the inheritance**). In France, in contrast, the default is to disclaim the heritage, but certain interested parties (such as creditors) can require a heir to formally make a choice, then the default is acceptance ([https://www.service\\-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1199](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1199)).\n* In contrast, in the United States (which generally uses [Common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law)), creditors are paid first, and the heirs only inherit what is left, in a process called [probate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate). In that case, a heir need not explicitly disclaim an inheritance that is \"under water\" \\- they will simply not inherit anything. Note that the heir may choose to inherit certain debts in exchange for keeping certain assets \\- for example, if a home with a mortage is part of the inheritance, the heir may either choose to sell the home and pay the mortage, or keep the home and accept the mortage as debt.\n\nNotes:\n\nEven if inheritance is not automatic, the system usually allows a heir to disclaim it. There are other reasons for disclaiming an inheritance apart from debts, for example tax advantages, or the desire to grant the inheritance to a different relative.\n\nIf a heir disclaims the inheritance, no matter the reason, the inheritance automatically passes to the next heir in line. If all potential heirs disclaim in turn (as would typically happen if the inheritance has more debt than assets), the inheritance will usually fall to the state. Then, the assets will be divided up among the creditors (similar to insolvency proceedings).

These rights do not include performance of a single song or medleys (\"Small Rights\"), videotaping, use of a logo or merchandising. In some instances, MTI has separately negotiated representation of additional rights, but those are administered on a show\\-by\\-show basis.\n> \n> \n> \"Small Rights\" is a term used to cover performances of individual songs in a concert or cabaret\\-type setting. There are three major agencies that control these rights in the U.S.: SESAC (Society of European Stage Authors and Composers), ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Author and Publishers) and BMI (Broadcast Music, Inc.) Depending upon the songs that are being performed, licenses may be required from one, two or all three of these organizations for a single presentation. Most schools, churches, restaurants and clubs pay an annual fee to obtain a \"blanket license\" from these licensing agencies that covers the \"small rights\" use of all music in their respective catalogues for the year. Note that these blanket licenses DO NOT permit dramatic performances of songs. The songs can be performed only in cabaret style. While it is sometimes difficult to draw a distinction between dramatic and non\\-dramatic performances, a dramatic performance usually involves using a song to tell a story or as part of a story or plot. A blanket license permits neither the use of dialogue from the show nor sets, costumes and/or choreography that invoke the original show.\n\nIn general, you need permission to make an arrangement and you need permission to perform it. Whether you're making money or not may affect the likelihood of being given permission, and it may affect the amount of the license fee, or it may not.

That is, TV channels that you get into your TV through having a once\\-ordinary (not sure people still have such things at all) antenna, either inside on the TV or outside on top of your house, which picks up \"normal radio signals\".\n\nBasically, these TV channels seem to be much more regulated and a much bigger \"deal\" in most places compared to \"satellite TV\" and \"cable TV\".\n\nWhy?\n\nAs I understand it, \"satellite TV\" is just like an antenna except the signal comes from a satellite in space rather than a tower standing on the ground. So *maybe* I can understand that, but still, you need a decoder to decode the signal, and that decoder has to be sold and owned by the person viewing satellite TV, so why not include that in the law?\n\nWhy specifically \"over the air\" TV? Is it because it's always unencrypted/unscrambled? (I'm not even sure that's always the case...)\n\nIn the case of cable TV, I assume that this means that you physically have a cable going under the ground all the way from the broadcasting station to your TV. Why is *this* less \"regulated\" than over\\-the\\-air TV? Seems to me as if cable TV is even *worse* than over\\-the\\-air TV in terms of requiring the local authorities' blessing, since you need to dig down cables and still use a decoder (maybe). Whereas over\\-the\\-air TV is literally invisible radio signals requiring no digging of any cables whatsoever.\n\nThis has always confused me both on a legislative and philosophical level. Please explain.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Over\\-The\\-Air\" or \"Broadcast\" television refers to Television that is propogated from a broadcast television over Radio Waves between 52 and 600 MHZ which puts this in the very high frequency (VHF) and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) spectrums and are line of sight propagation (typically placing the signal at 40\\-60 miles from the broadcast tower.\n\nLegally speaking, radio frequencies are \"public commons\" and are thus owned buy the government, similar to territorial waters vs. international waters (because no one lives Under The Sea but the law of the government encompasses them, it's a common trust managed by the government). Since there are only so many radio frequencies at any one time, and it's line of site the government will licenses corporations to use specific channels (granting them a \"right of way\"). However, because it's the government's radio station and you're just using it, in order to get those licenses, you had to meet some rules requirements and regulations.\n\nTypically, this is what is permissible to broadcast (You must have so much time devoted to news, so much time to educational programming, and cannot say certain things before a certain point in time called \"Watershed\" in the U.K. From 2100 to 0530 and \"Safe Harbor\" in the U.S. from 2200 to 0600\\. All times are military time.). Other restrictions (at least in the U.S.) include rules that limit some channels so they don't accidentally overpower each other. Typically this is achieved by alternating broadcast areas over even number channels and neighbor regions will be given odd number. In addition to changing which of the 10s you use and blocking out the 30s completely (in North America, the 30\\-40 range signals are reserved for radio telescopes).\n\nFor example, when I was growing up I was in the Baltimore Broadcast area, and because of station location, was able to get signals from Baltimore affilates and some D.C. affiliates as both were within the 40\\-60 mile range (it's 40 miles as the crow flies) as a kid, ABC was 02 for Baltimore and 07 for DC, so neither signal covered each other. (other double affiliates were Fox (05 in DC and 45 in Baltimroe) and PBS (26 DC and 67 Baltimore (and because of placement, 22 in Annapolis.) This lead to the weird thing where if you wanted something different on PBS and it was a clear night, 22 and 67 would have the same show, but 26 might give you an option. Unfortunately Pledge week was pledge week.).\n\nThis problem does not exist in cable or satellite (Dish) because the way the signals are sent are over infrastructure that is not publicly owned or in the \"commons\". The cable company may contract with a city or municipal government to lay down their lines, but the city doesn't own the line, the cable company does. Satellite will own the satellites that beam the signals down to the receiving dish.\n\nNow the question becomes why Cable or Dish programing aren't more naughty or risque and, well, back when it was new, it was a major selling point for the consumers. You could put all the swearing and nudity on that as well as movies where you might have to cut the naughtier scenes. But when you're making a television show, up until relatively recently, your goal was to get onto a Broadcast network that wasn't PBS (traditionally, the big three are ABC, CBS, and NBC. Fox (not Fox News) was the \"fourth\" with WB (now CW) being the 5th. A sixth in the form of UPN did exist, but it was folded into WB to make the CW and no longer exists and even in its heyday, was really a dumping ground for syndication shows that wasn't cable.\n\nGetting your pilot picked up by the \"Big 3\" networks (Or Fox, once X\\-Files was a hit and later WB/CW) was the goal for all TV productions so while you could make seedier content for cable, until very recently (the late 00s or early 10s) cable wasn't where you wanted to be. That said Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad could not exist on Broadcast.\n\nNow again, there was \"Safe Harbor\" but there were two problems... You had one hour before each network went to the Nightly News (2300\\) so you had 7 hours a week to get it in (and nobody wants their show on Friday or Saturday). From 2330 until about 0130 it was late night talk shows (With a \"late show\" followed by a \"late late show\") and after that was normally the sign off for a few hours until the morning, usually 5, which is when the farmers got up and they needed some market and weather info, so it was the AM news... though these days, there's more profit in infomercials selling the wee hour viewers miracle knives and exercise equipment they won't us.\n\nSuffice to say, you had a very narrow window... what's more, unlike the UK, which has earlier \"Watershed\" and uses it, the U.S. also has 6 time zones to the U.K.'s one, and Safe Harbor is based on local time (otherwise it would be 2200 in New York, 1900 in L.A. and 1700 in Hawaii, 1800 and (if you want to get technical about it) 1400 tomorrow afternoon in Alaska (Technically the part of Alaska west of the dateline are still Russian and nobody lives there, but Alaska time is so wibbly\\-wobbley that even Dr. Who won't go near it.). So the rule is broadcast is according to local time so. NYPD Blue famously got it's network into trouble for showing naughty content in Safe Harbor on the East Coast... but U.S. TV normally gives the time at 10/9 Central (and Pacific) which means it wasn't Safe Harbor the next time zone over and thus net some hefty fines. Cable/Dish only recently broke through this by writing shows that were sold only to channels that would air the naughtiness on cable and just happened to net that network a lot of attention, but it's too little too late as most viewers are \"cutting the cord\" and ditching cable/dish for streaming services which they pick up ala carte for specific shows and ditch if there is nothing on until the next season of favorite shows can come on.\n\nAll this stacks that even on cable and dish, and even on Cable, the big shows that get talked about are still keeping in relatively tame taboos because most writers are still just now branching out of comfort zones to put some more adult material in their shows... And some shows (especially legacy shows that survive a jump from safe TV standards to no rules) will still have the expectation of lacking some obscenities from fans (Don't expect Patrick Stewart to swear like a sailor in Star Trek: Picard, one of the few naval traditions that didn't make it to Starfleet).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why over-the-air television is more heavily regulated than cable or satellite TV in many countries?\n\nA) Over-the-air TV signals are always unencrypted and accessible to anyone with an antenna.\n\nB) Over-the-air TV uses radio frequencies that are considered public property and managed by the government.\n\nC) Cable and satellite TV companies own their entire infrastructure, including transmission lines and satellites.\n\nD) Over-the-air TV has a wider reach and can be accessed by more people than cable or satellite TV.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B.

For example the fifteenth amendment \"prohibits the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the right to vote based on that citizen's 'race, color, or previous condition of servitude'.\" [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)\n\nHowever I can't find any positive statements of who gets the right to vote, or any mention of who decides that. I assume that because the tenth amendment gives the powers not delegated to the federal government to the states or the people, that this is up to the states to decide.\n\nTechnically, Duncan's bill doesn't actually prohibit San Francisco from making this law, it just imposes very coercive penalties for doing so. The case of [South Dakota v. Dole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Dakota_v._Dole) lays out five criteria for considering if withdrawal of federal funds is unconstitutionally coercive. The last criteria is \"The condition must not be coercive.\" The debate around this fifth criteria seems to center on how much money is being withdrawn. This question might hinge on whether San Francisco gets enough money to count as \"irresistable pressure.\"\n\nI have a somewhat tenuous chain of logic laid out here. Any one of the links could be flat out wrong, or I could be just completely missing the point.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [National Federation Of Independent Business v. Sebelius](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-393c3a2.pdf), the court addressed the matter of withholding funding, with respect to obligatory expansion of Medicaid, where ACA required states to expand Medicaid coverage, or lose all federal Medicaid funds. The effect, as described in the ruling was \"\\[t]he threatened loss of over 10 percent of a State\u2019s overall budget\", which constitutes \"economic dragooning that leaves the States with no real option but to acquiesce in the Medicaid expansion\", and \"The Medicaid expansion thus violates the Constitution by threatening States with the loss of their existing Medicaid funding if they decline to comply with the expansion\". A law which withholds *more* than Medicaid funding would therefore clearly be at least as coercive as ACA.\n\nIt is some interest that the ACA ruling put specific comparative numbers on the effect of the highway funding law underlying SD v. Dole, which they decided was \"less than a half a percent\" of the state budget. In contrast, in the case of Medicaid funding, their estimate was that Medicaid costs are about 20% of a state's budget, and the federal government pays 50%\\-80% of that. That means, picking low numbers, the effect of withholding Medicaid funding would be about 10% of a state's budget. The line between persuasion and coercion then seems to lie between .5% and 10%.\n\nThe presumably introduced bill is [here](https://jeffduncan.house.gov/sites/jeffduncan.house.gov/files/documents/Eliminating%20Foreign%20Intervention%20in%20Elections%20Act.pdf), for reference. The core paragraph is \n\n> (a) None of the funds made available in any Act may be used to \n>  make payments to any unit of local government that permits \n>  individuals who are not citizens of the United States to \n>  vote in elections for State or local office.\n\nHowever, the introductory clause identifies the purpose as being \n\n> To prohibit Federal payments to a unit of local government  \n> \n>  that allows individuals who are not citizens of the United  \n> \n>  States to vote in elections for State or local office, and  \n> \n>  for other purposes.\n\nThe substantial difference is that propositions are not offices: the bill introduces ambiguity in legislative intent (the words of the statute say one thing, the potentially enforceable sections introduced into US Code say something else). The bill does not define \"unit of local government\", so we could search for existing definitions of that term. [31 USC 6701](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/6701): primarily \"a county, township, city, or political subdivision of a county, township, or city, that is a unit of general local government as determined by the Secretary of Commerce for general statistical purposes\" (I don't think school, fire, hospital and water districts count).

Further, there is no right of either spouse to be cashed out in circumstances where the property is not sold.\n\nPartition Actions\n=================\n\nEither spouse could bring a \"[partition action](http://www.lonestarlandlaw.com/Partitions-of-Texas.html)\", however. The right of either spouse to do this is essentially absolute in the absence of an express (probably written) agreement to the contrary. An waiver of a right to partition would occasionally be contained in a mortgage, although most mortgages don't contain a waiver of partition rights.\n\nFor some kinds of real property, a partition action is accomplished by the in kind division of real property between joint owners. But, that option is not generally available for a single family home.\n\nInstead, if either party demanded a partition of the residence, the house would be sold pursuant to court order and the net proceeds would be distributed to the parties according to their interests in the property, which would ordinarily be 50\\-50, but might entail an unequal distribution if, for example, one spouse used separate property to make significant improvements or renovations to the property.\n\nA court ordered partition sale, when it happens, is a transfer that would constitute a default under the mortgage, making it immediately due and payable out of the proceeds from the sale.\n\nIn practice, this almost never happens and instead, couples with disagreements so great that it would push them to bring a partition action would instead get divorced and have the residence handled as one asset among many in a divorce.\n\nBut, in principle, it could happen, for example, in the case of an estranged couple that has a shared moral objection to getting divorce (e.g. they are devout Catholics) who also don't want to get a full blown legal separation that is not a divorce. Or, it might happen if a guardian and conservator of an incapacitated and institutionalized spouse needed funds for medical treatment and had no other options and didn't want to seek an actual divorce or legal separation.\n\nAlternatives To Partition Actions\n=================================\n\nIn lieu of a partition action there could be a legal separation or divorce, but this seems to be precluded by the intent of the OP.\n\nThis said, nothing prevents spouses from voluntarily partitioning property or cashing out a spouse's interest in property by a mutual agreement which is suitably documented.\n\nOne spouse could also probably sell their undivided one\\-half interest in the property to a third\\-party, if they could find one (in reality an unrelated third\\-party would almost never agree to such a sale). But, this would also violate the terms of the mortgage making it immediately due and payable in full. How the mortgage payment would be satisfied would be tricky \\- the selling party might have to satisfy the entire mortgage out of the proceeds of the sale of their one\\-half interest at closing, subject to some sort of obligation upon subsequent partition or sale of the property for the other spouse to take a charge against the proceeds of a later sale.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a community property state like Texas, a married couple owns a house jointly.

As stated in the documentation, either spouse can file a partition action, which is an absolute right. For a single-family home, this typically results in a court-ordered sale with proceeds distributed equally.\nOption C is technically possible but highly impractical.

Whether or not this would violate the criminal statute you state is going to be a fact specific inquiry.\n\nIn the case I cited above, the court held that a crane moving something over someone\u2019s land was not *criminal* trespass. I think one could argue that sticking an arm in the window of a house, would be trespass. This is assuming you had a right to be on in the area in front of a window. Common areas in an apartment/housing complex come to mind.\n\n### Or are they trespassing if they insert a tool into the dwelling, like if they stick a hose in the window?\n\nAgain, no clear guidance in Mass., but given the dictionary definition used above where entry \u201cpresupposes actual, physical presence in or on property, \u201d it is not criminal trespass; however this might meet the elements of another crime depending on what that person is doing with the hose.\n\nAlso, take a look at the elements of [civil trespass (tort of trespass to land)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass#Trespass_to_land).

These items are simply entries in a database, presented by the game developers to users in their mobile app. They don't have a physical presence and don't affect the actual property rights of the land owner.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because virtual items don't automatically become the property of the real-world property owner. They remain part of the game's database.\n\nAnswer B is wrong because capturing a virtual item in the game is not considered theft, as the item doesn't belong to the property owner in the first place.\n\nAnswer D is partially correct in that the game developers have rights over the virtual items, but it's incorrect to say that players acquire ownership upon capturing them.

Fair Use deals with (among other things) the *amount of a copyrighted work you can legally use without violating copyright.* This is the aspect of Fair Use is what you need to be concerned with. If you use an amount of footage of the video clip that is more than Fair Use, you are in violation of copyright. See [Measuring Fair Use: The Four Factors \\- Stanford Copyright and Fair Use Center](https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/). If you use a small part of the watermarked video that amounts to Fair Use, i.e. an amount that is less than the full clip and could be seen as Fair Use, then you are not in violation of Fair Use.\n\nHowever, by showing any video or image that is watermarked, even if Fair Use, you are indicating to the audience that you may not have explicit permission from the owner.

The presence of a watermark does not inherently prevent the clip from being used under fair use. Fair use is determined by factors such as the amount of the copyrighted work used and the purpose of the use, not by the presence of a watermark. However, using a watermarked clip, even if it falls under fair use, may suggest to the audience that the researcher lacks explicit permission from the content owner. This could be perceived as unprofessional or indicative of a lack of understanding of academic courtesy and copyright norms.\n\nOption A is incorrect because watermarks do not automatically negate fair use possibilities. \nOption C is incorrect because removing a watermark is not a requirement for fair use and could potentially be seen as copyright infringement. \nOption D is too extreme and inaccurate, as watermarked content can be used if it falls under fair use provisions, despite potential professional implications."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74884/can-i-publish-on-my-website-numbers-and-quoted-text-from-another-site-with-link", "docs_id": 74884, "title": "Can I publish on my website numbers and quoted text from another site with link to the original?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Let me describe what I am trying to achieve.\nI want to aggregate stock forecasts from different sources (example [https://en.freedom24\\.com/ideas/10969\\-crocs\\-investidea](https://en.freedom24.com/ideas/10969-crocs-investidea)).\n\nI want to publish tables (Analyst, Target price, Description).

According to the documentation, target prices, being single numbers, cannot be protected by copyright and can be freely copied. However, the use of descriptions is more complex. In some jurisdictions, like the US, using portions of descriptions might fall under fair use, but this depends on various factors such as the amount used, the purpose, and whether it's transformative. The documentation suggests that using descriptions for the same purpose as the original might weigh against a fair use finding.

Two key factors must be considered:\n\n1. The original owner must have discontinued use without intent to resume. This is based on the Lanham Act, which states that a mark is not abandoned until it's been discontinued without intent to resume use. Even if the registration has expired, if the original owner is still actively using the mark, they retain common law rights.\n\n2. The 6-month grace period for renewal must have passed. After a trademark expires, there is a 6-month period during which the original owner can still renew the registration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate trademarking without consideration of current usage or the grace period is not permissible. Option B is overly restrictive, as written permission is not always necessary if the mark has been truly abandoned.

I don't really see the point of all the trouble if I'm not actively engaging in illegal activities on my machine, but for now I'm more interested in rather or not such a hidden partition is as foolproof as these individuals claim; specifically would it really render any law enforcement powerless to do anything.\n\nWithout going too deep into the technical factors involved the idea is to have another partition (ie part of the computer reserved to install and run software on) where the partition is both encrypted and not listed in the boot sector, where partitions are usually stored. The net result is a hidden partition, no one can see or access it without using some special boot technique, such as using a CD or thumb drive to change how the computer boots up, to connect to it. if you don't plug in your magic thumb drive before you start your computer then in theory it would be impossible to tell you have another hidden partition or connect to it.\n\nI know enough about computers to know this hidden partition isn't quite as foolproof as claimed, as inferring the existence of a hidden partition shouldn't be impossible on a technical level. The fact that a large part of the computer isn't allocated, effectively preventing use of part of your computer's storage, should be enough to make an analyst at least suspect a hidden partition may exist, doubly so if someone mostly used their hidden partition so that their visible partition was rarely used or too small to be useful. Once a hidden partition is suspected some analysis of 'randomness' of the 1 and 0 on the unallocated space could be used to provide extremely strong evidence that there was encrypted data saved there, with a very large area of encrypted data in turn being very suggestive, but not definitively prove, that a hidden partition is being used.\n\nSo say that a suspected criminal, who used one of these hidden partitions, had his computer confiscated. Let's further say the polices' technical folks are on the bar and noticed the evidence which strongly suggests, but could never definitively prove, that the suspect was using a hidden partition. The police would, of course, like to get access to this hidden partition to see if anything incriminating is saved on it, but their going to need the magic thumb drive to view anything saved on it.\n\nI suspect the police could not compel the criminal to hand this over directly, as the evidence, no matter how suggestive, would not be be absolute proof that the hidden partition existed. Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?\n\nWould there be any other options that the police may have to deal with such a suspected hidden partition which may contain incriminating data? The two obvious ones I could think of are:\n\n1. getting a second search warrant to allow them to search for the thumb drive used to connect to the partition. I imagine that they only need reasonable suspicion of a hidden partition to get a more extensive search warrant? Though I doubt that would be too useful since a criminal would presumably destroy such a device immediately after their computer was confiscated to prevent police from getting hold of it?\n2. Could the mere (strongly suspected) presence of a hidden partition be used against the suspect? for instance in a criminal trial could the prosecutor argue the fact that the suspect was apparently going to great lengths to make it impossible to see what he was using his machine for as evidence that the suspect likely was doing something unlawful with the machine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> ***Though if the police were able to find some other proof of a hidden partition, such as conversations the suspect had with someone where the suspect refers to his use of such a partition, they may be able to meet a sufficient burden of proof to compel the suspect to make the content of the partition available to them?***\n\nThe US courts have [ruled on this](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/appeals-court-upholds-constitutional-right-against-forced-decryption), and the answer is \"no\":\n\n> San Francisco \\- A federal appeals court has found a Florida man's constitutional rights were violated when he was imprisoned for refusing to decrypt data on several devices.

According to the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore (2000), state legislatures have the constitutional authority to select electors for the Electoral College directly if they choose to do so. This power is derived from Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which gives state legislatures broad discretion in determining the manner of appointing electors. The Court affirmed that states can \"take back the power to appoint electors\" even if they currently use popular elections to determine electors. This means that theoretically, a state legislature could decide to appoint electors directly, overriding existing state election laws, even for a current election cycle.\n\nOption A is incorrect because federal law does not require states to hold popular elections for electors.

The higher court agreed that the photographs were \"shocking and disturbing\". The [Communications Act 2003 section 127](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/127) likewise does not define \"grossly offensive\", meaning that it has it's ordinary meaning. Something is offensive if people are offended by it (the number or nature of the people so offended is not part of the meaning of offensive), and \"grossly\" is an intensifier suggesting that many people are offended, or people are highly offended. In other words, it refers to an emotional reaction. Whether or not a person has that reaction depends on the subject of the emotion (the person having it).\n\nFreedom of speech is protected to various degrees, by country.

The court ruled that these words are not given a specific definition in the Communications Act 2003, and thus should be interpreted as they would be in everyday language. This means that something can be considered \"grossly offensive\" if it causes a strong negative emotional reaction in many people or a very intense reaction in some people.
