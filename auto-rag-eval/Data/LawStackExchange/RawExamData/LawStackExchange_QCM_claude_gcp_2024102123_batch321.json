We won't be earning money while selling / using the characters in our software, only as a visual presentation in the website.\n\nI checked [Toei Animation](http://corp.toei-anim.co.jp/en/contact) contact page where it says:\n\n> We do not grant individuals permission to use any character images.\n\nI checked there because I wanted to ask them this same question, however that makes me think it's impossible to get their permission to use their characters in our website and thus it would be illegal to use them.\n\nFor [Bandai](http://www.bandai.com/terms.html) terms \\& conditions page they say that Digimon Intellectual Property Rights belong to:\n\n> Digimon: \u00a9 Akiyoshi Hongo \u2022 Toei Animation.

The exact extent of those rights varies by jurisdiction, but the use you're describing \\-\\- as part of a marketing scheme for commercial profit \\-\\- is generally going to be impermissible without permission.\n\nIf you can get written permission from the owners, you should be fine, but it seems unlikely that they will grant that permission.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this use?\n\nA) It's legal as long as they don't directly profit from the images themselves.\nB) It's legal because it falls under fair use for non-commercial purposes.\nC) It's likely illegal without explicit permission from the copyright holders.\nD) It's legal if they credit the original creators on their website.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Using copyrighted images, even for non-profit purposes or with attribution, is generally not permitted without explicit permission from the copyright holders. The documentation indicates that Toei Animation does not grant individuals permission to use character images, and Bandai's terms confirm that Digimon intellectual property rights belong to specific entities. Using these images for marketing or to enhance a commercial website, even if not directly selling the images, would likely infringe on copyright and trademark rights. The only way to legally use such images would be to obtain written permission from the rights holders, which seems unlikely in this case."

We do not have an real estate agent and we end up dealing with the seller's real estate agent directly. \n\nWe're told by the seller agent that there are multiple bidders bidding at the same time. We're under the impression that in order to have a shot at the condo we have to waive the following condition. \n\n![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDTIG.png)\n\nWhich is we can choose to withdrawal the offer after lawyer viewing of the status certificate. \n\nWe were hesitate to waive the conditions but the agent says condos are usually fine and he said he checked with the seller and there is nothing to worry about. \n\nAfter we win the bid our real estate lawyer examined the status certificate and says there's something called Kitec plumbing in the status certificate, which usually costs condo owners 20k to fix this issue. \n\nWe're wondering if there's something that I can do from my side? If the seller do not agree to lower the price for 20k is there something that I can do? Thanks. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am sorry to sound unsympathetic, but it sounds as if you have discovered, expensively, why some people employ their own agents when buying in fields with which they are unfamiliar.\n\nThe seller has no conceivable duty to lower the price, and (assuming that \"we won the bid\" means you signed a binding contract) there is nothing you can do but pay the stipulated price. There is a term in the standard conditions that would have protected you in this situation, but you waived it voluntarily and with understanding of what it meant.\n\nYou could in theory have a case for misrepresentation against the agent, but before even speaking to a lawyer you need to consider \n\n* If the agent is paid by the seller, he has a fiduciary duty to obtain the best price for his principal; there is no corresponding duty to you since he has no contract with you.\n* You were \"under the impression\" that the seller would only consider bids that waived this condition. Even if the agent told you so directly, it may well have been true, in which case the judge would expect you to ask yourself *why* the seller was imposing an abnormal condition. Similarly it is probably true that \"most condos are fine\". It's irrelevant at best and misleading at worst when you only want to buy one of them; but as I said above, somebody you're not employing is not obliged to give you good advice.\n* If you can prove that the agent told you that he had checked with the seller and there was no problem that would justify you retaining the condition, then that was fraudulent and you could probably sue the agent for your additional expenses. However, an important part of the agent's job is to do everything possible to persuade you to sign short of actual fraud; are you quite certain of the actual words he used? If your unsupported evidence is \"He told us so in the hotel lobby\" and the agent's evidence is \"No, I didn't\", your point is not legally proved. A jury *might* believe you rather than him; but probably (IANAL) the case would never be allowed to get that far.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, what is the most likely legal outcome for the condo buyers who waived the condition allowing withdrawal after lawyer review of the status certificate?\n\nA) The buyers can force the seller to lower the price by $20,000 to cover the Kitec plumbing issue.\nB) The buyers can sue the seller's agent for misrepresentation and recover damages.\nC) The buyers must pay the full stipulated price as per the binding contract they signed.\nD) The buyers can withdraw from the purchase without penalty due to the undisclosed plumbing issue.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, once the buyers \"won the bid\" and signed a binding contract after voluntarily waiving the protective condition, they are obligated to pay the stipulated price. The seller has no duty to lower the price, and the buyers have limited recourse against the agent. While there might be a theoretical case for misrepresentation against the agent, it would be difficult to prove and likely unsuccessful given the agent's primary duty to the seller. The buyers' decision to waive the protective condition, despite its importance, leaves them with little legal leverage to alter or escape the contract."

Some viewers claim these theories have negatively impacted their worldview. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of MystiqueTV's content in the United States?\n\nA) MystiqueTV can be prosecuted for spreading misinformation if their content is proven to be false.\nB) The platform is protected by the First Amendment unless they make specific medical claims or guarantees.\nC) MystiqueTV is breaking the law by profiting from conspiracy theories and can be sued for false advertising.\nD) The platform must include disclaimers stating their content is for entertainment purposes only to avoid legal issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In the United States, the First Amendment generally protects the right to express ideas and opinions, even if they are considered unconventional or unpopular. Spreading misinformation or conspiracy theories is not inherently illegal. However, if the platform were to make specific medical claims or guarantee results from their content, this could potentially fall under false advertising regulations. The key factor is whether the platform is delivering what it promises to its subscribers - access to content about these theories - rather than the truthfulness of the theories themselves. Options A and C are incorrect because merely spreading misinformation or profiting from conspiracy theories is not illegal in this context. Option D, while a common practice, is not a legal requirement for this type of content."

From the linked pages, it would seem the answer is that you are not required to answer any questions. You are required to stop if you are either legally arrested or are going to be searched.\n\nTo be [legally arrested](https://www.gov.uk/police-powers-of-arrest-your-rights) the police must:\n\n* identify themselves as the police\n* tell you that you\u2019re being arrested\n* tell you what crime they think you\u2019ve committed\n* explain why it\u2019s necessary to arrest you\n* explain to you that you\u2019re not free to leave\n\nTo [detain you for a search the police](https://www.gov.uk/police-powers-to-stop-and-search-your-rights) must tell you:\n\n* their name and police station\n* what they expect to find, for example drugs\n* the reason they want to search you, for example if it looks like you\u2019re hiding something\n* why they are legally allowed to search you\n* that you can have a record of the search and if this isn\u2019t possible at the time, how you can get a copy\n\nFrom my reading, unless all of one of these sets of actions have been completed, you are allowed to continue about your business as if the police were not there.

In such encounters, citizens have no legal obligation to stop, engage with the officer, or answer any questions. The police cannot lawfully detain an individual for such general questioning without reasonable grounds for suspicion or following proper stop and search or arrest procedures.

The alleged laws / powers allowed the following:\n\n> *\"In a highly unusual move the House of Commons serjeant\\-at\\-arms was sent to the businessman's hotel and he was given a final warning and a two\\-hour deadline to comply with the order.\"*\n> \n> \n> *\"When the executive failed to do so he was escorted to Parliament and warned he risked fines and imprisonment if the documents were not surrendered, the paper said.\"*\n\nThis kind of power is very worrying to me, I would like to know about this in more detail.\n\nWhich rarely used powers are they exercising? What is the extent of these laws? Under what circumstances can they be applied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Okay, I think that I have found the answer to my own question.\n\n**TLDR**: Parliament technically has the power to summon / fine / imprison anyone, but the applicability of these laws is in doubt as some have not been exercised for 100\u2019s of years. It is unclear that any fines or imprisonment would actually have been brought against the man.\n\nIt turns out that The House of Commons and The House of Lords technically have the power to summon, imprison, and fine anyone. ([See point 252 on page 62 here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/79390/consultation.pdf))\n\n[An older BBC article goes over these alleged powers in greater detail](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17912253). The last time that an non member was summoned was in 1957:\n\n> *\u201dThe editor of the Sunday Express, John Junor, was brought by the Serjeant at Arms to the bar and admonished by the Speaker for publishing an article that cast doubt on the integrity of MPs over their constituency petrol allowances.\u201d*\n\nHowever, the powers of fining and imprisonment have not been exercised for 100\u2019s of years and their legitimacy today is debatable. Specifically, the European Convention of Human Rights would seem to undermine such arbitrary powers of imprisonment.\n\nThe article alleges that the last recorded cases of fines or imprisonment are as follows:\n\n> *\u201dThere is a former cell in the lower floors of the clock tower. But in practice it is only the police within the parliamentary estate who have the right to arrest anyone. The last time a non\\-MP was imprisoned was in 1880 when a man called Charles Grissell was detained.\u201d*\n> \n> \n> *\u201dThe last time MPs fined someone was in 6 February 1666 when a man called Thomas White was forced to pay the House \u00a31,000 for preventing an MP attending parliament.\u201d*\n\nSo I\u2019m summary, it is murky territory and highly unlikely that the business man in question would have faced serious fines or imprisonment for failing to comply. [This parliamentary article](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmliaisn/697/697we36.htm) nicely summarises how farcical the whole affair could have become: \n\n> *\u201dIn modern circumstances, as a televised proceeding, it would risk being a pantomime. Consider: the miscreant is brought to the Bar, accompanied by the Serjeant with the Mace, and is admonished by the Speaker in front of the House. Even assuming that the miscreant is prepared to come (and a refusal would be a further embarrassment) the proceedings are not controllable, and the House would risk looking like a lynch mob. The Speaker stands and delivers a rebuke, at a range of some thirty yards. Then what? The individual at the Bar, in prime TV time, may decide to have a go at the House and the treatment he or she has received. If the individual really does have a case, or perhaps produces some surprise piece of evidence which makes it clear that the House has got it wrong, the result could be a reputational disaster.\u201d*\n\nMonologue finished.",

The information provided indicates that while the UK Parliament technically retains powers to summon, fine, or imprison individuals, these powers are rarely used in modern times.

Moreover, the legitimacy of these powers is questionable in the context of modern human rights laws, particularly the European Convention on Human Rights. The information suggests that while these powers exist on paper, their practical application is limited and potentially problematic in today's legal and social context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the powers are not regularly exercised, and their support by modern legal frameworks is dubious.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the powers have not been officially abolished, even though their applicability is in doubt.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the powers, in theory, can be applied to non-MPs as well, as evidenced by historical examples provided in the text."

I guess the reason why this works is because to average person \"contract free\" typically means that you don't have to read fine print on a written contract that most of the time works against you.\n\n> **However, isn't this misleading advertising to claim that there is \"no contract\", because there always will be a contract \\- either verbal or written on a paper under different title (e.g. Application Form, \"Unicorn tears\")?**\n\nBased on answer I received [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5718/if-there-was-no-written-contract-in-the-first-place-would-a-phone-call-be-enough), the person claimed that it does not matter what is the title of the document \\- so document with title \"Application Form\" could incorporate another document via [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_by_reference) that specifies terms. Effectively you actually end up having a contract, but the only difference is that you did not explicitly sign the referenced document and did not have a chance to read it; and this works against you. Or another person confirmed [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5613/no-written-contract-do-i-have-to-pay-undisclosed-early-termination-fee) that there does not have to be any paper signed at all for judge to think that there was a contract in the first place. Also, another person told [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5739/do-both-parties-need-to-explicitly-agree-upon-price-of-service-before-doing-it) that the terms don't need to explicitly be mentioned in the first place, if price (and possibly late fees) were omitted from contract, then judge will figure out what is fair.\n\n> **What would judge do if you were able to prove that other party claimed that their service is \"contract free\"?**\n\nIf sales person was **honest** would he have to explain to the other party that \"contract free\" actually means:\n\n> You know our service is only \"***written*** contract fee\" and not \"contract free\". However, this is the exact reason why you would have to be really dumb to enter into business with us orally or just via Application Form, because now instead of just dealing with the fine print issue that you would have had with written contract, now you will also have to deal with [incorporation by reference](http://Incorporation_by_reference) issue where we can incorporate terms and conditions from Application Form into our website or somewhere else; also, now instead of knowing what are the exact fees (e.g. ETF, late fees) that we would charge from you we will simply charge whatever we think is \"fair amount\". If you disagree with the amount of fees we charge, then no worries judge will decide what is fair for you. However, remember, just because that we did not disclose such fees in contract it does not mean that we can't charge them from you.\n\nDoes monologue from \"honest\" sales guy above really explains how our legal system works, if there is \"no contract\"? Note that this question is only asked from *legal point* of view and not from *building good relationship* point of view.\n\n*I will wait for multiple answers before accepting the right one. I will give preference to that answer that will be backed up with precedent case where judge discusses meaning of \"no contract\".*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's say I buy a phone. Typically you can buy a phone with something that is advertised as \"no contract\" or for example \"with a 24 month contract\". \n\nIn reality, \"no contract\" means \"we have a contract where you hand over the cash, and the phone company hands over the phone, and there are various guarantees that are either implied or explicit, but there are no terms in the contract that force you to hand over money to the phone company beyond payment for the phone in the future if you don't want to\". \n\nSo there *is* a contract, but the contract is such that you as the customer have no obligations towards the seller once you have paid for the goods. \n\n\"No contract\" would happen for gifts, or as an example if you download open source software in the USA for free. \n\nThere will be a difference between a \"no contract\" contract between business and consumer or between two businesses. Most countries have consumer protection laws so if a deal is advertised as \"no contract\" and the business demands further payments, they will likely lose. Between two businesses, each side is fully responsible to study the actual contract terms.",

If one party claims there's an error in the written contract, they would need to provide \"overwhelming evidence\" to override what's written.

She and her husband respectfully declined as they said they had been quarantined. They were then informed that if they did not take it then they would be put on a federal investigation list and would not be allowed to go home with their baby.\n\nThis doesn't seem legal to me but it's pretty difficult to fight these things in the heat of the moment. Regardless of how you feel about a COVID test, it could be something else next time.\n\nMy wife is having a baby in about a month, and in light of this, I thought it might be prudent to know what lawyer I want to call in a situation like this. Would this generally be something any \"medical lawyer\" would handle?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Medical lawyer\" is really the wrong focus, this is an issue of civil rights. The question would be, is it a violation of your civil rights to prevent you from taking your baby home; is it legal for the federal government to investigate people who refuse to take a covid test? You can take the question along with pertinent evidence to a civil rights attorney.\n\nTo pick a [non\\-random hospital's web page](https://www.texashealth.org/Health-and-Wellness/Coronavirus/Common-Questions-During-Pregnancy-and-Birth), they note that \"Any person having surgery or a procedure, including birth, at a Texas Health hospital will be tested for COVID\\-19 to provide appropriate care for the patient, and for the protection of visitors and the care team\", and \"you will need to be tested at admission to help safeguard you and the care team\". In answer to the question whether you can decline testing, they say \"Testing is recommended to promote the health of you and your baby. Patients who have COVID\\-19 can have a weakened immune system and may have inflammatory symptoms that can compromise healing. We encourage you to speak with your provider about the best decision for you\", which doesn't explicitly say \"No you may not\", nor \"Yes, you may\". However, they cannot literally force you to take the test: at most, they can refuse to treat you.\n\nIn answer to the question \"Will I be separated from my baby if I test positive for COVID\\-19?\", they say \"Texas Health will follow guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of OB/GYN and the Centers for Disease Control for how to keep you and your baby safe during your hospital stay. Ultimately, any decisions about care for you and your baby will be between you and your provider, based on what is best for you both\". This is also not crystal clear.\n\nThere are three primary legal issues, putting a worst spin on their policy. They say up front that you will be tested prior to admission: the question is whether you can decline to take the test but force them to admit you. Now we are closer to the realm of a medical negligence attorney \u2013 they can refuse to treat you, but that might leave them liable.\n\nThe second question is whether they can temporarily take the infant away, against the mother's wishes (for example, hold the infant in a separate facility while the mother is in the hospital). The third question is whether they have direct authority to take the infant away when you leave the hospital. The third question gets a plain and simple no. The [Texas Dept. of Family and Protective Services](https://www.dfps.state.tx.us/Investigations/parents_guide_to_investigation.asp) has some authority in such a matter, but taking a child requires an investigation and a court order.",

They also cannot legally prevent the couple from taking their newborn home without proper legal procedures involving child protective services and a court order (ruling out option A). There is no law requiring hospitals to report test refusals to federal authorities (ruling out option D). However, the hospital does have the right to refuse treatment if a patient declines to follow their admission policies, which in this case includes COVID-19 testing.

This has been in the Constitution since the original ratification in 1789\\. But women's right to vote wasn't added to the Constitution until 1920\\. (The same contradiction also appears to exist for African Americans, who didn't have full voting rights until 1915\\.)\n\nWas it really intentional that women could be president from the beginning, but it took over 100 years for them to get the right to vote? Is there any reason why the Constitution was written this way?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Prior to the 14th and 15th amendments, the US Federal Constitution and the Federal laws passed under it neither **allowed** nor **denied** anyone the right to vote. The decisions on who would and would not be allowed to vote, including for members of Congress and for President, was wholly in the hands of the sates, and were regulated by the various state constitutions and laws. A few states permitted women to vote, and at least one permitted free blacks to vote, at least for a period of its history. The Federal government had nothing to say on the matter.\n\nIn at lesat one case the US Supreme Court refused to consider such a question. That was the case of [*Luther v. Borden*, 48 U.S. (7 How.) 1 (1849\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_v._Borden) which grew out of the [Dorr Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorr_Rebellion)\n\nThe state of Rhode Island, had retained its pre\\-revolutionary charter (dating from 1663\\) as its constitution, and required the ownership of a significant amount of landed property as a qualification to vote. The Wikipedia article on the rebellion (linked above) states:\n\n> By 1829, 60% of the state's free white men were ineligible to vote (women and most non\\-white men were prohibited from voting).\n\nIn 1841 a group led by Thomas Wilson Dorr held a convention to draft a new state Constitution, (known as the \"People's Constitution\"), and held ratifying votes on the draft. They declared that it had been approved by a majority of those qualified under the old laws as well as a majority of those voting and qualified under the new rules, and that it was therefore the valid constitution of the state. The old (charter) government said this was invalid and illegal. Attempts to establish the new government by force failed. However, a revised state constitution that greatly expanded voting rights was passed and took effect in 1843\\.\n\n*Luther v. Borden* was a case of trespass against members of the militia acting under the charter government, brought by a supporter of Dorr. The plaintiffs brought extensive evidence (over 150 pages) intended to establish that the Dorr or \"People's\" constitution had been validly ratified by a majority of voters, and that the old constitution had improperly restricted voting rights. The case went to the US Supreme Court, where Chief Justice Taney wrote in [the majority opinion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/48/1/):\n\n> The plaintiff contends that the charter government was displaced, and ceased to have any lawful power, after the organization, in May, 1842, of the government which he supported, and although that government never was able to exercise any authority in the State nor to command obedience to its laws or to its officers, yet he insists that it was the lawful and established government upon the ground that it was ratified by a large majority of the male people of the State of the age of twenty\\-one and upwards, and also by a majority of those who were entitled to vote for general officers under the then existing laws of the State.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> The point, then, raised here has been already decided by the courts of Rhode Island. The question relates altogether to the constitution and laws of that State, and the well settled rule in this court is that the courts of the United States adopt and follow the decisions of the State courts in questions which concern merely the constitution and laws of the State.\n> \n> \n> Besides, if the Circuit Court had entered upon this inquiry, by what rule could it have determined the qualification of voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution unless there was some previous law of the State to guide it? It is the province of a court to expound the law, not to make it. And certainly **it is no part of the judicial functions of any court of the United States to prescribe the qualification of voters in a State, giving the right to those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State, or taking it away from those to whom it is given**; nor has it the right to determine what political privileges the citizens of a State are entitled to, unless there is an established constitution or law to govern its decision. {*emphasis added*}\n\nThus, until the passage and ratification of the 14th and 15th amendments, which forbid states to deny the vote based on race, national origin, and a few other grounds, the Federal Constitution had nothing to say on the point. States were required to grant the right to vote to women by the 19th amendment in 1920, and the 26th (1971\\) prohibited denial on the ground of age to anyone 18 or older. The 24th (1964\\) prohibited denial for failure to pay a poll tax or any other tax. The 14th amendment has been held to guarantee the equal weight of votes, in what was at first known as the \"one man, one vote\" rule (later \"one person, one vote\") and has been used to overturn individual and group denials of voting rights. But there **were** no federal voting rights in the years before 1865\\.\n\nI am not aware of any writings by any of the \"founding fathers\" (say the members of the Constitutional Convention) that seriously discuss the possibility of a female President. But they did consider and endorse the possibility of a person being elected president who might not be qualified to vote in some of the states. They declined to impose, or permit Congress to impose, a property, or other variable, qualification on the president, even though many of the original states had property qualifications for voters. Options for this were proposed and voted down in the Convention's drafting process.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between voting rights and presidential eligibility in the early United States, according to the information provided?\n\nA) The Constitution explicitly granted women the right to be president while denying them the right to vote, demonstrating a deliberate inconsistency in the founders' vision.\n\nB) The federal government had full control over voting rights from the beginning, but chose not to extend suffrage to women and minorities until the 20th century.\n\nC) State governments initially determined voting rights, while the Constitution set separate eligibility criteria for the presidency, allowing for potential presidents who couldn't vote in some states.\n\nD) The Supreme Court regularly intervened to determine voting rights in states prior to the 14th and 15th Amendments, gradually expanding suffrage over time.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that initially, voting rights were determined entirely by state governments, not the federal government. The Constitution set specific eligibility criteria for the presidency (age, citizenship, residency) that were separate from voting rights. This meant it was possible for someone to be eligible for the presidency while being ineligible to vote in some states due to state-specific restrictions (such as property requirements).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Constitution did not explicitly grant or deny voting rights to any group initially. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because the federal government did not have control over voting rights at the beginning; this was left to the states.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the Supreme Court actually refused to intervene in state voting rights issues before the 14th and 15th Amendments, as exemplified by the Luther v. Borden case mentioned in the text."

But I can't even come up with proper, concise question to search for pre\\-existing answers in a meaningful way. I apologize because if you're reading this I do realize your time is valuable.\n\nIf anyone can help me even with just the proper framing and wording of the question, I can press ahead with answering it myself.\n\nQuestion: \nIf I have a existing property claim on roof damage from a hurricane in 2008 that was never paid, can I make a new claim on new damage now 7 years later? Does the insurance company have the right to reject it. \n\nDetails: \nBack at the time of the original claim, I wanted to upgrade my roof, so I was waiting to save up more money to add to the value of the claim and replace the roof. Metal instead of shingles. Insurance would not pay full value of the claim until I provided proof of actual repair. The original emergency claim adjuster told me over and over again that it's \"my money\" and there's no expiration on the payout. I called several years in a row to confirm this and was told the same thing. Then one year I was told no. State Farm said they are not required to pay the claim under Florida law. So I never replaced my roof. Now it's leaking after an intense storm (not a hurricane, yet possible to argue it was effect of tropical storm). I'm wondering if there are any loopholes or bureaucratic options that would recategorize my claim and allow me to collect full payment. \n\nDisclaimer(s): Yes yes yes I should have just taken the money and repaired the roof instead of trying to upgrade it, but the insurance rep told me again and again that it wouldn't expire, so I thought I was safe. Yes I would love to be able to do it over again and not be typing lengthy questions into StackExchange. \n\nThank you for your time and any help.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The old claim is probably barred by a state statute of limitations (best guess) and the adjuster was probably misleading in saying that you could wait for as long as you wanted to file a claim.\n\nYou almost certainly can file a claim for new damage, but the insurance company would probably be within its rights to limit its payout to damage actually caused by the new storm and not merely by your failure to repair your roof. And, the insurance company is probably not obligated to pay more than would be necessary to return your roof to the condition it was in before the new storm.",

Seven years later, the roof is leaking after an intense storm. Which of the following statements is most likely true regarding a new insurance claim?\n\nA) The homeowner can file a new claim and receive full compensation for both the old and new damage, as the original claim was never closed.\n\nB) The insurance company must honor the original claim from 2008 in addition to any new damage, as the adjuster said there was no expiration on the payout.\n\nC) The homeowner cannot file a new claim at all, as they failed to repair the roof after the original damage.\n\nD) The homeowner can file a new claim, but the insurance company may limit the payout to damage caused only by the recent storm and not for pre-existing damage.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because while the homeowner can file a new claim for the recent storm damage, the insurance company is likely within its rights to limit the payout to only the new damage caused by the recent storm. The old claim from 2008 is probably barred by the statute of limitations, and the insurance company is not obligated to pay for damage resulting from the homeowner's failure to repair the roof after the original incident. The insurance company would typically only be responsible for returning the roof to its condition immediately before the new storm, not for cumulative damage over the years."

Even on private property, it's not permissible to set up devices intended to cause damage or injury to trespassers or their property. The nails serve no purpose other than to potentially harm people or damage vehicles, which crosses the line into booby trap territory. While property owners can take reasonable measures to protect their property (such as installing visible fences or barriers), any hidden danger designed to cause harm or damage is generally illegal. The fact that it's on private property or that it might not severely injure a person wearing shoes doesn't make it legal. The intent to cause damage or potential harm is what makes it unlawful."

The parties may depart from the *literal* language of the contract as long as their departure does not defeat the purpose or intent of that contract. Unless prescribed differently, the principle of \"*strict construction*\" would equally constrain the conduct of *all* the parties to the contract.\n\n[*Contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) disfavors *only* the party who drafted a contract. The doctrine is applicable where the language of a clause is simultaneously consistent with reasonable interpretations which would lead to opposite outcomes.\n\nThe rationale behind *contra proferentem* is that the party who drafted the contract is presumed to outweigh the counterparty in terms of bargaining power. Thus, the doctrine seeks to somehow compensate that disparity in bargaining power whereas there is no element of compensation in the principle of \"*\\[no] strict construction*\".\n\nNote that the excerpt you posted in regard to *contra proferentem* is contradictory. By definition, *contra proferentem* entails a disadvantage to the party who drafted the provision at issue. Instead, the first sentence in the excerpt should state something in the sense of \"*No contra proferentem*\" or \"*Invalidation of contra proferentem*\".",

The question about Hungary changing its laws to criminalize illegal entry further emphasizes that different countries may handle this issue differently, and that the legal status of unauthorized presence can change over time.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A supermarket offers small, flimsy bags for free at the produce section for customers to use when selecting fruits and vegetables. A customer, Sarah, decides to use these bags for her entire shopping trip to avoid paying for larger carrier bags. The store manager confronts Sarah, stating that the free bags are only for produce. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal and ethical considerations of this situation?\n\nA) Sarah is within her rights to use the free bags for any purpose once she has made a produce purchase, as the bags become her property.\n\nB) The store has no legal grounds to restrict the use of the free bags once they are given to customers, regardless of whether a produce purchase was made.\n\nC) The store can legally prohibit the use of produce bags for non-produce items, as the bags are provided conditionally with the purchase of fruits and vegetables.\n\nD) Sarah can use the bags for any purpose as long as she eventually purchases some produce, even if it's after using the bags for other items.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the free bags are provided conditionally with the purchase of produce, not as a general giveaway. The store has the right to set conditions on the use of items provided as part of a specific transaction or service. The bags are included at no additional charge with qualified purchases (fresh produce), similar to a \"buy one, get one free\" offer where the free item is tied to a specific purchase. The store can legally and ethically restrict the use of these bags to their intended purpose. Options A and D are incorrect because they assume ownership without meeting the condition of produce purchase. Option B is incorrect as it ignores the conditional nature of the offer. This question tests understanding of conditional offers, property rights, and business practices in retail settings."

In order to do so he must sign a warrant of a certain prescribed form, and upon the act taking effect minister of Justice Alex Avery exercises his power to condemn citizen Bob Bolger to removal of his bollocks. He does everything exactly to the letter of ABRA 2023, but in exercising the power created and granted to him by ABRA, he is clearly violating several of Bob\u2019s human rights, not least Articles 3\\&6\\.\n\n(Note that HRA 1998 is a constitutional act.)\n\nIs there not some doctrine which suggests that Minister Avery as a government official must not act in ways which contravene citizens\u2019 human rights?\n\nBob applies thus for judicial review of Minister Avery\u2019s decision to issue the ABRA warrant for his arbitrary castration, on grounds that his decision to exercise the power given to him by ABRA has the effect of violating Bob\u2019s human rights.\n\nYet, one may also perhaps quite easily argue that the power bestowed on the government by ABRA inherently violates, and cannot but violate, its subjects\u2019 human rights, and so it cannot be exercised without violating subject citizens\u2019 human rights.\n\nPerhaps, as per a different answer by Dale M., the UK judiciary may not nullify ABRA itself, but can it reverse any particular decisions by relevant government ministers to actually exercise the powers bestowed to them by the Act\u2019s provisions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: None",

In the UK legal system, while courts do not have the power to strike down primary legislation like ABRA, they can review and potentially reverse specific decisions made by government officials under such laws if those decisions violate human rights. This is consistent with the principle of parliamentary sovereignty and the role of judicial review in the UK.\n\nOption A is incorrect because UK courts cannot nullify Acts of Parliament due to the principle of parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nOption B is wrong because following the letter of the law does not exempt ministerial decisions from judicial review, especially when human rights are at stake.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the Human Rights Act 1998 is important, it does not automatically override subsequent legislation. Courts must try to interpret laws in a way that is compatible with human rights, but cannot strike down primary legislation."

(In either of the aforementioned jurisdictions)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My understanding is that this isn't a contractual term, but rather a warning that the items don't satisfy legal requirements for individual sale. The seller and manufacturer likely don't care whether you resell the items, but the government does.\n\nIn the US, at least, regulations of the Food and Drug Administration require that (with certain exceptions) food items sold at retail must be marked with a Nutrition Facts label, showing calorie counts, fat and sugar content, and so on. The FDA has [information](https://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/ucm2006828.htm) on this requirement, including citations to the relevant sections of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\nFor example, if you buy a big multipack of tiny (\"fun size\") candy bars, the manufacturer usually won't have printed Nutrition Facts on each candy bar's wrapper (because it's too small). There will instead be a label on the outer bag. As such, you can't legally resell the candy bars individually, because they don't meet labeling requirements.\n\nIn fact, in the FDA page I linked above, you can see that manufacturers are *required* to print \"This unit not labeled for retail sale\" on individual items if they don't have Nutrition Facts labels.

Each snack cake in the multipack is marked \"Not for individual resale.\" The owner decides to sell these snack cakes individually at a markup. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The manufacturer can sue the store owner for breach of contract because \"Not for individual resale\" is a binding contractual term.\n\nB) There are no legal implications as long as the store owner discloses to customers that the items came from a multipack.\n\nC) The store owner may be violating government regulations, specifically FDA labeling requirements for individual food items.\n\nD) The action is legal as long as the store owner keeps the original multipack packaging available for customer inspection.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The phrase \"Not for individual resale\" is not primarily a contractual term between the manufacturer and the buyer, but rather a warning about regulatory compliance. In the US, the FDA requires that individually sold food items have specific labeling, including Nutrition Facts. Items in multipacks often lack this individual labeling, making their separate sale potentially illegal under FDA regulations. The store owner selling these items individually could be violating these government regulations, not a contract with the manufacturer. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they misinterpret the nature and implications of the \"Not for individual resale\" notice."

This is not the approach I am interested in taking. As a capable technical writer, I am interested in establishing the beliefs and practices of such an organized religion in such a way as to demonstrate sincere and safe religious practice up front.

The cases of Santo Daime and UDV churches gaining legal recognition through federal court cases, rather than automatic protection, suggest that each new religious use would likely require its own legal battle or specific legislative action. The passage states that to establish a new religiously-based exemption to the Controlled Substances Act, one would have to \"try, sue, or otherwise force Congress to develop additional exceptions.\" This aligns with option C, indicating that recognition requires case-by-case litigation or legislative action."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a courtroom setting, what is the most accurate description of the expected behavior between opposing lawyers who have not previously met in person?\n\nA) They should maintain a cold and distant demeanor to show loyalty to their clients.\nB) They are expected to be openly hostile towards each other to demonstrate their commitment to the case.\nC) They should approach each other, shake hands, and engage in polite small talk, treating the interaction as a professional courtesy.\nD) They must avoid any interaction whatsoever to prevent the appearance of impropriety.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, it is common and expected for opposing lawyers to be collegial and friendly with each other, even if they have only communicated formally before. This behavior is compared to other professions where practitioners share common interests and are generally friendly with colleagues. The documentation emphasizes that it's the clients who have a dispute, not the lawyers themselves. Therefore, approaching each other, shaking hands, and engaging in polite small talk is considered a normal professional courtesy in a courtroom setting. Options A, B, and D all describe behaviors that would be considered unprofessional or unnecessarily adversarial in this context."

There may or may not be a license or implied license to use the material, or the use may be \"fair use\".

So, unless you fall within an exception to a copyright violation, you are infringing.\n\nThe fact that your otherwise infringing work is used to make a profit for yourself, weakens the case that fair use or an implied license authorizes you to do so, but even without receiving any money, you could very well be infringing anyway.",

While not owning the copyright is a key consideration, it's not the only one. There may be licenses or implied licenses that allow certain uses. The concept of \"fair use\" might also apply, depending on how the game elements are used in the artwork. The fact that the creator is potentially profiting from the work (even through voluntary tips) could weaken a fair use argument, but doesn't automatically make it illegal. Each case would need to be evaluated based on its specific circumstances, considering factors like the nature of the use, the amount of copyrighted material used, and the effect on the market for the original work."

Using deception to get someone to open the door so that you can execute a warrant is okay (United States v. Contreras\\-Ceballos, 999 F.2d 432\\). Leading a criminal to believe that you are a crime\\-customer (e.g. for purposes of a drug sale) and not a police officer is okay (Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206\\), but must be limited to the purposes contemplated by the suspect and cannot turn into a general search. Lying about whether you have a warrant is not okay (Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, Hadley v. Williams, 368 F.3d 747\\), nor is it okay to lie about the scope of a warrant (United States v. Dichiarinte, 445 F.2d 126\\).

Indeed, its intention feels morally wrong (not that that is any part of my question).\n\nMy question is \\- does the existence of that part make any difference to their legal recourse to actions of my own.\n\nBtw: I actually like Amazon at this time and have no intention to attempt to disparage them. My question is purely about the legal status of this clause.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does this non disparagement clause have any legal standing?\n\nEnforcement of that clause has its limitations. The keywords in the clause are *disparage* and *discredit*, each of which warrants a separate analysis.\n\n[Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines *disparagement* \\[of goods] as:\n\n> A statement about a competitor's goods which is untrue or misleading\n> and is made to influence or tends to influence the public not to buy.\n\nThat excerpt from the legal definition is the relevant one insofar as the clause is in terms of suppliers' trademarks and the \"*product\\[s] or service\\[s]*\" they offer.\n\nFrom this legal definition, it follows that the non\\-disparagement portion of the clause is enforceable only if (1\\) the source of the statement is an Amazon's competitor, (2\\) the statement is about goods or services offered by Amazon, and (3\\) those statements are untrue or misleading *and* \\-\\-potentially or actually\\-\\- detrimental to Amazon's interests as competitor. Whether or not the publisher qualifies as Amazon's competitor will depend on the factual details. Other than that, competitors' statements about Amazon but *unrelated to* Amazon's products or services are beyond the scope of item (2\\).\n\nAs for *discrediting*, the clause is tantamount to stipulating to a [gag order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_order) regardless of how nefarious Amazon's conduct could be. That overly broad portion of the clause can be stricken as null and void to the extent that it is contrary to public policy. See [Restatement (Second) of Contracts](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/restatement-second-contracts.html) at \u00a7178\\. The public's awareness of a party's misconduct is very likely to supersede parties' interest in the enforcement of that clause.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal analysis of Amazon's non-disparagement clause, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The clause is fully enforceable and prevents any negative statements about Amazon, regardless of their truth or the speaker's relationship to Amazon.\n\nB) The clause is only enforceable against Amazon's competitors when they make untrue or misleading statements about Amazon's products or services that could harm Amazon's interests.\n\nC) The clause is unenforceable in its entirety due to its broad language and potential conflict with public policy.\n\nD) The clause is enforceable against anyone who makes any negative statement about Amazon, but only if the statement is proven to be false.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The analysis indicates that the non-disparagement portion of the clause is enforceable only under specific conditions. It applies to Amazon's competitors making untrue or misleading statements about Amazon's products or services that could potentially or actually harm Amazon's interests. The \"discrediting\" portion of the clause is considered overly broad and likely unenforceable as it conflicts with public policy. Option A is incorrect because the clause is not fully enforceable in all cases. Option C is incorrect because parts of the clause are enforceable under certain conditions. Option D is too broad, as the clause primarily applies to competitors, not just anyone, and specifically relates to statements about products or services."

I asked him, if he would tell me in advance the price, if I have to pay something. He answered, \"Of course.\" I also asked him, if he was in\\-network with my dental insurance company. He answered, \"Yes.\"\n\nHe billed $118 to the insurance company for a liquid that I thought it was mouth wash. The dental insurance paid $43, and I got a letter from the dentist that I have to pay the difference, $75\\.\n\nAs he never told me the price in advance, should I have to pay? If not, what would I need to do?\n\nAt this time, my plan is to pay, and look for a different dentist.\n\nThe only reason that I am thinking to do that is because I think that if I do not pay my credit score would be damaged. Also, hiring a lawyer would be more expensive.\n\nHowever, I feel that he broke our contract not telling me the price in advance. I do not think that is reasonable $118 for a liquid that I thought was mouth wash. What can you tell me?\n\nI found a question, that even though is not the exact case, gave me a lot of information.\n\n[Can a dentist charge for a treatment without written paperwork?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8345/can-a-dentist-charge-for-a-treatment-without-written-paperwork)\n\nAdditionally to the fluoride, that is the name of the liquid, he charged for X rays and the cleaning what was covered by the dental insurance. My previous dentist uses 45 minutes for the cleaning. This dentist used only 15 minutes.\n\nMy previous dentists never charged me for this \"treatment.\" I think that what this dentist is doing is illegal, but is it illegal?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> As he never told me the price in advance, should I have to pay?\n\nApparently yes. The fact that the dentist answered that he would tell you *in advance* the price, and yet you allowed him to do the job without him doing so reflects that you knowingly waived the opportunity to timely get that information. In terms of the [Restatement (Second) of Contracts](http://www.oneclubofjusticides.com/p/restatement-second-contracts.html) at \u00a7 154(b), that is called \\*Bear\\[ing] the Risk of a Mistake.\n\n> I do not think that is reasonable $118 for a liquid that I thought was mouth wash. What can you tell me?\n\nOne *prima facie* element of *fraud* is the plaintiff's *reasonable reliance* on the defendant's misrepresentations. The question is *what* made you think you were acquiring mouth wash when it appears that (1\\) there was little to no communication between you and the dentist, and (2\\) you made no actual attempt to inquire of him so as to make an informed decision. These circumstances weaken your ability to prove that you *reasonably relied* on whatever \\[mis\\-]representations (if any) the dentist might have made to you.\n\nIn a context of omission or concealment of information by the dentist, you would have to prove that the dentist failed his *duty* to make the pertinent disclosure(s). This is known as *silent fraud*. However, it is unclear from your description whether or not the matter amounts to some dentist's duty in this regard.\n\nIt *might* help to argue position from the standpoint of dentist's *unfair and deceptive practice(s)*, a matter which is legislated in pretty much every state in the U.S. But you need to be mindful of the aforementioned obstacles, and persuade that the dentist *de facto* misled you.\n\n> Also, hiring a lawyer would be more expensive.\n\nFor sure. But the amount at issue would have to be litigated in Small Claims court, where [attorneys are generally not allowed](https://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/small_claims/basic_info.shtml).\n\n> My previous dentist uses 45 minutes for the cleaning. This dentist used only 15 minutes.\n\nThis comparison in and of itself is irrelevant because one goes to the dentist for a service to be performed, not for a requisite minimum of dentist's time.\n\nThe relevance of time spent on you lies mostly in proving that the dentist was negligent, careless, etc., and resulted in a service that was detrimental to you\\[r health].",

According to the legal information provided, the patient bears the risk of mistake in this situation. By allowing the dentist to proceed with treatment without insisting on getting the promised price information in advance, the patient effectively waived their opportunity to be informed of costs beforehand. This aligns with the Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 154(b), which discusses bearing the risk of a mistake. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the lack of a written estimate doesn't automatically invalidate the charge, especially since the patient proceeded with treatment without insisting on the promised price information.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while silent fraud is mentioned, the information provided doesn't definitively establish that the dentist had a duty to disclose all potential charges beyond what was asked.\n\nOption D is incorrect because comparing practices to a previous dentist is noted as irrelevant in determining the validity of charges.

If an eCommerce company attempts to sue a customer for initiating a chargeback, even if it violates their terms of service, they are likely to face significant consequences. This action would typically violate the merchant account agreement with the credit card company. As a result, not only would the company likely lose the lawsuit, but they would also risk having their merchant account terminated. This could effectively put them out of business, especially for smaller eCommerce sites that lack the bargaining power of major players like Amazon or eBay. The other options are incorrect because: A) The company is unlikely to win such a lawsuit due to the protections offered by credit card companies to consumers; B) While they may lose the lawsuit, the consequences would likely extend beyond just losing the case; and D) Credit card companies generally do not penalize customers for initiating chargebacks, as this is considered a consumer protection feature."

I'm wondering if there is an efficient way to search through the session laws to find where the related session law is which corresponds to a codified law. Often, the session laws are titled something that may not contain a relatable key word. And they're ordered chronologically. I'm mainly interested in seeing the progression of a chaptered statute as it is changed over many years or even decades and possibly centuries. I'm sure there's an old fashioned way of doing this search and a new technologically improved way, too. I suppose I would need to know both, depending on how far back in history I wish to be looking.\n\nThe reason I am looking is because I am looking for evidence of intent for when the law was created. \n\nIf this is a question that will only be answerable in a jurisdiction\\-specific way, then I'm asking about Maine and the Federal Government.\n\n(No, I am not in school, and no this is not my homework.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best place to find intent is the legislative history, and you're right, the session laws' text or even its bill numbers are not printed in the history of the statute (and are titled and chartered differently). They are much more difficult to research than statutes. In the notation after the statute, sometimes, in some states, it will list the session laws in order from the first enactment through all of its legislative changes to its current form. And then you can backtrack.\n\nThat said if you're not using a professional search site, there is nearly no way to just find them through a Google or Findlaw search. Some states may assign an archaic system to their indexing. I've seen, where it will have state abbreviation, say MA, the year, 2012, then the actual numerical filing order, then the session \u2013 e.g., MA12\\-3694\\-1\\. However, to find the legislative session, you need to use a Boolean logic search on Lexis or West, or use your local law librarian. Also, many states legislative webpages now have them. You can use Lexis and Westlaw at the law library, for free.\n\nIf you don't have a professional search engine, you can use one at any local law library.\n\n### BASIC RESEARCH STEPS\n\n1. Identify the state Code section you wish to research.\n2. Find which session law created the language.\n3. Determine which bill created the law.\n4. Trace the procedural history of the bill during its passage.\n\nThen, at the law library, you can read the various discussions on the floor relating to intent, as well as listen to the hearings on audio for more recent enactments (past 50 years or so). This is especially useful if it was a contested bill or if it was brought about by some sort of social or political climate at the time. In some places, for instance where I live, if you call your court's law library the librarian will compile it for you if you know the statute for which you want the legislative history searched. I've done that many times and they don't mind doing it.",

This is fleshed out in [34 CFR 99](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr99_main_02.tpl), and starting with \u00a799\\.30, there is extensive regulation of disclosing information. A university will (or should) then articulate privacy policies that say what employees may and may not do. Typically, universities impose ludicrous restrictions in order to cover their back pockets. (Following the letter of the rules, my university requires professors who communicate on academic matters with students, using email, that they do so on campus, using campus computers, sending to and from official university email addresses, and the email is to be encrypted \u2013 AFAIK this requirement is never obeyed).\n\nIt is not inconceivable that some university has a privacy policy that fails to expressly forbid posting information about the student. (It is even possible that there has been a legal development whereby such behavior is now allowed). It can be difficult to determine what those internal policies are, i.e. they may be buried in a big pile with other information, it may be called something else like \"institutional data policy\"; the online version of the policy is often not findable due to dead links. Typically, the Registrar can provide the desired information.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A university professor posts a gradebook online where students can find their grades by looking up their student ID numbers. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this practice?\n\nA) This practice is always permissible under federal law as long as student names are not directly linked to the ID numbers.\n\nB) The legality of this practice depends primarily on the specific policies implemented by the university to comply with federal regulations.\n\nC) Posting grades linked to student ID numbers is explicitly forbidden by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA).\n\nD) Professors have full discretion in how they share grade information, regardless of university policies.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The legality of posting grades linked to student ID numbers depends primarily on the specific policies implemented by the university to comply with federal regulations. As explained in the documentation, federal law (20 USC 1232g) requires institutions to establish policies that protect student privacy. These policies are typically based on federal regulations (34 CFR 99) but may vary between institutions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while removing names helps, it may not be sufficient if university policy prohibits linking grades to ID numbers. \n\nOption C is too absolute; FERPA doesn't explicitly forbid this practice, but rather requires institutions to implement their own privacy policies. \n\nOption D is incorrect because professors are bound by university policies, which are designed to comply with federal regulations.\n\nThe key point is that the university's specific policies, which should align with federal regulations, determine what practices are permissible for sharing grade information."

In this case, the waitress sued her employer for fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of contract based on a verbal promise, even though it was not part of a formal employment contract. The case was settled in favor of the employee, allowing her to receive the promised prize (a Toyota car). This shows that employees may have legal recourse when employers make false promises, even if they are not written in a formal contract. It's important to note that while not all verbal promises will necessarily result in successful lawsuits, this case illustrates that there can be legal consequences for employers who engage in deceptive practices or make false representations to their employees."

This would mean that the court would give greater deference to that decision; however, applying the principle is a matter of administrative preference to save resources of the court. Whether or not the other judge would reconsider the matter would be within their discretion absent binding authority to the contrary as a \u201claw of the case\u201d is not binding.\n\nIn fact, even if it would have been the same judge with the exact same facts deciding the matter in a final judgement, there wouldn\u2019t be much to do. One could argue that deciding differently is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment which, if the judge fails to explain the different decision on the exact same facts may have a reasonable probability to get overturned provided the unconstitutionality finding was correct in the first place.\n\nIf the matter was, in fact, unconstitutional, appeals may overturn a contrary judgement if the issue is brought up in the lower court and enters the court record.

As stated in the documentation, a local county judge's decision is generally not binding on the judgment of another judge unless it comes from an appellate division.

Smith promptly hires a tree service to remove the damaged tree entirely. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) By removing the tree, Smith has automatically admitted liability for the damage to Jones' property.\n\nB) Smith's decision to remove the tree cannot be used as evidence of liability in court, but may be admissible to demonstrate that removal was possible.\n\nC) Local ordinances always take precedence over state laws and common law rules in cases involving border trees.\n\nD) If the branch was healthy before the storm, Smith is automatically liable for the damage because the tree was partially on his property.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, many jurisdictions prohibit the admission of evidence of subsequent remedial acts (such as removing the tree) to show liability. However, such evidence might be admissible to show that it was possible to take action. This aligns with the statement in option B.\n\nOption A is incorrect because removing the tree does not automatically admit liability, especially given the rules about subsequent remedial acts.\n\nOption C is false because the law regarding border trees is described as involving a complex interplay of local ordinances, state laws, and common law rules, without a clear hierarchy always being present.\n\nOption D is incorrect because liability typically depends on whether the property owner was negligent in maintaining the tree, not on automatic liability for trees partially on one's property. In the case of a healthy branch and an extraordinary storm, negligence would usually not be found.\n\nThis question tests understanding of multiple legal concepts, including evidence rules, property law, and the complexities of tree-related disputes between neighbors."

Using some small excerpts from the books may be okay, but using *all of them* probably not.\n\nOne mitigating factor: The effect upon the market could be argued to be small, since you will not publish the illustrations, and the Dr Seuss books are arguable quite incomplete without them.\n\nIn summary: You may get lucky with the fair use defense, but I would not count on it. Using the book texts for research yourself could be okay, but publishing it most likely is not.\n\n---\n\nAdditional reading:\n\nThe article [Text and Data Mining and Fair Use in the United States](http://www.arl.org/storage/documents/TDM-5JUNE2015.pdf) addresses your problem, and mentions some court cases.

The amount of copyrighted material used is a key factor in fair use determination, and using entire books goes beyond what's typically considered acceptable. Even though it's for research and doesn't include illustrations, using complete texts of multiple books would likely exceed fair use limits. The non-profit nature of the project helps, but isn't sufficient on its own to guarantee fair use protection.

If the house is on a multi\\-acre lot and is not visible from any public roads, what business is it of the town, how big an addition is? It seems like interfering with building for the sake of being nosy and interfering. Since it costs money and time to seek such approvals, it is a real cost being imposed.\n\nIs this kind of rule illegal, can I contest it in court, or do towns have the right to make arbitrary or pointless zoning restrictions at their whim?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is this kind of rule illegal, can I contest it in court, or do towns\n>  have the right to make arbitrary or pointless zoning restrictions at\n>  their whim?\n\nThis kind of rule is completely legal. You could sue, but you would almost certainly lose. Generally speaking, towns have the right to make arbitrary or pointless zoning restrictions at their whim. This general rule is subject only to some very narrow exceptions:\n\n1. They can't totally ban any particular kind of first amendment activity, although they can regulate time, place and manner (e.g. they can't completely ban topless establishments or churches or political gathering places, although they can say where these establishments can be located).\n2. The regulations can't discriminate on their face on the basis of race or national origin, even though they can have a discriminatory effect that isn't the principal purpose of the regulations.\n3. The town's regulations can't leave property with no economically viable use whatsoever without paying compensation to the owner.\n4. The town must be able to articulate some basis for the zoning restriction, but pretty much any explanation whatsoever will do (which is to say that this kind of law is subject to the rational basis test).\n5. There are meaningful limitations arising under federal law regarding the extent to which manufactured housing can be treated differently than conventionally build housing under the regulations. In practice, it is easy to adopt neutral regulations that make manufactured housing (i.e. trailer parks) uneconomic.\n6. There are federal regulations that prohibit zoning laws from banning satellite dishes.\n7. Zoning laws can't be changed retroactively. In other words, once something is built that conforms to current zoning laws, it is \"grandfathered\" notwithstanding future changes in the zoning laws, until the building at the site is destroyed or substantially renovated, except in the case of some very extreme and urgent health and safety threats.\n\nSubstantive state regulation of zoning laws is pretty much non\\-existent, although state law may set forth a particular process that must be followed or require the regulations to fit a general template applicable in the state. Usually, however, states don't limit the authority of states to regulate land use at all. Where there is state regulation, this usually prevents regulation of something specific (e.g. political advertisements, a \"right to farm\" provision, prohibiting bans on xeriscaping, etc.).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small town in rural America has implemented a zoning ordinance that requires planning board approval for any home addition exceeding 500 square feet, regardless of property size or visibility from public roads. A homeowner with a 10-acre lot, whose house is not visible from any public road, wants to build a 600 square foot addition without seeking approval. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and potential challenge of this zoning ordinance?\n\nA) The ordinance is likely illegal because it interferes with property rights on large, secluded lots and can be successfully challenged in court.\n\nB) The ordinance is legal, but the homeowner can challenge it based on the rational basis test, as the town cannot articulate any reasonable explanation for the restriction.\n\nC) The ordinance is legal and would likely withstand a court challenge, as towns generally have broad authority to implement zoning restrictions, even if they seem arbitrary.\n\nD) The ordinance is illegal because it discriminates against large property owners and violates their First Amendment rights.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As stated in the provided information, towns generally have the right to make zoning restrictions, even if they seem arbitrary or pointless. The ordinance in question does not violate any of the narrow exceptions mentioned (e.g., it doesn't discriminate based on race, completely ban a type of first amendment activity, or leave the property with no economically viable use). While the homeowner might find the restriction unnecessary or intrusive, courts typically defer to local governments on zoning matters unless they fall under specific exceptions. The town would likely be able to articulate some basis for the restriction, which would satisfy the rational basis test. Therefore, although the homeowner might disagree with the ordinance, it would likely be considered legal and withstand a court challenge."

The X is then modified to include a Youtube video using `<iframe>` element. (Youtube is used here as an example only. This question is about combining content from multiple different hosts in general.)\n\nIt seems that commonly *believed* solution is to require Cookie Consent on the host page. **Why?** The cookie is not set by the host document server. Its value cannot ever be seen by the server providing the host document for the `<iframe>` element even if the server administrator wanted to monitor their users.\n\nTo me, the obvious solution to the problem is that if *the embedded document* wants to save non\\-necessary cookies, *it* should provide the cookie consent before storing such cookies.\n\n**Are there any prior decisions in some jurisdiction that specify that *host document* should request the cookie consent instead?** And if so, how the host document is supposed to transfer information about this consent to embedded content hosting server? It doesn't sound reasonable to me that if your document is embbedded in a `<iframe>` element, you don't ever need the consent to set non\\-necessary cookies.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The **data controller** is responsible for GDPR compliance. For embedded content, case law such as the Fashion ID case indicates a **joint controllership** where both the controller of the embedding page and the controller of the embedded content are controllers. However, one can only be controller for processing activities where one has influence on the means and purposes of processing. So the controller of the embedding page is a controller with respect to the act of embedding (with purposes like *showing a video*), but they wouldn't be a controller for subsequent processing by that embedded content (with purposes like *tracking people across the web*).\n\nFor determining who is a controller, it is not too helpful to look at which servers sent which HTTP headers. Instead, look at which processing activities occur, for what purposes that processing is carried out, and who had input to determining these purposes. Those (natural or legal) persons are data controllers and are therefore responsible for compliance.\n\nWhat does this mean for the example of embedding a Youtube video, Tweet, or Like button?\n\nThe **controller of the embedding page** needs a legal basis for sharing visitor's personal data with the embed provider. Such a sharing is inevitable due to the embedding, regardless of whether cookies are involved. Typically, the legal basis used here would be consent: in place of the embed, a placeholder is shown that lets visitors opt in to loading the content. In some cases, a legitimate interest argument might also work.\n\nWhether the embedded content ends up using cookies is outside of the embedding page's control. Thus, I would think the **controller of the embedded content** would be the sole controller with respect to these cookies. Of course, no consent is required for the use of cookies when this use is strictly necessary to provide the service requested by the user, e.g. to add a video to a logged\\-in user's Youtube history.\n\nThe **joint controllers** can divide up compliance obligations among themselves. For example, the provider of the embed content could likely require embedders to collect necessary consents prior to embedding (Twitter has similar terms). However, this would be risky for the controller because controllers shall be able to demonstrate that valid consent was actually given.\n\nSo in **conclusion**, I largely agree with your analysis that the provider of the embedded content should consider cookie consent. With two caveats: the controllers might have an agreement that moves this responsibility to the embedder, and the embedding data controller might need consent to embed the content in the first place.",

The website itself doesn't use any non-essential cookies. According to GDPR regulations and relevant case law, who is responsible for obtaining user consent for any non-essential cookies that may be set by the embedded YouTube content?\n\nA) Only the website owner, as they are solely responsible for all content on their site\nB) Only YouTube, as they are setting the cookies through their embedded content\nC) Both the website owner and YouTube are jointly responsible, but for different aspects of data processing\nD) Neither party is responsible, as embedded content is exempt from GDPR regulations\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Fashion ID case and the concept of joint controllership under GDPR, both the website owner (who embeds the content) and YouTube (who provides the embedded content) have responsibilities, but for different aspects of data processing.\n\nThe website owner is considered a data controller for the act of embedding the video and sharing visitor data with YouTube. They would need a legal basis (typically consent) for this sharing of data, which occurs regardless of cookie usage.\n\nYouTube, as the provider of the embedded content, would be the controller responsible for any non-essential cookies set by their content. They would need to ensure compliance with GDPR for these cookies.\n\nWhile the two parties could potentially have an agreement that shifts some responsibilities (e.g., YouTube requiring embedders to collect consent), both parties remain controllers for their respective areas of influence over data processing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the responsibility. Option B fails to acknowledge the website owner's role as a controller. Option D is incorrect as embedded content is not exempt from GDPR regulations."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It's very rare for players to hit the jackpot on a slot machine. Can a casino make sure they never have to pay that out by having the machines \"malfunction\" to display a larger\\-than\\-maximum amount in those rare cases, and then avoid having to pay out anything close to the maximum, while still retaining all the player losses? \n\nExample stories where the answer seems to be \"yes\" can be found with [Katrina Bookman](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/15/news/jackpot-steak-dinner-katrina-bookman-lawsuit/index.html) or [Pauline McKee](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-iowa-casino-error-20150424-story.html). Both played the slots at casinos that kept the players' losses, until they were notified by slot machine hardware that they'd won \\>$40M. Then the casinos pointed to signs \u201cMalfunction voids all pays and plays,\u201d and claimed that since the machines were malfunctioning, the casino didn't have to pay more than a couple dollars. The Iowa Supreme Court agreed with the casino in McKee's case and the New York State Gaming Commission agreed with the casino in Bookman's.\n\nIn [the words of Bookman's lawyer](http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens-casino-told-woman-43m-prize-slot-machine-malfunction-article-1.2854392), \"the casino used the same broken machine to take money from players, and that everyone who used the machine should at least get their money back...Doesn\u2019t that mean a place can claim a machine is broken every time somebody wins?\" That is the question here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the case of [McKee v. Isle of Capri Casinos](http://www.iowacourts.gov/About_the_Courts/Supreme_Court/Supreme_Court_Opinions/Recent_Opinions/20150424/14-0802.pdf), we can tell because that case has been legally decided. As the court says, there was a contract and \"the patron was not entitled to the bonus under those rules\", and plaintiff \"failed to prove the necessary elements of either promissory or equitable estoppel\". They did not \"represent to her that a bonus would be available if she played the \ngame\", and did not \"promise to pay the $41 million after the notice was displayed\".\n\nThe (very complex) rules of the game are easily available on the machine, and there is a prominent disclaimer that \"MALFUNCTION VOIDS ALL PAYS AND PLAYS\". Under the rules, the winning configuration stated that she was entitled to $1\\.85\\. The problem was that it also announced \"Bonus Award \\- $41797550\\.16\". This was due to an inexplicable software error which in communicating with the central computer awarded a \"legacy bonus\", which is no part of the game in question. The maximum legacy bonus is $99999\\.99; the manufacturer knows of the possibility of this kind of error and has implemented a fix that is thought to eliminate the problem.\n\nThe first point then is that the casino didn't just claim there was a malfunction, they proved that there was one. Second, the terms of the contract hold: she was entitled to $1\\.85, and the extraneous message was not part of the contract. That is, she did not actually win the large payout, the malfunction was in saying that she received a bonus. If a patron could likewise prove that they had actually won but the machine malfunctioned to represent the situation as a loss, they would of course be entitled to the appropriate winnings. The problem simply resides in the difficulty of a patron proving that.",

In trademark law, especially in the U.S. (which may provide insight into other jurisdictions), rights can be established through use even without registration.

Under U.S. federal law, specifically 18 USC 2252 and 18 USC 2251, it is illegal to distribute any visual depiction of a minor (defined as anyone under 18) engaging in sexually explicit conduct, regardless of who is distributing the material or the current age of the person depicted. The law does not make exceptions for cases where the person in the images is now an adult or is the one distributing the images. The prohibition applies even if the distribution is within a single state, as it's considered to be \"affecting interstate commerce.\" The fact that the person took the photos themselves when they were a minor does not create an exception to the law."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I am an owner of a site, I can place restrictions on its usage even if the site software is licensed under an open source license such as GPL or AGPL, right? Which law allows me to place such restrictions? For example, I can disallow uploading porn to my site, right? I can forbid circumventing site payment system, such as by distributing site passwords to other users or by modifying (I think, it's called \"hacking\") the site scripts, right?\n\nDo I have similar rights for an open source smart contract created and uploaded to public servers by me? Can I legally disallow certain usages of smart contract (such as retrieving data from it directly to download a paid file for free bypassing my user interface software)?\n\nNote that I realize I have no rights to restrict usage of my source code of a smart contract, because it is open source. I ask about a particular instance of smart contract running (similarly to a particular site running on a particular domain not to its underlying open source software).\n\nSmart contract is a computer program that runs on servers (you can assume they are third\\-party servers) with the purpose to controls possible actions (such as money transfers) and disallow certain kinds of actions (like uncompensated money transfers).\n\nI suspect it is something related to \"terms of service\". Can I apply terms of service to a running instance of a smart contact? I think, the main question is whether I am considered a service provider for the services provided by a smart contract: I spin it once and then the smart contract runs without my intervention (it is even not possible for me to stop my smart contract running, but I can for example change the amount of the monetary fee for its usage) on third\\-party servers.\n\nThere is a thing (securing a public file) that I cannot restrict with logic of a smart contact. So I am seeking a legal (\"if you violate, I can sue\") way to disallow these actions.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Terms of service are contracts, where you grant a person a right in exchange for them doing something. If they have agreed but violate the terms, you may have legal recourse to sue them; or you can \"undo\" their action, e.g. you can delete porn that they uploaded. There are certain limitations on your recourse, for example you cannot fine a user $100 for posting a snarky comment, and this comes from contract law (no penalty clauses).\n\nRegardless of the copyright status of any code you have running on your machine, you can set legal limits on how a program on your web page can be uses, for example you can stipulate \"cannot be used for commercial purposes\". The legal challenge would be for the provider to prove that they were actually harmed by the user's breach of contract: usually, the violator is just banned, which doesn't take a lawsuit. An indemnification clause is useful because it can require the user to take responsibility for legal damages that the user causes to you (for example, if they post defamatory content, they can be forced to cover your losses arising from the defamation lawsuit). You might have a hard time suing a person for making a snarky comment online, although the damage could be that it causes your snark\\-free forum reputation and attendant customer base to evaporate.\n\nIf your program transfers money from a user account to a specified target account and the TOS requires the user to have money in the account but the software doesn't check the account, then \"writing a rubber e\\-check\" would be a violation of the TOS and would cause damage, so you could sue. (For the sake of keeping this maximally related to the question you ask, I ignore the probability that online financial transactions are highly likely to be subject to other specific laws).\n\nThe comments suggests a complication, that there are two TOS's involved. There can be a front\\-end server that has a TOS, and that server can \"silently\" call on a separate server with its other TOS. If your TOS and use of the third party server is consistent with the third party TOS, there is no problem. If you are using the third party server illegally, you bear the liability and your customers do not (unless you are clear about the nature of the third party TOS and that you disclaim responsibility for lawsuits arising from the customer's illegal use of the service). It is unlikely that the situation will arise, since the customer has no agreement with the third party that they breached. It is insufficient to just say \"we have a TOS\", you have to have actual agreement between the parties.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A web developer creates a website using open-source software licensed under GPL. The developer wants to implement restrictions on how users can interact with the site. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the developer's ability to impose such restrictions?\n\nA) The developer cannot place any restrictions on site usage because the underlying software is open-source.\n\nB) The developer can only restrict usage that directly violates the GPL license terms.\n\nC) The developer can implement Terms of Service to restrict site usage, but cannot enforce monetary penalties for violations.\n\nD) The developer has complete freedom to restrict any type of usage without limitations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the underlying software may be open-source, the website owner can still implement Terms of Service (ToS) to restrict how users interact with their specific instance of the site. These ToS act as a contract between the site owner and users. The owner can restrict activities like uploading certain content or bypassing payment systems. However, there are limitations on enforcement. For example, the owner cannot impose excessive monetary penalties for violations, as this would likely be considered an unenforceable penalty clause under contract law. The owner's primary recourse would typically be to ban users or remove violating content. They could potentially sue for damages if they can prove actual harm from the violation, but this is often difficult in practice. The other options are incorrect because A) ignores the ability to restrict usage of a specific site instance, B) unnecessarily limits restrictions to GPL terms only, and D) overstates the freedom to restrict without any limitations."

TWC](http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Time-Warner-Cable-Sued-For-Robocalling-Wrong-Woman153-Times-134405)), where the judge apparently cites some industry study about copyright trolls, and explicitly names the plaintiff as such, denying its motions and dropping the lawsuit.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your question slightly misrepresents what the article says: Yes, the judge denied the motion which led to the collapse of the case, he did not make a ruling on the substance of the case.\n\nThe distinction is significant to my mind as the judge was using non\\-evidentiary knowledge (i.e. what he read in the paper) to make a decision on **process**; in this case a process that would have put a lot of people to a lot of inconvenience. It would not be proper for the judge to have used such knowledge to inform a **judgement**.\n\nIt is also not clear from the article if the academic paper in question was actually introduced by the defendant as evidence. If that was the case then it is only right and proper for the judge to consider it.\n\nAs to why a judge is allowed to read the news and a jury is not, I can offer several ideas:\n\n1. A judge must document their reasoning process in a judgement which is subject to review \\- if they were to make a decision based on matters not supported by the evidence then an appeals court could correct it. Alternatively, juries are specifically prohibited from revealing their reasoning process to *anyone*.\n2. Judges do their jobs for years, perhaps a whole career \\- to prohibit them from consuming media is a) unworkable and b) a serious impediment on their lifestyle. Juries are empaneled for weeks or months \\- such sacrifices are more reasonable.\n3. Judges are (supposedly) trained and impartial professionals who are more readily able to make the distinction between evidence and news.\n4. Newsworthy cases are relatively rare",

Prohibiting judges from consuming media for their entire careers would be unworkable and a significant lifestyle impediment, unlike the shorter-term restrictions placed on jurors (option B).\n3. Judges are required to document their reasoning in judgments that can be reviewed by higher courts, allowing for corrections if decisions are based on matters not supported by evidence (option C).\n\nSince all of these reasons are valid according to the passage, the correct answer is D) All of the above, which encompasses all the key points mentioned."

Is it even possible to be prosecuted unter U.S. law? It sounds a bit weird to me. Also, is it possible to get extradicted to a country you never have been to?\n\nPersonally, to me the scary part is: Do I need to make sure I do not break any laws in *any* country of the world in the future, not only in the country I live? Or is this a difficult question to answer because the accusations against him are related to internet business?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n----\n\nKim Dotcom is alleged to have committed a crime against US law. The US requested his arrest by NZ authorities with whom they have an extradition treaty. He has now had his extradition hearing and the NZ court is satisfied that, under NZ law, he should be extradited to face those charges.\n\nYou do not have to be a citizen of a country to offend its laws. You do not have to be located within its borders.\n\nFor example, if you rob a US bank over the internet you are liable to prosecution in the US no matter where you are in the world.

This is particularly relevant in the digital age, where crimes can be committed across borders via the internet.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because citizenship is not a requirement for prosecution or extradition. \n\nAnswer B is false because physical presence is not always necessary to commit a crime, especially in cases involving cybercrime or international financial crimes.\n\nAnswer D is too narrow, as having business operations in a country is not a prerequisite for committing a crime against its laws or being subject to extradition.\n\nThis question tests understanding of international law, extradition treaties, and the global nature of certain crimes in the modern world."

We're looking at having flasing green on recovery vehicles on route to their jobs. \n\nCan a county make a regulation like that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [State law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&division=12.&title=&part=&chapter=2.&article=7.) regulates the use of flashing and colored lights. Veh. Code 25250 says that \"Flashing lights are prohibited on vehicles except as otherwise permitted\", so if the state does not permit it, the county can't say anything about it. The list of permissions includes \"making a turn\", as a warning with parked on the side of the road, to warn of funeral procession, and nothing like what you describe.\n\nThe state does cover tow trucks in 25253:\n\n> (a) Tow trucks used to tow disabled vehicles shall be equipped with\n>  flashing amber warning lamps.

The state law specifically regulates the use of flashing and colored lights on vehicles, including tow trucks (recovery vehicles). The law allows flashing amber warning lamps for tow trucks under certain conditions, but does not permit flashing green lights for the purpose described. Since state law takes precedence and does not allow for this specific use of flashing green lights, the county cannot implement a regulation that conflicts with state law."
