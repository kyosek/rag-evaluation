The players and timeline below. \n\nPlaintiff (victim) is a female of a different race of the jury as was her attorney. The victims had an attorney who asked her to increase the percent of the award under the contract because he needed help getting the case settled. That lawyer told her she would have a team of two working on the case. The first lawyer wound up not working on the case after she agreed to the increase and he essentially handed the case to the other attorney. The victim had documents proving medical visits, lost wages, and medical bills. \n\nThe defendant (drunk driver) had numerous attorneys appointed by the insurance agency that extended the case out over six years. The last lawyer was a female of the same race as the jury. The defendant, the drunk driver, did not appear in court. The defendant never spent a dime on legal fees and never showed up in court. The insurance company paid for an attorney to represent her; the insurance company could not be mentioned during the hearing.\n\nThe attorney for the victim offers a settlement to the insurance company. The settlement was for the legal limit of $25K under GA law. At the hearing, he requested a judgement of $80k.\n\nThe defendant's insurance company attorney counters the offer for $12K in writing before the hearing and $15k the day of trial. The first written offer refers to a legal code that would make the plaintiff pay the legal fees if the Jury does not award at least 75% of the offer. \n\nNeither party accepted the other's offer to settle.\n\nThe jury was composed entirely of a different race than the plaintiff; it had all women except for one male and was not a diversified group. \n\nThe jury asked a question because some invoices were not attached to a statement and wanted to impeach the victim's testimony. (Note: the total amount of the medical expenses and individual bills were listed on the statement.) Victim's attorney objected and motioned jury bias based on that question, which was denied by the judge. The jury ruled in favor for the victim with an award of only $500\\. My research shows that investigate questions by a jury and trying to impeach a witness does show bias but I could not find the code, only legal articles.\n\nThe victim felt that was an inadequate amount and wanted to appeal the decision. The victim's attorney refused to file an appeal or any motions that the victim requested stating that judges almost never overturn a jury's verdict. The victim wanted to file a motion on her behalf. She was not able to file the motion because she was under contract with her attorney and if she fired him she was liable for all of his fees. The lawyer informed her that the verdict has made her obligated to pay the insurance company back their legal fees. (Note: The victim did not file a lawsuit against the insurance company she filed a lawsuit against the drunk driver.)\n\nMy research shows that you can file a motion for the judge to give a Judgement notwithstanding a verdict and additur the amount of the award. There were numerous reasons this would be allowed jury bias was one of them. Jury prejudice is another.\n\nThe final settlement was the victim take the $500 and not file an appeal; both attorneys threatened her with the obligation to pay their legal fees if she did anything else. I could not find anything that allowed the victim out of the contract with her attorney and to act on her own behalf without being obligated to pay her lawyer his legal fees.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no legal requirement that a jury be composed of people demographically like the defendant (or the plaintiff), there is simply a requirement that the selection process give all kinds of people an equal chance at being empaneled. So being a different race or gender from one of the parties is not prima facie evidence of a biased jury.\n\nThe statement that \"The jury asked a question because some invoices were not attached to a statement and wanted to impeach the victim's testimony\" is somewhat puzzling, since Georgia is widely cited as a state where jurors are forbidden to ask questions. Let us suppose though that jurors manage to communicate an interest in knowing a fact, such as \"Do you have an invoice for X?\", then the judge could decide whether that is a proper question. At that point, it moves from being a jury matter to a legal judge matter, and if the question was itself highly prejudicial, the case could be overturned on appeal. Alternatively, the way in which the question was framed by the jury could be proof of bias, e.g. \"Please ask that lying %@!^\\* defendant to prove her ridiculous story\". The defense attorney has entered an objection (if you don't object, you can't appeal), and perhaps if the question was legally improper then the verdict could be set aside. If the attorney failed to move for mistrial (if the question proves blatant bias) then that's the end of the matter, except for a possible action against the attorney.\n\nThe implied questions about attorney conduct are hard to understand. An attorney may refuse to engage in a futile legal act, but this does not preclude an individual from seeking another attorney to file a motion or even attempting to file a motion on one's own (which is probably a futile act). However, I also assume that the victim did not have her own attorney and that this was a case between two insurance companies *about* individuals \u2013 a third party claim. In this case, the attorney represents the insurance company, not the victim, and has to be responsible to the interests of the insurance company. The attorney thus is obligated to not cost the insurance company a packet of money if there is no realistic chance of getting anything in return. The alternative would have been be to engage (and pay) your (her) own attorney.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil case where a plaintiff feels the jury's verdict was unfair due to potential bias, which of the following options is most likely to be successful in challenging the verdict?\n\nA) File a motion for a new trial based solely on the racial composition of the jury being different from the plaintiff\nB) Personally file an appeal without the attorney's involvement while still under contract with the attorney\nC) File a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) and additur, citing specific evidence of jury bias or prejudice\nD) Refuse to accept the verdict and demand a new trial with a more diverse jury\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the racial composition of the jury being different from the plaintiff is not, by itself, evidence of bias.

The parties are free to negotiate terms which govern their past behaviour.\n\nIf instead you mean that the contract purports to have been entered into in the past then no, that is not legitimate. Depending on the circumstances this can amount to fraud or forgery.\n\nIn practice it is common for people to misunderstand the difference and so you will often find contracts backdated by inserting the past date as the date of the contract (the 2nd type) when the correct approach is to have a clause which specifies that the terms apply from an earlier date (the 1st type).\n\nThere is also an implied question here about what those terms should be for the backdated period.

The documentation indicates that for serious traffic offenses like speeding more than 40 mph over the limit and driving without a license, the penalties can be severe, including up to a year in jail. The judge had previously recommended obtaining an attorney, and the Illinois Legal Aid site suggests that individuals who cannot afford a lawyer may be entitled to a public defender.

It is my understanding that Powell's First Amendment right is not tested as the plaintiff is Dominion Voting Systems and not the government. Assume Dominion has actually suffered quantifiable damages (loss of business), caused by the Powell assertions.\n\nIf plaintiff were to assert that Powell's statements were the extremist \"dog whistle\" that summoned unreasonable persons to cause said damages: How, if in any way, does the defense's reasonable person standard shield Powell? IANAL\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Some simplified points of basic defamation law as background:\n\n* A critical element of defamation law is that the defendant said something false.\n* You therefore can't win a defamation case if it's based on a statement that can't be proven false: \"You are annoying.\" \"You are ugly.\" \"You are a bad lawyer.\"\n* If a statement can't be proven false, it is considered opinion.\n* Statments of opinion are virtually always protected by the First Amendment.\n\n[Powell's brief](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20519858/3-22-21-sidney-powell-defending-the-republic-motion-to-dismiss-dominion.pdf) relies on this framework to argue that because her statements were statements of opinion, no defamation could have occurred. It's like defending against a murder charge by saying that no one died. Although it isn't generally referred to as the \"reasonable person standard,\" reasonableness comes into this question because part of the calculus in assessing whether a statement is fact or opinion is to ask whether a reasonable person would understand the statement to be making an assertion of fact. [*Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.*, 497 U.S. 1 (1990\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/497/1).\n\nBy leaning into that language, Powell is not saying that reasonable people would not have any reaction or would not have any specific reaction to her statements; instead, she is saying that reasonable people would not have understood her statements to be assertions of fact. Her argument seems to turn on the fact that she was speaking as an attorney representing a political candidate in a lawsuit, and that reasonable people understand statements made in that context to be \"inherently prone to exaggeration and hyperbole\u201d and \"view them only as claims that await testing by the courts through the adversary process.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, that seems to me like a pretty weak argument. While people expect a certain amount of puffery from their candidates, they also expect that lawyers representing the President of the United States aren't going into court with frivolous allegations.\n\nMore importantly, though, I think she's running the analysis incorrectly. Rather than asking whether a reasonable person would understand her statements to assertions of fact, she's asking whether a reasonable person would think that she was prone to exaggerate in the setting in which she made those statements. As I understand it, a speaker cannot cloak statements of fact from liability by merely refraining from uttering them until she finds herself in a context where people expect some amount of loose speech. Even if you're a partisan hack with no credibility appearing on a TV show hosted by another partisan hack with no credibility, you generally can't accuse your opponent of being a murderer or child molester or something like that. Those are still assertions of fact, even if they're bookended with statements that \"Donald Trump is the greatest president this country will ever have.\"\n\nThe brief does not rely at all on *Hustler* or the First Amendment protections for parody that were discussed in the previous answer.

This is based on the Supreme Court's ruling in Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the standard doesn't focus on whether the statement is believed to be true, but rather on whether it's perceived as a factual claim.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the offensiveness of a statement is not the primary consideration in determining whether it's fact or opinion.\n\nOption D, while related to arguments sometimes made in defamation defenses, is not the correct application of the reasonable person standard.

Whether or not you can get such a court order and get it enforced is up in the air right now (July 6 is one day when things might change). In the normal case, you would file a holdover case, because the lease expired. [This document](https://www.nycourts.gov/courthelp/pdfs/TenantsGuide_holdover.pdf) from the NY Courts is addressed to tenants, but the information contained in it tells you what a landlord has to do. Notice of Termination is not required for a holdover eviction. Notice to Quit requires 10 days notice.\n\nYou do not collect rent in this case, unless you want to start all over (this is one of the defenses against holdover eviction). By collecting rent, you agree (by actions) to let the tenant continue, and the essence of a holdover case is that they are holding over without permission. While the case is going on, the judge may order the tenant to pay \"use and occupation\". Given the distinct possibility that the situation is going to continue for a long time, you may be in novel legal territory, therefore you should get an attorney. The premise of holdover evictions is that it is not an arduous process, you simply establish that the tenant overstayed the lease, and you won;t have to wait months without payment to get your (first) day in court. However, a holdover tenant is treated as a month\\-to\\-month tenant, so you can accept rent under those conditions while waiting for the legal situation to change.

Could a judge cancel his own or (without requiring court appearance)\nhis relatives traffic ticket?\n2. Could a judge declare an individual as guilty simply because they\nwant to, esp. if the case does not have much direct evidence either\nfor or against an indictment?\n\n(I am not interested in what they are expected to do, or how they are expected to behave in their position, but what they are able to do without accountability.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the proper immediate action is to \\- while not leaving the judicial branch \\- appeal up to the next higher court. In federal courts, the lowest levels are district courts, which issues decisions appealable to the circuit courts, whose decisions are sometimes able to make their way to the Supreme Court by submitting a Petition for Writ of Certiorari. Then the Supreme Court meets and decides which appeals it will hear for the year ahead. \n\nThis works similarly on a state level, except the levels of the courts may have different names (for example, Washington, DC\u2019s trial level court is not the District Court, but the Superior Court. In Virginia, one trial court is the General District Court, which hears claims up to $25,000 and another trial court is the Virginia Circuit Court which hears other claims, and some felonies while also serving as an appellate court for the General District Court).\n\nAssuming those options have been exhausted, the reality is yeah, sometimes there are judges who will act that way. Sometimes they will get away with it because they are maintaining enough discretion, they are powerful enough, or because someone else is corrupt, too. \n\nA number of options and variables may come into play at this point. What, if any, laws exist to prevent the behavior in question? What ethics standard does the jurisdiction have (this would likely be developed by the local bar association)? Are there any other organizations he or she is affiliated with professionally? Who else knows about it, how serious is it, will anyone else speak up, etc...? Each of those variables \\- and likely a number of others not mentioned here \\- may play into the outcome. They each can serve to make one\u2019s actions more or less easy or desirable to perform, whether by exposing and embarrassing an actor, reminding him or her of the potential legal liability associated with such actions, etc. \n\nAll that said, there are limits on what a judge may or may not do. For example, in federal criminal cases, the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, rules assembled by the US Sentencing Commission that are, of course, non\\-binding, set a floor and ceiling on the years in prison one should be sentenced to in various circumstances with a formula used to make the calculation. It is rare (and sometimes controversial and subject to scrutiny) if a judge grossly or unreasonable deviates from the Guidelines. The intent of the Guidelines is to remove judicial bias from the doling out of prison sentences. Results have arguably been mixed. \n\nFinally, I\u2019d be remiss not to mention that in general judicial discretion in many aspects of litigation is a desirable and useful occurrence, whether it manifests itself in the dismissal of a frivolous case or appointing counsel to an indigent defendant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States judicial system, what is the primary mechanism for addressing potential judicial misconduct or bias in a case?\n\nA) Filing a complaint with the local bar association\nB) Petitioning the Supreme Court directly\nC) Appealing to the next higher court\nD) Requesting a different judge for the case\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The primary and immediate mechanism for addressing potential judicial misconduct or bias is to appeal the decision to the next higher court within the judicial branch. This allows for a review of the lower court's decision and can help correct any errors or misconduct. While other options like filing complaints or petitioning higher courts may be available in certain circumstances, appealing to the next higher court is the standard and most direct approach in the U.S. legal system.

In Scotland, generally speaking, at least one party must either be domiciled in Scotland or must have been a \"habitual resident\" of Scotland for at least a year.\n\nIn Europe, international jurisdiction over divorce cases is governed by the [Brussels II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_II) regulation enacted in 2003 (text [here](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R2201:EN:HTML)), and different bodies of law allocate jurisdiction between different divorce regimes within federal states like the U.K. as explained [here](http://www.brodies.com/blog/what-are-the-rules-of-jurisdiction-for-family-cases-in-scotland/). The basic rule of Brussels II for divorces is set forth in Article 3 which states:\n\n> 1. In matters relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment, jurisdiction shall lie with the courts of the Member State\n> \n> \n> (a) in whose territory:\n> \n> \n> * the spouses are habitually resident, or\n> * the spouses were last habitually resident, insofar as one of them still resides there, or\n> * the respondent is habitually resident, or\n> * in the event of a joint application, either of the spouses is habitually resident, or\n> * the applicant is habitually resident if he or she resided there for at least a year immediately before the application was made, or\n> * the applicant is habitually resident if he or she resided there for at least six months immediately before the application was made and is\n>  either a national of the Member State in question or, in the case of\n>  the United Kingdom and Ireland, has his or her \"domicile\" there;\n> \n> \n> (b) of the nationality of both spouses or, in the case of the United\n>  Kingdom and Ireland, of the \"domicile\" of both spouses.\n> \n> \n> 2. For the purpose of this Regulation, \"domicile\" shall have the same meaning as it has under the legal systems of the United Kingdom and\n>  Ireland.\n\nA handful of countries do not and in the days when a divorce was hard to get in the absence of proof of fault, there was a huge amount of litigation over whether a couple could either unilaterally, or by mutual agreement, dissolve their marriage in a place that had loose jurisdictional requirements for obtaining a divorce. But, Scotland and other countries whose law follows the European Union rules are not such jurisdictions. (Historically, Mexico had more liberal divorce rules and weaker residency requirements and was on such jurisdiction although I do not know if that remains the case today.)\n\nAlso, while it is often possible for parties by control to choose a governing law and venue for disputes between them, generally speaking, the parties must have some meaningful connection to the venue for that principle to apply. The only way I can see that some court, somewhere might find a connection to jurisdiction when neither party has ever lived there would be if the wedding took place in there, but Scotland does not recognize this exception.\n\n**The Impact Of Children On The Question**\n\nFurthermore, if there were children involved in a divorce, there are international treaties that govern jurisdiction over child custody matters which generally require proceedings to be brought in the jurisdiction that is the child's \"habitual residence\" and a place where a child has never lived would almost certainly not qualify. The [most notable of these treaties](http://www.americanbar.org/content/newsletter/publications/gp_solo_magazine_home/gp_solo_magazine_index/oct99cro.html) is the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, a treaty with approximately 45 member countries.\n\n> The Hague Convention encompasses nearly all European countries,\n>  including some of the former Soviet and Yugoslav republics, and other\n>  westernized countries around the world. Members also include a very\n>  few countries in Africa, South America, and the pro\\-western margins of\n>  the Middle East.\n\nIn general, rights and responsibilities related to children, who cannot be parties to any binding agreement, may not be set forth in a marital agreement.\n\nSo, even if a Scottish court was willing to entertain the termination of marriage, property division, name change, and maintenance part of the divorce, and other jurisdictions chose to recognize the Scottish court's ruling, this would not give the Scottish court authority to issue orders related to children.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A married couple, John (English) and Maria (Italian), currently living in France, signed a prenuptial agreement stating that in case of divorce, they would get divorced in Scotland.

Generally, at least one party must either be domiciled in Scotland or must have been a \"habitual resident\" of Scotland for at least a year. The prenuptial agreement doesn't override these jurisdictional requirements. Option A is incorrect because the prenup doesn't guarantee jurisdiction. Option B is incorrect because 6 months is not sufficient for non-nationals. Option D is incorrect because mutual agreement doesn't override residency requirements.

Taking them in order:\n\nBecause of how HTTP/HTML works, there are essentially two ways for a server operator to know what software you are running.\n\n1. Your browser announces that it's running something. This usually takes the form of a modified [User\\-Agent header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent#User_agent_identification). I'm not aware of any privacy laws that consider \"Person A told me something\" to be an invasion of Person A's privacy.\n2. They guess it based on the actions your browser takes. For example, if the website gets a request for a page, and the site's ad network does not get a matching request for an ad, the server deduces that the user is running an ad blocker. Since this is based on things that the server operator could reasonably be expected to be informed of, it isn't an invasion of privacy under any law I'm aware of.\n\nIs it discrimination? Yes. [But not all discrimination is illegal.](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/681/137) In general, only discrimination based on protected categories (race, sex, etc.) is prohibited, and I can't imagine a jurisdiction making \"choice of browser add\\-ons\" to be one of those categories, not least because it's something the person being discriminated against can easily change.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website detects that a user is employing an ad blocker and subsequently denies access to its content.

[18 USC 2511](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511) is the federal wiretapping statute, which generally outlaws \"wiretapping\" \u2013 i.e., recording a conversation where neither party consents to the recording. (If at least one party consents, it is allowed, though [some states require all parties to consent](http://www.rcfp.org/reporters-recording-guide).) There are a number of special cases, starting in subsection (2\\), where party consent is not required. Court orders would be one of those conditions. Another is if the Attorney General certifies in writing that the tap is legal and necessary to catch a spy. (2\\)(e) says, in particular:\n\n> it shall not be unlawful for an officer, employee, or agent of the\n>  United States in the normal course of his official duty to conduct\n>  electronic surveillance, as defined in [section 101 of the Foreign\n>  Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1801), as authorized by that Act.\n\nwhere electronic surveillance is defined (partially) as \n\n> the acquisition by an electronic, mechanical, or other surveillance\n>  device of the contents of any wire or radio communication sent by or\n>  intended to be received by a particular, known United States person\n>  who is in the United States, if the contents are acquired by\n>  intentionally targeting that United States person, under circumstances\n>  in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy and a\n>  warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes\n\nThis seems to satisfy the circumstances described in the question \u2013 the act would be \"electronic surveillance\" as defined in that section of the law. But the wiretap law also says \"as authorized by that Act\", so now we have to turn to authorization (without court order). [50 USC 1802](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1802) says\n\n> Notwithstanding any other law, the President, through the Attorney\n>  General, may authorize electronic surveillance without a court order\n>  under this subchapter to acquire foreign intelligence information for\n>  periods of up to one year if the Attorney General certifies in writing\n>  under oath that...\n\nThere are three conditions that have to be met. The second, (B), is that\n\n> there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire\n>  the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a\n>  party\n\nwhich would rule out the use against US persons asked about. Condition (A) likewise limits surveillance to\n\n> the acquisition of the contents of communications transmitted by means\n>  of communications used exclusively between or among foreign powers\n\nSo wiretapping without a court order is not authorized against a US person (which includes US citizens plus numerous other non\\-citizens with a \"connection\" to the US, including and not limited to permanent residents).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under federal law, which of the following statements is true regarding the President's authority to order electronic surveillance without a court order on a United States citizen?\n\nA) The President can order such surveillance at any time, as long as it's for national security purposes.\n\nB) The President can authorize surveillance for up to one year if the Attorney General certifies in writing under oath that it's necessary, regardless of who the target is.\n\nC) The President cannot order such surveillance on a U.S. citizen without a court order under any circumstances.\n\nD) The President can authorize such surveillance only if there is no substantial likelihood that it will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and related statutes, the President cannot order electronic surveillance on a U.S. citizen without a court order. While the President can authorize certain types of electronic surveillance without a court order through the Attorney General, this is specifically limited to situations where \"there is no substantial likelihood that the surveillance will acquire the contents of any communication to which a United States person is a party\" (50 USC 1802). \n\nOption A is incorrect because the President's authority is not unlimited, even for national security purposes. \n\nOption B is false because the one-year authorization still requires that the surveillance not target U.S. persons. \n\nOption D might seem correct at first glance, but it's actually describing a limitation on warrantless surveillance, not an authorization to surveil U.S. citizens.\n\nThe key point is that U.S. citizens are protected from warrantless electronic surveillance by the President, and a court order would be required in such cases."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84668/is-it-possible-to-be-reimbursed-by-the-nhs-or-government-for-price-difference-of", "docs_id": 84668, "title": "Is it possible to be reimbursed by the NHS or government for price difference of gluten-free food?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've heard years ago that if one with gluten allergy saves receipts then since the diet is their medical treatment then the government reimburses the cost difference between GF and non\\-GF options.

These areas, often marked in blue on official plans, allow the property owner to pass over land owned by others without needing permission each time. This matches the description of the secondary extent reaching to the middle of the road and into neighboring land, suggesting it's not full ownership but rather a right of passage or use.

This is an [equitable remedy](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85675/what-are-equity-and-equitable-remedies). Whether a personal right of action or a derivative action is appropriate generally depends on the nature of the loss. See e.g. *Anthony v. NPV Management Ltd.*, 2003 NLCA 41 at para. 14, quoting McGinness, *The Law and Practice of Canadian Business Corporations*:\n\n> Derivative actions must be distinguished from personal rights of action belonging to a shareholder. In deciding whether a particular cause of action is derivative or personal, the question to resolve is whether the essence of the action is the violation of some right of the corporation or some personal right to which the shareholder is entitled. Either one can produce a loss to the shareholder. **The difference is whether the loss is suffered by the shareholder directly or by the reduction in the value of his or her shares.**\n\nI am not sure that this reflects the exact boundaries of the availability of this action in other jurisdictions and I would expect there to be jurisdiction\\-specific thresholds/tests/procedures to establish a valid derivative action.\n\n### Dissipation of assets\n\nCommonly, a derivative action will claim that a defendant has dissipated assets of the corporation. E.g. in *Anthony v. NPV Management Ltd.*, the claim was (among other things) that\n\n* \"the Defendants dissipated or permitted the dissipation of the assets and transferred business of Conpak Seafoods Inc. to Daley Brothers Limited\" and that\n* one defendant \"acted in such a manner to serve his personal objectives to the detriment of Conpak Seafoods Inc. and its Shareholders.\"\n\nIn this [overview article](https://www.mondaq.com/pdf/clients/87654.pdf), Aronson et al. describe a derivative action as follows:\n\n> \u2018the action is derivative, i.e., in the\n> corporate right, if the gravamen of the complaint is injury to the\n> corporation, or to the whole body of its stock or property without\n> any severance or distribution among individual holders, or if it seeks\n> to recover assets for the corporation or to prevent the dissipation of\n> its assets.\n\n[This answer by ohwilleke](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/56345/46948) presents another good description.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A minority shareholder in a corporation suspects that the majority shareholder, who is also the CEO, is using company profits to start a competing business instead of reinvesting in the current company.

The majority shareholder's actions potentially constitute dissipation of corporate assets, which harms the corporation as a whole rather than the minority shareholder individually. Derivative actions are designed to address situations where corporate insiders are misusing company resources or acting against the company's interests. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a personal lawsuit would only be appropriate if the minority shareholder suffered direct personal harm, rather than harm through the reduction in value of their shares. \n\nOption C is incorrect because suing the corporation itself would not address the root cause of the problem, which is the majority shareholder's actions. \n\nOption D is an extreme measure that doesn't directly address the issue and would likely harm all shareholders, including the minority shareholder."}, "32": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48434/text-about-a-deposit-held-by-the-landlord", "docs_id": 48434, "title": "text about a deposit held by the landlord", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the hope of salvaging some of the deposit held by the landlord, my husband exchanged texts with the landlord.

Will that hold in a small claims court where I am suing her for the full deposit?\n\nThat seems unlikely. Lease contracts typically establish that tenants are jointly and severally liable. If your lease does not establish that, you would need to prove the landlord's agreement that your husband's acts with respect to the contract are not binding to you.\n\nEven if you prove the aforementioned issue, the security deposit to be reimbursed would be prorated if the court decides that your husband essentially desisted from his portion of the deposit by saying to the landlord \"*you can keep your money*\".\n\n> Do we have a chance of winning the case?\n\nYes. It is unclear from your post whether the landlord's pretexts are tantamount to complying with her statutory obligation of timely notification of an itemized list of damages. Landlord\\-tenant statutes give a deadline (such as 30 days) for sending that notification. Non\\-compliance forfeits whatever entitlement the landlord would otherwise have as to the security deposit.\n\nIn case of landlord's compliance regarding that itemized list, you as tenants may dispute the legitimacy of the damages alleged therein.\n\nHere the intricacy stems from your husband's statement \"*you can keep your money*\", which a reasonable person might construe as your husband's waiver \\-\\-notwithstanding the contentious context\\-\\- of reimbursement. A waiver may be cognizable even if made reluctantly or under apparent reluctance. In fact, it is common for people to reluctantly waive their rights because they deem the matter not worth the hassle that court or quasi\\-judicial proceedings as well as extra\\-judicial disputes entail.\n\nIf necessary, you as tenants might want to posit that \"*your money*\" in that expression literally refers to the amount \\-\\-if any\\-\\- that legitimately belongs to the landlord, and that the expression ought not to be confused with \"*you can keep the\\|that\\|my money*\". Your husband's expression literally reflects that he was not overreaching into landlord's funds, but that your husband's purpose simply was to recover \\[nothing more than] the security deposit.\n\nUnless impracticable, I encourage you to litigate this matter *in pro per* because in doing so you would gain some exposure to legal proceedings. The amount involved is not too high, whence the matter would be litigated in Small Claims court (hence without being represented by a lawyer) anyway. With that exposure you will not be easily intimidated by lawyers/charlatans if your rights are violated in the future. But one lesson here is that that type of expressions can backfire because such expressions don't truly reflect the person's ultimate purpose and thus may be construed to that person's detriment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a landlord-tenant dispute over a security deposit, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of a tenant's frustrated statement \"you can keep your money\" to the landlord?\n\nA) The statement automatically forfeits the entire security deposit for all co-signers on the lease.\nB) The statement has no legal bearing as it was made in frustration and anger.\nC) The statement may be interpreted as a waiver of rights, but its impact could be limited by arguing about its literal meaning and the joint liability of co-signers.\nD) The statement is irrelevant if the landlord failed to provide a timely, itemized list of damages.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most accurate because it captures the nuanced legal implications of the tenant's statement. The answer from LawStackExchange indicates that such a statement could be construed as a waiver of rights, even if made reluctantly or in frustration. However, it also suggests that tenants could argue about the literal interpretation of \"your money\" and that co-signers might have separate standing due to joint and several liability.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation and doesn't account for the potential arguments or the rights of co-signers.\n\nOption B is incorrect because, according to the answer, a waiver may be cognizable even if made reluctantly or under apparent reluctance.\n\nOption D, while potentially true in some circumstances, is not the most comprehensive answer.

Also if we are coming to it, some sort of verification of the rider will encourage women cab drivers to also operate an Uber.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Contracts that violate local law are void in just about every jurisdiction, as are contracts against clearly defined public policy. In many cases, laws are specifically *designed* to restrict otherwise valid contracts; for instance, in the US, an employment contract that pays less than $7\\.25 an hour will normally be invalid, even if the company and the employee both agree to the reduced wage. In employment law, where contracts are fairly common, the laws would be virtually meaningless if contracts took precedence.\n\nIn the case of independent contractor status vs. employee status, California law does not consider someone to be an independent contractor just because their contract says so. \"Independent contractor\" is defined in California law to be \n\n> any person who renders service for a specified recompense for a specified result, under the control of his principal as to the result of his work only and not as to the means by which such result is accomplished. ([California Labor Code, section 3353](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&sectionNum=3353.))\n\nIf this definition isn't satisfied, it's irrelevant what the parties agree the status is; it's not an independent contractor status. According to the state department of labor, the test is that found in [*Borello v. Dept. of Industrial Relations*](http://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/48/341.html) (a California Supreme Court case), which lays out a multifactor test for contractor status and says that\n\n> The label placed by the parties on their relationship is not dispositive, and subterfuges are not countenanced.\n\nLikewise, with product liability, a country can generally have laws *mandating* liability for people providing a product or service; the extent to which this happens depends on the jurisdiction. For instance, India may not want a big company like Uber to be able to block liability claims by putting some legalese in front of average consumers who aren't able to make a detailed risk\\-benefit analysis. Alternatively, India could decide that Uber is better able to take the risk from bad drivers than average consumers are, so the right policy is to assign the risk to Uber. Whether Uber should be able to avoid liability is something that every country can decide for itself based on public policy considerations; the point is that if they *do* decide that Uber should be liable for damages, their law trumps Uber's contract.\n\nUber actually *tries* to limit liability in their EULA, and to avoid an employer\\-employee relationship in their driver agreement. Their US EULA and driver agreement says they aren't a transportation provider and you aren't getting transportation from them, and even if you are they aren't liable for damages. However, if that provision violates the law in some state, the provision is invalid. Likewise, if they claim it's not an employment contract but it meets the \"employee\" definition in some state, it's an employment contract.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Uber seeks to classify its drivers as independent contractors rather than employees.

Option B demonstrates the highest level of control, with Uber providing a company car and requiring a uniform. This suggests that Uber controls both the means and the result of the work, which aligns more closely with an employer-employee relationship. \n\nOption A actually supports independent contractor status by showing the driver's autonomy.

The language defining the warranty term from a [warranty for a 2018 Acura](https://owners.acura.com/Documentum/Warranty/Handbooks/2018_Acura_Warranty_Basebook_BWL06581_v1__FINAL_.pdf) (I picked it at random as an example) is pretty typical.

The warranty lasts for 3 years from this date, making the expiration date December 15, 2025. The mileage limit is 36,000 miles from the start of the warranty, not from the sale date.

What is the legal basis for having workers outside of the jurisdiction of the US working (effectively) on the US territory in this manner? These are people answering calls in a business setting. So there is no question of whether they are working or rather just talking. This is not a question of free speech. It's a question of work authorization. \n\nLet me clarify why I think this is or isn't an issue. If I go to hear a paid performance by a folk singer in the US, but he is not authorized to work in the US, he can't accept a payment for singing. If I call him on the phone and ask him to sing, and he lives in the US, but he is not authorized to work in the US, he can't legally sing for money during that call. But somehow if he is in a different country, then I can call him and he may be legally allowed to sing to me for money without being afoul of the US labor law. This doesn't seem legal. And yet this is what the call centers are doing.\n\nI am not asking for *some* reasons why this is happening. This is a question about the US law. What is the reason why providing services to the people situated in the US is not considered working in the US from the perspective of the US law?\n\n**EDIT**: a number of answers seem to center around the idea that a person who is not present in the US cannot be considered to be working in the US, by law, simply because they are not physically present in the US. \n\nIt is simply not the case that the US law cannot make such a consideration. \n\nThere is a **more general principle** at play here. An action performed outside of the US does not automatically become a non\\-US action. For example, US citizens owe US Federal income taxes on all income earned abroad. \n\nThe confusion maybe caused by a slight semantic distinction. It is not automatically the case that work done outside of the US is not work in the US. The fact remains that by servicing calls from numbers in the US, some work within the US gets done. \n\nWhether or not the US labor law considers this to be work in the US is a **matter of law**. **It's not a matter of fact**. If it were a matter of fact, then no law could change it. But it is certainly possible for a law to exist which would make such work to be considered work in the US.

The discussion indicates that Congress's actions regarding the debt ceiling, while politically contentious, do not directly question the validity of existing debt. Instead, by refusing to authorize additional borrowing, Congress is exercising its power over future spending and debt accumulation. This interpretation suggests that such actions, while potentially problematic for government operations, do not violate the letter of the 14th Amendment's provision that the validity of public debt \"shall not be questioned.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the discussion explicitly states that Congress is not questioning the validity of the debt.

I am not sure whether this act then only covers consumer debt (i.e. store purchases etc.).\n\nThanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I am a landlord and not an attorney. For that reason, will answer this question from that perspective.\n\nThe Dodd Frank Act covers \"collections\" as primarily in a collections agency. If can cover a corporation collecting debts of course. It has nothing to do with a landlords ability to obtain a judgement or collect a debt which is covered by your states Tenant Landlord Act (or something similar).\n\nThe landlord has the right to file a complaint against anyone who has not paid rent, caused damage to the property, or any other loss to the landlord as a result of your action or inaction. Filing and getting a judgement is not collections as covered by the Dodd Frank Act. Once a judgement or judgements have been entered, there are several options including through the sheriffs department seizure and forfeiture depending upon your state law.\n\nOnly *if* the landlord sends your debt to a collections agency, does the Dodd Frank Act apply and, in that, only applies to how the collections agency that collects the debt and not to the landlord. It does not apply to the debt, the ability or right to collect the debt. It applies to the behavior of the collections agency seeking to collect the debt only.\n\nFor what it is worth, with so many legal options available to the landlord and not similarly afforded to consumer debt, it is unlikely that the landlord will use a collections agency. Options can include a collections attorney, the sheriffs department, direct collection by the landlord, the courts, etc. Landlords often take a loss of some sort using a collection agency and therefore avoid the option unless as a last resort. Often, if direct collection efforts fail, the landlord will either receive relief through the courts or through the sheriffs department according to state law, both of which are unavoidable and not ordinarily covered by the Dodd Frank Act. In this case, it is akin to owing the state the debt just like any other debt owed to the state. The state will have rights afforded by law such as the right to withhold privileges offered by the state such as drivers licenses, titles, tags, building permits, other licenses, etc. This may not apply equally in all states.

The Dodd-Frank Act primarily applies to the actions of collection agencies, not to landlords directly collecting debts. It only becomes relevant if the landlord sends the debt to a third-party collection agency. The Act does not govern the landlord's right to file complaints, obtain judgments, or use other legal means to collect debts as provided by state landlord-tenant laws.

Why? Let's see:\n\nAre you infringing ([Title 17 chapter 5](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html), esp. [section 501](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#501)) on the rights of the copyright holder ([Title 17 chapter 1](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106A) , esp. [section 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106)) to distribute their film by making it available? Yes, you perform it, thus violating copyright.

Do you stream the whole movie? Are you usurping the market (people that have not yet seen the movie) from the movie distributor? Clearly, yes, yes, yes. This puts factors 2, 3, and 4 (nature is fictional, the amount is all, Effect on the market is that the stream is a replacement for a legitimate copy) against screen sharing on films. This makes it *near impossible* to claim [fair use (Title 17 Section 107\\)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107).\n\nSo...\n-----\n\nCase 3 is clearly illegal.\n\nCase 2 likewise does not change a lot: being \"internet friends\" is generally not recognized, and would likely not stop people from being considered the public or a subset of it under the law \\- especially not if the group is large and could be described as \"random people you met online\". Under that pattern, even if a broadcast that is somewhat publically accessible (through word of mouth access sharing or something) would have not a single viewer, it would still be aimed at some subset of the public, which is the public. This in turn means, that even sharing with a single person that isn't specifically allowed to be shared with is illegal. However, it would be up to a court to draw a line between the is\\-Public of \"these 42 random people Peter talks to on Zoom\" and the not\\-Public which is \"Peter, Paula, Maria and Marcus, who would meet and drink after work if not for COVID\". However... Usage licenses apply, and streaming services generally ban re\\-streaming in their ToS (see below).\n\nCase 1 has a Significant Other that might qualify as family under the law, and then it would not be copyright infringement. So it might be ok **unless** the ToS of the site make it a breach of the contract to re\\-stream to anyone. Which incidentally is banned in the Amazon Prime ToS. That would be a Breach of Contract claim of the streaming service against Victor, not Copyright Infringement.\n\nbut...\n------\n\nBut there is one difference: Copyright infringement needs to be filed for by the copyright holder. This means, the copyright holder needs to learn of the conduct first, then file suit with enough evidence. Which makes it incredibly hard for cases 1 and maybe 2\\.\n\nHowever, it is still not technically legal if those people are not inside the \"inner circle\" that is not *the public* and there is the problem with the ToS, making it not ok even with that inner circle.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to copyright law and the information provided, which of the following scenarios is most likely to be considered legal?\n\nA) A person streams a movie from their Netflix account to 50 random internet friends via screen sharing on Zoom.\n\nB) A couple in a long-distance relationship watches a movie together by one person screen sharing their Amazon Prime account over Skype.\n\nC) A teacher shows a Disney+ movie to their class of 30 students via screen sharing during a virtual lesson.\n\nD) A person sets up a public Zoom room that plays movies 24/7 for anyone to join and watch.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: While technically all of these scenarios could be considered copyright infringement under a strict interpretation of the law, option B is the most likely to be considered legal or at least the least problematic. This is because:\n\n1. It involves only two people in a close relationship, which might be considered as \"family\" under some interpretations of the law.\n2. It's a private viewing between two individuals, not a public performance.\n3. It's less likely to be detected or pursued by copyright holders.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this scenario could still potentially violate the Terms of Service of the streaming platform. Options A, C, and D all involve larger groups or public sharing, which more clearly fall under the definition of public performance and are therefore more likely to be considered copyright infringement."}}
