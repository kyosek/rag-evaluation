He got a red card, but if he'd done a similar thing while walking down the street, he might have ended up in a police station.\n\nWhy the double standard? Is there some legal convention that being assaulted is a hazard of playing any contact sport? That would make some sense in e.g. boxing, but makes no sense in association football, where this behaviour is clearly against the rules.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the U.S. at least, there is an assumed risk you acknowledge and consent to when you put on your professional athletic team uniform and walk onto the field. The principle of assumption of risk applies outside of sports, as well, but it is unique in sports. \n\n[See](https://www.avvo.com/legal-guides/ugc/implied-assumption-of-risk-for-sports-participants): \n\n> A participant in an active sport breaches a legal duty of care to other participants only if the participant intentionally injures another player, engages in conduct so reckless to be totally outside the range of ordinary activity involved in the sport, or fails to use care not to increase the risk of a participant over and above those ordinarily in the sport. Knight v. Jewett, 3 Cal. 4th 296, 315\\-16, 320\\-21 (1992\\).\n\nAlthough this doesn't speak to the Zidane incident specifically, the Zidane incident didn't end up with him simply getting a red card.

However, this doesn't provide blanket immunity for all actions. According to the legal precedent cited (Knight v. Jewett), a player can be held liable if they intentionally injure another player or if their conduct is so reckless that it falls completely outside the ordinary activities involved in the sport. This balances the understanding that sports involve physical risks with the need to protect players from malicious or extremely reckless behavior.

The car exiting the parking lot is required to yield to the U-turning car already on the main road. However, it's important to note that no party is granted an absolute right of way; rather, one party is required to yield. \n\nThe U-turning car's action of turning into the third lane instead of the leftmost lane could be considered improper, and the car from the parking lot making a wide right turn (not into the rightmost lane) is also potentially in violation of Sec. 545.101.

So, if the case does not fall into a category such as family court, probate court, or land court, the Superior Court is probably the correct court.\n\nThe District Court has limited equity jurisdiction, but the wording of the statute giving it equity jurisdiction is ambiguous and doesn't appear to divest the Superior Court of any authority, so the Superior Court is probably correct, although it is hard to know without more information.

Here's why:\n\n1. The Superior Court has general equity jurisdiction, which includes the power to issue injunctions. According to Mass. Gen.

The case doesn't involve monetary claims, which eliminates the jurisdictional limits based on dollar amounts for both courts.\n\n4.

When a bar owner rents out their establishment to a private group, the space temporarily ceases to be a public accommodation during the rental period. The private group, in this case the ethnic club, has the right to determine who they admit to their event, even if that decision is based on ethnicity. This is because private clubs are not bound by the same anti-discrimination policies that apply to public accommodations.

Whether such a claim will be believed is another matter. A party to a contract with a \"wet\\-ink\" signature can claim that it was forged or that the signer was impersonated. But such claims are hard to prove, particularly if they are not true.\n\nThe answer to the question in the title is that terms are binding if the user freely agrees to them, and if they meet the conditions for a legally binding agreement in the relevant jurisdiction. The question in the body is more about what evidence will establish this.\n\nSuppose the code behind a web\\-site is so designed that no user is allowed to proceed without affirmatively accepting the ToS, and the operator can demonstrate this. That will be persuasive evidence that the user did accept the terms. If the site logs the consent in a database along with a timestamp that would be further evidence. A journaling database provides an audit trail of changes, which would be further evidence.\n\nEvidence of other users that the site always worked that way, and of coders that the code had never permitted a user to proceed without accepting the ToS might also help.

When his father died, his mother contacted him, and they began to rebuild a relationship. She came to the US 8 different times to visit over the next 25 years. I failed to mention that upon his father's death he left his mother a very, very wealthy woman. Over the years of visits and many phone conversations his mother assured my husband at her death, he and his younger brother would never want for anything. She told him that there was a trust that would handle everything. My husband received a phone call from his aunt in mid\\-May of last year (2021\\) who told him his mother had died several weeks before of lung cancer. Because of the pandemic, the funeral was virtual. My husband's mother had many personal assets as well as a bank account and most probably real estate holding. There was only my Husband and his younger brother, no other siblings. My husband received NOTHING! No one will give us any information about anything. We were told that there was most likely no will because there was a trust. My question isn't a trusted company responsible for treating the client's assets fairly? His brother knows we have no money to get a lawyer so he simply took everything, isn't this the same as stealing?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We can't give personal legal advice, but we can explain in general terms what the law is.\n\nApparently, the mother, brother and estate are outside the US, in country X. The disposition of the estate follows the laws of X, so you would need an attorney who can practice law in country X. The primary issue is, (1\\) how are estates probated in X and (2\\) what provisions, if any, did the deceased(s) make for the disposition of the estate (was there a will; a trust; did one or more parents die intestate?).\n\nTo simplify matters, we will assume that the laws of X are very similar to US law (which is not uniform \u2013 it is state\\-specific, but broadly similar). In the US, assets can be in a trust and can be directly transferred to a beneficiary. The disposition of the assets may be irrevocable, meaning that the person setting it up can decide who gets what, and then that cannot be changed.\n\nIt is thus possible that a child could be excluded as a beneficiary of a trust. E.g. the father could set up a trust with just the mother and brother as beneficiaries. The mother may simply have been misinformed as to what the trust document said. Or, there could have been illegal misappropriation of funds, even something as heinous as providing fraudulent documents purporting that an actually living beneficiary is dead. In other words, even though you can't afford a (foreign) attorney, that is realistically the only way to get a clear answer, if the brother is being uncooperative or untruthful.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of international estate law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the situation described?\n\nA) The husband's rights to his mother's estate are automatically protected under US law, regardless of where the mother resided.\n\nB) A trust established in a foreign country must always include all children as equal beneficiaries.\n\nC) The disposition of the estate follows the laws of the country where the deceased resided, which may differ from US law.\n\nD) If there is no will, the estate must be equally divided among all surviving children, regardless of any existing trusts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The disposition of the estate follows the laws of the country where the deceased resided, which may differ from US law. This is a crucial point in international estate matters. The question highlights that the mother and the estate are outside the US, in an unspecified country X. The laws of country X govern how the estate is handled, not US law. This means that the rules for wills, trusts, and inheritance may be different from what one might expect under US law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because US law does not automatically apply to estates in other countries. Option B is false because trusts, even in the US, do not always have to include all children as equal beneficiaries. Option D is also incorrect because the existence of a trust can override intestate succession laws, and these laws can vary by country.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complexities of international estate law and the importance of jurisdiction in such matters."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79466/is-it-necessary-for-india-to-have-a-war-crimes-act-to-prosecute-war-criminals-in", "docs_id": 79466, "title": "is it necessary for India to have a war crimes act to prosecute war criminals in India too?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many EU nations have a war crimes act in their countries to prosecute e g.

The country has ratified the Genocide Convention, but domestic legislation specifically addressing war crimes in cross-border conflicts is limited. The text mentions that Indian legislators argue that current laws are sufficient to deal with such issues, although there is debate about their effectiveness.

Such demands are not usually made at the level of the President of the United States, but the president could order a specific official to take such action.

The information provided indicates that the U.S. government, particularly the executive branch, can compel private citizens to take specific actions without a court order when authorized by specific statutes. The primary example given is the use of National Security Letters, which are authorized by 50 USC 3162. These letters can demand that individuals or companies provide information or take certain actions, often with a gag order preventing them from disclosing the demand.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the President does have expanded powers during wartime, the ability to compel private citizens is not limited to declared wars or emergency powers.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because, although the Fourth Amendment does provide protections against unreasonable searches and seizures, there are legal mechanisms (like National Security Letters) that allow the government to compel certain actions without violating the Constitution.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, while Congress creates the laws that authorize such actions, they do not need to give express permission for each individual case. Once the law is in place, authorized agencies can act within the scope of that law.\n\nThe case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v.

The law was most likely implemented to comply with the First Geneva Convention of 1949. Article 53 \u00a7 2 of this convention explicitly requires signatories to prohibit the use of the Swiss coat of arms by private individuals, societies, or firms for commercial purposes or in ways that could wound Swiss national sentiment.

The law wasn't specifically about protecting Swiss businesses, but rather about complying with international law.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the Swiss flag (a white cross on a red field) is quite different from the American flag and unlikely to cause confusion.\n\nThe question tests understanding of international law, the significance of the Geneva Conventions, and the reasons behind seemingly unusual national laws."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61533/is-it-illegal-to-drop-boulders-into-the-sea", "docs_id": 61533, "title": "Is it illegal to drop boulders into the sea?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The BBC has a [video](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-environment-56201231) in which those opposing Greenpeace say so\n\n> A Greenpeace ship has been dropping huge boulders into the sea off Brighton this week to stop fishing boats from trawling the sea bed. \\[...]\n> \n> \n> But leaders of the fishing community describe the action as dangerous, illegal and irresponsible.\n\nWhat UK law prohibits this and what is the penalty for breaking it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The sea area in question is a [Marine Protected Area](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_protected_area), which is referred to in the [united\\-kingdom](/questions/tagged/united-kingdom \"show questions tagged 'united-kingdom'\") as a [Marine Conservation Zone](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Conservation_Zone) (as per No17 on the 2016 linked list) and lies within the [UK's territorial waters](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/49?timeline=false).\n\n**What UK law prohibits this?**\n\nI have discounted my initial thoughts about [s.58(2\\) of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/section/58?timeline=false) as I strongly suspect the Greenpeace vessel is neither UK registered nor proceeding to/from a UK port.\n\nI have also considered the [Criminal Damage Act 1971](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1971/48/contents) which, although potentially viable\\* and has [off\\-shore jurisdiction](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/41-42/73?timeline=false), I have discounted in favour of the  [Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/23/contents) which creates the offence of depositing objects in the UK's territorial waters without a licence:\n\n[s.65](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/23/section/65?timeline=false) **Requirement for a Licence**\n\n> (1\\) No person may \\-\n> \n> \n> (a) carry on a licensable marine activity\n> ...\n> except in accordance with a marine licence granted by the appropriate licensing authority.\n\n[s.66(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/23/section/66?timeline=false) **Licensable Marine Activity** includes:\n\n> 1\\.(a) To deposit any substance or object within the UK marine licensing area, either in the sea or on or under the sea bed, from ... any ... vessel ...\n\n[s.66(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/23/section/66?timeline=false) states the \"UK marine licensing area\u201d consists of the *UK Marine Area* which is defined by [s.42](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/23/section/42?timeline=false) to include:\n\n> the area of sea within the seaward limits of the [territorial sea adjacent to the United Kingdom](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1353/made)\n\n**What is the penalty?**\n\n[s.85(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/23/section/85?timeline=false) states anyone guilty of a s.65(1\\) offence is liable:\n\n> (a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding \u00a350,000,\n> \n> \n> (b) on conviction on indictment, to a fine or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to both.\n\n\\*relating to the seabed as well as the bottom trawlers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under UK law, what is the most appropriate charge and maximum penalty for Greenpeace's action of dropping boulders into a Marine Protected Area off the coast of Brighton without a license?\n\nA) Criminal Damage Act 1971; Maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment\nB) Merchant Shipping Act 1995; Maximum fine of \u00a350,000\nC) Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009; Maximum of 2 years imprisonment and/or unlimited fine\nD) Environmental Protection Act 1990; Maximum fine of \u00a320,000\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate law for this situation is the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009.

Maxon, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled on the use of drones for surveillance without a warrant. Which of the following best describes the court's reasoning for requiring a warrant in this case?\n\nA) The drone violated FAA minimum altitude regulations, which automatically makes the surveillance illegal.\n\nB) Any use of drones by law enforcement agencies for surveillance purposes requires a warrant, regardless of circumstances.\n\nC) The low-altitude, targeted nature of the drone surveillance intruded upon the reasonable expectation of privacy, unlike traditional aerial observations.\n\nD) The drone captured infrared images, which the Supreme Court has previously ruled as unconstitutional without a warrant in Kyllo v. United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The court's reasoning in Long Lake Township v. Maxon centered on the concept of \"reasonable expectation of privacy\" and how drone surveillance differs from traditional aerial observations. The court concluded that \"low-altitude, unmanned, specifically-targeted drone surveillance of a private individual's property is qualitatively different from the kinds of human-operated aircraft overflights permitted by Ciraolo and Riley.\" This intrusion into reasonable expectations of privacy is what led the court to require a warrant for such drone surveillance.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the drone's low altitude was a factor, violating FAA regulations doesn't automatically make the surveillance illegal from a Fourth Amendment perspective. Option B is too broad, as the ruling doesn't apply to all drone use by law enforcement. Option D is incorrect because while the Kyllo case was cited, this case didn't involve infrared imaging."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/3836/when-can-a-landlord-withhold-damage-deposit", "docs_id": 3836, "title": "When can a landlord withhold damage deposit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What must a landlord do to (legally) withhold some or all of a past tenant's damage deposit (aka security deposit)? I've heard (from the tenancy office) that a landlord cannot arbitrarily withhold the damage deposit, but what does this actually mean?\n\nI guess my first question is: When is a tenant held financially responsible for damage? For example, if a rock is thrown from outside and breaks the window, it wouldn't be the tenant's fault. But if the tenant spills something that stains the carpet, then it may be (though even this might be a gray area if the carpets were so old as to be due for replacement anyway).\n\nWhen a tenant moves out, what prevents the landlord from breaking something himself and claiming it was the tenant; or putting a bunch of garbage into the house, claiming the tenant left it, and charging for the delivery to the dump? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A tenant can only be held liable for any damage that is caused during the course of the tenancy if not pre\\-existing (marked by notation in your lease, or photos upon move\\-in). If *you* cause damage you must pay reasonable cost to rectify the damage. I feel comfortable saying that as a rule, landlords are not typically piling trash in the house or breaking things to get your deposit. Logically, they'd still have to have the trash removed and fix any damages, even if they use your deposit, so there is not a whole lot to gain by doing that. Landlords tend to not want their properties damaged; they want the unit re\\-rented. Typically, compared to the monthly value of the unit, your deposit is small in comparison. I have heard people argue this type of thing in court and they inevitably lose.\n\nLandlords, however, cannot act arbitrarily in keeping your deposit. This just means they must be reasonable in what they keep, if anything. If there is a hole or two from nails, they cannot charge to re\\-paint. However, if you trash the walls or if you paint a wall hot pink, they can. If a neignbor kid breaks the window, you'd need to notify the landlord before the day you move out, and take actions to mitigate the damage (ie. speak to the parents of the kid, file a police report, or whatever else supports you landlord in getting it paid for by a third\\-party).\"Reasonable\" generally means that unless you caused damage to the apartment and you abide(d) by the terms of your rental agreement/lease, your landlord must refund your deposit along with interest from the day you moved in. \n\nKeep in mind, if you have a contract, that instrument will direct the terms of what you must do to ensure your deposit is returned. If you don't have a writing, local housing laws will dictate the terms of a tenancy\\-at\\-will. With these, the same rules apply to your deposit, except there are not special conditions except those set by the law, and you can move anytime with 30 days notice from the last paid rent. Otherwise, your rental term will determine when you can leave with no loss of deposit or other financial damages.\n\nSo long as you proceed both during tenancy and upon departure, in keeping with your agreement (which is controlling so long as it is in keeping with the laws), you are entitled to a full refund \\- usually in at maximum of 30 days, or earlier if your lease/agreement sets it out as such. Many landlords will return the deposit after the move\\-out walk through if you've completed the entire term of your lease and owe no back rent or late fees. Walkthrough is integral to getting your deposit back; be sure to take photos. \n\nIf you do have a lease and regardless, you leave early, there will be an early abandonment/termination fee \\- even with prior notice. The fee for this will usually be either a lump sum, or the amount due under the lease had you stayed; if you owe early termination fees your deposit can be kept to help fulfill this amount potentially due. If you have a pet, there may be a non\\-refundable pet deposit; some leases have a non\\-refundable cleaning fee regardless of pets; some require you leave the apartment broom\\-swept and generally clean; some leases charge storage or trash removal for anything left behind. No matter what happens, when your tenancy ends, you should walk through the apartment with your landlord, whereby he he goes through it with you and afterward he signs a statement that you walked through together and there were either no damages\\-or if there are, that they're determined and agreed to at that time. If there is one that you disagree on, mark it as such and try to negotiate how much you'll be charged for it, or if you can fix it yourself. If you cannot agree, he can keep the cost of fixing it, and then your only recourse is to sue to have it returned.\n\nIf your landlord keeps any portion of your deposit, he *must* send an itemized record of what what kept and *why*, and the costs for *each damage* individually itemized. With that, he must return any reminder.\nhere are things that a landlord can never do. Your deposit cannot be kept \"unreasonably\". It would be *unreasonable* to withhold any portion of your deposit if you've not damaged anything and owe no financial reparations. It would be unreasonable if you owe no money. \n\nThere are things that a landlord can never do so as not to keep your deposit \"unreasonably\". It would be *unreasonable* to withhold any portion of your deposit if you've not damaged anything and owe no financial reparations. It would be unreasonable if you owe no money on the lease. A landlord cannot use your deposit to refresh the apartment or for normal wear and tear that occurs under normal use and care. So, for example, if you live there for 5 years you cannot be charged for carpet or paint because it would've been worn with normal careful use \\- whereas, if those items are in bad shape and you moved in only only one year prior (assuming both were new or in great condition), well then your deposit could be used for those damages. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, if you can prove it (or any portion of it) was kept intentionally wrongfully (even if they just couldn't afford it) you can get treble damages (3x what is owed). But, you must show that you ou were due the money back and notice either wasn't given to keep it, or it misrepresented the damages \\- either way, that your money was not returned. The notice to keep any portion must come within the timeframe set out by agreement or housing law in your area.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant, Sarah, rented an apartment for two years. Upon moving out, she conducted a walk-through with her landlord. The landlord claimed the following damages and deductions from her $1000 security deposit:\n\n1. Repainting the entire apartment - $500\n2. Replacing carpet due to normal wear - $300\n3. Fixing a broken window (caused by a neighbor's child, reported by Sarah a week before moving out) - $200\n4. Cleaning fee for removing Sarah's abandoned furniture - $100\n\nWhich of the following is the correct amount the landlord should return to Sarah, and why?\n\nA) $0 - The landlord's itemized deductions equal the full security deposit amount.\nB) $300 - The landlord can only charge for the broken window and cleaning fee.\nC) $700 - The landlord can only charge for the cleaning fee and half of the repainting cost.\nD) $800 - The landlord can only charge for the cleaning fee.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The landlord should return $800 to Sarah. Here's why:\n\n1. Repainting the entire apartment ($500) is considered normal wear and tear after two years of occupancy and cannot be charged to the tenant.\n2. Replacing carpet due to normal wear ($300) is also considered normal wear and tear and cannot be charged to the tenant.\n3. The broken window ($200) was caused by a third party and reported by Sarah before moving out. The landlord should seek compensation from the responsible party, not Sarah.\n4. The cleaning fee for removing abandoned furniture ($100) is a valid charge, as tenants are typically responsible for removing all their belongings.\n\nTherefore, the only valid deduction is the $100 cleaning fee.

If it is possible, what would such a contract look like (note, I won't be the one to test this, just curious...)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Absolutely not.\n\n### Lack of authority\n\nLaw enforcement officers do not have the authority to grant immunity from prosecution. The decision to prosecute lies with the district attorney's office. Courts have sometimes held that a promise of immunity by a police officer can make resulting statements inadmissible, but that's it \\-\\- the state is not bound by the police officer's promise to not prosecute, except in *exceptional* cases. They can gather other evidence and prosecute anyway.\n\n### Prospective immunity\n\nThe contract claims to provide immunity against prosecution for *future* crimes. Contracts against public policy are void, and I'm having trouble thinking of something which is more against public policy than a license to commit crimes. *No one* can offer that immunity through contract. In a recent trial of a Boston mob boss, he attempted to claim that a federal prosecutor had given him immunity for any and all future crimes for some time period; the court did not accept that, because a license to break the law is not a valid contract.\n\n### Public authority\n\nThere is a situation in which certain officers can grant authority to break certain laws: to catch bigger criminals. However, for fairly obvious reasons, there are *extremely* strict rules on when this is valid, both on the government procedure side and the claiming\\-the\\-defense side. The defense can only work if the defendant *honestly* believed the government had authorized his actions, if the government actually *had* authorized them, or if he followed official government legal advice. In this case, the defendant has no idea if government officials have agreed to the terms; he would have approximately no chance of convincing anyone he legitimately thought that the government approved of his actions. They certainly wouldn't be actually properly authorized, and he hasn't sought advice from the government.\n\n### Other issues\n\nPolice aren't the only people on this site. An investigation tends to involve one or more non\\-government agents who provide testimony in court. No contract with a private party can stop them from testifying in a criminal trial; certain *relationships* mean testimony isn't allowed (e.g. a lawyer can't testify about dealings with their client without client permission), but regular users could be required to testify against the site operator (possibly on the basis of *actual* immunity).\n\n### Sources\n\nPublic authority stuff: [this Justice Department page](http://www.justice.gov/usam/criminal-resource-manual-2055-public-authority-defense), plus some discussion in [this order](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371/pdf/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371-7.pdf). \n\nProspective immunity: [that same order](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371/pdf/USCOURTS-mad-1_99-cr-10371-7.pdf).\n\nLack of authority: myriad readings.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of law enforcement and criminal activities in the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) A dark web site operator can create a legally binding contract granting themselves immunity from prosecution for future illegal activities.\n\nB) Law enforcement officers have the authority to grant complete immunity from prosecution to individuals involved in criminal activities.\n\nC) Contracts that provide immunity for future crimes are generally considered void as they go against public policy.\n\nD) A promise of immunity by a police officer always prevents the state from prosecuting an individual for related crimes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

And if I have, should I?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The US Fifth Amendment right to silence has multiple consequences, one being that the police cannot beat a confession out of you, you cannot be compelled to testify against yourself, and if you refuse to testify, your refusal cannot be considered as evidence of your guilt. There is a related right (the Miranda right), that when arrested, police must inform you of your right to silence and an attorney.\nOn the topic of silence being held against you, that aspect of 5th Amendment rights does not exist in England and Wales, but it remains in Scotland. In fact, in the US there is a kind of \"exception\" to the rule that silence cannot be held against you, in the form of \"adoptive admissions\", where your failure to deny an accusation can be introduced as evidence against you in trial (you can overcome this exception by explicitly invoking your right to silence). The right to silence is generally recognized in common law jurisdictions, but is not historically part of inquisitorial systems (but has spread to such systems in the modern era). Even within common law jurisdictions, the foundation of this right varies. It is encoded in the US Constitution, but is not a constitutional right in Australia. Under French law, a suspect being questioned by a judge during an investigation must be informed of his right to silence, and at trial he can be compelled to testify, but he is free to say whatever he wants, including telling lies.\n\nAs for Indonesia, Ch. VI of the [Law of Criminal Procedure](http://defensewiki.ibj.org/images/6/62/Indonesia_Law_of_Criminal_Procedure.pdf) covers any supposed right to silence: Art 66 says that \"A suspect or an accused shall not bear the burden of proof\". However, Article 175 says \"If the accused declines to answer or refuses to answer a question addressed to him, the head judge at trial shall suggest that he answer and thereafter the examination shall be continued\".

The question that the courts would ask is whether the driver was using ordinary caution (watching for pedestrians or cars backing out), and could have reasonably stopped. See [People v. McLachlan](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/36/supp754.html), where some pedestrians had crossed the roadway and then the\n\n> pedestrians suddenly leaped backward to the west, directly in front of\n> defendant's car, which was then 20 feet from them\n\nand he hit them. The court reasoned that\n\n> it is clear that when a pedestrian crossing a roadway in a crosswalk\n> is so far from the path of an approaching automobile and proceeding in\n> such a manner that no interference between them is reasonably to be\n> expected, the driver of the automobile need not wait for it to develop\n\n\"Right of way\" is not a carte blanche to act irresponsibly. Even in a marked crosswalk on the roadway (where the driver bears all of the duty of care), there are scenarios where a hyper\\-cautious driver could not avoid hitting a pedestrian. See [Schmitt v. Henderson](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/supreme-court/3d/1/460.html):\n\n> We do not declare that in no circumstances is a pedestrian crossing a\n> street under a duty to be alert to danger approaching him from behind\n\nciting the general rule\n\n> A pedestrian using a crosswalk in obedience to the signals placed\n> there for the government of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic is\n> entitled to rely upon others' obeying the law *until something occurs\n> which would place him on notice as a person of ordinary prudence that\n> the law is being or is about to be violated by another to his danger*", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a California parking lot with one-way lanes, a pedestrian is struck by a car while crossing.

According to the provided information, liability in parking lots is determined by general principles of liability and negligence, which are fact-specific. The example given where a driver might not be at fault closely matches option B: a pedestrian suddenly appearing from behind an obstruction, giving the driver no reasonable opportunity to stop.\n\nOption A would likely result in the driver being at fault due to distracted driving. Option C would also likely fault the driver for failing to yield in a marked crosswalk. Option D would probably fault the driver for not maintaining proper control of the vehicle.\n\nThe key factors are whether the driver was using ordinary caution and could have reasonably stopped.

If you want to sue them because you think they were liable for something, you won't be able to do that successfully \u2013 unless you can point to a liability they cannot disclaim.

Then what's \"the maximum extent\" or \"law\"?\n\nThis construction avoids this problem because it does not fix a certain list of liabilities that are included or excluded.

Given a historical analysis, the court concludes that an \"asserted 'right' to assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause\".

They need to demonstrate their efforts to contact John and provide reasons why they believe he is likely deceased, such as his advanced age (95 years old) and the long period of no contact. The court can then decide whether to issue a death certificate based on this evidence. This follows the principle outlined in the documentation that when a court believes a person is likely dead, they can issue a death certificate, even if the person intentionally withdrew from society.

I was surprised that they reached out to me but I guess they got my number from the court.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't say what it means for you personally, but there are some general rules around treating jurors as witnesses that you could learn about. They vary from one jurisdiction to the next, but most of them run largely parallel.\n\nOne important consideration is [Model Rule 3\\.5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/ethics/aba/current/ABA_CODE.HTM#Rule_3.5), which prohibits a lawyer from contacting a juror if:\n\n> (1\\) the communication is prohibited by law or court order;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the juror has made known to the lawyer a desire not to communicate; or\n> \n> \n> (3\\) the communication involves misrepresentation, coercion, duress or harassment.\n\nAssuming there is contact, [Evidence Rule 606(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_606) says that testimony from a juror is generally not admissible when it's about the jury's deliberations. There are some exceptions:\n\n> A juror may testify about whether:\n> \n> \n> (A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention;\n> \n> \n> (B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or\n> \n> \n> (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.\n\nGenerally speaking, courts seem to be very reluctant to entertain a losing party's attempt to revive litigation based on what happened in the jury room, so they seem to take a very narrow view of what it takes to meet one of those exceptions:\n\n* \"Extraneous prejudicial information\" is more likely to refer to a juror knowing that the defendant in a car crash case was a child molester, rather than a juror previously owning the same kind of car and knowing that it has a weird blind spot that could cause the accident.\n* \"An outside influence\" is more likely to refer to someone trying to bribe or threaten a juror, rather than a juror's husband pressuring him to wrap up deliberations and get home.\n* \"A mistake in entering the verdict on the verdict form,\" for instance, is more likely to involve circling \"yes\" instead of \"no,\" rather than a mathematical error in calculating the damages awarded to a plaintiff.\n\nSo unless something went seriously wrong, it seems unlikely that a juror would be called back into court to discuss anything that happened behind closed doors.\n\nThese rules, though, govern only whether the attorney may reach out and whether the juror's testimony may be admitted into court; they don't really say anything about whether a juror should be talking to the lawyer in the first place. On that question, the decision is the juror's. Generally speaking, the juror is not required to keep deliberations secret, but the juror is not required to answer questions about deliberations, either. A juror who believes that some injustice occurred in the deliberations may very well want to answer questions from the lawyer, or even reach out to the lawyer or the court herself.\n\nBut a juror who is confident that everything went right, or who thinks the losing party is just trying to escape liability, or who just wants to be left alone, may refuse to answer questions, sign statements, or otherwise reveal anything that happened. If that's the case, and the juror clearly tells the lawyer that he or she does not want to communicate about the case, the lawyer should leave the juror alone, or run the risk of serious trouble with the court in the event the juror lets the judge know about it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A juror in a recently concluded civil case is contacted by the losing party's attorney, who requests that the juror sign a declaration about the jury's deliberations.

See for example [Rule 44\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#rule44.4) which lists (among others) the following factors:\n\n* Whether the costs are proportionate.\n* Whether the costs are reasonably incurred.\n* Whether the costs are reasonable in amount.\n* The conduct of the parties including efforts made to settle.\n* The value of the case.\n* The importance of the matter to the parties.\n* The complexity of the case.\n* Time spent on the case.\n\nSettlement negotiations can also have specific cost implications, particularly if the formal [Part 36](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36) procedure is followed:\n\n* [Rule 36\\.13](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36#36.13) provides that a claimant can generally recover costs up to the point at which a Part 36 offer is accepted.\n* [Rule 36\\.17](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part36#36.17) provides for cost consequences for a party who refuses a Part 36 offer and subsequently fails to achieve a better outcome in the proceedings.\n\nNote that it is fairly common to be unable to recover *all* your costs even if you obtain a costs order in your favour.\n\nFor some types of case, you will generally be unable to recover costs at all, or only very limited costs.

In a nutshell,\n\n> The VCS came into existence as a sovereign nation in 1929 with the signing of the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy. The signing effectively ended the \u201cRoman Question,\u201d the decades old tension between the Catholic Church and the nation of Italy. Prior to the treaty, the relationship between the Church and the country was governed by the Law of Papal Guarantees, an Italian law that allowed the Pope a certain amount of autonomy within the borders of Italy.\n> \n> \n> The Lateran Treaty consisted of three separate documents spread over twenty\\-seven articles and four annexes: an agreement acknowledging the Vatican as an independent state, also known as the Treaty of Conciliation; a concordat on church state relations between the city state and Italy; and a financial convention liquidating the financial claims of the Holy See against Italy. In signing the treaty, Italy ceded 108\\.7 acres of Rome to the Holy See, thus creating the world\u2019s smallest sovereign nation. At the signing, Pope Pius XI was represented by Cardinal Pietro Gasparri, papal secretary of state, while King Emanuel III was represented by Benito Mussolini, prime minister of Italy. The Lateran Treaty was incorporated into the Italian Constitution sixteen years later in 1947\\.\n> \n> \n> . . .\n> \n> \n> On the same day that the Lateran Treaty was signed, the VCS adopted a constitution in the form of six constitutional (or fundamental) laws: Fundamental Law of the City of the Vatican; Law of the Source of Laws; Law on the Rights of Citizenship and Sojourn; Law on Administrative Organization; Law on Economic, Commercial, and Professional Organization; and Law of Public Security. Under the second of these laws, the sources of VCS law were comprised of the Codex Iuris Canonici (Canon Law Code), and \u201c\\[t]he laws promulgated for the City of the Vatican by the Sovereign Pontiff or by any other authority delegated by him, as well as the regulations lawfully issued by the competent authority.\u201d Article 3 of this law also allowed for the use of Italian law as well as provincial and municipal Roman law when they did not conflict with canon law, the rules of the Lateran Treaty (and, later, the 1984 Concordat), or divine law.\n\n**The role of the Pope**\n\n> The VCS is a unique entity in that the state\u2019s monarch is also the spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church throughout the world. As the elected absolute temporal monarch of the state, the Pope has full legislative, executive, and judicial authority over the jurisdiction. The Pope delegates most of this authority to a variety of organs within the Vatican City, all of whose members may be appointed or removed at the discretion of the Pope. The powers and duties of these various organs are described in detail later in this article.\n\nIn other words, everybody answers to the Pope. He may not oversee this particular case, but he theoretically could.

This finding was made although no prosecutions under such a law had been carried out in some years, and the policy of the Attorney\\-General of Cyprus was that there should be no such prosecutions.\n\nNote at the time of this case Mr Modinos held the position of 'President of the \"Liberation Movement of Homosexuals in Cyprus\"', so his sexual preferences were not exactly secret \\-\\- this being one reason he was fearful of future prosecution under the Cyprus law.\n\nThis publicity did not deprive him of he protection of ECHR article 8 or of the Cyprus Constitution article 15, both of which protect \"private life\". It would seem that ECHR article 8 is not being interpreted as a \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy, where publicity to one's sexual prefernces or acts would void its protection.\n\nThus it would seem, under that case, that publication of texts or images making a person's sexual activities or preferences clear would not deprive them of protection as an element of \"private life\".

Cyprus suggests that the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) interprets Article 8 protection of \"private life\" broadly. The case established that even the mere existence of laws criminalizing homosexual conduct violates Article 8, regardless of whether they are enforced. Furthermore, the fact that Modinos was publicly known as an advocate for homosexual rights did not diminish his protection under Article 8. \n\nThis interpretation indicates that the ECHR does not view publicity or advocacy as negating the \"private life\" aspect of sexual conduct. Therefore, an individual who engages in homosexual activity and documents it for advocacy would likely be protected under both Article 8 (right to private life) for the activity itself, and Article 10 (freedom of expression) for the documentation and advocacy.

It follows from the nature of the reasonable man, as a means of describing a standard applied by the court, that it would be misconceived for a party to seek to lead evidence from actual passengers on the Clapham omnibus as to how they would have acted in a given situation or what they would have foreseen, to establish how the reasonable man would have acted or what he would have foreseen. **Even if the party offered to prove that his witnesses were reasonable men, the evidence would be beside the point.** **The behaviour of the reasonable man is not established by the evidence of witnesses, but by the application of a legal standard by the court.** The court may require to be informed by evidence of circumstances which bear on its application of the standard of the reasonable man in any particular case; but it is then for the court to determine the outcome, in those circumstances, of applying that impersonal standard.\n> 4.

The couple wanted to sign a contract saying that the resulting child would be legally theirs and he wouldn't file for child support etc. The individual claims he informed the couple that in his state there is already legal precedent that states these sort of contracts are unenforceable as void, but since the couple was insistent on signing the contract anyways he eventually agreed to do so, even while telling them it was not legally binding.\n\nHe claims he was sued for \"fraudulent contract activities\" (his exact words). Supposedly because he admitted he knew the contract was meaningless he was now guilty of fraud by signing it. However, he gained no benefit from the contract, as the same scenario would have happened exactly as it is without a contract, and he claims he clearly explained the contract was worthless. I find it odd that he could be charged with anything under such a situation. He makes it sound like this is a criminal charge, as opposed to some sort of civil case, and he says the judge chose to 'charge' him.\n\nAgain, common law, and contract in particular, has always seemed to apply common sense so I was a little skeptical. Of course the individual making the claim also has a history of questionable truthhoods as well, and is making claims that further his personal agenda, so I'm not quite willing to take his words as 100% true.\n\nWould this scenario warrant any kind of potential fraud charges, civil or criminal? The individual in question lives in Oklahoma so probably that's where the contract was signed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Does signing a contract after explaining it was not legally binding\n>  count as contract fraud?\n\nNo. However, depending on the details of the contract, the circumstances, and the parties' subsequent conduct, the donor's ability to prove he actually disclosed it to the couple would strengthen his position.\n\nThe *prima facie* elements of fraud are listed in [*Key Finance, Inc. v.

That preempts the relevance of (3\\). No matter how bizarre it is that the donor eventually bowed to the couple's pressure, that does not change the fact that elements (1\\) and (2\\) are stricken.\n\nYour description does not reflect whether or how the couple incurred any losses, but the requirement of the couple's *reliance* is preempted by virtue of the donor's disclaimer. Furthermore, the donor's \"*history of questionable truthhoods*\" can only weaken the couple's position of \"reasonable\" reliance on any representation the donor makes (in case the couple shared back then your concept of donor's reliability).\n\nThe donor's questionable assertions \"*\\[to] further his personal agenda*\" seems to be irrelevant in this matter because, as you say, \"*he gained no benefit from the contract*\". Also, it is unclear from your description whether or not the donor has been sued/charged at all. The donor's mere allegation that he was sued has no legal effect \\-\\-such as defamation or malicious prosecution\\-\\- unless one adds intricate assumptions into this matter.\n\nAs for \"*he says the judge chose to 'charge' him*\", it is possible that he was charged for something else and he is (whether unintentionally or on purpose) mischaracterizing whatever proceedings in which he was involved.\n\nThe sole act of signing that contract upon proper disclaimer **does not** render the donor liable for fraud.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Oklahoma, a sperm donor signs a contract with a lesbian couple stating he will not seek parental rights or child support for any resulting children.

Later, he claims he was charged with \"fraudulent contract activities.\" Based on this scenario, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The donor is likely guilty of fraud because he signed a contract he knew was unenforceable.\n\nB) The donor cannot be guilty of fraud because he disclosed the contract's unenforceability before signing.\n\nC) The donor is guilty of fraud only if he later attempted to claim parental rights despite the contract.\n\nD) The donor's guilt depends on whether the couple suffered financial losses as a result of the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the principles of fraud outlined in the case law (Key Finance, Inc. v. Koon), the donor's actions do not meet the criteria for fraud. By informing the couple that the contract was unenforceable before signing, he negated the first two elements of fraud: a material misrepresentation known to be false.

They would stop at particular locations, and hold court together with the local judge of a district court as a two\\-judge court. Appeals from district court decisions were heard. Some were passed along to the full Supreme Court, particularly ones in which the Justice did not agree with the judge.\n\nEach Justice had a route, or \"circuit\" which that Justice covered once or twice a year on horseback (or by carriage) spending half or more of his time \"riding circuit\". The process was quite onerous, and was by far the larger part of the work of a Justice. It allowed decisions to be reviewed by a Supreme Court member at places physically closer to the original trials, and served as a filter on cases to be decided by the full court.\n\nThis practice was derived from the older English practice of having ***Justices in Iter*** (later known as circuit judges) who traveled through the country, judging cases that had been held awaiting their arrival. (The word \"Iter\" is related to \"Itinerary\", the list of places one is scheduled to visit.)\n\n*The Marshall Court and Cultural Change, 1815\\-1835* by G. Edward White (ISBN 978\\-0195070590\\) includes a detailed description of the process of circuit riding during the period of 1815\\-1835, and the way in which proceeding in the circuit courts influenced constitutional jurisprudence and how cases came to the Supreme Court. I recommend this extensive book for better understanding of the origins of many features of the US Judicial system.\n\nSome years after the US Civil war the Circuit Courts officially became the Courts of Appeals and Supreme Court justices stopped \"riding circuit\", but the geographical divisions continued to be called \"circuits\", and each circuit is still supervised by a single Justice, who rules on \"emergency\" applications, often for stays of judgement, or for injunctions.\n\nThe division of the US court system into circuits thus is due as much to historical inertia as to careful design, although an alternate design that was an improvement would not be easy to create.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the historical origin of the circuit court system in the United States?\n\nA) It was designed to create intentional legal disparities between different regions of the country.\n\nB) It evolved from the practice of Supreme Court Justices traveling to different locations to hear cases alongside local judges.\n\nC) It was established to give states more autonomy in interpreting federal law.\n\nD) It was created as a direct copy of the modern British court system.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The circuit court system in the United States originated from the practice of Supreme Court Justices traveling on set routes or \"circuits\" to hear cases with local judges. This allowed for appeals to be heard closer to where the original trials took place and served as a filter for cases that might eventually reach the full Supreme Court.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the system was not designed to create intentional legal disparities.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because the system was not established primarily to give states more autonomy in interpreting federal law, but rather to bring federal judicial review closer to local jurisdictions.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the U.S. system was influenced by English practices (such as Justices in Iter), it was not a direct copy of the modern British court system."}}
