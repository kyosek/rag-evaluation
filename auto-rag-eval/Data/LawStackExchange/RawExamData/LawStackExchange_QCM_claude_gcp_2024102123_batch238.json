Month-to-month contracts often have specific clauses regarding cancellation notice periods and billing cycles. Without knowing these details, it's impossible to definitively state whether the service provider's actions are justified. The contract's terms would typically specify how cancellations are handled, including any notice periods required and how billing is managed during the cancellation process.

In Washington state, it is legal to possess and purchase up to 28 grams of MJ. Suppose I purchase a legal amount in Washington, then travel to Florida (leaving my dope in Washington), but somehow Florida learns of my purchase in Washington. Is there case law (or any statute) whereby can't they prosecute me for committing an act that is illegal in Florida? It needn't be drugs.\n\nI know (or ought to know) that they don't \"have jurisdiction\": I am specifically looking for case law that officially establishes that in order for a government to have authority to prosecute an offense, the act had to have been committed within the geographical territory controlled by that government. Is there official law that expressly says this, or is this just part of the common historical understanding of \"jurisdiction\"? This need not be US law only.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the specific example you have given, Florida law could not be applied. A state has jurisdiction over a crime under constitutional due process limits on the scope of a state's criminal jurisdiction if the crime is either committed within the state (regardless of where the harm occurs) or is directed at or impacts the state (the classic example is a gunshot fired from the Ohio side of the state line killing someone located in Indiana, which could be prosecuted in either state, or in both states as it doesn't violate double jeopardy to be prosecuted for the same offense by more than one sovereign). \n\nSometimes these issues are framed not as \"jurisdictional\" per se, but as \"conflict of law\" questions limited by the constitution. The proof that a crime was committed in the territory where it is applicable is called proof of *locus delecti* and depends upon the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it. To determine where a crime is committed depends on what acts constitute the crime, something that leaves considerable room for flexible interpretation and a careful reading of the exact wording of the relevant criminal statute. \n\nThe most important limitation on the territorial jurisdiction of a U.S. state is the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This applies directly in the case of federal criminal prosecutions in the federal courts, and applies in state courts because it is incorporated to apply in state court cases through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States under 20th century case law applying the \"Selective Incorporation doctrine.\"\n\nThe Sixth Amendment mandates that criminal trials be conducted \u201cby an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\u201d \n\nIf a suspect is not present in a state to be criminally prosecuted, then the options available to a state are (1\\) to toll the running of the statute of limitations while the suspect is outside the state to the extent permitted by the relevant state statute and the U.S. Constitution, (2\\) to bring a civil lawsuit against the suspect instead of a criminal prosecution, or (3\\) to seek extradition of the suspect, which must be granted under certain circumstances under the United State Constitution and reads as follows in the pertinent part:\n\n> Article IV, Section 2, Clause 2:\n> \n> \n> A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime,\n>  who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall on\n>  demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be\n>  delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the\n>  crime.\n\n(Note that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to civil lawsuits. Civil lawsuit trials can be conducted in a state other than the state where the breach of contract or tort giving rise to the lawsuit took place for jurisdictional purposes and not infrequently is brought in another state, although constitutional choice of law rules limit the circumstances under which a particular state's laws can be applied to a particular set of circumstances in a lawsuit.)\n\nThe Sixth Amendment, on its face, prohibits Florida from prosecuting a case in the example given in the question involving a crime that was committed solely in Washington State. \n\nOf course, the exact definition of the crime might determine where it was committed. In traditional \"common law\" \"blue collar\" crimes there is usually no ambiguity over where it is committed except in the most extraordinary circumstances, but in prosecutions of conspiracies and crimes involving economic activity (such as owning or mailing something), the question of where a crime is committed can grow much fuzzier.\n\nFor example, one could imagine a differently defined crime prohibiting providing funds to finance a purchase of marijuana in excess of 20 grams being committed both in Washington State and Florida at the same time (e.g. perhaps a purchase of marijuana in Washington State was financed by a Florida bank by delivering cash to a courier in Florida who is bound for Washington State knowing that the cash would be used to finance a marijuana purchase).\n\nSimilar ideas apply in international circumstances where the Sixth Amendment and Extradition Clause do not apply. But, in those cases, the more flexible and less well defined \"law of nations\" as interpreted by Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court and the President still does impose some territorial boundaries on prosecutions for actions which are not crimes in the country where they are committed under that country's domestic laws. But, those boundaries are not so hard and fast and the idea that a crime is committed in places where it has an impact allow for considerable flexibility in prosecuting crimes committed outside the United States.\n\nIt has also been well settled since the earliest days of the United States that \"The courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.\" *The Antelope*, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 66, 123 (U.S. Supreme Court 1825\\) and that this applies to states applying each other's penal laws as well. So, Florida cannot enforce a violation of the criminal laws of Washington State in its courts either. If you get in a bar fight in Seattle, you can't be prosecute for assault in a court in Orlando, even if both of the parties to the bar fight were Orlando residents and U.S. citizens.\n\nSome notable cases resolving the question of whether *locus delecti* is present in a particular case include the following: \n\nIn *Hyde v. United States*, 225 U.S. 347 (1912\\) although none of the defendants had entered the District of Columbia as part of their conspiracy to defraud the United States, they were convicted because one co\\-conspirator had committed overt acts in Columbia (225 U.S., at 363\\). So conspiracy is a continuing offense committed in all the districts where a co\\-conspirator acts on the agreement. \n\nSimilarly, *In re Palliser*, 136 U.S. 257 (1890\\) the sending of letters from New York to postmasters in Connecticut in an attempt to gain postage on credit, made Connecticut, where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received, an appropriate venue (136 U.S., at 266\u2014268\\).\n\nA typical state statute on the subject from Colorado's Revised Statutes (2016\\) is as follows:\n\n> \u00a7 18\\-1\\-201\\. State jurisdiction\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A person is subject to prosecution in this state for an offense\n>  which he commits, by his own conduct or that of another for which he\n>  is legally accountable, if: (a) The conduct constitutes an offense and\n>  is committed either wholly or partly within the state; or (b) The\n>  conduct outside the state constitutes an attempt, as defined by this\n>  code, to commit an offense within the state; or (c) The conduct\n>  outside the state constitutes a conspiracy to commit an offense within\n>  the state, and an act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs in the\n>  state; or (d) The conduct within the state constitutes an attempt,\n>  solicitation, or conspiracy to commit in another jurisdiction an\n>  offense prohibited under the laws of this state and such other\n>  jurisdiction. (2\\) An offense is committed partly within this state if\n>  conduct occurs in this state which is an element of an offense or if\n>  the result of conduct in this state is such an element. In homicide,\n>  the \"result\" is either the physical contact which causes death or the\n>  death itself; and if the body of a criminal homicide victim is found\n>  within the state, the death is presumed to have occurred within the\n>  state. (3\\) Whether an offender is in or outside of the state is\n>  immaterial to the commission of an offense based on an omission to\n>  perform a duty imposed by the law of this state.\n\nCase law under this statute sometimes describes the issue presented under this statute a question of \"sovereign jurisdiction.\" *See, e.g., People v. Cullen*, 695 P.2d 750 (Colo. App. 1984\\)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A resident of Florida travels to Washington state and legally purchases 25 grams of marijuana. They consume the marijuana entirely while in Washington, then return to Florida. Later, Florida authorities learn about the purchase and consumption that occurred in Washington. Under which circumstances could Florida potentially have jurisdiction to prosecute this individual?\n\nA) Florida has jurisdiction because the purchase exceeded Florida's 20-gram limit, regardless of where it occurred.\nB) Florida has no jurisdiction because the act was legal where it was committed and did not physically occur within Florida.\nC) Florida has jurisdiction if the individual discussed their plans to purchase marijuana before leaving Florida.\nD) Florida has jurisdiction if the individual brought any marijuana-related paraphernalia back to Florida.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Florida would not have jurisdiction to prosecute this individual because the act (purchasing and consuming marijuana) was legal in Washington state where it occurred, and no part of the offense took place within Florida's borders. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that criminal trials be conducted in the state and district where the crime was committed. Additionally, states generally cannot prosecute actions that are legal in the jurisdiction where they occurred. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Florida's laws do not apply extraterritorially to legal acts in other states. \n\nAnswer C is incorrect because merely discussing plans doesn't constitute a criminal act, and the actual purchase and consumption occurred entirely in Washington.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because possessing paraphernalia would be a separate offense from the marijuana purchase and consumption that occurred in Washington. While bringing paraphernalia to Florida might be prosecutable, it wouldn't give Florida jurisdiction over the legal purchase and use that occurred in Washington."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11513/divorce-case-with-split-custody-age-of-child-when-he-she-can-be-moved-out-of-of", "docs_id": 11513, "title": "Divorce case with split custody: Age of child when he/she can be moved out of of state without consent of other parent", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is about the case of relocating from one U.S. state (Georgia) to another (Florida) for employment reasons in a situation where\n\n* The person relocating is a divorcee (a single parent mom).\n* The divorce case was initiated and has been handled in the court in\nGeorgia.

In most common law jurisdictions, particularly in the USA, how would John likely be treated under the law?\n\nA) John would not be held criminally responsible since he didn't physically commit the act himself.\nB) John would be charged with a lesser offense than vandalism, such as contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\nC) John would be held equally criminally responsible as if he had committed the vandalism himself.\nD) Both John and Tommy would be charged with vandalism, but John would receive a harsher sentence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Based on the principles of complicity in criminal law, John would likely be held equally responsible as if he had committed the vandalism himself. The act of causing an innocent or irresponsible person (in this case, a child) to commit an offense is typically treated as equivalent to committing the offense directly. This is exemplified by Ohio's complicity statute, which explicitly includes causing an innocent person to commit an offense as a form of complicity. The penalty for complicity is generally the same as for the underlying offense. Therefore, John's attempt to use an innocent third party (Tommy) to commit the crime would not allow him to evade criminal responsibility."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51333/can-i-quote-an-article-which-license-is-cc-by-nd", "docs_id": 51333, "title": "Can I quote an article which license is CC-BY-ND", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a question about direct quotations (i.e. \"copy\\-and\\-paste\" portions of a work \\- with ellipses \"\\[...]\" if necessary \\-) and paraphrasing the content of a text article which license is CC\\-BY\\-ND.

The intention is to ensure that trade in the EU is not distorted by government incentives, so that factories get built in the most efficient location rather than where a government offers the biggest subsidy. This is the mirror image of the rules which prohibit tariffs; governments cannot protect their own industry from competition either by imposing tariffs on imports or by providing subsidies to exports.\n\nThe Irish government was found to have provided an illegal subsidy to Apple in the form of a tax reduction made especially for Apple.

The EU ruled that the tax reduction given to Apple by Ireland constituted an illegal state subsidy under EU competition rules.

There are still limitations and conditions that must be met.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it suggests that explicit permission is always required, which is not necessarily the case if the user pays royalties and complies with statutory conditions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it omits the crucial requirement of paying royalties, which is explicitly stated in the original text.\n\nThe correct interpretation allows for limited use of copyrighted work when both royalties are paid and statutory conditions are met, striking a balance between the rights of copyright owners and the ability of others to use the work under specific circumstances."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81918/is-it-newly-illegal-to-say-thank-you-while-driving", "docs_id": 81918, "title": "Is it newly illegal to say thank you while driving?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the UK there have been some [recent changes to traffic law](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/highway-code-changes-set-to-take-effect-this-weekend).

If he had children, I'm sure they'd want it to go to them. However, if he didn't have children, can a clause be added to have it go back to me? She's entitled to 1/2 their accumulated assets during the marriage, but is there any way to deny her anything related to my parents' will?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In some jurisdictions, certain relatives cannot be disinherited without their consent (e.g. in community property states, your wife's right of inheritance is independent of any will).

The hard part if for the testator to decide on / think about a hierarchy, such as \"Wife first; if wife dead, oldest female child; if oldest female child dead then children of oldest female child...\". Painful statements like \"Person X shall in no circumstance receive any portion of the estate\" indicates testator's intent, and following the testator's wishes (hence \"will\") is the basic principle of inheritance law. \n\nIt's certainly possible to write a will, especially if it is really simple.

The Lateran Treaty of 1929, between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, said ([Article 7, paragraph 3](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html)):\n\n> In conformit\u00e0 alle norme del diritto internazionale, \u00e8 vietato agli aeromobili di qualsiasi specie di trasvolare sul territorio del Vaticano.\n\n> In accordance with the provisions of International Law, it is forbidden for aircraft of any kind whatsoever to fly over the territory of the Vatican.\n\nThe revision of 1984 did not preserve this provision (see [its Article 13(1\\)](http://home.lu.lv/%7Erbalodis/Baznicu%20tiesibas/Akti/Arvalstis_ligumi/Italijas&Sv.Kresla_konkordats.pdf)). The present situation is that Vatican airspace, managed by the Italian national authorities, is subject to flight restrictions preventing low\\-flying aircraft and drones. So you cannot legally buzz St Peter's Basilica in your helicopter, but you could fly at a higher altitude in the normal way. (The restrictions are for anything below 3500 feet, and for comparison St Peter's is about 450 feet tall.)\n\nThere are obvious exceptions for papal or other official travel, and Popes have used their own helicopters to travel in and out of the Vatican since 1976\\. Since 2015, the helipad has also been made available for emergency use by medical helicopters from a nearby children's hospital. That demonstrates the extent to which it is *not* available for routine travel. Therefore, I think that \"flying there for business purposes, flying domestically, or leaving the country by helicopter\" are all forbidden, unless you are the Pope or have his permission.\n\nYou also cannot land or take off in a fixed\\-wing aircraft, but that's largely a matter of geography, not law: there is no runway."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: According to the Lateran Treaty of 1929 between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, which of the following statements was true regarding aircraft in Vatican City airspace until 1984?\n\nA) Only military aircraft were prohibited from flying over Vatican City\nB) All aircraft were forbidden from flying over Vatican City territory\nC) Helicopters were allowed, but fixed-wing aircraft were prohibited\nD) Aircraft could fly over Vatican City, but not land within its territory\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Lateran Treaty of 1929 explicitly stated that \"it is forbidden for aircraft of any kind whatsoever to fly over the territory of the Vatican.\" This blanket prohibition remained in effect until 1984 when the agreement was revised. The ban applied to all types of aircraft, including both civilian and military, as well as both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. Options A and C are incorrect because they suggest exceptions that did not exist. Option D is incorrect because the treaty prohibited overflight entirely, not just landing.

I've been watching them for over 6\\-months, so first\\-and\\-foremost I'm a fan. But after having thought about this situation for a few days, I'm not entirely sure if the lawsuit is unfair. In H3H3 videos, they don't just show small clips or images from videos that they make fun of; they show almost the entire work of the targeted author's video but in the form of small clips. \n\nThe format is essentially: \n\n* Show a clip/segment of the other person's video\n* Pause said clip\n* Change scene from the reviewed video to H3H3 making commnetary on that particular clip/segment\n* Pick up where you left off on the video and show the next 5\\-10 seconds\n* Rinse and repeat\n\nFrom watching their videos, I'd estimate that H3H3 shows at least half of the other author's video more than 95% of the time.

Does it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Only a court can decide if use is fair.** As Dale stated, we will know whether it was or was not legally fair when a court decides, and it ceased to be appealed. Unfortunately, there is no formula. Remember that fair use is an exception to rules that make copyright infringement illegal, so it occupies a narrow space practically by definition.\n\nFortunately this was already decided\n------------------------------------\n\n*(yes, I recognize that this is an old question)*\n\nJudge Katherine B. Forrest [decided in favor of your favorite YouTuber](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4356997/116/hosseinzadeh-v-klein/):\n\n> The Court has held that the Klein video constitutes fair use, and further that the Klein video does not infringe plaintiff\u2019s copyrights.\n\nand further that:\n\n> But even if this Court held the Klein video is not fair use, the Court would still dismiss Claim II because defendants clearly had a subjective \u201cgood faith belief\u201d that their video did not infringe plaintiff\u2019s copyrights. Cf. Lenz, 815 F.3d at 1153\\.\n> It is undisputed that defendants understand the concept of fair use and have an\n> established practice for ensuring their videos make fair use of copyrighted material.\n\nBut that answer isn't entirely satisfying, is it? Let's get specific.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFair use seems to be something that ***should*** be clear to both parties: the copyright holders and the user of copyrighted content. While it is true that the percentage of original content may be of concern, there is no specific percentage nominated in Title 17 Chapter 1 Section 107 of the US Code.\n\n> In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n> The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.\n\nIt takes vigilance on the part of both parties to cohabit this narrow law. Fortunately, YouTube has [recently taken measures](https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2016/04/improving-content-id-for-creators.html) to ensure that use that ***should*** (presumably in their view) be judged as fair will remain live on their site while a dispute process is pursued. This procedure resolves cases outside of formal legal battles, which can be costly for both parties. However, YouTube has pledged to [pay legal fees](https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2015/11/a-step-toward-protecting-fair-use-on.html) of content providers that are sued for copyright infringement, in special circumstances (esp. when the use was fair, and when a claimant is abusing, again presumably as determined by some legal counsel at YouTube). They discuss similar matters in their [FAQ page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797449?hl=en&ref_topic=2778546).\n\n> Why did YouTube let an abusive claimant remove my video?\n> YouTube takes action to address cases of abuse and misuse in our copyright takedown processes. While we cannot comment on specific cases or our processes, we do look into abuse of our copyright tools and processes, and have a zero\\-tolerance policy for claimants we've deemed abusive. Misuse of the copyright process (for both takedowns and counter notifications) can result in termination of an account.\n\nAnd remember that courts love precedent\n---------------------------------------\n\n**Future cases will likely leverage the decisions made in the case you mention**. And while the following does not have any real legal value, you may find comfort in knowing: there are many YouTubers out there that heavily leverage others' content, and their videos are still up. Again this is not strictly speaking a precedent, but you can safely assume that in cases where a high\\-profile YouTuber (say CinemaSins, for instance) uses content from many content owners, and uses a great deal of it, they will likely have come up against claims of unfair use, and have emerged with an intact channel.

Any suggestions to improve the question are appreciated.\n\nBonus Question:\n\nIf Harry illegally built a deck and then sold his condo unit to Sally, does Sally own the deck and have a responsibility to maintain the deck or is it the Association's responsibility?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Multiple factors matter and the correct answer isn't always obvious\n\nWhich parties are necessary in an action related to HOAs is often a tricky question (even for smart judges trying to do the right thing) and I have seen cases where the trial court says one thing, an intermediate appellate court rules another way, and the state supreme court agrees with one or the other for reasons different than those given by any of the lower courts.\n\nFrom a litigant's perspective, the better choice is usually to err on joining too many people, which is almost harmless error if they aren't necessary parties, rather than to joint too few people (which can often lead to reversal of a case which may have been correctly decided on the merits).\n\nSome of the main factors are reviewed below.\n\n**What remedy is sought?**\n\nPart of the answer hinges upon the remedy being sought.\n\nIf the suing HOA member sues for a declaratory judgment that allowing this was improper and a prospectively enforceable injunction, the individual HOA members are probably not necessary parties. Is the person suing seeking an order to tear down the decks? To impose a fine? For some injury suffered by another HOA member in the form of reduced property values?\n\nOne bright line rule is that anyone against whom relief is sought, directly or indirectly, is generally a necessary party, so the nature of the claim brought and the relief sought are critical to evaluating who is a necessary party.\n\nIf the relief sought is to have a deck removed, the owner of the property served by that deck almost certainly has to be made a party.\n\nEven this rule has exceptions, however, in cases where a named defendant fairly represents the interests of the unnamed defendants in some cases.\n\nFor example, the beneficiaries of a trust owning a unit don't have to be named as parties if the trust is named as a party.\n\nRelief in the form of a money judgment against a defendant almost always requires that defendant to be joined as a party. Relief \"in rem\" limited to recovery involving a particular identified piece of property sometimes can proceed with fewer parties if notice by publication is given to potentially interested parties.\n\n**Who owns the common areas?**\n\nIn some HOAs, all members have a present, undivided tenants\\-in\\-common co\\-ownership interest in the common areas, while in others, the common areas are owned by the HOA and the members of the HOA don't have a property interest in the common areas.\n\nThis arcane and technical issue could be outcome determinative on a necessary parties question. If the common areas are owned as tenants\\-in\\-common, all members of the HOA may be necessary parties.\n\n**Who has permission to enforce covenant violations and is this a covenant violation?**\n\nWho has standing to complain about the failure of a homeowner to comply with the covenants in the governing documents?\n\nSome HOA governing documents limit this authority to the HOA only, others allow either the HOA or any HOA member to enforce covenant violations.\n\nIn other words, some HOA governing documents allow Bob to sue Sally directly, without even naming the HOA as a party, for some kinds of covenant violations. Others authorize only the HOA to sue Sally.\n\nBut if the problem is that the HOA approved something that it shouldn't have approved, it isn't necessary a covenant violation, even though it seems to be one on its face.\n\n**Statute of limitations issues**\n\nRelated to who can sue, is the issue of statute of limitations.\n\nIn Colorado, where I practice law, and in many other states, there is a short statute of limitations (one year) within which you can sue to assert that a completed structure is built in violation of HOA covenants, and sometimes what triggers the statute of limitations will be different for a claim brought be the association (which may run from the date of the violation or from when it had notice) and for a claim brought by a homeowner (which can run from the date that an HOA member has notice of the violation).\n\n**Have HOA members or the HOA done something actionably wrong?**\n\nA common scheme in HOA governing documents is that someone must seek permission from an architectural control committee to make some kind of improvement, and if the architectural control committee fails to act within a certain amount of time, the proposal is deemed approved, even if it clearly violates some HOA policy or covenant.\n\nIn those cases, there is no valid claim of anyone against the offending deck building HOA member, and there isn't necessarily a claim against the HOA for negligently failing to enforce its covenants either.\n\n**The nature of the claim governs whether it runs with the land.**\n\nSometimes the nature of the claim is that a particular owner at a particular time did something wrong for which they are responsible (e.g. allowed a dog off a leash that bit someone). Usually claims like that name only the owner who did something wrong.\n\nSometimes something related to whether the property can continue to be in the state it is will run with the land and apply to future owners, so will claims that are liens against the property (e.g. for unpaid assessments) that were perfected by the person imposing them prior to the sale and not cleared up at closing.\n\nAnd, nothing prevents a single complaint filed in court from asserting more than one kind of claim.\n\nThe distinction is harder than it seems because the issue of whether an offense is particular to the person who committed it, or runs with the land, is often non\\-obvious and not well developed in case law or statutes.\n\n**Bottom line: It's complicated.**\n\nBecause multiple aspects of the HOA governing documents and the precise nature of the relief sought in the case are so essential to determining who is or is not a necessary party to a lawsuit involving an alleged failure by the HOA to comply with its own policies, determining who is a necessary party isn't easy.\n\nFar more facts are necessary to answer the question correctly.\n\n### Bonus question\n\n> If Harry illegally built a deck and then sold his condo unit to Sally,\n> does Sally own the deck and have a responsibility to maintain the deck\n> or is it the Association's responsibility?\n\nThis is highly dependent upon the definitions used and responsibilities created in the HOA governing documents. A lot will depend upon whether the governing documents treat this as a part of a unit, a limited common element, or a common element, but there is more to it than that. Even if it was built in violation of HOA policies, it may be a fait accompli at some point that is treated as valid.\n\nThere is not one consistent way to handle this issue that is predominant in HOA governing documents."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Florida HOA case where wooden decks were improperly built on common areas without required approvals, which of the following factors is LEAST likely to be considered when determining if an owner is an indispensable party to a lawsuit seeking removal of the decks?\n\nA) Whether the owner currently owns the unit with the deck or purchased it after the deck was built\nB) The specific remedy being sought in the lawsuit (e.g., declaratory judgment vs. deck removal)\nC) Whether the HOA governing documents allow individual members or only the HOA to enforce covenant violations\nD) The color and material of the deck in question\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the timing of ownership (current vs. previous) can be relevant in determining responsibility and necessary parties.\nB) is incorrect because the nature of the remedy sought is a critical factor in determining necessary parties.\nC) is incorrect because the authority to enforce violations as outlined in HOA documents is an important consideration.\nD) is correct as the LEAST likely factor.

There is a large body of First Amendment case law that relates to claimed religious beliefs, and the restriction that the government cannot prohibit a person from exercising their religious beliefs. The courts therefore avoid bright\\-line answers to the question.\n\nYou can look at [Friedman v. Southern Cal. Permanente](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ca-court-of-appeal/1465095.html) for an example where a court found that a belief is not a religious belief, finding that veganism is not a \"religious creed\" within the meaning of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. Plaintiff was told to get a mumps vaccination (which involves chicken embryo) as a condition of employment, refused, and the offer of employment was refused. [The law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=12940.&lawCode=GOV), \u00a712940a makes it unlawful \"because of the religious creed of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person...\".

Seeger, 380 U.S. 163 and Welsh v. US, 398 U.S. 333\\. And the court points out that government agencies are granted wide latitude in interpreting enabling legislation (under which the government might allow or disallow an action).\n\nIt us noted that as of 2002, there were no California cases deciding what constitutes a religious creed w.r.t. FEHA and that regulation. The court then recited various statements from other California cases regarding the characterization of a religion \u2013 the main relevant point is that a religion does not have to be theistic to be a \"religion\". The court also reviews federal employment discrimination laws, and again considers the difference between traditional and non\\-traditional religions. There are many snippets in the review of the law section saying things such as that\n\n> the court should find beliefs to be a religion if they \u2018occupy the\n> same place in the life of the \\[individual] as an orthodox belief in\n> God holds in the life of one clearly qualified.\u2019\n\nWe can now move to the question in \u00a76, *Is Veganism a Religious Creed For Purposes of the FEHA*. This court states that\n\n> The test we apply is that set forth in Judge Adams's concurring\n> opinion in [Malnak](https://casetext.com/case/malnak-v-yogi) which has been adopted by the Third, Eighth, Ninth,\n> and Tenth Circuits\n\nwhich they say\n\n> presents the best objective method for answering the question whether\n> a belief plays the role of a religion and functions as such in an\n> individual's life\n\nAt this point, we can't reasonably guess how some individual would object on religious grounds to the vaccination mandate, but we do at least know what aspects of the law would be relevant and where the \"rules\" are laid down. Until someone actually alleges that they have a religious belief that prohibits vaccination, we can't analyze those arguments. The gist of the \"veganism is not a religion\" is it is too narrow a belief to constitute a religious belief. The court found that did not find that it is a \"belief system (which) addresses fundamental or ultimate questions\", and that it does not a address fundamental questions such as \"the meaning of human existence; \u2009the purpose of life; \u2009theories of humankind's nature or its place in the universe; \u2009matters of human life and death; \u2009or the exercise of faith\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the court's ruling in Friedman v.

This criterion was deemed crucial in determining if a belief system functions as a religion in an individual's life.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the court explicitly stated that a religion does not have to be theistic to qualify as a \"religious creed\" under FEHA.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while traditionally recognized religions are included, the definition extends beyond them to encompass non-traditional beliefs that occupy a parallel place of importance in an individual's life.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while dietary practices may be part of a religious belief system, they alone are not sufficient to qualify as a religious creed.

The Act specifically addresses assisted reproduction, stating that a person who consents to assisted reproduction with the intent to be a parent is considered the legal parent.

Because news channels do that as well where they blur watermarks on video clips.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [17 USC 1202(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1202) states:\n\n> *Removal or **Alteration** of Copyright Management Information*.\u2014No person\n> shall, without the authority of the copyright owner or the law\u2014 (1\\)\n> intentionally remove or **alter** any copyright management information,\n> (2\\) distribute or import for distribution copyright management\n> information knowing that the copyright management information has been\n> removed or **altered** without authority of the copyright owner or the\n> law, or (3\\) distribute, import for distribution, or publicly perform\n> works, copies of works, or phonorecords, knowing that copyright\n> management information has been removed or **altered** without authority\n> of the copyright owner or the law, knowing, or, with respect to civil\n> remedies under section 1203, having reasonable grounds to know, that\n> it will induce, enable, facilitate, or conceal an infringement of any\n> right under this title.\n\nIn the suggested sample, it is impossible to judge whether the blurred SE corner is \u201ccopyright management information\u201d, defined in para (c), because it has been, well, blurred. For example, if the blurred portion says \"Call now, operators waiting\" or \"Don't do this at home!\", that is not copyright management information. Assuming that this is the manufacturer's name (the video being a work for hire so Terex holds the copyright), then blurring that label without permission would be a violation of this section of copyright law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A YouTube channel specializing in list-style videos occasionally uses short clips from other sources with voiceovers. The channel owner is considering blurring watermarks on these clips. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice under U.S. copyright law?\n\nA) Blurring watermarks is always legal as long as the use of the clip falls under fair use.\n\nB) Blurring watermarks is explicitly permitted by Section 1202 of the U.S. Copyright Act.\n\nC) Blurring watermarks may violate copyright law if the watermark contains copyright management information.\n\nD) Blurring watermarks is legal because news channels commonly engage in this practice.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to 17 USC 1202(b), it is prohibited to intentionally remove or alter any copyright management information without the authority of the copyright owner. Blurring a watermark could be considered alteration of copyright management information if the watermark contains such information (e.g., copyright owner's name). Therefore, blurring watermarks may indeed violate copyright law in these circumstances.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fair use does not automatically make altering copyright management information legal. \n\nOption B is false; Section 1202 does not explicitly permit blurring watermarks. In fact, it prohibits alteration of copyright management information.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the practices of news channels do not determine the legality of an action.

From what I've learnt, they only get the evidence by investigating your computer. Is that right?\n\nOr do they really need to investigate the hacker's computer? And if they do have to investigate the hacker's computer what exactly would they need to \"Find\" to convict him?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anyone can be arrested, as long as the police (and in some cases, anyone) have probable cause to do so. This generally includes two points:\n\n* You are in the process of committing a criminal act\n* The police have probable cause, generally through evidence, that you are in the process of, about to, or have committed a criminal act. This usually requires obtaining a warrant for the arrest.\n\nHowever, it's important not to conflate searches with arrest. Arrests are when you are being taken into custody for the reasons mentioned above. Searches are when your personal belongings (i.e. property), are searched to collect evidence.\n\nIt is not up to police to *convict* someone. This is the job of the judicial system. There's a bit of terminology here: *convictions* basically mean being found guilty of an offence. Police don't have the ability to convict someone of an offence. They do have the ability to arrest, and *charge* with an offence. To charge someone with a crime basically means to accuse them of having done something.\n\n---\n\nNow let's get to the actual crime. Since you haven't mentioned a specific jurisdiction, I'm going to use Canadian cases and law, but in general, it should apply worldwide.\n\nIf the police have reason to believe that you are engaging in unlawful hacking\\-related behaviour, then they have the authority to arrest you. They simply need to have a reasonable belief that you are engaged in the crime. Something such as connecting you with an IP address and connecting that you were online at the time is enough.\n\nIf the police need to find out more information (which they generally do, to investigate further into the matter) \\- they can obtain a search warrant afterwards. With this, they can legally search into your computer, and investigate. Any evidence that they collect can be used in court.\n\nI've recently done some research into cyber crimes. One rather infamous case involved the attack on multiple large scale websites, including Dell, Yahoo, and Amazon, in 2000\\. This sparked a large scale investigations, between the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) and the FBI. The attacks were claimed by some to cause nearly 1\\.7 billion dollars of damage.

According to the information provided, police can make an arrest if they have probable cause to believe a crime has been committed. This can be based on evidence such as an IP address linked to criminal activity. However, to search the suspect's computer for additional evidence, they would typically need to obtain a search warrant. This process separates the act of arrest (based on probable cause) from the act of searching for evidence (which usually requires a warrant). Options A and B are incorrect because they misstate the requirements for arrest, suggesting a higher standard of evidence is needed before an arrest can be made. Option D is incorrect because it confuses the roles of law enforcement and the judicial system, erroneously suggesting that a conviction must precede an arrest."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/10920/is-it-legal-to-buy-software-license-keys-from-bulk-sites", "docs_id": 10920, "title": "Is it legal to buy software license keys from &quot;bulk&quot; sites?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: <http://www.windows7keyonsale.com/about.html>\n\nSeems legit. They buy license at bulk and sell it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are many aspect to this.\n\nFirst of all, there is a license which is a deal between a manufacturer of the software and the entity who bought those keys (assuming that key dealer bought them lawfully). This license often directly forbids further sale of such keys. So according to manufacturer they can be \"pirated\".\n\nSecondly, there is a law applicable to your jurisdiction. Eg in EU resale of used software is always legal and cannot be taken away by the license. So according to the law they may be legal.\n\nAnother issue here is what proof of purchase you'll get from the key dealer? Your local jurisdiction may not recognize this transaction at all without a proper receipt or invoice.\n\nThis only skims the surface, because later you might want to exercise rights from the license (eg right to tech support or updates), however the license might be already violated.

For example, in the EU, resale of used software is generally legal. However, even if the purchase is legal, the business owner may face several issues:\n\n1. The original license agreement may forbid resale, potentially violating the manufacturer's terms.\n2. The business owner might have limited or no access to technical support or updates.\n3.

This allows attorneys to customize the agreement for individual clients while maintaining consistent paragraph numbering across different contracts. For example, they might remove a paragraph about contingency fees for clients paying hourly rates, marking that section as \"Reserved\" to keep subsequent paragraphs in their standard positions. This practice helps maintain organization and consistency in the firm's documentation, rather than being a space for future additions or negotiations."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43615/is-it-legal-for-a-company-to-enter-an-agreement-not-to-hire-employees-from-anoth", "docs_id": 43615, "title": "Is it legal for a company to enter an agreement not to hire employees from another company?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it legal for ACME Corp to enter a reciprocal agreement with another company to not hire from their workforce.

The office agreed to cover the cost of the repairs in order to facilitate her coming to work as well.\n\nThe offer was made in May, and with the pandemic delays the repair work was finished in June and I was able to order a duplicate title in July. I was working remotely so I brought the title in and signed it, however we did not agree on date, etc. At that point and she was to leave the title at the office until things had been ironed out.\n\nShe had multiple reasons why she was unable to take possession of the vehicle and kept putting it off. I continued to pay for insurance on the vehicle as it physically remained in my possession.

I did not believe her and to be safe continued to pay for insurance on the car.\n\nI asked her multiple times when she would take the vehicle and always was told later dates.

After much consideration, we decided we still wanted to help her and agreed that we would come in on the weekends and allow her to work so that she would at least be able to make some money.\n\nHowever, at this point I informed her that the vehicle was off the table as she had yet to use it to come to work which was the condition of the gift and now she would not be coming to work on the weekdays as previously agreed. She was unhappy about this and told me the car was hers as she had removed the title from the office already. In addition, she never showed up for her shifts the following Saturday and Sunday and also never responded to multiple texts confirming her new schedule and asking her where she was when she was a no show.\n\nAt this point we accepted her lack of communication and absences as a resignation and sent her a letter outlining all the facts regarding her employment with us and stating that she was no longer with the company due to her actions.

The mere fact that one consideration entails a permanent effect (i.e., she would not have to return the vehicle) does not change the fact that the parties' ascertainable intent was an *exchange* of considerations.\n\nNow termination of her employment frustrates the purpose of *that* contract. Moreover, since (1\\) she kept postponing the picking up of the vehicle till you informed her of the withdrawal of your offer, and (2\\) her attendance did not improve significantly, the contract was voidable *by you* to the extent that her prior acts (i.e., incurring Uber expenses) misled and induced you to make that offer.\n\nEven if she were in possession of the vehicle already, her erraticism and unreliability suggests that she breached the *covenant of good faith and fair dealing* that is inherent to all contracts.

Are these two notions completely synonymous?\n\nNo. they aren't even that similar in meaning.\n\n> If not then what\u2019s the difference between them?\n\n**Frivolous** means not having a basis in the law or a sincere and reasonable effort to extend the law. Sometimes the term frivolous is also used in a broader sense to include not having a factual basis, even though it would be a valid lawsuit if the facts alleged were true. But a narrower definition calls something without a factual basis **groundless** and calls something without a legal basis **frivolous**.\n\nFor example, a lawsuit for breach of contract in circumstances where you are suing over a contract you wanted to enter into with someone even though you acknowledge that they didn't agree to that contract would be frivolous. You can only sue for breaches of contracts that are actually entered into and it is frivolous to bring a lawsuit when you don't argue that a contract was formed.\n\nA lawsuit alleging that a contract was entered into with someone and breached when, in fact, the other party to the alleged contract never interacted with the person bringing the lawsuit would be groundless, and within a broader sense of the term, frivolous as well.\n\n**De minimis** means that the magnitude of the harm is so small that the courts won't entertain a lawsuit to address the wrong even though the harm would otherwise be something that someone could bring a lawsuit over.\n\nFor example, if you sued someone for negligence for slightly bumping into when you were walking down a crowded sidewalk, even though you suffered no physical injury, and you weren't even made to fall or drop something as a result, that might be a lawsuit that is dismissed because the harm was *de minimis*.\n\nWhether a claim can be dismissed for alleging only *de minimis* harm varies by the nature of the cause of action. Some legal theories will award nominal damages (e.g. $1\\), if you prevail on the other elements of the claim but show only nothing more than *de minimis* harm.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, proof of damages are not necessary to prevail on a claim for breach of contract or negligence *per se*, and nominal damages will be awarded even if you fail to show damages.\n\nOther legal theories make a showing of more than *de minimis* harm one of the elements that must be proved as part of the cause of action for there to be any legal liability at all.\n\nFor example, in Colorado, a showing of more than *de minimis* damages is necessary in a negligence claim.\n\nThis is a distinction which matters a lot in cases where an award of costs and/or attorney fees depends upon which party prevails on particular causes of action.\n\nIn the federal courts, there is an additional subject\\-matter jurisdictional threshold of \"standing\", as a matter of constitutional law, which requires a showing that the person bringing a claim suffered \"actual injury\" which arguably involved more than a *de minimis* harm. But federal courts have recognized that at least for some kinds of lawsuits, standing is present even when the claim is only for nominal damages.\n\nA lawsuit seeking a remedy for a *de minimis* harm would rarely be considered to be frivolous."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A law student files a lawsuit against her classmate for accidentally bumping into her in the library, causing her to drop her pen.

The harm described (dropping a pen due to a bump) is extremely minor and would typically be considered too trivial for the court to entertain. While emotional distress can be a valid cause of action, the incident described here is so minor that it would not meet the threshold for a legitimate claim of emotional distress.\n\nThe lawsuit is not frivolous because it does have a legal basis (personal injury and emotional distress are recognized causes of action).

While parody can be protected under fair use in certain contexts, the key factor here is that the \"Dumb Starbucks\" shop was actually selling coffee using Starbucks' trademarked logo and branding. This goes beyond mere commentary or parody and enters the realm of trademark infringement. The act of selling the same product (coffee) while using a modified version of a protected trademark is likely to cause consumer confusion and dilute the Starbucks brand, which are core issues in trademark law.
