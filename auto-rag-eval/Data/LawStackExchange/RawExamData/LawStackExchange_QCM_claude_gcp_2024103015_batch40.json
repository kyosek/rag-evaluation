That seems a rather week preventative measure, since the two legal teams merely have to keep their communication secret. \n\nIs there anything else that prevents this from happening?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would approach the question from a different direction.\n\nAs an empirical matter, there are very few places in the United States were it is even remotely conceivable that this would happen, despite the fact that opposing counsel in legal matters have to cooperate with each other all time and are very good at cooperation and at keeping secrets.\n\nPsychologist Stanley Milgram noted in [psychology experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) that even slight steps to make someone identify with a particular role powerfully influences their behavior. People are extremely responsively to even slight whiffs of authority and respond to that role. The [Stanford Prison Experiment](http://People%20are%20extremely%20responsively%20to%20even%20slight%20whiffs%20of%20authority%20and%20respond%20to%20that%20role.) reached a similar conclusion. People told they are prison guards act like brutes. People told they are prisoners act like victims. This is true even when everyone knows it is just an act and people get very caught up in their roles. This instinct is at work in lawyers too, who, of course, aren't acting.\n\nOne can ask why, but the question has to be rooted in the knowledge that not colluding really is what happens not just 99% of the time, but 99\\.999999999% of the time.\n\nLawyers as a matter of psychology want to help their clients and identify very strongly with their clients. Yes, they could be punished for colluding with opposing counsel and would probably be disbarred at a minimum and might even go to prison for doing so, but that happens perhaps 100 times less frequently than, for example, simply stealing money held in trust for a client that actually belongs to a client.\n\nLawyers are much more likely to collude with their clients to illegally take advantage of an opposing party than they are to collude with opposing counsel to the disadvantage of their client for their own benefit.\n\nNow, often lawyers do have to do things that their clients don't like. For example, in a civil case, if a lawyer knows that his client has a damaging document, the lawyer will often have to get the client to hand it over to the other side as part of the disclosure and discovery process in order to play by the rules. \n\nAnd, often, lawyers will push their clients to accept a settlement because the lawyers believe that it is in their client's best interest, but that their client is an idiot who is too emotional to realize this fact (and this is not gender specific \\- lawyers have lots of male clients who act like idiots for emotional reasons and have to be talked at length into sanity).\n\nThis probably isn't globally universal. I'm sure that there are one or two remote corners of this kind of lawyer corruption in the United States (probably in the rural Deep South, or Appalachia), and I'm sure that there are some countries where this happens somewhere in the world. But, even in some relatively corrupt part of Europe (for example, Italy or Greece), this is pretty much unthinkable these days.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the answer provided, which of the following best explains why lawyers rarely collude with opposing counsel against their own clients?\n\nA) The severe legal consequences, such as disbarment and imprisonment, are the primary deterrent.\n\nB) Lawyers are inherently more ethical than other professionals and resist temptation.\n\nC) The strong psychological identification with their client's interests prevents most lawyers from even considering such collusion.\n\nD) The difficulty of keeping such collusion secret makes it impractical in most cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer emphasizes the psychological aspect of a lawyer's role identification as the primary reason for not colluding. It states that lawyers \"identify very strongly with their clients\" and \"want to help their clients.\" The answer draws parallels to psychological experiments showing how people strongly conform to assigned roles. While legal consequences are mentioned, they are presented as a less significant factor compared to this psychological alignment with the client's interests. The answer does not suggest that lawyers are inherently more ethical than others or that secrecy is the main obstacle. Therefore, option C best captures the main explanation provided in the answer for why lawyers rarely engage in such collusion."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78201/does-h-r-4310-allow-the-us-government-to-use-propaganda-against-citizens", "docs_id": 78201, "title": "Does H.R. 4310 allow the US government to use propaganda against citizens?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In an online conversation, a person said to me,\n\n> Holy crap are you a bot?

Maybe dont \\[sic] research and follow blindly what your masters tell you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The intended reference is surely to Section 1078 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which is about \"Voice of America\" and other media services produced by the Department of State for non\\-U.S. audiences.\n\nUnder the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, also known as the [Smith\\-Mundt Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act), the Secretary of State was authorized\n\n> to provide for the preparation, and dissemination abroad, of information about the United States, its people, and its policies, through press, publications, radio, motion pictures, and other information media, and through information centers and instructors abroad.\n\nThis law did not explicitly authorize distribution of that material domestically, other than saying it would be available on request to members of Congress and in certain other circumstances. The policy of not making it generally available in the U.S. was hardened into law in the [Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1972](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-86/pdf/STATUTE-86-Pg489.pdf), saying\n\n> Any such information (other than \"Problems of Communism\" which may continue to be sold by the Government Printing Office) shall not be disseminated within the United States, its territories, or possessions, but, on request, shall be available in the English language at the Department of State, at all reasonable times following its release as information abroad, for examination only by representatives of United States press associations, newspapers, magazines, radio systems, and stations, and by research students and scholars, and, on request, shall be made available for examination only to Members of Congress.\n\nSubsequent tweaks carved out many exceptions for other specific content, and arranged for deposition of material in the National Archives. In 1985, [a new provision](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-99/pdf/STATUTE-99-Pg405.pdf#page=27) was inserted to say that apart from certain enumerated exceptions,\n\n> no funds authorized to be appropriated to the United States\n> Information Agency shall be used to influence public opinion in the\n> United States, and no program material prepared by the United\n> States Information Agency shall be distributed within the United\n> States.\n\nThe developing statute law reflects a balance of concerns; it was felt that Americans *should know* what their government is saying to foreign audiences, but *should not be the target* of that official messaging. These additional provisions are not a departure from the position of 1948, so much as they are trying to set out the boundaries more clearly in the light of experience.\n\nThe 2013 law, codified within [22 U.S.C. \u00a71461\\-1464b](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-18/subchapter-V), made some changes to the domestic regime. It authorizes post\\-2013 material to be made generally available to the U.S. public *on request*, potentially subject to a fee: there is no longer a requirement that the requestor has to be a scholar/journalist/etc. It also amends the \"no domestic distribution\" section to account for that change. The bar on influencing domestic political opinion remains, as can be seen from the current codification.\n\nThe present situation is that much post\\-2013 material is available online (which is \"on request\", in that you have to go to the appropriate website). There is [a system](https://www.insidevoa.com/p/5719.html) for requesting permission to reuse this material, including within the U.S.; for example, you might do this if you were making a documentary and wanted to show some VoA footage. Per [policy](https://www.usagm.gov/wp-content/media/2013/11/2-160-Domestic-Distribution-of-Program-Materials.pdf), there is a possibility for providing\n\n> program materials, prepared for dissemination abroad, to domestic broadcasters aimed at foreign diaspora communities as part of the Agency's foreign policy mission.\n\nSubject to various criteria, this allows broadcasting material within the U.S., not by the federal government itself but by some commercial organization \\- if that is still compliant with the prohibition on influencing domestic political opinion, based on the way the material is used. The broadcaster is also obliged to credit the producing agency, so it should be reasonably clear when a video segment (for example) has this origin.\n\nIn answer to the question \"Does H.R. 4310 allow the US government to use propaganda against citizens?\", the situation is something like: it makes it possible for a third party to rebroadcast existing foreign\\-targeted propaganda for a domestic audience, in certain circumstances. It does not allow the government to broadcast or promote it domestically, and does not allow the government to produce it with a domestic audience in mind.\n\nAn important note is that all of this legislation only applies to the foreign\\-audience material produced under the auspices of the State Department (under various agency names at different times). It does not cover broadcasting or communication by other parts of the federal government.\n\nA less important note is that the journal \"Problems of Communism\" mentioned in the 1972 Act is now called \"Problems of Post\\-Communism\", and published by Taylor \\& Francis rather than by the U.S. government.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the changes made by Section 1078 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (H.R. 4310) regarding the domestic distribution of State Department-produced media for foreign audiences?\n\nA) It allowed the U.S. government to create and distribute propaganda directly to American citizens without restrictions.\n\nB) It completely repealed all previous restrictions on domestic distribution of foreign-targeted media content produced by the State Department.\n\nC) It authorized post-2013 material to be made generally available to the U.S. public on request, while maintaining prohibitions on influencing domestic political opinion.\n\nD) It granted the government unrestricted authority to use Voice of America and other media services to shape public opinion within the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the changes made by the 2013 law. The legislation authorized post-2013 material produced for foreign audiences to be made generally available to the U.S. public upon request, potentially subject to a fee. However, it maintained the prohibition on using these materials to influence domestic political opinion.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law did not allow unrestricted creation and distribution of propaganda to American citizens.

Or in other words, could identifying myself as Single as opposed to a divorcee incur any type of liability of which I should be aware?\n\n### Since you specified the financial and medical contexts, yes, sometimes it is mandatory to disclose that you are divorced.\n\n*Any time your signature is involved, be as accurate as the form allows.* The worst consequence I can think of is actually pretty bad (\"penalty of perjury\" is no joke, and whether or not it *should*, divorce *does* impact a surprising number of especially financial considerations.) If possible, it would be better to simply not answer at all than to sign off on something other than the most accurate option available.\n\nIn these contexts, the designation as having been divorced is often an archaic throwback predating no\\-fault.\n\nFor example, divorce adversely impacts your credit (more than the loss of a partner's presumed earning power, the reasoning here is basically that marriage was a long\\-term commitment you entered into willingly that was not fulfilled.) Jobs or employment opportunities demanding a very high degree of personal integrity may be negatively impacted by having, or having had a divorce, by the same reasoning (the examples that pop to mind are officers the military, depending on the career field.) Divorce can be interpreted as an indication that the individual in question is currently not as stable in their personal life and affairs (moving, figuring out joint custody, jealous/vindictive ex, etc.) as a prospective lender or employer requires.\n\nAs far as healthcare is concerned, it can have an impact on health care services and how providers interact with you, your ex, etc. (for example, your child's pediatrician.) Having had a divorce can be a flag to health care provider to screen for depression, anxiety, blood pressure, and so forth; likewise, insurance companies consider divorce a \"major life event\" that qualifies you to change your coverage out\\-of\\-season (I don't know, but wouldn't be surprised if divorce somehow impacted your rates because of statistical increased risk of specific ailments.)\n\nFurthermore, there can be far\\-reaching implications for others \\- how long you were married determines whether or not social security benefits are conferred to a surviving spouse, for example, or calculating your kid's FAFSA in five or ten or fifteen years.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal expert's response, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the disclosure of divorce status on official forms?\n\nA) It is always optional to disclose divorce status, and there are no legal consequences for choosing \"single\" instead of \"divorced\"\n\nB) Divorce status must only be disclosed on tax forms, but can be omitted on all other types of documentation\n\nC) Disclosing divorce status is mandatory on financial and medical forms where a signature is required, as inaccurate information could have legal consequences\n\nD) Divorce status only needs to be disclosed if the individual is paying alimony or child support\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The expert emphasizes that when dealing with financial and medical forms that require a signature, it is mandatory to disclose divorce status accurately.

After asking and researching I found out that I can register a copyright for my app with a copyright office to claim ownership of my app.\n\n**A little bit about apps:**\n\nSome of you might or might not know that an app is just a set of files : java, xml, .... that contain lines of code. And when the app is finished you can out put the app as a single APK file, and that APK file is then put on the play store for people to download (of course the app considered here is android app).\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1\\) How do I register a copyright for my app, do I provide the individual files to the office or the single APK file?\n\n2\\) Do I need a lawyer to do so?\n\n3\\) Lets say I include third party libraries in my app, then these libraries have their own code included in my app. Do I provide these to the office too?\n\n4\\) Any other ways to prove ownership of my app?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can start [here](https://eco.copyright.gov/eService_enu/start.swe?SWECmd=Start&SWEHo=eco.copyright.gov), registering with the Electronic Copyright Office. [This circular](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ61.pdf) describes the process (it's tailored to registering computer programs). You submit the source code in an accepted format (PDF, and others are said to be listed \"online\"). There is a list of conditions relevant to how much you must provide (for example if the code contains trade secrets. [This document](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap1500/ch1500-deposits.pdf) covers deposits, i.e. the copies of the work, and \u00a71509\\.1(C) is specific to computer programs. Read that section to determine what you have to submit. Look at \u00a71507\\.2 for specification of electronic deposit copies. At some point you will wonder about accepted formats: [this](https://www.copyright.gov/eco/help-file-types.html) is the currently accepted format list.\n\nIf you cannot figure it out given this, you do really need a lawyer: but it's not legally required that the application be submitted by a lawyer. There is an increased risk that you will mess up the application if you do it yourself, but the same is also true of paying your income tax, and people do manage on their own. For example, you do need to exploit the \"Limitation of Claim\" field, so that you do not attempt to claim copyright ownership of third party code.\n\nThe situation where two parties A and B both claim copyright ownership is a very complicated matter, briefly summarized [here](https://scottandscottllp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Litigating-Copyright-Infringement-Claims.pdf). Most typically, competing claims of ownership involve collaboration and get resolved in court (or by negotiation) after the fact. For example, A may think he owns the copyright because he wrote the code, but he was hired as an employee by B to write that code, and as a work for hire, B may actually own the copyright. But maybe A was an independent contractor who agreed to write some code and license it to B, and A is the copyright holder. If you are just talking about a case of code\\-poaching (B stole your thumb drive, saw the code, and registered it), when you litigate for infringement, you would present (in court) whatever evidence you have that *you* are the rightful copyright holder. Registration is a requirement for litigation and provides prima facie evidence \u2013 not irrefutable proof \u2013 of copyright ownership. The law does not specify a practical means of balancing the evidence in your favor, but surely there are technical ways of permanently encoding your name in the source code.\n\nIf I want to sue a person for infringement, I must register the copyright first. [17 USC 411](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411) says that\n\n> no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States\n>  work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the\n>  copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title\n\n\"United States work\" is defined [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101) \u2013 as a US citizen, anything I create is a US work.

If the work is unpublished and you are not a US person, it's not a US work. Once you've determined if the work is a US work, you know whether you have to register before you can sue in US courts.\n\nYou would have a separate set of remedies and procedures available to you under Lebanese copyright law (which is a whole other question).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer has created a new mobile application and wants to protect their intellectual property rights.

I told her that I am not comfortable with that request as I will be there by myself and I only know him from meeting him a few times when he visited his sister. Though our lease allow for subletting with the landlord's permission, my understanding is that the landlord would also need all of the current tenants to agree to any sublet arrangement as we all signed the lease. Hence, we are legally joined by the lease as \"tenant\" of the dwelling. I believe as our parents guaranteed the payment of the lease, they also would need to provide approval. Is my understanding correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You should read over your lease document, which may describe specific rules for subletting the place.\n\nIf it does not, then the basic idea is that you do not need to let in any subtenant or replacement tenant that you don't want to. You might consider writing an email or letter (and keeping a copy!) that simply says you don't consent to admitting this guy as a subtenant or cotenant. You don't need to say why. This can be sent to your cotenants or your landlord or both\\-\\-they are all obligated to respect your rights.\n\nUnless there is specific language giving the lease guarantors (like your parents) the right to refuse a sublet or lease modification, they generally do not have that right. If the nature of the rental changes enough that they are being made to guarantee a situation substantially different from what they signed up for, their guarantee might not be enforceable. But it is you, not the guarantors, who have rights as tenants.\n\nI get the sense from your post that the potential subtenant's gender is one cause for your concern. Your objection to his tenancy on those grounds may raise your roommates' hackles, but in *Fair Housing Council v.

The tenant would likely be bound by the terms in the signed lease, even if they differ from earlier discussions. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because proving fraudulent misrepresentation would be difficult if the tenant had the opportunity to review the document before signing. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect due to the parole evidence rule, which typically prevents the introduction of evidence from negotiations when a clear, signed contract exists. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because simply incorporating terms inconsistently is not typically grounds for voiding a contract entirely, especially if the tenant had the opportunity to review before signing."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67186/the-court-does-but-does-your-attorney-have-any-duty-to-assume-you-are-truthful", "docs_id": 67186, "title": "The court does, but does your attorney have any duty to assume you are truthful for the sake of a problem spotting?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When a complaint is first filed, per case law, courts have a duty to assume each allegation you make on information and belief as long as they are each not contradicting any other statement or other evidence present at the time of filing for the purpose of evaluating if there is any actionable causes.\n\nWhat authority governs any similar duties of your own attorney when you make similarly non\\-contradictory, consistent statements to them until you assert that you relayed every fact you deem relevant?

The court doesn't have to actually believe you. The court merely has to assume for sake of argument that the things said are true for the narrow purpose of evaluating whether they describe a legal wrong in a formal sense.\n\nAlso, under modern federal pleading rules in the U.S., the judge doesn't have to believe you and can dismiss your complaint if it is not \"plausible.\"\n\nYour attorney has a duty to not merely assume that everything that a client tells the lawyer is true. In federal court, the governing rule is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which states that when an attorney files and signs a document in court that the attorney:\n\n> certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and\n> belief, **formed after an inquiry reasonable under the\n> circumstances**:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) **it is not being presented for any improper purpose**, such as to\n> harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of\n> litigation;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by\n> existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying,\n> or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) **the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if\n> specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after\n> a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery**; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) **the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence\n> or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a\n> lack of information**.\n\nThe California state law obligations is more or less identical in substance, although the procedural rules of California are codified differently than the federal rules.\n\nSo, a lawyer is required to reasonably inquire into whether the client is telling the lawyer the truth about the client's motives and about the facts.

They must ensure that these contentions have evidentiary support or are likely to have such support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.

A bystander (let's call him Paul) rushes to Emily's aid, attacking Thug in her defense. After a few minutes, Thug is incapacitated and thoroughly bloodied, and Emily and Paul are safe.\n\nIs Paul guilty of assault and battery for attacking Thug, or would self\\-defense or some other standard defense apply?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Legal Context**\n\nThis kind of argument is often called a \"defense of others\" defense which is available in every jurisdiction of which I am aware. Almost every state has a specific description of when this is permitted as part of their criminal code, usually in a general principles section at the beginning, or in the sections pertaining to crimes of violence.\n\nSome details vary from one state to another, but none of the facts presented in this hypothetical really push the envelope in terms of distinctions between one state's law and another. \n\nMost of the differences involve situations when the use of deadly force is allowed. For example, states differ regarding when deadly force allowed to prevent a burglary of your home or business which is in progress, particularly if it is possible to avoid a use of deadly force at all by retreating in a manner that puts you at no one at any significant risk of bodily injury. But, the scenario presented does not appear to involve the use of deadly force (although the definition of \"deadly force\" can be slippery and lead to some subtle variations in what is permitted from state to state).\n\nAnother common nuance of variation between states involves the circumstances under which physical force or deadly physical force is authorized to make a citizens arrest, but this situation is also not implicated by your hypothetical. Once Thug is beat up, the scenario ends without any effort to detain Thug until the police arrive.\n\nGenerally speaking, a defense of others defense that justifies a use of force under criminal law will also not give rise to civil liability in a lawsuit for assault and battery as opposed to a criminal prosecution for it.\n\n**A Sample Defense Of Others Statute**\n\nThe pertinent section of the Colorado Revised Statutes (2016\\), strongly influenced by the language of the Model Penal Code (which never adopted in full by any state but highly influential stylistically in how U.S. criminal codes are drafted) is very typical of the majority rule regarding the defense of others and reads as follows (emphasizing the language relevant to the scenario in the question):\n\n> \u00a7 18\\-1\\-704\\. Use of physical force in defense of a person\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Except as provided in subsections (2\\) and (3\\) of this section, **a\n>  person is justified in using physical force upon another person in\n>  order to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably\n>  believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by\n>  that other person, and he may use a degree of force which he\n>  reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose.**\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Deadly physical force may be used only if a person reasonably\n>  believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate and: (a) The actor has\n>  reasonable ground to believe, and does believe, that he or another\n>  person is in imminent danger of being killed or of receiving great\n>  bodily injury; or (b) The other person is using or reasonably appears\n>  about to use physical force against an occupant of a dwelling or\n>  business establishment while committing or attempting to commit\n>  burglary as defined in sections 18\\-4\\-202 to 18\\-4\\-204 ; or (c) The\n>  other person is committing or reasonably appears about to commit\n>  kidnapping as defined in section 18\\-3\\-301 or 18\\-3\\-302, robbery as\n>  defined in section 18\\-4\\-301 or 18\\-4\\-302, sexual assault as set forth\n>  in section 18\\-3\\-402, or in section 18\\-3\\-403 as it existed prior to\n>  July 1, 2000, or assault as defined in sections 18\\-3\\-202 and 18\\-3\\-203\\.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1\\) of this section,\n>  **a person is not justified in using physical force if: (a) With intent\n>  to cause bodily injury or death to another person, he provokes the use\n>  of unlawful physical force by that other person; or (b) He is the\n>  initial aggressor; except that his use of physical force upon another\n>  person under the circumstances is justifiable if he withdraws from the\n>  encounter and effectively communicates to the other person his intent\n>  to do so, but the latter nevertheless continues or threatens the use\n>  of unlawful physical force;** or (c) The physical force involved is the\n>  product of a combat by agreement not specifically authorized by law.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) In a case in which the defendant is not entitled to a jury\n>  instruction regarding self\\-defense as an affirmative defense, the\n>  court shall allow the defendant to present evidence, when relevant,\n>  that he or she was acting in self\\-defense.

This\n>  section shall not apply to strict liability crimes.\n\n**Analysis of the Hypothetical Facts**\n\n> Is Paul guilty of assault and battery for attacking Thug, or would\n>  self\\-defense or some other standard defense apply?\n\nPaul is probably not guilty of assault and battery for attacking Thug because a defense of others defense justifies his actions.\n\nPaul is using physical force to defend a third person (and presumably himself as well once once he is involved in the fray) from what he reasonably believes to be the use of unlawful physical force by Thug, and generally, under those circumstances Paul may use a degree of force which Paul reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose. \n\nPaul is most vulnerable in this scenario on the question of whether he reasonably believed that the degree of force he used was reasonably necessary for the purpose of defending Emily and himself from Thug's unlawful use of physical force, or whether he went further than what was reasonably necessary for a few minutes that left Thug \"incapacitated and thoroughly bloodied\".\n\nFor example, suppose that Paul had already caused Thug to try to flee the scene after the first minute at which point Thug was slightly bruised and afraid of Paul, but was not at all incapacitated. But, suppose that despite this fact that Paul, awash with adrenaline from the fight, continued to pummel Thug for a couple more minutes as Thug repeatedly tried to flee the scene only to be dragged back by Paul. Suppose that Paul continued the fight after it was no longer necessary because Paul wanted to punish Thug for his mistreatment of Emily and to discourage other people from trying to attack Emily in the future, even after Paul knew that there was already no real risk that Thug himself would continue to use unlawful physical force against Emily no or in the near future. \n\nUnder these circumstances, which aren't inconsistent with the hypothetical facts, if this extra couple of minutes caused Thug to be much more badly injured than he otherwise would have been if Thug had been allowed to flee after the first minute, then Paul could still be guilty of assault and battery, even though his actions were legally justified for the first minute of the fight.\n\nThere is no indication that either Paul or Emily provoked the attack on Emily, or that either Paul or Emily was the initial aggressor, or that this was actually a pre\\-agreed dueling situation. So each of these circumstances which would be exceptions to the general rule that the defense of others is justified do not apply to this case.\n\nThere is likewise no indication that Paul used \"deadly force\" as opposed to mere \"physical force\" in handling the situation. It is likely that Paul would have committed a crime if he had shot and killed Thug instead of beating him up, if Paul knew perfectly well at the time that he was capable of beating up Thug and making Thug go away for good as a result without resorting to a firearm, unless the attack on Emily was severe enough for Paul to reasonably believe that the attack was putting Emily at a real risk of serious bodily injury.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Paul witnesses Thug violently assaulting Emily on the street.

How much paperwork does he have to fill out?\n\nIf the person is on the autopsy table, while he may have technically been legally dead, the person's death certificate has probably not even been issued yet, since normally an autopsy is done, in part, to determine a cause of death for purposes of preparing a death certificate.\n\nNormally, an autopsy is only prepared when the cause of death is uncertain or needs to be documented for legal reasons (e.g. an accidental or potentially criminal death or one that is just unexplained), and the need for one postpones the preparation of a death certificate. If the cause of death is self\\-evident and there is no indication of foul play, an autopsy isn't done and the preparation of a death certificate proceeds more quickly.\n\nIn other words, while he may be \"legally\" dead (defined as discontinuation of the function of certain bodily processes like brain activity and heartbeat and breathing), he very likely isn't yet \"bureaucratically\" dead.\n\nYou can be \"legally\" dead days before anyone even discovers that you have died, with the time of your death determined only retroactively, but that doesn't have any practical effect until someone discovers it and it makes its way through the bureaucratic and court process.\n\nIt takes a few days after a death for a probate proceeding to establish death, heirship and the validity of any will (many states have a 120 hour minimum waiting period after a date of death and most autopsies are within 72 hours). Even if a probate proceeding had been commenced, a simple affidavit or notice that someone was not, in fact, dead would cause the case to be summarily dismissed and it is unlikely that much would have happened in the court process since then.\n\nWith older people, one of the fastest agencies to act is the Social Security Administration discontinuing benefits. But a younger person wouldn't have gotten those to start with, so that wouldn't be a factor.\n\nLife insurance companies normally won't pay until a final post\\-autopsy death certificate with cause of death is in place (so they can look for fraud in the life insurance application relative to the cause of death stated).\n\nIt would be very usual for a landlord to take action sooner than the month after learning of the death, and often the estate will keep in a lease in force much longer. Next of kin may have removed some valuables prior to any official declaration, and while most people would promptly return them upon learning of the \"mistake\", a few items might not be recovered.\n\nThe final death certificate would probably never be prepared. A preliminary death certificate might be quashed as erroneous and not filed with the Vital Statistics Department of the State Department of Health, by the preparing party, through a simple, oral, in office instruction to the person in the coroner's office who handles those filings.\n\nSince there isn't a formal judicial declaration of death or a final death certificate, simply informing an agency or person that received a preliminary notice that it was in error, perhaps by letter or email, would suffice. Even if a final death certificate had just issued, the person who filed it could probably fill out a simple correction form so soon (probably just a matter of hours) after it was filed. It wouldn't be that disruptive.\n\nThe messy cases are when there has been a legal declaration of death and then months of actions have been taken in reliance on the determination that someone is dead.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A young man in California is erroneously declared dead but reanimates on the autopsy table within 72 hours of his supposed death.

As explained in the passage, if a person is declared dead but reanimates within a short timeframe (like on the autopsy table), it's likely that many bureaucratic processes related to death haven't yet been completed. A death certificate probably hasn't been finalized, and probate proceedings typically take several days to begin.

He touched on the things that we were told to leave at home. I asked whether a paperback novel was allowed or not, and he said that there isn't enough spare time in six months of boot camp to finish a book. It may seem, from the outside, that disallowing a novel is an unreasonable abridgement of your rights, but the actual effect on you is minimal.

The documentation suggests that the military prefers simple, blanket solutions to prevent disciplinary problems.

The Secretary of DHS has authority to establish rules, and has recently done so [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/23/2019-15710/designating-aliens-for-expedited-removal). The current regulations pertaining to expedited removal are at [8 CFR 253\\.3](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c57508ef4cccfe5bb518ac20feef57e1&node=8:1.0.1.2.28.0.1.3&rgn=div8). There is no exemption for people being medically treated, for covid\\-19 or any other reason, but \"parole\" is available (at the discretion of the attorney general) to \"parole\" an immigrant if it is \"is required to meet a medical emergency\".

According to the information provided, ICE does have the legal authority to arrest illegal immigrants, even those who have received medical care for COVID-19. However, the Attorney General has the discretion to grant \"parole\" in cases of medical emergencies. This means that while ICE generally has the authority to arrest and potentially deport illegal immigrants after they receive medical care, there is a provision for exemption in cases of ongoing medical emergencies, at the discretion of the Attorney General.\n\nOption A is incorrect because ICE does have legal authority in these situations.

This is a change to [Federal Law 5/2012](http://ejustice.gov.ae/downloads/latest_laws/cybercrimes_5_2012_en.pdf), replacing Article 9 (the translation into English is odd because the verb phrase goes first). The level of the penalty has increased (minimum 150K \u2192 minimum 500K; maximum 500K \u2192 2M).

In any case a signature would not be required I guess.\n\nIn a similar situation on the web, a website would have a link to the privacy policy somewhere in the footer (not very noticeable), and no banners, no notices, or checkboxes of any kind.

And because of my age I am under the risk of being immediately take into forced military service upon my return. I am also known to the community around me of having my own opinions and thoughts about the authorities, some of my family members were killed/taken away because of that. Everyone who speak has a mark on his name to be 'dealt with' later (when I return to my home). Not to mention I lost my home there and have no assets or anything. \n\nThe country I'm living in currently does not grant citizenship or permanent residency. I have to keep working to keep my residency visa through the sponsor. The sponsor will not keep you under his sponsorship for free or for not working for him. Currently the economy is failing badly and non\\-citizens are getting life harder. And if I leave my current job I'll not get another one, means sponsor will force me to leave him which cannot happen without another work, so it will end up for me to be deported by the request of the sponsor since I cannot work for him anymore or cannot find another sponsor because I was unable to find a new job... TLDR: no social/economic security or future in the current country I'm in right now...\n\nFor the future of my family I have to leave and I am looking at New Zealand. I need a visa to be able to travel there... So my question is if I get a visit visa for me and my family and once we land in the airport we claim asylum, is my case going to be accepted? or I'll be deported back to the country I came from (to either my home or the second country)...?\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: New Zealand has ratified the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \n\nYou must submit a request in writing and the Refugee Status Branch processes the claim. While yopur claim is being processed, you will not be deported. A refugee and protection officer will attempt to resolve your claim within 140 days. \n\nRefugee is defined as one who is outside of her home country or country of habitual residence, faces a real chance of harm if returned ot that country, the harm faced is an ongoing breach of a fundamental human right or is based upon who she is or what she believes (race, religionm, nationality, political views, etc.), and needs and deserves protection in New Zealand. \n\nThe process is roughly as follows: file your original claim (forms available on the website of the Ministry of Justice). One for each family member. Once referred to the Refugee Status Branch, you will need to submit a written statement explaining the experiences and circumstances that form the basis of your refugee status claim. About 4 weeks later, youll be invited to an interview with the Refugee and Protection Officer. You need correct documents as to your identity and under New Zealands Section 135 of its Refugee Act, you must provie all information and form your case as to why you deserve and need asylum. Examples of useful documents to bring include: passport, ID cards, birth certficates, marriage certificates, school and military ID cards. If documents are in another language, you will need certified translations of them. Within 3 weeks of this interview, youll be issued the Interview Report, written by the officer, and you will have three weeks to comment on that and submit more documentation, if necessary. The officer assesses whether your statemtents are truthful and credible and whether your claim meets the criteria contained in Article 1A(2\\) of the Refugee Convention or if you are eligible for protected person status (see below). If accepted, you will be able to apply for permanent resident status and remain in New Zealand. If you are unsuccessful, you are required to leave. \n\nPlease visit [https://www.immigration.govt.nz/audiences/supporting\\-refugees\\-and\\-asylum\\-seekers/asylum\\-seekers](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/audiences/supporting-refugees-and-asylum-seekers/asylum-seekers) for more comprehensive information and requirements. \n\nArticle 1A(2\\) of the [Refugee Convention](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/3b66c2aa10) merely restates the definition of a refugee, roughly stating that if, due to race, religion, nationality, etc., are outside the country of your nationality and are unable to or, owing to such fear, are unwilling to avail yourself of the protection of that country. It does note that one will not be considered \u201clacking protection of the country of nationality if, without any valid reason based on well0founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national.\u201d\n\nFinally, should your circumstances not be fit for asylum, you may consider seeking protection uner the United Nations Convention Against Torture ([http://www.nolo.com/legal\\-encyclopedia/how\\-apply\\-convention\\-against\\-torture\\-protection.html](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-apply-convention-against-torture-protection.html)). The requirements to meet are higher than for asylum and the relief is more limited, but if you qualify, the country must admit you and certain things that would bar you from being granted asylum, wont bar you from being granted protected status. One example of a bar to refugee status is being \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in another country, for example. To quality for CAT protection, you have to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that you would be subjected to torture if returned to the country you are fleeing. The CAT defines torture as any \u201cintentionanal unlawful infliction of severe (physical or mental) suffering or pain, with consent of a public official, for purposes such as punishment, obtaining a confession, intimidation, or discrimination.\u201d Torture must be done by your government, or at the request of your government, or with permission of your government. \n\nRelevant items to show to prove your case under CAT are specific types of torture you fear you will suffer if forced to return, what types you have already suffered if you have, what types your family or friends have suffered if they have, and how the government has tortured other people similar to you, if they have. Keep in mind, while past torture may be a deciding factor for asylum, it is not for CAT.

According to the information provided, asylum seekers in New Zealand must submit a written claim to the Refugee Status Branch. They will then go through a process that includes submitting a written statement, attending an interview with a Refugee and Protection Officer, and having their case assessed based on the criteria in Article 1A(2) of the Refugee Convention. This process takes approximately 140 days, during which time they will not be deported. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because asylum is not automatically granted, even for those from countries experiencing civil unrest. Each case is individually assessed.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because New Zealand, as a signatory to various international refugee conventions, will not immediately deport asylum seekers without processing their claims.\n\nAnswer D is too narrow.

Most audaciously to my eye, subsection (4\\) of the bill purports to criminalize transporting a minor out of state (to neighboring Oregon, say) for the provision of such treatment.\n\nShould Idaho attempt such a prosecution, I would guess that Subsection (4\\) would be overturned by a federal court as an infringement of the right to freedom of movement among the states. Is this correct? The closest valid law I'm aware of is the *federal* law against interstate travel for the purpose of dodging state age of consent laws, which is of course a very different matter. In abortion law, there is a related discussion [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41261/is-it-legal-to-have-an-abortion-in-another-state-or-abroad), but this regards an Alabama law that doesn't even purport to ban residents' seeking abortions out of state, which is moot while Roe v. Wade stands in any case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Effect of Bill\n--------------\n\nFirst of all, if this bill (Idaho House Bill 675\\) is passed in the form linked in the question, section 4, which prohibits transporting a child outside the state, **ONLY** applies when this is done for purposes prohibited in subsection (1\\), that is, traditionally defined female genital mutilation. It does not, in its linked form, prohibit transport to violate the new section (2\\) which prohibits procedures to \"change or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex\". Thus the statement in the question that:\n\n> subsection (4\\) of the bill purports to criminalize transporting a minor out of state (to neighboring Oregon, say) for the provision of such treatment.\n\nis incorrect.\n\nNotice that section 4 is not new, nor is it modified (except by changing th4e section number) by the current bill. My understanding is that the travel ban was, when it was passed, aimed at families who took female children outside the US, to African or Middle\\-eastern countries, for traditional rites that include FGM. This was done by a significant number of people with ethnic origins in such countries, and a number of US states passed laws banning such travel. This law, before the house bill, was one such law. The recent bill added \"gender affirming care\" into the law, by calling it another form of genital mutilation.\n\nHowever, for purposes of discussion, let us assume that subsection (4\\) is changed to refer to subsections (1\\) **or** (2\\), thus making the question correct.\n\nRight to Travel\n---------------\n\nThe right to travel from one state to another is a basic right under the US constitution.\n\nThe LII page on [\"Interstate Travel\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/interstate-travel) refers to it as: \"a right venerable for its longevity, but still lacking a clear doctrinal basis.\"\n\nSee the Wikipedia article [Freedom of movement under United States law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law)\n\nThe right to travel was recognized early on, in the case of [*Corfield v. Coryell* (6 Fed. Cas. 546, no. 3,230 C.C.E.D.Pa. 1823\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfield_v._Coryell). This case was decided by Justice Bushrod Washington, a member of the US Supreme Court, but it was decided while he was acting in his role as circuit judge, not by the Supreme Court as a whole.\n\nIn that decision, Justice Washington included \"The right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to reside in any other state, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise;\" as one of the \"privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states\" which are guaranteed to all citizens. This passage has been influential, although not undisputed, in interpreting the \"privileges and immunities clause\" of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn [*Crandall v. Nevada*, 73 U.S. 35 (1868\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crandall_v._Nevada) The Supreme Court held that the right to travel between states was fundamental, and that a state could not impede it by taxing the exit of people from one state to travel into another.\n\nSubsequent cases have deemed the right to travel protected against state restrictions both under the privileges and immunities clause, and under the commerce clause. In [*United States v. Guest*, 383 U.S. 745 (1966\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/745/) at 383 U.S. 757 the Court wrote:\n\n> The constitutional right to travel from one State to another, and necessarily to use the highways and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce in doing so, occupies a position fundamental to the concept of our Federal Union. It is a right that has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized.\n\nThe *Guest* court goes on to cite *Crandall v. Nevada*, 6 Wall. 35, (the case in which a tax on those leaving the state was overturned) and the *Passenger Cases*, 7 How. 283, 48 U. S. 492 in which Chief Justice Taney wrote:\n\n> We are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States.\"\n\nAll this would mean that a law prohibiting travel would need strong justification, and is probably subject to ***strict scrutiny***, a standard of review requiring a \"compelling governmental interest\" and a \"narrowly drawn\" law.\n\nMedical Judgement\n-----------------\n\nThe bill declares that procedures to \"change or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex\" are \"never necessary\", any medical opinion to the contrary notwithstanding. Such an override of qualified medical opinion might be hard to justify in a criminal law.\n\nCivil Rights\n------------\n\nIn [*BOSTOCK v. CLAYTON COUNTY, GEORGIA* 590 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020\\) \\#17\u20131618](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf) the Subreme court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\. prohibits **employment** discrimination against homosexual or transgender individuals, writing:\n\n> Because discrimination on the basis of homosexuality or transgender\n> status requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex, an employer who intentionally penalizes an employee for being homosexual or transgender also violates\n> Title VII.\n\nThis rule may well carry over to other areas of the law.\n\nEqual Protection Clause\n-----------------------\n\nThe [Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause#Sex,_disability,_and_sexual_orientation) reads\n\n> nor \\[shall any state] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nTreating members groups differently because of group membership is often, but not always, an equal protection violation.

The bill would likely face multiple constitutional challenges:\n\n1. It potentially infringes on the right to interstate travel, which has been recognized as a fundamental right protected by the Constitution.\n2. It may violate the Equal Protection Clause by treating transgender individuals differently.\n3.

What does it mean if your product uses gpl?\n\nIf your product is being publicly distributed (sold, offered to the public as a free download, etc) then you must make it open source. This doesn't mean you have to have a link to your product's source code available on your website, but if it is requested by someone you must be able to send them a copy of your source code\n\nIf your product isn't being publicly distributed (e.g only used by yourself or inside your own company) then you don't have to make your code open source.

Ximpleware argues that ameriprise are distributing a product, and therefore needs to make their code open source due to the copyleft requirement of the gpl\n\n3. You want to sell your product, but not make it open source. What do you do?\n\nYou need to contact ximpleware and buy a commercial license to use their code.

You want to sell your product, not make it open source, but also not buy a commercial license from Ximpleware.

This is quite a roundabout way, and potentially a legal grey area (since I can see Ximpleware arguing that people would do this to avoid making their programs open source or paying for a commercial license, but this is probably a problem that you won't have to face unless Ximpleware finds it financially worth it to sue your company for, and even then it's a difficult case)\n\nOverall, buying a commercial license from ximplewar would be the most \"cleanest way\" to go about things, but as it stands I don't think there is anything illegal with selling your software and requiring clients to download vtd\\-xml separately", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company wants to use vtd-xml, which is licensed under GPL, in their commercial product.

If he knew it was false, that constitutes perjury, which is a crime (and could invalidate the warrant, thus the evidence). If he is simply mistaken, that is not a crime, and does not invalidate the warrant.\n\nA statement that there is evidence this person was at the place at the time of the crime is not sufficient to yield a warrant, and would not be perjury (it is a conclusion based on fact: perjury pertains to statements of fact, not conclusions drawn from facts). The statement would need to say *how* it is known that the person was there. If the statement is that \"two eyewitnesses saw him\" and that is just a lie, that is perjury. If the eyewitnesses change their minds about who they saw, or if it is later found that the eyewitnesses were lying, reporting that is not a wrongful act by the officer.\n\nThe affidavit must be \"fully truthful\", and may not omit material facts.

This is a classic public purpose. \n\nGenerally, the government must first attempt to acquire the property out of court by making an offer for the land, and, if it is unsuccessful in getting the owner to accept its offer, it will bring an eminent domain action to seize the land for public purposes.\n\nIn the eminent domain case, the government will win on its right to condemn the land and to take immediate possession of it pending a determination of its value, because the government has the right to seize land to build sidewalks.

Her conduct would also not provide a basis for a valid lawsuit for money damages against her.\n\n### Long Answer\n\n**Applicable Law**\n\nIn Colorado's state criminal code, the relevant statutory section, Colorado Revised Statutes, \u00a7 18\\-1\\-704, states, in the pertinent parts (emphasis mine):\n\n> **Use of physical force in defense of a person \\- definitions.**\n> \n> \n> (1\\) . . . a\n> person is justified *in using physical force* upon another person in\n> order to defend himself . . . and he may use a degree of force which he\n> reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) *Deadly physical force* may be used only if a person reasonably\n> believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate and: . . .\n> \n> \n> (b) The other person is using . . .\n> physical force against an occupant of a dwelling . . . while committing or attempting to commit burglary as\n> defined in sections 18\\-4\\-202 to 18\\-4\\-204; or\n> \n> \n> (c) The other person is committing or reasonably appears about to\n> commit . . . sexual assault as set forth in section 18\\-3\\-402, or in\n> section 18\\-3\\-403 as it existed prior to July 1, 2000\\.\n\nThe referenced definition of burglary as relevant to this fact pattern is that:\n\n> A person commits . . . burglary, if the person knowingly breaks an\n> entrance into, enters unlawfully in, or remains unlawfully after a\n> lawful or unlawful entry in a building or occupied structure with\n> intent to commit therein a crime against another person or property.\n\nNote also that it doesn't matter for purposes of the burglary statute, if this is her kitchen, or someone else's, so long as it is not his kitchen.\n\nAlso he need only be \"attempting to commit burglary\", so even if he was trying unsuccessfully to get into the house and assaulting her from just outside a door or window, her use of deadly force to prevent burglary would be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, if he was lawfully present in the home (perhaps a husband or roommate), the burglary justification for the use of deadly force would no longer be present.\n\nThe referenced sexual assault statute states in the pertinent part that it is committed if:\n\n> Any actor who knowingly inflicts sexual intrusion or sexual\n> penetration on a victim commits sexual assault if: The actor causes\n> submission of the victim by means of sufficient consequence reasonably\n> calculated to cause submission against the victim's will . . . \\[which\n> includes any case in which:] The actor causes submission of the victim\n> through the actual application of physical force or physical\n> violence\\[.]\n\nEven if he does not \"reasonably appears about to commit\" sexual penetration or intrusion (which are necessary for the crime to be sexual assault for purposes of the use of deadly force law in Colorado), unlawful sexual contact is a crime against a person in an occupied dwelling, so it constitutes burglary that justifies the use of deadly force, even if it doesn't constitute sexual assault.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the woman may use deadly physical force if she reasonably believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate to cause the rapist to cease committing sexual assault, *and any other crime against person or property* in the home.\n\n**Application Of Law To Facts**\n\nThere is no reasonable doubt that the man is, at a minimum, in the process of committing burglary, and very likely sexual assault as well, although the language of the question is somewhat coy on this point as relevant to the Colorado definition of sexual assault.\n\nHe has proven himself capable of physically overpowering her efforts to resist him with non\\-deadly force without success. This demonstrates that non\\-deadly force was inadequate.\n\nShe used a knife to kill him for the legally authorized purpose of ending a burglary and probably also a sexual assault.\n\nTherefore, her use of a knife to kill him is almost certain be a use of deadly force for purposes of self\\-defense which is permitted by Colorado law. As a result, she would not be legally guilty of any crime for killing him with a knife in these circumstances.\n\nIncidentally, she would also have [no civil liability in tort for money damages in this situation in Colorado](https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/self-defense-and-stand-your-ground).\n\n**Application To Other U.S. States**\n\nThe exact wording of self\\-defense statutes differ from one U.S. state to another and I don't personally know every fine statutory detail of every one of them. But, Colorado's statute is quite typical. A state where her actions did not constitute legally justified in these circumstances would be an extreme outlier in U.S. law. I would be surprised if there was any U.S. state in which her actions would not constitute legally justified self\\-defense.\n\n**Historical Note**\n\nSuppose that the man in the question were the woman's husband in their own home where they were both lawfully present.\n\n> Prior to the 1970s, marital rape was legal in every US state. It was\n> partially outlawed in Michigan and Delaware in 1974, then wholly\n> outlawed in South Dakota and Nebraska in 1975\\. The court case *Oregon\n> v. Rideout* in 1978 was the first in which someone stood trial for\n> raping his spouse while they lived together. By 1993 marital rape was\n> a crime nationwide.\n\n([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_in_the_United_States))\n\nUnder current U.S. law in every U.S. state, the sexual assault justification analysis would be no different because there is no marital immunity for the crimes of sexual assault, although the burglary justification would no longer be present, so an intent to commit unlawful sexual contact without penetration or intrusion would not justify the use of deadly force.\n\nBut, when marital immunity to sexual assault was part of the law, as it was in every U.S. state prior to 1974, and as it was in some U.S. states until 1993, she would be guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.\n\nThe distinction between second degree murder and manslaughter in that case would hinge upon whether she had an intent to kill or only intended to harm (as in [a case cited by Jen in her answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/92909/9517)). Also, she would have a good argument for manslaughter due to provocation by the victim that was not sufficient to justify the use of deadly force, even if jury concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that she did intent to kill him.\n\nColorado's self\\-defense statute (in a subsection omitted because it was not applicable to the facts in the question) also permits the grade of a criminal offense caused in the course of conduct intended as self\\-defense that does not meet the statutory standards for self\\-defense (e.g. because non\\-deadly force would have been sufficient) to downgrade the severity of the offense for which the person may be convicted, in a manner similar to the \"heat of passion\" defense.\n\nBut, these facts present no plausible justification for a first degree murder, which is often a charge punishable by death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole, since it was not premeditated or committed in connection with a crime by the perpetrator.\n\nRealistically, under the circumstances of the question, if he was her husband and they were in their own home, during a time frame when there was marital immunity from sexual assault charges, she would most likely be convicted of manslaughter under these circumstances.\n\n**Side Observation**\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held in *Kennedy v. Louisiana*, 554 U.S. 407 (2008\\) that the 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution, directly and as incorporated against the states under the 14th Amendment, prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for a rape not resulting in death (even the rape of a child).\n\nThe death penalty has been unconstitutional in cases involving the rape of an adult woman in the U.S. since U.S. Supreme Court case of *Coker v. Georgia*, 433 U.S. 584 (1977\\).\n\nThere are many serious felonies (including some omitted from the Colorado statute above because they were not applicable to this fact pattern) for which the use of deadly force in self\\-defense is authorized even though the U.S. Constitution prohibits the use of the death penalty upon a conviction of that offense which does not result in someone dying.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado, under what circumstances can a person legally use deadly force in self-defense against sexual assault?\n\nA) Only if the attacker explicitly threatens to kill the victim\nB) If the victim reasonably believes lesser force is inadequate and the attacker is committing or about to commit sexual assault\nC) Only if the attack occurs outside the victim's home\nD) If the victim fears for their life, regardless of the attacker's actions\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Colorado's self-defense law (C.R.S. \u00a7 18-1-704), deadly force may be used if a person reasonably believes lesser force is inadequate AND the attacker is committing or reasonably appears about to commit sexual assault as defined in section 18-3-402. The law does not require an explicit death threat (ruling out A), nor does it restrict this right to attacks outside the home (ruling out C). While fearing for one's life can be a factor, it's not the sole determining factor, and the law specifically addresses sexual assault situations without requiring fear of death (ruling out D)."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30182/gdpr-what-exactly-should-i-do-to-prevent-revenue-loss", "docs_id": 30182, "title": "GDPR - What exactly should I do to prevent revenue loss?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've seen many sites blocking cookies right away and expecting users to click the \"Accept cookies\" button to activate them.

The specific requirements are in [\u00a74902](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/4902). One of the triggers is the [\"cancellation date\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/4901), which relates to the initial amortization schedule, basically the day when by making regular payments the loan is reduced to 80% of the initial value (not the loan amount). This completely ignores later appraisals, though the bank can require proof that the value of the property has not declined (and that evidence is \"of a type established in advance and made known to the mortgagor by the servicer promptly upon receipt of a request under paragraph (1\\))\"). The law excludes inflationary changes in equity, where e.g. one has an initial 5% interest that swells to a 20% interest over a few years because of inflation.

This date is when the loan balance is scheduled to reach 80% of the original value, regardless of current appraisals. While the homeowner can appeal the bank's appraisal, they cannot force the bank to use a different valuation method.

What typically tends to come up as the subject of dispute is rooted in the urban legend that one cannot obtain a patent (utility) on software. This is substantially incorrect, and any patent attorney asserting to the veracity of this makes a substantially false conclusory statement of law knowingly and willfully controverting the actual state of law in, at least, all Western jurisdictions as it omits to assert to the fact that one is not barred to obtain a patent on any system that comprises of non\\-obvious software, and hardware to run on is entitled to a patent \u2014 except in the U.S. where one must also comply with the *Alice* decision requiring that at least one hardware component in addition to the hardware of a generic computer be necessary for the utility of the system. However, in the U.S., one may obtain a software\\-centered patent through a (i) method or (ii) a computer program product in addition to (iii) systems or apparatuses which are available avenues for patents everywhere else.\n\nWhen disputes around IP and software come up, this is typically at the crux of the debate: May one obtain a software patent? The answer is: One is not barred merely because the non\\-obvious aspect of an invention is software. For example, if one uses hardware that are prior art, in fact, patented to someone else, but by the use of software a system, method and/or computer program product achieves a different objective (since utility patents, axiomatically, must have a utility objective) one may obtain a patent, and a layman may very well consider their invention of the system as that particular component that appears to them as having required any inventive steps, encompasses the inventive novelty (understandably) which, in many cases may be software.\n\nSo the advice from a patent attorney that \u201cyou can\u2019t patent software\u201d is simply malicious (or wide and far disbarringly incompetent).\n\nOne may patent software so long as it is an invention, and the administrative (or at times judicial) process requirements are complied with.\n\nNevertheless, since the question inquired about \u201cIP\u201d, below is the answer to other avenues of intellectual property.\n\n**Copyrights**\n\nThe software code written to make this operable could be the subject of copyright as long as it is not substantially identical with another solution (or such to give reasons to believe it to be a derivative thereof) that also put buttons in the four corners.\n\nThe visual design may possibly also enjoy copyright protection, but that is less plausible to imagine since not only the copyrighted work of art is protected, but anything that may objectively be deemed a derivative work (regardless of whether the \u201cre\\-author\u201d actually knew about the copyrighted material that it may be deemed the derivate of).\n\n**Design patents**\n\nIt is possible that one could get design patents for the actual graphical design of the layout provided there isn\u2019t something substantially similar already out there protected by a design patent.\n\n**Utility patents**\n\nThis would most certainly not overcome obviousness, that is, the requirement for one to obtain a patent which needs that a presented invention not be obvious for anyone \u201cwith ordinary skill in the art\u201d (an ordinarily knowledgable person in the field of the specific area of tech).\n\n**Trademark**\n\nI have a hard time stretching my imagination to see how this could be applicable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company has developed a user interface design that places four global utility links (Settings, Menu, Home, Back) at the corners of the screen to assist visually impaired users.

The documentation suggests that multiple forms of IP protection could potentially apply to this design:\n\n1. Copyright protection could apply to the specific software code implementation.\n2.

California has civil stalking laws that could apply in this situation. The resident may be able to seek a restraining order to prohibit the neighbor from monitoring their front door, even if the camera was not installed with malicious intent. This approach acknowledges both the complexity of privacy laws and the existence of legal remedies for those who feel their privacy is being invaded.

I doubt the fact that the alterations are signage is really significant; unless they are stolen, or they cause someone to make a wrong turn into the corner of the building. :)\n\nIt's probably in the lease that a renter can't make significant changes to the property's appearance without permission from the property owner or management; i.e. many leases don't allow you to repaint rooms, put in new carpet, etc. without permission from the landlord.\n\nBut, it all depends on the lease. If you both have the same property management company, see what is in your lease about property alterations.\n\nEvery lease I have ever seen (and most of the free template lease forms on the web have) had a clause stating that making unauthorized changes to the property is not permitted, along with the possible penalties, like paying for the damages, losing a deposit, even eviction.\n\nThe fact that you're in CA really doesn't matter when it comes to the lease; damage clauses, though pretty much universal, are by choice of the landlord.

Most residential lease agreements contain clauses that prohibit tenants from making unauthorized significant changes or alterations to the property, including its exterior appearance. While the specific legality depends on the terms of the lease, it's highly probable that drilling signs into the stucco exterior without permission violates the standard terms of a rental agreement.

It states that:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.\n\nThis might be read as immediately applying by its own force to render laws inconsistent with the *Charter* to be void. And language to this effect has been even used by the Court, saying that a provision inconsistent with the Constitution is \"invalid from the moment it is enacted\" (e.g. *Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Martin; Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Laseur*, [2003 SCC 54](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2088/index.do)).

Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/19390/index.do) at para. 54\\). That a law is inconsistent with the Constitution is \"revealed through litigation, specifically the judgment that declares the inoperability of the impugned law\" (*Sullivan* at para. 55\\). Section 52 has no practical effect aside from Courts or other decision\\-makers declining to apply law that is inconsistent with the Constitution.

In *Albashir*, my colleague Karakatsanis J. explained that declarations of unconstitutionality are generally retrospective, consistent with the notion that a law is unconstitutional from its enactment.

Similarly, the legal effect of a s. 52(1\\) declaration by a superior court must be defined with reference to constitutional supremacy, the rule of law, and federalism.\n\nI'll say this one more way: while it's true that some laws were immediately inconsistent with the *Charter*, s. 52(1\\) did not have any observable effect until a court declared such laws to be invalid.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court of Canada's interpretation of section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, which of the following statements most accurately describes the effect of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms on pre-existing laws that were inconsistent with it?\n\nA) All laws inconsistent with the Charter became automatically void at the moment the Charter came into force, without any need for judicial intervention.\n\nB) Laws inconsistent with the Charter remained in full force and effect until explicitly repealed by Parliament or provincial legislatures.\n\nC) Laws inconsistent with the Charter became theoretically invalid from the moment of the Charter's enactment, but required judicial declaration to have practical effect.\n\nD) The Charter had no impact on pre-existing laws until the passage of enabling legislation to give it effect.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

I think its a very very interesting question because you click on a link and you do not know what your cache is going to buffer on your internal memory.\n\n1. > Does this pose a legal issue for visitors of such sites?\n\n\t* there is no law that regulates viewing pornography just one that regulates distribution and production in Germany and in the US:\n\n\t`$ 184 StGB`\n\n\t`18 U.S.C. 2257 Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act`\n\t* your are not indictable, because you do not know that a person in the video is not informed about the uploaded...\n\t* ...but it is important if the contant has copyrights and it would be an infringement if you watch it, because streaming is a crime in the US...:\n\n\t`CRS Report for Congress Prepared for Members and Committees of Congress Illegal Internet Streaming of Copyrighted Content: Legislation in the 112th\n\tCongress`\n\t* ...but not in germany:\n\n\t`\u00a7 44a UrhG`\n\n> Is it illegal to even accidentally view such videos?\n\n* No it is not except the content is copyrighted\n\n> Am I obliged to take specific action when recognizing such content (would ignoring be illegal) ?\n\n* No, because you do not know if the person does not want to be in the video\n\nSo the responsibility leads to the uploader and the video platform. In Germany a website owner / operator has to remove content which contains a crime\n\n`\u00a7 10 TMG`", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form exam question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Under U.S. and German law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal responsibilities of visitors to pornographic websites that allow user-uploaded content?\n\nA) Visitors are legally obligated to report any content they suspect involves non-consenting individuals.\n\nB) Accidentally viewing potentially problematic content (e.g. amateur videos) is illegal in both jurisdictions.\n\nC) Viewers are not legally liable for viewing content, but may be liable for copyright infringement if streaming copyrighted material in the U.S.\n\nD) Viewers have a legal duty to verify the consent status of individuals in all videos they watch on such sites.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, viewers are generally not legally liable for simply viewing content on these sites, even if it potentially involves non-consenting individuals. They are not obligated to report content or verify consent. However, streaming copyrighted material without permission could potentially be considered copyright infringement in the U.S., though not in Germany. Options A and D incorrectly state legal obligations that don't exist for viewers. Option B is incorrect as accidental viewing is not illegal in either jurisdiction based on the information given."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/63587/how-long-can-an-employer-keep-financial-details-after-employee-has-left-under-gd", "docs_id": 63587, "title": "How long can an employer keep financial details after employee has left under GDPR?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I finished a job in 2019, but just received notification of a data breach at that job in 2021, and my bank account number, sort code, national insurance number, full name, address and date of birth were compromised.\n\nAs far as I know under GDPR data controllers can only hold data for as long as they have grounds to process it \\- does anyone know what this means in practice for HR and financial records?

For example, accounting records might reasonably involve at least your bank account number, sort code, full name, and address. Under Section 388 of the Companies Act 2006, accounting records must be kept for three to six years, depending on the type of company (private or public). This would indicate that the company was within its right (and duty!) to hold records relating to at least the 2018 fiscal year.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under the Companies Act 2006 in England and Wales, how long must a private company retain accounting records that include employee bank details and personal information?\n\nA) 1 year\nB) 2 years\nC) 3 years\nD) 6 years\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Section 388 of the Companies Act 2006, private companies are required to keep accounting records for a minimum of 3 years. This retention period applies to records that may include employee bank account numbers, sort codes, full names, and addresses, as these are often necessary for accounting purposes. Public companies have a longer retention requirement of 6 years, but the question specifically asks about private companies. The 3-year retention period explains why a company might still have an ex-employee's financial information over a year after their employment ended, as they are legally obligated to maintain these records for the specified time frame."}}
