The documentation states that isolated references to trademarked terms are generally considered fair use, especially when they're not exploiting the trademark in a way that damages the holder or creates confusion about ownership.

The correct approach (D) acknowledges that the developer should first review any licensing terms associated with the paper.

If this happens and you default or fail to cooperate in the judicial process, you will probably have a judgment entered against you.\n\nIf you lost, the other party would get a judgment against you (an official declaration of a court that you owe another party money that authorizes various involuntary means of debt collection from your income and assets). This could be enforced against assets you have in the jurisdiction where the judgment was entered, or could be \"domesticated\" to a different jurisdiction where you had assets by bringing suit or exercising another process set forth by treaty or a law of the jurisdiction in which the foreign judgment holder seeks to domesticate the judgment.\n\nWhether the foreign judgment is conclusive against you or not, depends upon the domestic law of the place where they seek to enforce the foreign judgment, the nature of the underlying claims upon which the foreign judgment is based, and the legal process used to obtain the foreign judgment.\n\nMany countries will pretty much automatically enforce a judgment enforcing a breach of a contract between private sector parties obtained through the ordinary legal process in a country whose legal system is recognized by the U.S., but often will not give legal effect to legal procedures like a pre\\-dispute \"confessions of judgment\", an award of exemplary damages, an award of non\\-economic damages, or an award based upon a legal theory that is not recognized by the jurisdiction in which you seek to enforce the judgment. \n\nIn general, judgments of U.S. courts in tort cases are rarely recognized by other countries.\n\nSimilarly, a U.S. court, for example, would not enforce a foreign judgment, from say, ISIL controlled territory, for breach of a contract to deliver slaves to a buyer. Some Saudi Arabian money judgments are not enforced in the U.S. because the courts have held that their system does not protect basic principles of due process and the rule of law, which is why contracts with Saudi Arabia often have arbitration clauses instead of relying upon the royal courts in existence there.\n\nSome countries might enforce a judgment entered following a trial on the merits regarding a dispute, but not a default judgment, without essentially bringing the lawsuit all over again in the country where the assets are located, applying the general principles of legal concepts known as \"collateral estoppel\" and \"res judicata\".\n\nMost countries have special laws specifically governing when an arbitration award will be enforced with a money judgment in that jurisdiction and when it will not be enforced. This varies considerably from one country to another. The U.S. is unusually deferential to employment and consumer arbitration, but most countries will recognize express signed contractual arbitration agreements in a business to business situation that conforms to basic standards of due process."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company in the United States sues a former employee for breach of employment contract after the employee has permanently relocated to Germany. The U.S. court issues a default judgment against the employee, who did not appear in court. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforcement of this judgment in Germany?\n\nA) The judgment will be automatically enforced in Germany without any further legal proceedings.\n\nB) The judgment cannot be enforced in Germany under any circumstances because it's from a foreign jurisdiction.\n\nC) The judgment may be enforceable in Germany, but the process will depend on German law and may require a new trial or review of the case.\n\nD) The judgment will only be enforceable if the employee has assets remaining in the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. When a judgment is obtained in one country (in this case, the United States) and enforcement is sought in another country (Germany), the process is known as \"domestication\" of a foreign judgment. The enforcement of such a judgment depends on the domestic law of the country where enforcement is sought (Germany in this case).\n\nMany countries, including Germany, do not automatically enforce foreign judgments, especially default judgments. They often require a review of the case to ensure it meets their standards of due process and doesn't violate their public policy. This may involve a new trial or a review of the original case.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because automatic enforcement of foreign judgments is rare, especially for default judgments.\n\nAnswer B is too absolute. While enforcement isn't automatic, it's not impossible either. Many countries have processes for recognizing and enforcing foreign judgments under certain conditions.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the enforcement of the judgment in Germany would not depend on whether the employee has assets in the United States. The purpose of seeking enforcement in Germany would typically be to access assets the employee has in Germany.\n\nThis question tests understanding of international judgment enforcement, the concept of domestication of foreign judgments, and the complexities involved in cross-border legal disputes."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26678/jurisdictional-order", "docs_id": 26678, "title": "Jurisdictional Order", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can a Canadian lawyer reply to this question please?

For example, the Australian states and Canadian provinces will look to each other far more often than they will look abroad and both will tend to look to England/Wales before looking at each other or say India. \n\nBecause the United States legal tradition separated more than a century earlier than the rest of the common law jurisdictions and remained more conservative than England/Wales (e.g. the retention of grand juries and jury trials for civil cases) the law there has more limited application outside the US and vice versa: they are just too different.\n\nPersuasive precedent is generally only applicable for the interpretation of new laws \\- long standing laws usually have plenty of binding precedents. It is particularly common to look outside a jurisdiction for precedent when a piece of legislation is based on an existing one in another country courts will look to that jurisdiction for case law.\n\nFor example, the New South Wales *Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999* is based on a similar law in Alberta, Canada and the first cases under this act looked to Albertan case law for precedent.

Thus, in *Miranda*, we said that a suspect who is subjected to the \u201cinherently compelling pressures\u201d of an **unwarned custodial interrogation** need not invoke the privilege. 384 U.

In a custodial setting, speaking and thereby failing to claim a Fifth Amendment right to silence cannot be understood as waiving that right unless warned as per *Miranda*.\n\nThat holding was not touched in *Salinas*.\n\nThe unwarned custodial interrogation is one of three narrow exceptions to the general rule that the Fifth Amendment is not self\\-invoking. The circumstances in *Salinas* did not fall within one of those exceptions (all parties agreed that it was a voluntary discussion from which Salinas was free to leave)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between the Salinas v.

If the person who committed what would otherwise be murder \"did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation,\" then the conviction is reduced to manslaughter.\n\n### Current codified defence: victim must have done something that would be an indictable offence punishable by five or more years of imprisonment\n\nOne of the statutory requirements for a successful provocation defence is that the victim must have conducted themselves in a way that \"would constitute an indictable offence under this Act that is punishable by five or more years of imprisonment.\" **This is an objective element of the defence, not dependent on the perception of the accused**.\n\nOne court has found this limitation to the defence to be unconstitutional ([*R. v Simard*, 2019 BCSC 531](https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2019/2019bcsc531/2019bcsc531.html)). However that court would still require that the \"*conduct of the victim* \\[to be] of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self\\-control...\"\n\n### The common law and the previous codified defence also required provocative conduct by the victim\n\nBoth the common law and the pre\\-2015 codification of the provcation defence required that *the victim's provocative conduct* be \"of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self\\-control\" (*R. v. Cairney*, 2013 SCC 55 at [paragraphs 24\\-35](https://canlii.ca/t/g1nzp#par24)).\n\n### Burdens for establishing this defence\n\nThe provocation defence is an \"air of reality\" defence ([*R. v. Cinous*, 2002 SCC 29, paragraph 57](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc29/2002scc29.html)). This means that there is an initial evidential burden on the accused. There must be evidence on the record that, if believed, *could* lead a reasonable properly instructed jury to acquit (or, in the case of provocation, to convict of manslaughter instead of murder). Once the accused meets this burden, then the defence is properly in play and will be successful unless the Crown disproves any element of the defence beyond a reasonable doubt."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Canadian criminal case where a father kills someone he believes raped his daughter, which of the following statements is true regarding the provocation defense?\n\nA) The defense can be successful if the father genuinely believed the victim was the rapist, even if this belief was mistaken.\n\nB) The defense requires that the victim must have actually committed an indictable offense punishable by five or more years of imprisonment.\n\nC) The defense can only reduce a murder charge to manslaughter, not result in a complete acquittal.\n\nD) The burden of proof for the provocation defense lies entirely with the prosecution.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the current codified defense of provocation in Canada, one of the statutory requirements is that the victim must have conducted themselves in a way that \"would constitute an indictable offence under this Act that is punishable by five or more years of imprisonment.\" This is an objective element of the defense, not dependent on the perception of the accused.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the defense depends on the actual conduct of the victim, not just the belief of the accused.\n\nOption C, while true, is not the most complete answer to the question. The provocation defense can only reduce murder to manslaughter, but this isn't the key point being tested.\n\nOption D is incorrect because there is an initial evidential burden on the accused to establish an \"air of reality\" to the defense before the burden shifts to the Crown to disprove it beyond a reasonable doubt."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36215/what-is-the-label-associated-with-airbnb", "docs_id": 36215, "title": "What is the label associated with AirBNB?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: How does one write no AirBNB into a rental contract that AirBNB or the like is forbidden?

Section 240\\.10b5\\-2 enumerates the following duties:\n\n> (1\\) Whenever a person agrees to maintain information in confidence;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Whenever the person communicating the material nonpublic\n>  information and the person to whom it is communicated have a history,\n>  pattern, or practice of sharing confidences, such that the recipient\n>  of the information knows or reasonably should know that the person\n>  communicating the material nonpublic information expects that the\n>  recipient will maintain its confidentiality; or\n> \n> \n> (3\\) Whenever a person receives or obtains material nonpublic\n>  information from his or her spouse, parent, child, or sibling;\n>  provided, however, that the person receiving or obtaining the\n>  information may demonstrate that no duty of trust or confidence\n>  existed with respect to the information, by establishing that he or\n>  she neither knew nor reasonably should have known that the person who\n>  was the source of the information expected that the person would keep\n>  the information confidential, because of the parties' history,\n>  pattern, or practice of sharing and maintaining confidences, and\n>  because there was no agreement or understanding to maintain the\n>  confidentiality of the information.\n\nIn the hypothetical, (1\\) is plainly not applicable.

You have to get their permission, at least for *their* creations. In the case of F\u00fcr Elise, you can freely use the original score to \"rework\" that piece, but you can't \"rework\" a version that is itself a recent \"reworking\" (known as a derivative work). Anything that Jon Williams created is protected by copyright, so you need to negotiate a license to create a derivative work, and he/they get to dictate the terms (like, half of the 69 cents per copy). That might include some attribution statement such as \"with permission, copyright Warner Brothers\", or whatever is stipulated in the license agreement."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A musician wants to create and sell a variation of the Harry Potter theme song composed by John Williams.

The Harry Potter theme song, composed by John Williams, is protected by copyright law. To create and sell a variation of this work, the musician must obtain permission from the copyright holders (likely John Williams and the Harry Potter company/Warner Brothers). This permission typically comes in the form of a license agreement, which would outline the terms for creating a derivative work, including potential royalties and any required attribution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply giving credit is not sufficient; permission is required.\nOption C is incorrect because the price point does not affect copyright obligations.\nOption D is incorrect because film scores are not automatically in the public domain; they are protected by copyright like other musical compositions.\n\nThis question tests understanding of copyright law, derivative works, and the process of obtaining proper permissions for using copyrighted material in new creations."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29268/what-does-recital-13-in-gdpr-make-exempt", "docs_id": 29268, "title": "What does Recital 13 in GDPR make exempt?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I read through [Recital 13](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-13/) in GDPR and it states\n\n> To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and\n>  medium\\-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for\n>  organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to\n>  record\\-keeping.\n\nHowever, I couldn't find an official definition of \"record\\-keeping\" pertaining to GDPR.

Lawyer 1 says, \"I didn't know that the client wanted X in the deal because i never received a phone call or email to that effect. (This is conspicuously *absent* from both lawyer and client emails.) Lawyer 2 says, \"I knew that X was a priority for the client (and was legal, even \"standard\" practice), but I failed to include/downplayed it because I had other priorities.\"\n\nAre there any differences in a lawyer's potential negligence liability between these two sets of cases? How far can what i call the \"idiot\" defense protect a lawyer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In most jurisdictions of which I am aware, there is no such distinction. \n\nFor example, Colorado's jury instructions makes no such distinction, and the distinction you suggest is not one identified in most law school textbooks or the Restatements of Torts.\n\nIn most legal malpractice cases, an expert lawyer called a \"standard of care\" expert offers an opinion that particular elements of the lawyer's conduct did not live up to the level of a reasonable lawyer in the state. \n\nThere are a handful of very narrow cases where this is not required (e.g. missing a statute of limitations due to failure to properly calendar the deadline, or not showing up to court on the appointed day resulting a default judgment). But, this arises from the clarity of the violation and not from its active v. passive nature.\n\nIgnorance of the law is rarely an excuse, and even more rarely so for lawyers, although the law does not require lawyers to be prescient either.\n\nFor example, I recent had a case where I won on an issue of substantive probate law governed by California law at trial, because the other side argued a contrary position but had no legal authority to back up that argument. But, a few weeks before the appellate court issued its opinion, after all briefing in the appeal was complete and oral arguments had been waived by both parties, the California Supreme Court made a ruling that was contrary to my position in a case that was factually almost identical to my case and reversed prior case law in California on the subject. One of the judges in my case (or more likely, on the judge's clerk) found the new case. So, I lost on the appeal.\n\nBut, nobody would accuse me of legal malpractice for not knowing at trial that many months after the case was argued, and weeks after the case had been fully briefed on appeal, that the California Supreme Court would change the law of the state of California in a manner that was contrary to the position I had taken all along and prevailed with, until that point."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A lawyer is accused of legal malpractice for failing to include a specific clause in a contract that the client claims was important.

According to the documentation, most jurisdictions do not distinguish between \"active\" and \"passive\" negligence in legal malpractice cases. Instead, the key factor is whether the lawyer's conduct met the standard of care expected of a reasonable lawyer in that jurisdiction. This is typically determined by expert testimony from a \"standard of care\" expert. The lawyer's claim of ignorance (the \"idiot defense\") is not likely to be a strong protection, as lawyers are generally expected to know and follow professional standards. While clear evidence of the client's request would be relevant, it's not the only factor in determining liability. The expert's assessment of whether the lawyer's overall conduct met the professional standard is crucial in most legal malpractice cases."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43028/am-i-legally-required-to-pay-for-order-i-had-done-and-have-not-picked-up", "docs_id": 43028, "title": "Am I legally Required to Pay For Order I had done and Have not Picked Up?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I talked directly to an employee at a local manufacturing company, over email, about a custom small project.

There was no payment or receipt and the work was not completed within 2 weeks. It also mentions, payment in cash on delivery.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are not obligated to pick the thing up, but you are obligated to pay. Analogously, if you go into a restaurant and order a steak, you are obligated to pay for it, but you are not obligated to eat it. You can cancel the steak order within some reasonable short period of time (maybe a minute) \u2013 it depends on whether they have relied on your acceptance of their offer, and have done anything that puts them in a worse situation (such as \"started cooking it\"). You could have informed them that you decided that you didn't want the thing and they might have been able to cancel the order with no or minimum cost to you (depends on whether your job was simply \"in the queue\", or had they done something like ordered parts or detrimentally committed an employee to some schedule so that other customers could not be serviced). Once you accept their offer, you have an enforceable contract.\n\nThe additional information about lateness of delivery doesn't clearly change the situation. If there were an explicit \"time is of the essence\" clause in your contract, related to any delay causing harm, then failure to meet a deadline could constitute a breach of contract. For example, if you have a contract where you will be transported to a location by a specific deadline so that you can get on the boat, failure to meet that deadline causes material harm (if you miss the boat, you suffer a loss). You apparently do not have any such clause, and there's no indication that you suffered a loss because of the delay in delivery.

When John accepted the quote via email, it formed a binding contract, even without a formal signed document. In contract law, acceptance of an offer creates a legal obligation.

But if the judge says the case, on the basis of the written material, is \"totally without merit\", then there is no renewal hearing, and we are done. The claimant could file a fresh case, if the judge's reasons for denial gave them enough clues about what might be arguable instead, or can appeal the finding. Evidently, then, some points can be not arguable, but also not totally without merit.\n\nIn *Wasif*, the court differentiated between (paras 15ff):\n\n1. Cases where the judge \"can see no rational basis on which the claim could succeed\" are certainly bound to fail, and a hearing would be pointless; they are totally without merit.\n2. Cases which contain a rational argument, but the judge \"is confident that, even taking the case at its highest, it is wrong\". Notwithstanding the judge's confidence, it is possible that his mind could be changed if an oral hearing took place, so these should not be deemed to be totally without merit. They are described as \"not arguable\" at this stage, but the claimant gets to argue that they are arguable.\n\nThe decision is one involving, well, *judgement*, and is not totally precise, but the experienced judges in *Wasif* felt that it was a realistic distinction in practice.\n\nThe court points out (17(3\\) and (5\\)) that a hearing gives the claimant the chance to address specific issues the judge has noted, especially when they are self\\-represented and their documents are not well\\-prepared. In those instances, the judge might be able to spot an actual arguable claim lurking in the material, and \"the correct course\" could be to refuse permission but allow an oral hearing so that the real issue can be drawn out.\n\nWhat we can see from this is that a point might be \"not arguable\" (the judge thinks it is plainly wrong), but still have some level of merit at that stage (the judge is willing to let the claimant address his objections). When the judge comes to deliver his opinion at the very end, he might still say that a particular point is without merit (he has heard all about it and thinks it is completely wrong) even if he'd conceded earlier that the claimant deserved a chance to present it.\n\nNot all arguments that fail are described as \"without merit\". If Bob prevails in *Bob v Rob* it does not follow that all of Rob's points were hopeless. Judges can deploy colourful opprobrium but are just as likely to recognize that some arguments are strong, even when the opposing argument was stronger. Equally, a judge might decide that neither Bob nor Rob is completely correct, and the real answer is some other position \\- even when they both presented reasonable arguments that were worth hearing."}, "answer": "Question: Based on the explanation provided about legal arguments and judgments in England and Wales, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the concept of \"totally without merit\" in legal proceedings?\n\nA) Any argument that ultimately fails in court can be labeled as \"totally without merit\"\n\nB) A case deemed \"not arguable\" by a judge is automatically considered \"totally without merit\"\n\nC) \"Totally without merit\" applies only to cases where the judge can see no rational basis for the claim to succeed\n\nD) All cases that are rejected at an early stage without proceeding to a full hearing are considered \"totally without merit\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

That being said, there is a difference between intent and a mere wish.\n\nIntent is inferred from statements or circumstances indicating that a person's actions were (or are) devised toward knowingly committing the underlying crime. The [Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines *intent* as \"*\\[D]esign, resolve, or determination with which \\[a] person acts. \\[...] \\[M]ental action at its most advanced point \\[...]. It is the exercise of intelligent will, the mind being fully aware of the nature and consequences of the act which is about to be done*\" (brackets added).\n\nBy contrast, a wish that goes no further than fantasizing or expressing \"*I want to do this*\" usually is inconsequential from a legal standpoint. One exception to that relates to promoting offenses such as terrorism, murder, and arguably pedophilia. Even if it is proved that the person making those expressions has no propensity or intent to indulge in the criminal conduct he depicts, the expressions themselves might encourage others to do so. That encouragement makes it more difficult for a government to prevent those crimes from being committed and to identify the perpetrator(s)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following scenarios is most likely to be considered criminal intent rather than a mere wish under the law?\n\nA) A person posts on social media \"I wish I could rob a bank and get away with it.\"\n\nB) An individual researches methods for breaking into safes and purchases lock-picking tools.\n\nC) Someone tells their friend \"I want to punch my annoying coworker in the face.\"\n\nD) A person writes in their private diary about their fantasy of committing insurance fraud.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B demonstrates the clearest intent to commit a crime.

This does also cover non\\-profit and political activity.\n\nThe exception for \u201cpurely personal or household activities\u201d has to be interpreted somewhat narrowly. It does not apply to *all* personal activities, but to *purely* personal activities. The intention is clearly to exempt normal family and social life from GDPR compliance obligations. The GDPR explicitly mentions address books, social networking, and related online activities as examples of exempt activities.\n\nThe scenario you describe can be argued either way. It may or may not fall under the GDPR exception. However, I believe that this would have little consequence.\n\nPersonally, I think the exception will not apply if your web postings will be accessible to a wider circle than friends and family. Political activity such as participating in the shaping of public opinion is inherently public and outside of purely personal and household activities. So is making a website publicly accessible. Case law from the [Lindqvist case](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?num=C-101/01) confirms this:\n\n> 47\\. That exception must therefore be interpreted as relating only to activities which are carried out in the course of private or family life of individuals, which is clearly not the case with the processing of personal data consisting in publication on the internet so that those data are made accessible to an indefinite number of people.\n\nIn C\\-101/01, the ECJ had to decide whether a personal website that was created in the context of a church fell under data protection laws. This case related to the GDPR's predecessor, the Data Protection Directive. As an EU directive and not an EU regulation the legal situation was a bit different, but the old directive included the same exception as the GDPR. [This answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/29056/20476) contains a bit more background.\n\nYou have mentioned various steps that could be taken to limit collection or processing of personal data through such a website. However, this data minimization does not determine whether the website is limited to purely personal or household activities: If GDPR does not apply to the processing activity, then any processing of personal data would be fine. If GDPR does apply, then any collection must be lawful and comply with the various provisions.\n\nWhat would it mean if you had to comply? You are proposing two somewhat distinct activities that have to be analyzed separately:\n\n* offering a website\n* listing personal data of a politician, such as name and their professional contact details\n\nThe case of offering a website has been discussed elsewhere in abundance. It is important to recognize that even a static website is unlikely to work without processing of personal data, since IP addresses are typically personal data. There are many steps that can be taken to minimize and avoid the collection and processing of data, but those are decisions taken by the data controller, who should still offer a privacy notice in line with the GDPR transparency principle and Art 13\\.\n\nPublishing personal data about a politician is more interesting. Here, it is extremely important to note that the GDPR is not absolute. Instead, the GDPR rights and obligations MUST be balanced against other rights. Such other rights include in particular the right to freedom of expression which could be exhibited by political or journalistic activity. Any interpretation of GDPR that would make such activities impossible is likely incorrect. In fact, the GDPR explicitly asks member states to implement additional exemptions where necessary to safeguard freedom of expression (Art 85\\). The [UK has implemented such exemptions](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/exemptions/#ex16). Where you publish a politician's professional contact details in the course of normal political or journalistic activities \u2013 but not e.g. to harass them \u2013 your EU/EEA/UK state will likely have an exemption for that.\n\nEven if there wasn't an explicit exemption, your right to freedom of expression would almost certainly count as a legitimate interest that would be a legal basis for this processing under Art 6(1\\)(f)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A private citizen creates a public website listing politicians' views on a particular issue, including their names and official contact information.

I am creating a tool for players and DMs of D\\&D. The reason i've been trying to understand the copyright law in regards to this issue is that upon using any information from the books created by WotC you'd violate their copyright. Luckily, WotC has a \"Open Gaming License\" that you can use, to have much of the rules, items and monsters in your book, program, etc. for free (Link to the link of the SRD\\-OGL: [http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems\\-reference\\-document\\-srd](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd))\n\nMy issue is that WotC has intentionally left out some of the unique monsters that they themselves has created over the years.

Your program is a tool, just like a word processor is. If I copy a Harry Potter book into a word processor that does not make the word processor maker liable.\n\nThere is a concept of \"contributory infringement\", which I think is what you are concerned about. I don't know about Danish law in particular, but most countries would require evidence that you had reasonable knowledge that actual copyright violation was occuring, rather than just being aware that it might happen in theory. This is normally applied to file sharing services who have to have \"notice and takedown\" measures, file filters and the like. This isn't your concern as you never have any access to the files created by your users. \n\nYou can also be found liable if you induce anyone to commit copyright violations. Don't draw your customers attention to the custom monster feature as a workaround for those copyrighted monsters, as that could be considered to be inducement. Also don't provide any \"wizards\" or similar tools which make it noticeably easier to duplicate the custom monsters (e.g. if you notice that the copyrighted custom dragon stats are all on a linear scale with dragon size, don't create a \"dragon creation wizard\" embodying that fact.)\n\nThis assumes that your program runs entirely on the end user computer.

The researcher uses DNA from these samples to validate a diagnostic test, which unexpectedly shows potential for commercial development. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The researcher can freely commercialize the diagnostic test since the samples were used for initial validation, not direct product development.\n\nB) The researcher must obtain new permissions from all sample providers before proceeding with any commercial development.\n\nC) The legality of commercialization depends on the specific language in each MTA and the governing laws of the countries involved.\n\nD) UK law solely determines whether the researcher can commercialize the test, regardless of the sample origins.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the situation involves a complex interplay of international agreements and laws. As stated in the documentation, there is no single definition of \"commercial use\" that applies universally. The legality of commercializing the diagnostic test would depend on:\n\n1. The specific language used in each Material Transfer Agreement (MTA)\n2.

What if the officers are ordered not to comply? How could it realistically play out?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: @Dale M is basically correct, but fudges a bit on the process.\n\nThe court issuing the order would issue an order to show cause to a government official who is alleged by the person who sought the order to have violated the order after having received legal notice (i.e. service) of the order.\n\nIf that individual fails to appear at the appointed time and place in the order to show cause, a warrant issues for that individual's arrest. If that individual does appear, the allegedly contemptuous individual is read their rights and a hearing date is set. \n\nAt the hearing, if the person appears, the person seeking the contempt finding (or some other attorney appointed by the court) prosecutes the case and if the person is found in contempt, then contempt sanctions issue. If they do not appear, a warrant issues for their arrest and a hearing is held on the merits promptly following that arrest.\n\nAn individual can also be ordered to show cause in an official capacity in which case the contempt sanctions would be imposed against the organization rather than the individual.\n\nUsually, in federal court, the U.S. Marshal's office has primary responsibility for arresting people on contempt warrants. The [U.S. Marshal's office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service) primarily reports to the judicial branch, although strictly speaking, it is part of the Justice Department, and ultimately reports to the Attorney\\-General.\n\nThere are actually two kinds of contempt \\- remedial and punitive. Remedial contempt sanction can include indefinite incarceration or a fine (often a per day fine) until the violation of the order of the court ceases and is allowed only when it is possible to comply with the order going forward. Punitive contempt has a sanction comparable to a misdemeanor conviction and applies in cases where the goal is to punish someone for a past violation of a court order whether or not it is possible to comply going forward.\n\n(Both of these are examples of \"indirect contempt\", i.e. violations of court orders that take place outside the courtroom. A different summary process called \"direct contempt\" applies when someone misbehaves in the presence of the court \\- this is summary incarceration or fine without a trial on the spot for disrespecting the dignity of the court in the courtroom.)\n\nEstablished practice is to direct a contempt order at the lowest level official necessary to remedy the violation of the order. There are a few examples in living memory of cabinet members being held in contempt, however (e.g. the Secretary of Interior, with regard to Indian Trust fund litigation), and keep in mind that in the case of remedial contempt an official can purge the contempt and be released from any sanction by resigning from office, after which the official no longer has the ability to comply. \n\nI am not aware of any instance in which the President of the United States has personally been held in contempt of court, but I am also not aware of any authority that specifically prohibits a court from holding the President in contempt of court.\n\nWhile contempt is the only \"hard\" remedy for a violation of a court order, the bureaucratic structure of the federal government is also set up in a manner that once a court order definitively resolves a legal issue, the higher ups in a federal agency are supposed to take all reasonable actions to insure that their subordinates follow that order (and they are themselves subject to contempt sanctions if they fail to do so). And, keep in mind that most of the people in the chain of command are civil servants with legal protections from unlawful employment actions hired on a merit basis, not political appointees, and that lots of the people in the chain of command are also members of unions that provide individual employees with the ability to fight wrongful employment action from a superior for violating a court order. \n\nIn particular, the top lawyers in the executive branch would in ordinary times direct government employees to follow a clear court order and to cease and desist from explicitly disobeying one. Among other things, the courts could probably deny lawyers who refused to do so the right to practice law in federal court. But, usually things never reach this point. Then again, we are living in interesting times.\n\nThere are about 670 political appointee positions in the executive branch, many of which are currently vacant and less than a dozen of which would be relevant to any given dispute in any case. There are about a million, civilian, non\\-defense department, non\\-postal service employees in the United States government, of which perhaps 100,000 or so are in the Department of Homeland Security and fewer are in the CBP. As far as I know, the CBP political appointees from the Obama administration have resigned and a replacement has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate yet (there has been a Department of Homeland Security appointee confirmed if I recall correctly), and there are only a few people in the agency that political appointees can hire without either receiving Senate confirmation or using the merit based hiring process for civil servants (which takes a while, especially given an executive order imposing a hiring freeze). So, realistically, we have a case where the acting head of the CBP is probably a GS\\-15 or Senior Executive Service grade civil servant, rather than a political appointee, at the moment, who was hired as a civil servant many years ago, who is doing his (or her) best to follow the less than clear guidance he is receiving from his superiors and government lawyers (perhaps errantly).\n\nThere could also be remedies in the form of declaratory judgment. The Court could declare as a matter of law on a case by case basis that, for example, Fatima Jones is not deportable and is lawfully within the United States and is entitled to be released from custody. This specific finding as to an individual would be very hard for the administration to escape sanction for. \n\nAnd, the Court could also declare that the entire executive order, at least as applied, is invalid (e.g. for failure to comply with the administrative procedures act, or for failing to include an exception for contrary court orders) or is unconstitutional."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A federal court has issued a clear ruling that border officials must not turn back refugees, but Customs and Border Protection (CBP) explicitly refuses to comply.

This is typically directed at the lowest level official necessary to remedy the violation of the court order. The official would be required to appear in court to explain why they should not be held in contempt for violating the court's order. This process allows for due process and gives the official an opportunity to explain their actions or lack thereof. If the official fails to appear or cannot justify their non-compliance, further steps such as contempt proceedings or arrest warrants may follow. Options A, C, and D are more extreme measures that would likely only be considered after other remedies have been exhausted or in extraordinary circumstances."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78689/uk-is-it-legal-to-display-a-flag-in-front-of-a-store", "docs_id": 78689, "title": "UK: is it legal to display a flag in front of a store?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Country: United Kingdom\n\nIs it legal to:\n\n1. leave a free standing flag of a country (Russia) close to an entrance of a store?\n2. leave free standing flags:\n\n* of a country (Russia)\n* with logo/name of a store\n\nclose to an entrance of the said store?\n\n3. leave free standing flags:\n\n* of a country (Russia)\n* with logo/name of a store\n* of a president of a foreign country (Vladimir Putin)\n\nclose to an entrance of the said store?\n\nNote that this is someone else's store.

Instead, the key legal consideration is whether these items obstruct the free passage along the highway, which includes the pavement. This falls under section 137(1) of the Highways Act 1980, which states that willfully obstructing free passage along a highway without lawful authority or excuse is an offense.

Any court cases?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Every country has its own copyright laws. In the US, the first thing it depends on is the Department of Justice, which decides whether to prosecute. This is the [prosecution policy of the DoJ](https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-71000-copyright-law) (having said that, there are also state laws against copyright infringement, so it is possible that some state attorney general will pursue a case... you need to look into the matter on a state\\-by\\-state basis: usually, the matter has to be prosecuted at the federal level). The relevant US law is [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/506). One of three things must be true, for criminal prosecution. One is that the action was \"for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain\"; or, \n\"by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180\u2013day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000\"; or \"by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution\".\n\nThe stipulation that this is \"for personal use\" precludes re\\-distribution cases, but leaves open the possibility of jail time for \"massive\" personal infringement. It is highly likely that many infringers do in fact download more than $1,000 worth of content in a 180 day period. [This article](https://www.mediainstitute.org/2011/05/25/will-you-go-to-jail-for-copyright-infringement/) addresses the \"will you go to jail\" question. The author notes that it is \"highly unlikely\", and \"there were fewer than two hundred criminal intellectual property convictions in 2010\" which included trademark cases... also, not every conviction results in imprisonment (fines are also possible). [This report](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ascii/ipt02.txt) from the Bureau of Justice Statistics notes that\n\n> Of the 134 IP theft defendants sentenced in 2002, 58 (43%) received\n>  some imprisonment with a term ranging from 1 to 46 months and a median\n>  of 15 months. In 1998, 34% of defendants were sentenced to prison with\n>  a range of 1 to 30 months and median of 10 months.\n\nHowever, this does not narrowly report just \"personal use infringement\" imprisonments. One can speculate as to why the federal government is not more aggressive with prosecuting personal\\-use downloaders. The first reason (in the long list of reasons) is that personal\\-use downloaders are least likely to get caught. The last reason (on my list) is that under sentencing guidelines, a personal\\-use infringer is least likely to trigger imprisonment. [This manual](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/about/overview/Overview_Federal_Sentencing_Guidelines.pdf) explains sentencing guidelines and the 43 levels of seriousness, and [this](https://www.whitecollarcrimeresources.com/federal-sentencing-guidelines-for-criminal-copyright-cases.html) explains the factors that go into computing the seriousness of infringement. Imprisonment is not statutorily mandated, so it is very unlikely that a level 8 infringement conviction will result in imprisonment."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to U.S. law and prosecution policies, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding criminal copyright infringement for personal use?\n\nA) Downloading copyrighted material for personal use is always prosecuted as a criminal offense, regardless of the value of the content.\n\nB) Criminal prosecution for personal use copyright infringement is common, with most cases resulting in custodial sentences.\n\nC) Criminal prosecution for personal use copyright infringement is rare, but possible if the total retail value of downloaded content exceeds $1,000 in a 180-day period.\n\nD) Personal use copyright infringement is only ever treated as a civil matter, never as a criminal offense.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

So speaking with an attorney or bringing them into the picture is always a big step as the attorney also has to do their best to keep you in mind which without oversight and good judgement on your part could lead to uncomfortable interactions with the other party.\n\nSometimes its not only about protecting you, its also about finding a win\\-win while still maintaining your rights, educating you how the law applies to your case, what actions you as an informed individual can take and how to negotiate the different enumerable interactions with the other party.\n\nSo let's say someone is interested in hiring an attorney but hasn't understood exactly how to interact with attorneys yet.\n\n* How do you explain your case to the attorney? What facts do you bring up? What documents do you provide, etc.?\n* How do you set the tone with your attorney? How to get the attorney to understand so that you are represented satisfactorily?\n\n(Note that in case of criminal cases, clearly win\\-win is a strange concept so I'm not considering criminal case types in my question, but specifically dealing with other party's in which the end goal is to find a win\\-win while still being represented to your satisfaction.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So for your first two questions, you want to look for attorneys that specialize in your area of Law. For example, if you're facing a murder trial, best not to look at lawyers specializing in contract law. Yeah, they could represent you... but they'd be out of their depth as they don't do this normally. Similarly one wouldn't want to have a criminal defense attorney help them through a suit against the cops for a violation of civil rights.\n\nEven in specializations, Lawyers might further specialize. There are Criminal Defense Attorneys who specialize in traffic court cases and would be out of place in a murder trial. There are prosecutors who are good at prosecuting white collar crimes with huge money and paper trails. Others focus on drug crimes, or what have you.\n\nOften if attorneys aren't right for you, they will refer you to an attorney who would be better.\n\nAs for questions regarding what to tell them, really, you should absolutely honest with an attorney. Attorney\\-client privilege exists to for this reason, as the attorney can only best advise you in your legal disputes. If you did the thing you're accused of, let the attorney know in detail. It could be a case of the cops are right for the wrong reasons and if they don't have the right reasons, that evidence could be attacked (suppose you're accused of murdering someone by stabbing them. Which is not entirely true. You did try to murder them... but you poisoned them. If the cops aren't bringing up poison, negotiating that difference would get you off since it introduces doubt to stab being COD.).\n\nAnd yes, Win\\-Win is completely viable in U.S. criminal law, depending on your definition of win. If you could be charged with a capital offense, coming to a plea agreement of life without parole is a win\\-win because you don't get executed, while the state gets to say the punished a bad guy (not to mention, saves money on the expensive process that is going to trial). In a similar vein, they may have you dead to rights on \"Drug possession\" but are wobbly on \"Possession with intent to sell.\" They might offer the lesser offense (Drug possession) in exchange for not having to prove what you intended to do with the amount you had, which might cause them to lose as it's harder to prove."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An individual is seeking legal representation for a complex civil rights case against local law enforcement.

The domestic law is what's important.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian constitution, president can be removed from the office during impeachment proceedings by the vote of 3/4 of the parliament (at least 338 deputies out of 450\\). On February 22, when 328 deputies voted to remove Yanukovich from the office (with 116 absent and 6 abstaining), the normal impeachment procedures weren't followed. That is, Yanukovich was not formally charged with a crime and the charge was not reviewed by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine. Instead, the legal basis for the vote to dismiss Yanukovich and to appoint early election was claimed to be the fact that Yanukovich \"withdrew from his duties in an unconstitutional manner\" \\- in other words, his whereabouts were unknown, and it was later reported that he fled the country bypassing normal clearance procedures.\n\nI don't have the precise timeline, but on the same February 22 as the vote to dismiss Yanukovich (presumably, before the vote happened), the Euromaidan activists arrived at the president's Mezhyhirya Residence and found Yanukovich gone, with plenty documentation and other evidence of multiple crimes left behind.

The documentation indicates that while the normal impeachment procedures were not followed (338 votes were required, but only 328 were received), the removal was justified by extraordinary circumstances.

For instance, a cinema may have a newsletter announcing which movies will run on which date, with short descriptions of them. It's just not reasonable to expect that they put out a \"marketing\\-free\" newsletter stating the dates on which the cinema is open, omitting the actual movies! That's just silly. Permission for the newsletter includes permission for the embedded marketing of the movies. Still, that newsletter is independent from the actual cinema service itself. \n\nIn your case, it appears that there is no relation between the marketing and the actual service. That is to be expected. As such, the GDPR is aimed straight at you. And you guessed that from the last \"how you've chosen to operate your business\" quote. Non\\-profits fall under the GDPR as well.\n\nPS. you mentioned the \"legitimate interest\". That's not at all relevant.

Approved jury instructions for the particular circuit, which translate statutory language into clear guidelines for jurors.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the prosecution cannot freely interpret the law to impose strict liability if that's not supported by the statute and case law. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because the interpretation is not determined solely by arguments in court, but by established legal principles and precedents.\n\nAnswer D is overly broad and doesn't account for potential variations in different statutes or circuit-specific interpretations."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37462/can-an-employer-place-someone-on-medical-leave-even-though-a-doctor-says-they-ar", "docs_id": 37462, "title": "Can an employer place someone on medical leave even though a doctor says they are ok to work?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Hypothetically, if someone has a chronic mental illness and their employer is already aware of it (and made accommodations for it) for the time they have been employed, does the employer have the right/ability to place the employee on medical leave of absence and demand that they receive counseling/therapy before allowing them to return to work, even if the employee provides a clean bill of health from a psychiatrist? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Normally, an employer can decide whether someone is allowed to go on leave or not.\n\nIf someone has a covered disability, that must be accommodated, except to the extent that the disability makes the person unable to perform a bona fide job qualification that cannot be accommodated by any practical means.\n\nEmployers have some latitude and discretion in evaluating this question and a doctor's opinion, while it is relevant evidence that an employer should consider, isn't binding on the employer. This is because physicians can differ in their opinions on a particular case, and because physicians don't necessarily know exactly what is and isn't necessary to perform a job satisfactorily. Business owners are entitled to decide what duties go with a job, and within reason, what kind of performance of those duties meets their standards.\n\nAs the case summary linked to in the comments explains: \"Counseling is a medical appointment and the determination as to whether it can be required for employment is dependent on whether it is \u201cjob related\u201d and consistent with a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d as described in the ADA.\"\n\nUnder the circumstances described in the question, it is likely that this requirement would be found to have been met.\n\nAlso, an employer could place an employee on medical leave without requiring counseling or therapy as a requirement to return, so long as some other performance standard was established for the employee.\n\nOn the other hand, the employer's discretion is not unlimited. If a judge or jury finds that an employee was clearly capable of performing the job in a satisfactory manner (e.g. by noting that the disabled employee outperforms many non\\-disabled employees in the same position who are not put on leave), then that finder of fact could conclude that the employer had engaged in illegal discrimination based upon disability, rather than legally exercising an employer's discretion.\n\nThere are, inevitably, gray areas, and no one doctor's opinion is enough to resolve that question definitively."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee with a known chronic mental illness, for which accommodations have already been made, is placed on medical leave by their employer.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The employer's actions are always illegal under the ADA, as they disregard the psychiatrist's assessment.\nB) The employer has unlimited discretion to make such decisions, regardless of the employee's actual job performance.\nC) The employer's actions may be legal if the counseling requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity.\nD) The employee can immediately return to work based solely on the psychiatrist's clean bill of health.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The employer's actions may be legal if the counseling requirement is job-related and consistent with business necessity. This aligns with the ADA's guidelines on such matters. While the employer should consider the psychiatrist's opinion, it is not binding. The employer has some discretion in evaluating the employee's ability to perform job duties, but this discretion is not unlimited. The requirement for counseling could be justified if it is deemed necessary for the employee to safely and effectively perform their job duties. However, if it can be shown that the employee is clearly capable of performing the job satisfactorily (e.g., outperforming non-disabled colleagues), then the employer's actions could be considered discriminatory. The other options are incorrect because they represent extreme positions that do not accurately reflect the nuanced nature of such situations under employment law and the ADA."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42194/if-a-person-is-court-ordered-to-pay-child-support-in-the-state-of-ohio-does-that", "docs_id": 42194, "title": "If a person is court ordered to pay child support in the state of Ohio does that person have the right to claim said children on taxes", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Who has the right to claim children.

In this case, option C meets these criteria: Mr. Johnson provided 51% of the children's financial support (which is more than 50%), and there is no agreement specifying who can claim the children.

Is that legal or illegal in Texas\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, [Texas law](https://texas.public.law/statutes/tex._labor_code_section_62.003) requires the employer to give a written earnings statement to any employee which reports the rate of pay, the total amount of pay, deductions, and hours worked if the job is paid at an hourly rate. The law also says that an earnings statement may be in any form determined by the employer. Second, there is no law requiring there to be a single earnings statement or a combined statement, in case a person is paid at different rates, the requirement is simply that the information must be provided. It is legal to hire a person to work at different rates, as long as they have some mechanism for tracking what a person is doing. It is *required* that they pay you a different rate for working more than a certain number of hours, which will therefore be reflected in the earnings statement."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Texas, an employee with a CDL Class A license works for a company that pays different wages depending on the type of vehicle driven.

The key requirements are that the statement must include the rate of pay, total amount of pay, deductions, and hours worked (if paid hourly) for each type of work performed. The law specifically states that \"an earnings statement may be in any form determined by the employer.\" This means that as long as all the required information for each pay rate is provided, the employer can choose to present it in a single combined statement, separate statements, or any other format they prefer.
