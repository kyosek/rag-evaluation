According to LawStackExchange, what legal considerations apply?\n\nA) The owner must obtain written consent from all employees and customers before installing cameras.\nB) Cameras are only allowed in public areas of the shop, not in employee-only areas.\nC) The owner must post clearly visible signs informing customers of video surveillance.\nD) There are no specific laws or regulations governing the installation of surveillance cameras in this scenario.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided from LawStackExchange, there are no specific laws, regulations, or ordinances that apply to a coffee shop owner in California installing surveillance cameras inside the shop and around exterior doors. While it's generally good practice to inform employees and customers about surveillance, and to be mindful of privacy in certain areas, there are no legal requirements mentioned for this particular scenario. It's important to note that while this may be the case for basic surveillance, other factors like audio recording or specific uses of the footage might have additional legal considerations not covered in this simple scenario."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I realised I don't understand something fundamental about how the legal process works (surely many things, but here is one): \n\nSay it is a damages case, and a company is sued for a large amount of money. \n\nIf the defence lawyers become aware of some damaging information, what mechanism prevents them from sharing it with the plaintiff's team, in exchange for a percentage of the settlement in case the plaintiff wins? \n\nI guess if it were found out, the parties would be disbarred? That seems a rather week preventative measure, since the two legal teams merely have to keep their communication secret. \n\nIs there anything else that prevents this from happening?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would approach the question from a different direction.\n\nAs an empirical matter, there are very few places in the United States were it is even remotely conceivable that this would happen, despite the fact that opposing counsel in legal matters have to cooperate with each other all time and are very good at cooperation and at keeping secrets.\n\nPsychologist Stanley Milgram noted in [psychology experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment) that even slight steps to make someone identify with a particular role powerfully influences their behavior. People are extremely responsively to even slight whiffs of authority and respond to that role. The [Stanford Prison Experiment](http://People%20are%20extremely%20responsively%20to%20even%20slight%20whiffs%20of%20authority%20and%20respond%20to%20that%20role.) reached a similar conclusion. People told they are prison guards act like brutes. People told they are prisoners act like victims. This is true even when everyone knows it is just an act and people get very caught up in their roles. This instinct is at work in lawyers too, who, of course, aren't acting.\n\nOne can ask why, but the question has to be rooted in the knowledge that not colluding really is what happens not just 99% of the time, but 99\\.999999999% of the time.\n\nLawyers as a matter of psychology want to help their clients and identify very strongly with their clients. Yes, they could be punished for colluding with opposing counsel and would probably be disbarred at a minimum and might even go to prison for doing so, but that happens perhaps 100 times less frequently than, for example, simply stealing money held in trust for a client that actually belongs to a client.\n\nLawyers are much more likely to collude with their clients to illegally take advantage of an opposing party than they are to collude with opposing counsel to the disadvantage of their client for their own benefit.\n\nNow, often lawyers do have to do things that their clients don't like. For example, in a civil case, if a lawyer knows that his client has a damaging document, the lawyer will often have to get the client to hand it over to the other side as part of the disclosure and discovery process in order to play by the rules. \n\nAnd, often, lawyers will push their clients to accept a settlement because the lawyers believe that it is in their client's best interest, but that their client is an idiot who is too emotional to realize this fact (and this is not gender specific \\- lawyers have lots of male clients who act like idiots for emotional reasons and have to be talked at length into sanity).\n\nThis probably isn't globally universal. I'm sure that there are one or two remote corners of this kind of lawyer corruption in the United States (probably in the rural Deep South, or Appalachia), and I'm sure that there are some countries where this happens somewhere in the world. But, even in some relatively corrupt part of Europe (for example, Italy or Greece), this is pretty much unthinkable these days.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why lawyers rarely collude with opposing counsel to the detriment of their own clients, even when there might be personal financial gain?\n\nA) The threat of disbarment and potential prison time is severe enough to deter most lawyers from engaging in such behavior.\n\nB) Lawyers are naturally inclined to be honest and ethical in all their professional dealings.\n\nC) The strong psychological tendency for lawyers to identify with their client's interests and their professional role outweighs potential personal gain.\n\nD) There are robust technological systems in place to monitor and prevent communication between opposing counsels.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage emphasizes the psychological aspect of role identification, referencing studies like the Milgram experiment and Stanford Prison Experiment. It states that lawyers strongly identify with their clients and their professional roles, which makes them much less likely to betray their clients for personal gain. While option A mentions a deterrent, the passage suggests this is a less significant factor compared to the psychological aspects. Option B is not supported by the text, which doesn't claim lawyers are naturally honest. Option D is not mentioned in the passage and is incorrect."

Look up [HR 4310](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/4310), it literally states the government can use propaganda against it's \\[sic] people. Damn you are so asleep you wont \\[sic] question anything. Maybe dont \\[sic] research and follow blindly what your masters tell you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The intended reference is surely to Section 1078 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, which is about \"Voice of America\" and other media services produced by the Department of State for non\\-U.S. audiences.\n\nUnder the United States Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948, also known as the [Smith\\-Mundt Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Mundt_Act), the Secretary of State was authorized\n\n> to provide for the preparation, and dissemination abroad, of information about the United States, its people, and its policies, through press, publications, radio, motion pictures, and other information media, and through information centers and instructors abroad.\n\nThis law did not explicitly authorize distribution of that material domestically, other than saying it would be available on request to members of Congress and in certain other circumstances. The policy of not making it generally available in the U.S. was hardened into law in the [Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1972](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-86/pdf/STATUTE-86-Pg489.pdf), saying\n\n> Any such information (other than \"Problems of Communism\" which may continue to be sold by the Government Printing Office) shall not be disseminated within the United States, its territories, or possessions, but, on request, shall be available in the English language at the Department of State, at all reasonable times following its release as information abroad, for examination only by representatives of United States press associations, newspapers, magazines, radio systems, and stations, and by research students and scholars, and, on request, shall be made available for examination only to Members of Congress.\n\nSubsequent tweaks carved out many exceptions for other specific content, and arranged for deposition of material in the National Archives. In 1985, [a new provision](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-99/pdf/STATUTE-99-Pg405.pdf#page=27) was inserted to say that apart from certain enumerated exceptions,\n\n> no funds authorized to be appropriated to the United States\n> Information Agency shall be used to influence public opinion in the\n> United States, and no program material prepared by the United\n> States Information Agency shall be distributed within the United\n> States.\n\nThe developing statute law reflects a balance of concerns; it was felt that Americans *should know* what their government is saying to foreign audiences, but *should not be the target* of that official messaging. These additional provisions are not a departure from the position of 1948, so much as they are trying to set out the boundaries more clearly in the light of experience.\n\nThe 2013 law, codified within [22 U.S.C. \u00a71461\\-1464b](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-18/subchapter-V), made some changes to the domestic regime. It authorizes post\\-2013 material to be made generally available to the U.S. public *on request*, potentially subject to a fee: there is no longer a requirement that the requestor has to be a scholar/journalist/etc. It also amends the \"no domestic distribution\" section to account for that change. The bar on influencing domestic political opinion remains, as can be seen from the current codification.\n\nThe present situation is that much post\\-2013 material is available online (which is \"on request\", in that you have to go to the appropriate website). There is [a system](https://www.insidevoa.com/p/5719.html) for requesting permission to reuse this material, including within the U.S.; for example, you might do this if you were making a documentary and wanted to show some VoA footage. Per [policy](https://www.usagm.gov/wp-content/media/2013/11/2-160-Domestic-Distribution-of-Program-Materials.pdf), there is a possibility for providing\n\n> program materials, prepared for dissemination abroad, to domestic broadcasters aimed at foreign diaspora communities as part of the Agency's foreign policy mission.\n\nSubject to various criteria, this allows broadcasting material within the U.S., not by the federal government itself but by some commercial organization \\- if that is still compliant with the prohibition on influencing domestic political opinion, based on the way the material is used. The broadcaster is also obliged to credit the producing agency, so it should be reasonably clear when a video segment (for example) has this origin.\n\nIn answer to the question \"Does H.R. 4310 allow the US government to use propaganda against citizens?\", the situation is something like: it makes it possible for a third party to rebroadcast existing foreign\\-targeted propaganda for a domestic audience, in certain circumstances. It does not allow the government to broadcast or promote it domestically, and does not allow the government to produce it with a domestic audience in mind.\n\nAn important note is that all of this legislation only applies to the foreign\\-audience material produced under the auspices of the State Department (under various agency names at different times). It does not cover broadcasting or communication by other parts of the federal government.\n\nA less important note is that the journal \"Problems of Communism\" mentioned in the 1972 Act is now called \"Problems of Post\\-Communism\", and published by Taylor \\& Francis rather than by the U.S. government.",

The 2013 law made specific changes to the domestic regime for State Department media content originally produced for foreign audiences. It authorized post-2013 material to be made generally available to the U.S. public on request, potentially subject to a fee, and removed the requirement that the requestor had to be a scholar, journalist, or other specified professional. However, it maintained the prohibition on using this content to influence domestic political opinion. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the law did not allow unrestricted production and distribution of propaganda to American citizens. Answer B is incorrect because it did not completely repeal all previous restrictions; notably, the bar on influencing domestic political opinion remained. Answer D is incorrect because the law did not grant unrestricted authority for domestic political purposes; in fact, it maintained prohibitions on such use.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuanced changes made by the 2013 law, requiring careful differentiation between what was and was not altered in the regulations governing domestic distribution of State Department media content."

As far as as I'm aware, the IRS only cares how you are filing your taxes and what exemptions you take so it seems to me that the Federal government doesn't much care how identify myself as long as I'm paying my share of taxes.\n\nI personally don't like marking my status as *Divorced* as I don't like the idea of identifying myself by one of the lower events in my life. But in all but the most obviously reaching situations (like joining a website or a gym) I have marked myself with the safer *Divorced* as I wasn't sure if categorizing myself as *Single* could open me to some liability (as I suppose that technically I belong in the other category).\n\nIn dealing with financial, medical, insurance and basically any other forms found in the U.S. do I have a legal responsibility to identify myself as *Divorced*?

Or in other words, could identifying myself as Single as opposed to a divorcee incur any type of liability of which I should be aware?\n\n### Since you specified the financial and medical contexts, yes, sometimes it is mandatory to disclose that you are divorced.\n\n*Any time your signature is involved, be as accurate as the form allows.* The worst consequence I can think of is actually pretty bad (\"penalty of perjury\" is no joke, and whether or not it *should*, divorce *does* impact a surprising number of especially financial considerations.) If possible, it would be better to simply not answer at all than to sign off on something other than the most accurate option available.\n\nIn these contexts, the designation as having been divorced is often an archaic throwback predating no\\-fault.\n\nFor example, divorce adversely impacts your credit (more than the loss of a partner's presumed earning power, the reasoning here is basically that marriage was a long\\-term commitment you entered into willingly that was not fulfilled.) Jobs or employment opportunities demanding a very high degree of personal integrity may be negatively impacted by having, or having had a divorce, by the same reasoning (the examples that pop to mind are officers the military, depending on the career field.) Divorce can be interpreted as an indication that the individual in question is currently not as stable in their personal life and affairs (moving, figuring out joint custody, jealous/vindictive ex, etc.) as a prospective lender or employer requires.\n\nAs far as healthcare is concerned, it can have an impact on health care services and how providers interact with you, your ex, etc. (for example, your child's pediatrician.) Having had a divorce can be a flag to health care provider to screen for depression, anxiety, blood pressure, and so forth; likewise, insurance companies consider divorce a \"major life event\" that qualifies you to change your coverage out\\-of\\-season (I don't know, but wouldn't be surprised if divorce somehow impacted your rates because of statistical increased risk of specific ailments.)\n\nFurthermore, there can be far\\-reaching implications for others \\- how long you were married determines whether or not social security benefits are conferred to a surviving spouse, for example, or calculating your kid's FAFSA in five or ten or fifteen years.",

In Australia, there is only one GST rate of 10%, which has been in place since its introduction. Some items are GST-free (effectively 0%), but these are typically essential items, and restaurant meals do not fall into this category. The \"GST2\" charge of 2.5% is not a legitimate tax rate in Australia. It's most likely an error in the restaurant's point-of-sale system, as there is no such thing as \"GST2\" in Australian tax law. The other options are incorrect: there is no new 2.5% GST rate for restaurant meals (A), restaurant meals are not considered \"basic food\" items and thus are not GST-free (B), and restaurants cannot choose to apply a different GST rate (D). This situation highlights the importance of proper tax compliance and accurate billing systems in businesses."

After asking and researching I found out that I can register a copyright for my app with a copyright office to claim ownership of my app.\n\n**A little bit about apps:**\n\nSome of you might or might not know that an app is just a set of files : java, xml, .... that contain lines of code. And when the app is finished you can out put the app as a single APK file, and that APK file is then put on the play store for people to download (of course the app considered here is android app).\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1\\) How do I register a copyright for my app, do I provide the individual files to the office or the single APK file?\n\n2\\) Do I need a lawyer to do so?\n\n3\\) Lets say I include third party libraries in my app, then these libraries have their own code included in my app. Do I provide these to the office too?\n\n4\\) Any other ways to prove ownership of my app?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can start [here](https://eco.copyright.gov/eService_enu/start.swe?SWECmd=Start&SWEHo=eco.copyright.gov), registering with the Electronic Copyright Office. [This circular](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ61.pdf) describes the process (it's tailored to registering computer programs). You submit the source code in an accepted format (PDF, and others are said to be listed \"online\"). There is a list of conditions relevant to how much you must provide (for example if the code contains trade secrets. [This document](https://www.copyright.gov/comp3/chap1500/ch1500-deposits.pdf) covers deposits, i.e. the copies of the work, and \u00a71509\\.1(C) is specific to computer programs. Read that section to determine what you have to submit. Look at \u00a71507\\.2 for specification of electronic deposit copies. At some point you will wonder about accepted formats: [this](https://www.copyright.gov/eco/help-file-types.html) is the currently accepted format list.\n\nIf you cannot figure it out given this, you do really need a lawyer: but it's not legally required that the application be submitted by a lawyer. There is an increased risk that you will mess up the application if you do it yourself, but the same is also true of paying your income tax, and people do manage on their own. For example, you do need to exploit the \"Limitation of Claim\" field, so that you do not attempt to claim copyright ownership of third party code.\n\nThe situation where two parties A and B both claim copyright ownership is a very complicated matter, briefly summarized [here](https://scottandscottllp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Litigating-Copyright-Infringement-Claims.pdf). Most typically, competing claims of ownership involve collaboration and get resolved in court (or by negotiation) after the fact. For example, A may think he owns the copyright because he wrote the code, but he was hired as an employee by B to write that code, and as a work for hire, B may actually own the copyright. But maybe A was an independent contractor who agreed to write some code and license it to B, and A is the copyright holder. If you are just talking about a case of code\\-poaching (B stole your thumb drive, saw the code, and registered it), when you litigate for infringement, you would present (in court) whatever evidence you have that *you* are the rightful copyright holder. Registration is a requirement for litigation and provides prima facie evidence \u2013 not irrefutable proof \u2013 of copyright ownership. The law does not specify a practical means of balancing the evidence in your favor, but surely there are technical ways of permanently encoding your name in the source code.\n\nIf I want to sue a person for infringement, I must register the copyright first. [17 USC 411](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/411) says that\n\n> no civil action for infringement of the copyright in any United States\n>  work shall be instituted until preregistration or registration of the\n>  copyright claim has been made in accordance with this title\n\n\"United States work\" is defined [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101) \u2013 as a US citizen, anything I create is a US work. Anything you create as a non US person and publish in the US is also a US work: basically, if the work involves a US creator or US publisher, it is a US work. If the work is unpublished and you are not a US person, it's not a US work. Once you've determined if the work is a US work, you know whether you have to register before you can sue in US courts.\n\nYou would have a separate set of remedies and procedures available to you under Lebanese copyright law (which is a whole other question).",

According to 17 USC 411, no civil action for infringement of copyright in any United States work can be instituted until the copyright claim has been registered. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while it may be helpful, it's not legally required to hire a lawyer for copyright registration. \n\nOption B is incorrect because Jane should not submit third-party libraries as part of her copyright claim. She needs to use the \"Limitation of Claim\" field to exclude third-party code.\n\nOption C is incorrect because copyright registration provides prima facie evidence of ownership, not irrefutable proof. It can still be challenged in court by other parties."

My roommates have decided they will not at the apartment over the summer and one asked if her brother could live in her room during the first summer session. I told her that I am not comfortable with that request as I will be there by myself and I only know him from meeting him a few times when he visited his sister. Though our lease allow for subletting with the landlord's permission, my understanding is that the landlord would also need all of the current tenants to agree to any sublet arrangement as we all signed the lease. Hence, we are legally joined by the lease as \"tenant\" of the dwelling. I believe as our parents guaranteed the payment of the lease, they also would need to provide approval. Is my understanding correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You should read over your lease document, which may describe specific rules for subletting the place.\n\nIf it does not, then the basic idea is that you do not need to let in any subtenant or replacement tenant that you don't want to. You might consider writing an email or letter (and keeping a copy!) that simply says you don't consent to admitting this guy as a subtenant or cotenant. You don't need to say why. This can be sent to your cotenants or your landlord or both\\-\\-they are all obligated to respect your rights.\n\nUnless there is specific language giving the lease guarantors (like your parents) the right to refuse a sublet or lease modification, they generally do not have that right. If the nature of the rental changes enough that they are being made to guarantee a situation substantially different from what they signed up for, their guarantee might not be enforceable. But it is you, not the guarantors, who have rights as tenants.\n\nI get the sense from your post that the potential subtenant's gender is one cause for your concern. Your objection to his tenancy on those grounds may raise your roommates' hackles, but in *Fair Housing Council v. Roommates.com*, the court affirmed that roommates can discriminate against each other for whatever reason they want, including gender, even though landlords generally can't. So you're in the clear on that point.",

According to the information provided, when multiple tenants sign a lease together, they all typically need to agree to any subletting arrangement. The student has the right to refuse a subtenant or replacement tenant that she doesn't want, and she doesn't need to provide a reason for her objection.

Merriam\\-Webster defines it as \"a mock court in which the\n>  principles of law and justice are disregarded or perverted\". The term\n>  may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial authority who\n>  intentionally disregards the court's legal or ethical obligations.\n> \n> \n> A kangaroo court is often held to give the appearance of a fair and\n>  just trial, even though the verdict has in reality already been\n>  decided before the trial has begun. Such courts are typically run by\n>  authoritarian governments, and can also be found in rural areas where\n>  legitimate law enforcement may be limited.\n\nI took that quote from Wikipedia that helps to define the term but characteristics help identify a Kangaroo court as opposed to a legitimate court system? \n\nBy this definition there are quite a few courts that I am sure do not belong as the categorization of this as such but based on this definition would seem to apply. Most notably the Supreme Court of the United states at times has made rulings that were completely contrary to the existing laws and the constitution. Similarly the US Federal Circuits have also had several rulings that even though superior courts agreed the court stepped outside the law in its decision have chosen not to overturn the decisions or have written decisions that have become defacto laws.\n\nWhy would these not be considered Kangaroo courts.

When people talk about a kangaroo court, what they mean is that the legal process is for show; the actual decision is made on non\\-legal principles.\n\nA kangaroo court may look just like any other court; the only exception might be that before the trial, the government meets with the judge or the jury and informs them that their verdict will be \"guilty.\"\n\nOf course, some kangaroo courts tip the scales in more obvious ways, but all that's necessary is that it not follow the law in a way that prejudices the defendant.",

The choice of operating system is not a protected class, so restricting use on a specific platform would be legal. \n\nOption A is incorrect because discrimination based on choice of operating system is not illegal. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the company does not need to prove any security risk to legally implement this restriction. \n\nOption D is incorrect because there is no legal requirement for software licenses to be platform-agnostic, and this type of restriction does not necessarily violate antitrust laws.\n\nThis question tests understanding of contract law, discrimination laws, and the concept of protected classes in the United States."

Exceptions to laws recognizing e\\-signatures abound which exclude wills from general laws recognizing electronic signatures. [Nevada](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-133.html) is the one current exception (conveniently located between Oregon and Arizona). There have been attempts to legalize electronic wills, including in Arizona (SB 1298\\). Although Tennessee does not recognize e\\-wills, a gentleman in Tennessee went ahead and did it, and in [Taylor v. Holt](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1405291/taylor-v-holt/), 134 S.W.3d 830 the court decided that the will was properly executed and witnessed. Electronic notarization is [recognized in Arizona](https://www.azsos.gov/services/public-information/digital-signature-policy-authority), though apparently for things you file with the government (not things that your heirs will eventually file), whereas [in Oregon](http://sos.oregon.gov/business/Pages/electronic-notarization-faq.aspx) it is a general\\-purpose way of getting a document notarized. Since the courts are loathe to completely disregard a person's last will and testament because they didn't narrowly follow requirements, you might be able to \"get away with it\", but it would not make things easier for the executor.",

The article from the American Bar Association confirms this, mentioning that there are many exceptions to laws recognizing e-signatures which specifically exclude wills. Nevada is explicitly mentioned as the one current exception where electronic wills are legally recognized. While there have been attempts to legalize electronic wills in other states (such as Arizona), and some courts may consider the intent of the deceased (as in the Tennessee case of Taylor v. Holt), the general rule is that electronic wills are not valid in most U.S. jurisdictions. Option A is incorrect because electronic wills are not generally recognized. Option B is misleading because while electronic notarization exists in some states, it doesn't make electronic wills valid. Option D is too extreme, as there are exceptions and courts may sometimes consider electronic wills under certain circumstances."

During negotiations the parties will take and express many different positions and put forward and receive, verbally and in writing, many offers and counter offers. Consequently, what is legally accepted as definitive of the agreement is the document(s) that were signed or, if nothing was signed, the last document(s) exchanged.\n\nThe [parole evidence rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parol_evidence_rule) prevents a party from even introducing evidence of the negotiations if the signed contract is complete enough to form a whole contract. Extrinsic evidence can only be used where the contract is silent or ambiguous on a matter, where the contract addresses it and is sufficiently clear, it is definitive.\n\nOne exception is where the party signed the document believing that it was something else, for example (and I've seen this happen) the parties read through the contract together and agreed that it reflected the agreement, one party copied it and (deliberately or accidentally) substituted different pages in the photocopy, both parties then signed the doctored contract: such a contract would be void for fraud.",

The law presumes that by signing, the tenant read, understood, and agreed to the terms in the final lease document. Prior negotiations and offers are generally not admissible as evidence if the signed contract is complete. The tenant would likely be bound by the terms they signed, even if they differ from what was initially negotiated, unless they can prove fraud in the execution of the document itself (such as deliberate page substitution), which is not indicated in this scenario."

The court doesn't have to actually believe you. The court merely has to assume for sake of argument that the things said are true for the narrow purpose of evaluating whether they describe a legal wrong in a formal sense.\n\nAlso, under modern federal pleading rules in the U.S., the judge doesn't have to believe you and can dismiss your complaint if it is not \"plausible.\"\n\nYour attorney has a duty to not merely assume that everything that a client tells the lawyer is true. In federal court, the governing rule is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which states that when an attorney files and signs a document in court that the attorney:\n\n> certifies that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and\n> belief, **formed after an inquiry reasonable under the\n> circumstances**:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) **it is not being presented for any improper purpose**, such as to\n> harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of\n> litigation;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by\n> existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying,\n> or reversing existing law or for establishing new law;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) **the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if\n> specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after\n> a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery**; and\n> \n> \n> (4\\) **the denials of factual contentions are warranted on the evidence\n> or, if specifically so identified, are reasonably based on belief or a\n> lack of information**.\n\nThe California state law obligations is more or less identical in substance, although the procedural rules of California are codified differently than the federal rules.\n\nSo, a lawyer is required to reasonably inquire into whether the client is telling the lawyer the truth about the client's motives and about the facts. It is a breach of the lawyer's duties to the court and the profession to simply take what a client tells the lawyer at face value, accepting it uncritically.",

They are not required to assume everything the client says is true (ruling out option A), nor are they required to independently verify every fact before filing (ruling out option B). \n\nThe correct approach, as stated in Rule 11, is that \"the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\" This allows attorneys to include factual contentions based on the information they have, while also allowing for the possibility of further investigation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the attorney's personal judgment about what the court will believe is not the standard.

[It](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-80/pdf/STATUTE-80-Pg378.pdf) created title 5 entitled \"Government Organization and Employees\". The act itself was not given a name: it did contain provisions in \u00a7552 requiring that information be made available, as opposed to being kept secret. Subsequently in 1974, [PL 93\\-502](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-88/pdf/STATUTE-88-Pg1561.pdf#page=4) amended the law specifically w.r.t. \u00a7552, and the act begins with the text\n\n> To amend section 552 of title 5, United States Code, known as the\n> Freedom of Information Act\n\nEssentially, by this act of Congress, \u00a7552 was legislatively deemed to be \"known as\" the Freedom of Information Act. The expression was used earlier, see the documents [here](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nsa/foialeghistory/legistfoia.htm). [This speech](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nsa/foialeghistory/112%20Cong.%20Rec.%2013007%20(1966%20Source%20Book).pdf) (June 20 1966\\) by Rep. Moss sets forth the arguments for the relevant bill S.1160 which amended title 5,, saying\n\n> Our system of government is based on the participation of the\n> governed, and as our population grows in numbers it is essential that\n> it also grow in knowledge and understanding. We must remove every\n> **barrier to information** about\u2014and understanding of\u2014government\n> activities consistent with our security if the American public is to\n> be adequately equipped to fulfill the ever more demanding role of\n> responsible citizenship\n\nThis is the sense in which the bill was about \"freedom of information\". In the speech, he also refers (p. 3 of the scan) to the chairmen of the \"Freedom of Information Committees\", and LBJ in his [signing statement](https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB194/Document%2031.pdf)\n\n> I have always felt that freedom of information is so important to our\n> form of government that it should not be restricted except when there\n> is an important reason for doing so\n\nThis gave rise to an informal name to the act, which then was \"codified\" in 1974 by another act of Congress.",

Johnson's signing statement in 1966 officially named the legislation the \"Freedom of Information Act,\" which was then retroactively applied to the original law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The term \"Freedom of Information Act\" evolved over time. It was not explicitly named in the original 1966 legislation (80 Stat 383), which contradicts option B. While Rep. Moss used similar language in his 1966 speech, referring to \"Freedom of Information Committees,\" this did not immediately establish the act's name, contrary to option A. President Johnson's signing statement, while using the phrase \"freedom of information,\" did not officially name the act, ruling out option D. The term gained informal usage over time, and was finally codified officially by Congress in 1974 through PL 93-502, which amended Section 552 of Title 5, United States Code, and explicitly stated it was \"known as the Freedom of Information Act.\" This matches the description in option C, making it the most accurate statement about the origin and formalization of the act's name."

A bystander (let's call him Paul) rushes to Emily's aid, attacking Thug in her defense. After a few minutes, Thug is incapacitated and thoroughly bloodied, and Emily and Paul are safe.\n\nIs Paul guilty of assault and battery for attacking Thug, or would self\\-defense or some other standard defense apply?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Legal Context**\n\nThis kind of argument is often called a \"defense of others\" defense which is available in every jurisdiction of which I am aware. Almost every state has a specific description of when this is permitted as part of their criminal code, usually in a general principles section at the beginning, or in the sections pertaining to crimes of violence.\n\nSome details vary from one state to another, but none of the facts presented in this hypothetical really push the envelope in terms of distinctions between one state's law and another. \n\nMost of the differences involve situations when the use of deadly force is allowed. For example, states differ regarding when deadly force allowed to prevent a burglary of your home or business which is in progress, particularly if it is possible to avoid a use of deadly force at all by retreating in a manner that puts you at no one at any significant risk of bodily injury. But, the scenario presented does not appear to involve the use of deadly force (although the definition of \"deadly force\" can be slippery and lead to some subtle variations in what is permitted from state to state).\n\nAnother common nuance of variation between states involves the circumstances under which physical force or deadly physical force is authorized to make a citizens arrest, but this situation is also not implicated by your hypothetical. Once Thug is beat up, the scenario ends without any effort to detain Thug until the police arrive.\n\nGenerally speaking, a defense of others defense that justifies a use of force under criminal law will also not give rise to civil liability in a lawsuit for assault and battery as opposed to a criminal prosecution for it.\n\n**A Sample Defense Of Others Statute**\n\nThe pertinent section of the Colorado Revised Statutes (2016\\), strongly influenced by the language of the Model Penal Code (which never adopted in full by any state but highly influential stylistically in how U.S. criminal codes are drafted) is very typical of the majority rule regarding the defense of others and reads as follows (emphasizing the language relevant to the scenario in the question):\n\n> \u00a7 18\\-1\\-704\\. Use of physical force in defense of a person\n> \n> \n> (1\\) Except as provided in subsections (2\\) and (3\\) of this section, **a\n>  person is justified in using physical force upon another person in\n>  order to defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably\n>  believes to be the use or imminent use of unlawful physical force by\n>  that other person, and he may use a degree of force which he\n>  reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose.**\n> \n> \n> (2\\) Deadly physical force may be used only if a person reasonably\n>  believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate and: (a) The actor has\n>  reasonable ground to believe, and does believe, that he or another\n>  person is in imminent danger of being killed or of receiving great\n>  bodily injury; or (b) The other person is using or reasonably appears\n>  about to use physical force against an occupant of a dwelling or\n>  business establishment while committing or attempting to commit\n>  burglary as defined in sections 18\\-4\\-202 to 18\\-4\\-204 ; or (c) The\n>  other person is committing or reasonably appears about to commit\n>  kidnapping as defined in section 18\\-3\\-301 or 18\\-3\\-302, robbery as\n>  defined in section 18\\-4\\-301 or 18\\-4\\-302, sexual assault as set forth\n>  in section 18\\-3\\-402, or in section 18\\-3\\-403 as it existed prior to\n>  July 1, 2000, or assault as defined in sections 18\\-3\\-202 and 18\\-3\\-203\\.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1\\) of this section,\n>  **a person is not justified in using physical force if: (a) With intent\n>  to cause bodily injury or death to another person, he provokes the use\n>  of unlawful physical force by that other person; or (b) He is the\n>  initial aggressor; except that his use of physical force upon another\n>  person under the circumstances is justifiable if he withdraws from the\n>  encounter and effectively communicates to the other person his intent\n>  to do so, but the latter nevertheless continues or threatens the use\n>  of unlawful physical force;** or (c) The physical force involved is the\n>  product of a combat by agreement not specifically authorized by law.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) In a case in which the defendant is not entitled to a jury\n>  instruction regarding self\\-defense as an affirmative defense, the\n>  court shall allow the defendant to present evidence, when relevant,\n>  that he or she was acting in self\\-defense. If the defendant presents\n>  evidence of self\\-defense, the court shall instruct the jury with a\n>  self\\-defense law instruction. The court shall instruct the jury that\n>  it may consider the evidence of self\\-defense in determining whether\n>  the defendant acted recklessly, with extreme indifference, or in a\n>  criminally negligent manner. However, the self\\-defense law instruction\n>  shall not be an affirmative defense instruction and the prosecuting\n>  attorney shall not have the burden of disproving self\\-defense. This\n>  section shall not apply to strict liability crimes.\n\n**Analysis of the Hypothetical Facts**\n\n> Is Paul guilty of assault and battery for attacking Thug, or would\n>  self\\-defense or some other standard defense apply?\n\nPaul is probably not guilty of assault and battery for attacking Thug because a defense of others defense justifies his actions.\n\nPaul is using physical force to defend a third person (and presumably himself as well once once he is involved in the fray) from what he reasonably believes to be the use of unlawful physical force by Thug, and generally, under those circumstances Paul may use a degree of force which Paul reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose. \n\nPaul is most vulnerable in this scenario on the question of whether he reasonably believed that the degree of force he used was reasonably necessary for the purpose of defending Emily and himself from Thug's unlawful use of physical force, or whether he went further than what was reasonably necessary for a few minutes that left Thug \"incapacitated and thoroughly bloodied\".\n\nFor example, suppose that Paul had already caused Thug to try to flee the scene after the first minute at which point Thug was slightly bruised and afraid of Paul, but was not at all incapacitated. But, suppose that despite this fact that Paul, awash with adrenaline from the fight, continued to pummel Thug for a couple more minutes as Thug repeatedly tried to flee the scene only to be dragged back by Paul. Suppose that Paul continued the fight after it was no longer necessary because Paul wanted to punish Thug for his mistreatment of Emily and to discourage other people from trying to attack Emily in the future, even after Paul knew that there was already no real risk that Thug himself would continue to use unlawful physical force against Emily no or in the near future. \n\nUnder these circumstances, which aren't inconsistent with the hypothetical facts, if this extra couple of minutes caused Thug to be much more badly injured than he otherwise would have been if Thug had been allowed to flee after the first minute, then Paul could still be guilty of assault and battery, even though his actions were legally justified for the first minute of the fight.\n\nThere is no indication that either Paul or Emily provoked the attack on Emily, or that either Paul or Emily was the initial aggressor, or that this was actually a pre\\-agreed dueling situation. So each of these circumstances which would be exceptions to the general rule that the defense of others is justified do not apply to this case.\n\nThere is likewise no indication that Paul used \"deadly force\" as opposed to mere \"physical force\" in handling the situation. It is likely that Paul would have committed a crime if he had shot and killed Thug instead of beating him up, if Paul knew perfectly well at the time that he was capable of beating up Thug and making Thug go away for good as a result without resorting to a firearm, unless the attack on Emily was severe enough for Paul to reasonably believe that the attack was putting Emily at a real risk of serious bodily injury.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Paul witnesses Thug violently assaulting Emily on the street. Paul intervenes to defend Emily, resulting in a physical altercation with Thug. After subduing Thug, Paul continues to beat him for several minutes, even after Thug attempts to flee. As a result, Thug suffers severe injuries. Under these circumstances, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Paul's legal liability?\n\nA) Paul is completely protected by the defense of others doctrine and cannot be held liable for any injuries to Thug.\n\nB) Paul is guilty of assault and battery for the entire duration of the incident, as he had no right to intervene in the first place.\n\nC) Paul is protected by the defense of others doctrine for the initial intervention, but may be liable for assault and battery for the excessive force used after Thug attempted to flee.\n\nD) Paul cannot be held criminally liable, but may face civil liability for the injuries caused to Thug.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While Paul's initial intervention to defend Emily is justified under the defense of others doctrine, his continued use of force after Thug attempted to flee likely exceeds what is considered reasonably necessary for defense. The law generally allows the use of force that is reasonably believed to be necessary for defense. Once Thug tried to flee, the threat was arguably over, and Paul's continued beating could be seen as excessive and no longer justified. Therefore, Paul may be protected for the initial intervention but could face liability for assault and battery for the excessive force used after the threat had subsided."

Is there any similar requirement under GDPR for data processors (resellers in this case) to disclose the country or countries where the data is stored and processed, or the names of third party data processors involved?

How much paperwork does he have to fill out?\n\nIf the person is on the autopsy table, while he may have technically been legally dead, the person's death certificate has probably not even been issued yet, since normally an autopsy is done, in part, to determine a cause of death for purposes of preparing a death certificate.\n\nNormally, an autopsy is only prepared when the cause of death is uncertain or needs to be documented for legal reasons (e.g. an accidental or potentially criminal death or one that is just unexplained), and the need for one postpones the preparation of a death certificate. If the cause of death is self\\-evident and there is no indication of foul play, an autopsy isn't done and the preparation of a death certificate proceeds more quickly.\n\nIn other words, while he may be \"legally\" dead (defined as discontinuation of the function of certain bodily processes like brain activity and heartbeat and breathing), he very likely isn't yet \"bureaucratically\" dead.\n\nYou can be \"legally\" dead days before anyone even discovers that you have died, with the time of your death determined only retroactively, but that doesn't have any practical effect until someone discovers it and it makes its way through the bureaucratic and court process.\n\nIt takes a few days after a death for a probate proceeding to establish death, heirship and the validity of any will (many states have a 120 hour minimum waiting period after a date of death and most autopsies are within 72 hours). Even if a probate proceeding had been commenced, a simple affidavit or notice that someone was not, in fact, dead would cause the case to be summarily dismissed and it is unlikely that much would have happened in the court process since then.\n\nWith older people, one of the fastest agencies to act is the Social Security Administration discontinuing benefits. But a younger person wouldn't have gotten those to start with, so that wouldn't be a factor.\n\nLife insurance companies normally won't pay until a final post\\-autopsy death certificate with cause of death is in place (so they can look for fraud in the life insurance application relative to the cause of death stated).\n\nIt would be very usual for a landlord to take action sooner than the month after learning of the death, and often the estate will keep in a lease in force much longer. Next of kin may have removed some valuables prior to any official declaration, and while most people would promptly return them upon learning of the \"mistake\", a few items might not be recovered.\n\nThe final death certificate would probably never be prepared. A preliminary death certificate might be quashed as erroneous and not filed with the Vital Statistics Department of the State Department of Health, by the preparing party, through a simple, oral, in office instruction to the person in the coroner's office who handles those filings.\n\nSince there isn't a formal judicial declaration of death or a final death certificate, simply informing an agency or person that received a preliminary notice that it was in error, perhaps by letter or email, would suffice. Even if a final death certificate had just issued, the person who filed it could probably fill out a simple correction form so soon (probably just a matter of hours) after it was filed. It wouldn't be that disruptive.\n\nThe messy cases are when there has been a legal declaration of death and then months of actions have been taken in reliance on the determination that someone is dead.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In an urban fantasy scenario where a young man is declared legally dead but reanimates on the autopsy table, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal and bureaucratic processes?\n\nA) The man's landlord would immediately evict him and rent out his apartment to a new tenant.\n\nB) The man would need to go through extensive court proceedings to prove he is alive and regain his legal status.\n\nC) Social Security Administration would be the first agency to act on his death, discontinuing any benefits.\n\nD) The death certificate likely hasn't been issued yet, and a simple notification of error would suffice to correct most records.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, if the person is still on the autopsy table, it's likely that the death certificate hasn't been issued yet. Autopsies are typically performed before a death certificate is prepared, especially in cases where the cause of death is uncertain. In this scenario, the bureaucratic process of declaring someone dead would not have progressed very far. A simple notification of error to relevant parties would likely be sufficient to correct most records and prevent the issuance of a death certificate.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because landlords typically don't take immediate action upon learning of a tenant's death, often waiting at least a month or longer.\n\nAnswer B is overstated. While some paperwork might be necessary, extensive court proceedings would likely not be required if the error is caught early in the process.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect for a young person, as they wouldn't typically be receiving Social Security benefits that could be discontinued."

He was not allowed to bring books and asked us to send him reading material.\n\nA [military website](https://www.militaryonesource.mil/military-life-cycle/new-to-the-military/getting-settled/what-to-pack-for-basic-training) states for basic training:\n\n> Dice, playing cards, dominoes, **magazines, newspapers and books** will be confiscated.\n\n(For completeness: There is an exemption for one religious book.) I understand that there may be little time or remaining energy in boot camp to read but is there an official rationale which was brought forward when the regulation was instated?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When it comes to preventing disciplinary issues, the military much prefers simple solutions that work. This will at times result in rules which ban things that aren't really a problem, along with the things that really are, but to tailor the regulation to ban only what needs to be banned can result in rules that take two lawyers and a judge to puzzle out. Your drill sergeant hasn't got time for that.\n\nAnd there are magazines that the military will see as needing to be banned. Porn (even though the on\\-base store sells it) was prohibited when I went through boot camp. I don't know if it was from a moralistic stance, or the simple fact that someone will steal someone else's copy of *Playboy*, which will probably result in a fight.\n\nShortly before I enlisted in the military, the recruiter held a meeting at which a former drill sergeant told us about what to expect in boot camp. He touched on the things that we were told to leave at home. I asked whether a paperback novel was allowed or not, and he said that there isn't enough spare time in six months of boot camp to finish a book. It may seem, from the outside, that disallowing a novel is an unreasonable abridgement of your rights, but the actual effect on you is minimal. Boot camp only runs from two to three months, and the last time I checked nobody ever died from a lack of entertainment. There are hills more worthy of dying on than this.\n\nGaming materials are probably be contraband because they might be used for gambling. That can lead to an outright brawl, and while a good fighting spirit is quite welcome, fisticuffs in the barracks are not.",

The documentation suggests that the military prefers simple solutions that work when it comes to preventing disciplinary issues. While banning all reading materials (except for one religious book) may seem extreme, it's easier to enforce a blanket ban than to make exceptions for certain types of books or magazines. This approach helps prevent potential problems like theft, gambling, or inappropriate content, which could lead to fights or other disciplinary issues.\n\nAnswer A is partially true but not the primary reason. While reducing distractions is a benefit, it's not the main motivation behind the policy.\n\nAnswer B, while plausible, is not directly supported by the given information. The focus on training and discipline is achieved through the structured program, not necessarily through banning reading materials.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect. While reducing personal belongings might be a secondary benefit, it's not presented as the main reason for the policy in the given context.\n\nThe explanation also notes that the actual impact on recruits is minimal due to the short duration of basic training and the lack of free time, further supporting the military's rationale for this simple, all-encompassing rule."

The legal framework for such deportations are explained [here](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/homesec/R45314.pdf), and rely on [8 USC 1225](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1225). The Secretary of DHS has authority to establish rules, and has recently done so [here](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/07/23/2019-15710/designating-aliens-for-expedited-removal). The current regulations pertaining to expedited removal are at [8 CFR 253\\.3](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c57508ef4cccfe5bb518ac20feef57e1&node=8:1.0.1.2.28.0.1.3&rgn=div8). There is no exemption for people being medically treated, for covid\\-19 or any other reason, but \"parole\" is available (at the discretion of the attorney general) to \"parole\" an immigrant if it is \"is required to meet a medical emergency\". Thus an illegal immigrant in the ICU might be exempt from immediate deportation, but that is at the discretion of the AG. State and local officials do not have the authority to interfere in the enforcement of federal law, even if the state or municipality has declared itself a \"sanctuary\". The criminal penalties for interference are spelled out [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/111); no law compells cooperation, the law simply prohibits forcible interference.",

According to the information provided, ICE does have the authority to deport illegal immigrants through an expedited process, even after they have received medical treatment. However, the Attorney General has the discretion to grant \"parole\" in cases of medical emergencies. This means that while ICE generally has the authority to deport, there is a provision for exceptions in urgent medical situations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because sanctuary city laws do not override federal immigration enforcement authority. \n\nOption B is too absolute; while ICE has broad authority, the discretionary parole option exists for medical emergencies.\n\nOption D is incorrect because state and local officials, including mayors of sanctuary cities, do not have the legal authority to interfere with federal law enforcement, even if they have declared themselves a \"sanctuary.\""

If you're in the UAE for business reasons, are there ways to get an exemption from this law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [This article](http://www.emirates247.com/news/emirates/dh500-000-fine-if-you-use-fraud-ip-in-uae-2016-07-22-1.636441) is from an official Emirates news agency, which confirms the change (Federal Law 12/2016\\). This is a change to [Federal Law 5/2012](http://ejustice.gov.ae/downloads/latest_laws/cybercrimes_5_2012_en.pdf), replacing Article 9 (the translation into English is odd because the verb phrase goes first). The level of the penalty has increased (minimum 150K \u2192 minimum 500K; maximum 500K \u2192 2M). Incarceration is changed from \"imprisonment\" to \"temporary imprisonment\", which might mean that previously the term was life. In either case, they have an \"and\" problem that the punishment is \"(temporary) imprisonment **and** a fine ... **or either** of these two penalties\". Presumably the Arabic version is dispositive.\n\nApart from that, the new version of the law identifies the offender as\n\n> Whoever uses a fraudulent computer network protocol address (IP\n>  address) by using a false address or a third\\-party address by any\n>  other means for the purpose of committing a crime or preventing its\n>  discovery\n\nwhereas the old law only said\n\n> whoever uses a fraudulent computer network protocol address by using a\n>  false address or a third\\-party address by any other means for the\n>  purpose of committing a crime or preventing its discovery.\n\nThus the meaning of \"computer network protocol address\" is defined as being equivalent to \"IP address\".\n\nIn other words, there is no substantive change beyond the stiffer penalty. There does not seem to any provision allowing one to ask for exceptions. Article 30 of the underlying law strongly suggests that there is no exception and you should not ask.\n\nOn a separate note, only Etisalat and Du are authorized to provide telecommunications services, pursuant to [Federal Decree Law No. 3/2003](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjWrdLL-pnOAhUBwWMKHRlmBo4QFgg6MAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tra.gov.ae%2Fassets%2FGevKF7CC.pdf.aspx&usg=AFQjCNGkkMICteX1CCWbaob3LQvdj0K-Rw&sig2=dOeeSCFScJ_Q5lQKuaY22A).

The fundamental offense remains the same: using a fraudulent IP address to commit a crime or prevent its discovery. The law does not specifically target VPN users, nor does it introduce exemptions for business travelers. It also does not legalize VPN use through specific providers.

And because of my age I am under the risk of being immediately take into forced military service upon my return. I am also known to the community around me of having my own opinions and thoughts about the authorities, some of my family members were killed/taken away because of that. Everyone who speak has a mark on his name to be 'dealt with' later (when I return to my home). Not to mention I lost my home there and have no assets or anything. \n\nThe country I'm living in currently does not grant citizenship or permanent residency. I have to keep working to keep my residency visa through the sponsor. The sponsor will not keep you under his sponsorship for free or for not working for him. Currently the economy is failing badly and non\\-citizens are getting life harder. And if I leave my current job I'll not get another one, means sponsor will force me to leave him which cannot happen without another work, so it will end up for me to be deported by the request of the sponsor since I cannot work for him anymore or cannot find another sponsor because I was unable to find a new job... TLDR: no social/economic security or future in the current country I'm in right now...\n\nFor the future of my family I have to leave and I am looking at New Zealand. I need a visa to be able to travel there... So my question is if I get a visit visa for me and my family and once we land in the airport we claim asylum, is my case going to be accepted? or I'll be deported back to the country I came from (to either my home or the second country)...?\n\nThanks\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: New Zealand has ratified the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment of Punishment and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \n\nYou must submit a request in writing and the Refugee Status Branch processes the claim. While yopur claim is being processed, you will not be deported. A refugee and protection officer will attempt to resolve your claim within 140 days. \n\nRefugee is defined as one who is outside of her home country or country of habitual residence, faces a real chance of harm if returned ot that country, the harm faced is an ongoing breach of a fundamental human right or is based upon who she is or what she believes (race, religionm, nationality, political views, etc.), and needs and deserves protection in New Zealand. \n\nThe process is roughly as follows: file your original claim (forms available on the website of the Ministry of Justice). One for each family member. Once referred to the Refugee Status Branch, you will need to submit a written statement explaining the experiences and circumstances that form the basis of your refugee status claim. About 4 weeks later, youll be invited to an interview with the Refugee and Protection Officer. You need correct documents as to your identity and under New Zealands Section 135 of its Refugee Act, you must provie all information and form your case as to why you deserve and need asylum. Examples of useful documents to bring include: passport, ID cards, birth certficates, marriage certificates, school and military ID cards. If documents are in another language, you will need certified translations of them. Within 3 weeks of this interview, youll be issued the Interview Report, written by the officer, and you will have three weeks to comment on that and submit more documentation, if necessary. The officer assesses whether your statemtents are truthful and credible and whether your claim meets the criteria contained in Article 1A(2\\) of the Refugee Convention or if you are eligible for protected person status (see below). If accepted, you will be able to apply for permanent resident status and remain in New Zealand. If you are unsuccessful, you are required to leave. \n\nPlease visit [https://www.immigration.govt.nz/audiences/supporting\\-refugees\\-and\\-asylum\\-seekers/asylum\\-seekers](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/audiences/supporting-refugees-and-asylum-seekers/asylum-seekers) for more comprehensive information and requirements. \n\nArticle 1A(2\\) of the [Refugee Convention](http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/3b66c2aa10) merely restates the definition of a refugee, roughly stating that if, due to race, religion, nationality, etc., are outside the country of your nationality and are unable to or, owing to such fear, are unwilling to avail yourself of the protection of that country. It does note that one will not be considered \u201clacking protection of the country of nationality if, without any valid reason based on well0founded fear, he has not availed himself of the protection of one of the countries of which he is a national.\u201d\n\nFinally, should your circumstances not be fit for asylum, you may consider seeking protection uner the United Nations Convention Against Torture ([http://www.nolo.com/legal\\-encyclopedia/how\\-apply\\-convention\\-against\\-torture\\-protection.html](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/how-apply-convention-against-torture-protection.html)). The requirements to meet are higher than for asylum and the relief is more limited, but if you qualify, the country must admit you and certain things that would bar you from being granted asylum, wont bar you from being granted protected status. One example of a bar to refugee status is being \u201cfirmly resettled\u201d in another country, for example. To quality for CAT protection, you have to show that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that you would be subjected to torture if returned to the country you are fleeing. The CAT defines torture as any \u201cintentionanal unlawful infliction of severe (physical or mental) suffering or pain, with consent of a public official, for purposes such as punishment, obtaining a confession, intimidation, or discrimination.\u201d Torture must be done by your government, or at the request of your government, or with permission of your government. \n\nRelevant items to show to prove your case under CAT are specific types of torture you fear you will suffer if forced to return, what types you have already suffered if you have, what types your family or friends have suffered if they have, and how the government has tortured other people similar to you, if they have. Keep in mind, while past torture may be a deciding factor for asylum, it is not for CAT. The CAT is forward\\-looking, therefore, you must demonstrate what you fear will happen to you if sent back, not what has already happened.",

Which of the following statements is NOT correct regarding their asylum process?\n\nA) They must submit a written request to the Refugee Status Branch, and will not be deported while their claim is being processed.\n\nB) They need to provide a written statement explaining their circumstances and attend an interview with a Refugee and Protection Officer.\n\nC) If their asylum claim is rejected, they can automatically apply for protection under the Convention Against Torture without any additional requirements.\n\nD) They should bring documents such as passports, ID cards, and birth certificates, with certified translations if in another language.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is incorrect because applying for protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) is not automatic and has different, often more stringent requirements than asylum. The CAT process is separate from the asylum process and has its own specific criteria. Applicants must demonstrate that it is \"more likely than not\" that they would be subjected to torture if returned to their home country, and the definition of torture under CAT is quite specific. The other options (A, B, and D) accurately describe aspects of the asylum process in New Zealand as outlined in the provided information."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Idaho's House of Representatives has just passed a [bill](https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/sessioninfo/2022/legislation/H0675.pdf \"full text here\") criminalizing most forms of gender\\-affirming treatment for minors. Most audaciously to my eye, subsection (4\\) of the bill purports to criminalize transporting a minor out of state (to neighboring Oregon, say) for the provision of such treatment.\n\nShould Idaho attempt such a prosecution, I would guess that Subsection (4\\) would be overturned by a federal court as an infringement of the right to freedom of movement among the states. Is this correct? The closest valid law I'm aware of is the *federal* law against interstate travel for the purpose of dodging state age of consent laws, which is of course a very different matter. In abortion law, there is a related discussion [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41261/is-it-legal-to-have-an-abortion-in-another-state-or-abroad), but this regards an Alabama law that doesn't even purport to ban residents' seeking abortions out of state, which is moot while Roe v. Wade stands in any case.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Effect of Bill\n--------------\n\nFirst of all, if this bill (Idaho House Bill 675\\) is passed in the form linked in the question, section 4, which prohibits transporting a child outside the state, **ONLY** applies when this is done for purposes prohibited in subsection (1\\), that is, traditionally defined female genital mutilation. It does not, in its linked form, prohibit transport to violate the new section (2\\) which prohibits procedures to \"change or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex\". Thus the statement in the question that:\n\n> subsection (4\\) of the bill purports to criminalize transporting a minor out of state (to neighboring Oregon, say) for the provision of such treatment.\n\nis incorrect.\n\nNotice that section 4 is not new, nor is it modified (except by changing th4e section number) by the current bill. My understanding is that the travel ban was, when it was passed, aimed at families who took female children outside the US, to African or Middle\\-eastern countries, for traditional rites that include FGM. This was done by a significant number of people with ethnic origins in such countries, and a number of US states passed laws banning such travel. This law, before the house bill, was one such law. The recent bill added \"gender affirming care\" into the law, by calling it another form of genital mutilation.\n\nHowever, for purposes of discussion, let us assume that subsection (4\\) is changed to refer to subsections (1\\) **or** (2\\), thus making the question correct.\n\nRight to Travel\n---------------\n\nThe right to travel from one state to another is a basic right under the US constitution.\n\nThe LII page on [\"Interstate Travel\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-14/section-1/interstate-travel) refers to it as: \"a right venerable for its longevity, but still lacking a clear doctrinal basis.\"\n\nSee the Wikipedia article [Freedom of movement under United States law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law)\n\nThe right to travel was recognized early on, in the case of [*Corfield v. Coryell* (6 Fed. Cas. 546, no. 3,230 C.C.E.D.Pa. 1823\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corfield_v._Coryell). This case was decided by Justice Bushrod Washington, a member of the US Supreme Court, but it was decided while he was acting in his role as circuit judge, not by the Supreme Court as a whole.\n\nIn that decision, Justice Washington included \"The right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to reside in any other state, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise;\" as one of the \"privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states\" which are guaranteed to all citizens. This passage has been influential, although not undisputed, in interpreting the \"privileges and immunities clause\" of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn [*Crandall v. Nevada*, 73 U.S. 35 (1868\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crandall_v._Nevada) The Supreme Court held that the right to travel between states was fundamental, and that a state could not impede it by taxing the exit of people from one state to travel into another.\n\nSubsequent cases have deemed the right to travel protected against state restrictions both under the privileges and immunities clause, and under the commerce clause. In [*United States v. Guest*, 383 U.S. 745 (1966\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/745/) at 383 U.S. 757 the Court wrote:\n\n> The constitutional right to travel from one State to another, and necessarily to use the highways and other instrumentalities of interstate commerce in doing so, occupies a position fundamental to the concept of our Federal Union. It is a right that has been firmly established and repeatedly recognized.\n\nThe *Guest* court goes on to cite *Crandall v. Nevada*, 6 Wall. 35, (the case in which a tax on those leaving the state was overturned) and the *Passenger Cases*, 7 How. 283, 48 U. S. 492 in which Chief Justice Taney wrote:\n\n> We are all citizens of the United States; and, as members of the same community, must have the right to pass and repass through every part of it without interruption, as freely as in our own States.\"\n\nAll this would mean that a law prohibiting travel would need strong justification, and is probably subject to ***strict scrutiny***, a standard of review requiring a \"compelling governmental interest\" and a \"narrowly drawn\" law.\n\nMedical Judgement\n-----------------\n\nThe bill declares that procedures to \"change or affirm the child's perception of the child's sex\" are \"never necessary\", any medical opinion to the contrary notwithstanding. Such an override of qualified medical opinion might be hard to justify in a criminal law.\n\nCivil Rights\n------------\n\nIn [*BOSTOCK v. CLAYTON COUNTY, GEORGIA* 590 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2020\\) \\#17\u20131618](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf) the Subreme court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964\\. prohibits **employment** discrimination against homosexual or transgender individuals, writing:\n\n> Because discrimination on the basis of homosexuality or transgender\n> status requires an employer to intentionally treat individual employees differently because of their sex, an employer who intentionally penalizes an employee for being homosexual or transgender also violates\n> Title VII.\n\nThis rule may well carry over to other areas of the law.\n\nEqual Protection Clause\n-----------------------\n\nThe [Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause#Sex,_disability,_and_sexual_orientation) reads\n\n> nor \\[shall any state] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nTreating members groups differently because of group membership is often, but not always, an equal protection violation. The provisions oc the bill, if enacted, **might** constitute such a violation.",

The right to travel between states is a fundamental right recognized by the Supreme Court in multiple cases. Laws restricting this right are subject to strict scrutiny, requiring a compelling government interest and narrow tailoring. Additionally, the bill's attempt to override medical opinions and potentially discriminate based on gender identity could face equal protection challenges. The other options either misstate the bill's likely constitutional standing or incorrectly compare it to unrelated laws."

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll answer the following questions, which hopefully give you a good idea of your situation:\n\n1. If you use vtd\\-xml (which uses a GPL license), must your product also use gpl?\n\nYes. You can still sell your product, but it will automatically use gpl.\n\n2. What does it mean if your product uses gpl?\n\nIf your product is being publicly distributed (sold, offered to the public as a free download, etc) then you must make it open source. This doesn't mean you have to have a link to your product's source code available on your website, but if it is requested by someone you must be able to send them a copy of your source code\n\nIf your product isn't being publicly distributed (e.g only used by yourself or inside your own company) then you don't have to make your code open source. But obviously you can't sell your code if you don't distribute it.\n\nNote that this is what the current court battle described in [https://opensource.com/law/14/7/lawsuit\\-threatens\\-break\\-new\\-ground\\-gpl\\-and\\-software\\-licensing\\-issues](https://opensource.com/law/14/7/lawsuit-threatens-break-new-ground-gpl-and-software-licensing-issues) is about. Ximpleware argues that ameriprise are distributing a product, and therefore needs to make their code open source due to the copyleft requirement of the gpl\n\n3. You want to sell your product, but not make it open source. What do you do?\n\nYou need to contact ximpleware and buy a commercial license to use their code. (their homepage has contact details for this). After that, you are free to use their code and not have to make your application open source\n\n4. You want to sell your product, not make it open source, but also not buy a commercial license from Ximpleware. What do you do?\n\nYou can theoretically make a piece of independant code, sell it, and give instructions for your users to download Ximpleware's code and incorporate it into your program. This is quite a roundabout way, and potentially a legal grey area (since I can see Ximpleware arguing that people would do this to avoid making their programs open source or paying for a commercial license, but this is probably a problem that you won't have to face unless Ximpleware finds it financially worth it to sue your company for, and even then it's a difficult case)\n\nOverall, buying a commercial license from ximplewar would be the most \"cleanest way\" to go about things, but as it stands I don't think there is anything illegal with selling your software and requiring clients to download vtd\\-xml separately",

If so if a part of the statement for the arrest warrant is proven false what are the implications? In the case of a search warrant that would mean that an argument for removing any evidence obtained under the search warrant but what does it mean if a person is arrested to be charged but part of the justification was in fact incorrect. more than a clerical error but a statement of existing evidence showing something it clearly doesn't. For example the statement says there is evidence this person was at the place at the time of the crime but the actual evidence puts the person there weeks after the crime and not at the time of the crime.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To get a warrant, there must be an affidavit. [Here](https://www.justice.gov/archive/amerithrax/docs/08-431-m-01.pdf) is an example of such affidavits, also [here](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/HP06-affidavit.pdf), and [here](https://media.nbcsandiego.com/documents/John-Jane+Doe+CP+production+-+complaint.pdf). Some general guidance on preparation of the affidavit is [here](https://nationalparalegal.edu/documentMovies/conLawCrimProc/Affid_Search_Warr/Main.pdf), which says you must \"Swear to the contents of the affidavit and sign it before the judge/magistrate\" (as we observe in the examples).\n\nIf a part of the statement for the arrest warrant is proven false, then the question would arise as to whether the person sweating knew that it was false. If he knew it was false, that constitutes perjury, which is a crime (and could invalidate the warrant, thus the evidence). If he is simply mistaken, that is not a crime, and does not invalidate the warrant.\n\nA statement that there is evidence this person was at the place at the time of the crime is not sufficient to yield a warrant, and would not be perjury (it is a conclusion based on fact: perjury pertains to statements of fact, not conclusions drawn from facts). The statement would need to say *how* it is known that the person was there. If the statement is that \"two eyewitnesses saw him\" and that is just a lie, that is perjury. If the eyewitnesses change their minds about who they saw, or if it is later found that the eyewitnesses were lying, reporting that is not a wrongful act by the officer.\n\nThe affidavit must be \"fully truthful\", and may not omit material facts. Suppose that two people claim to have seen the accused at the scene but the officer has credible evidence that they are lying, then the report must include that information (a Washington case [here](http://courts.mrsc.org/appellate/055wnapp/055wnapp0343.htm), a California case [here](http://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/57/521.html)).",

In this scenario, Officer Smith omitted material facts (that one eyewitness recanted) from the affidavit, which violates the requirement for the affidavit to be \"fully truthful\" and not omit material facts. This omission could be grounds for challenging the validity of the arrest warrant. Additionally, by knowingly providing incomplete information under oath, Officer Smith could potentially be charged with perjury. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there are indeed legal implications when an officer knowingly omits material facts from an affidavit. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the warrant isn't automatically invalidated; it would need to be challenged in court. Also, there are potential legal consequences for the officer.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while evidence suppression might be a consequence in the case of an invalid search warrant, this question deals with an arrest warrant. The primary issue here is the validity of the warrant itself and the officer's conduct, not necessarily evidence suppression."

I'm interested in case law research and the outcome of such challenages/inverse condemenation results. I tried searching and cannot find a similar situation such as this.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The situation you describe is ordinary condemnation not inverse condemnation. \n\nIf the government is actively taking legal/transactional effort to acquire the lot it is a condemnation. \n\nAn inverse condemnation is when the government takes property without court process or trying to pay for it, and you sue for compensation for the property that was taken. If the government just bulldozed a sidewalk in someone's front yard without asking, and the owner sued the government for compensation, that would be an inverse condemnation case.\n\nThe short answer is that the government has every right to condemn property adjacent to a highway for use as a sidewalk. This is a classic public purpose. \n\nGenerally, the government must first attempt to acquire the property out of court by making an offer for the land, and, if it is unsuccessful in getting the owner to accept its offer, it will bring an eminent domain action to seize the land for public purposes.\n\nIn the eminent domain case, the government will win on its right to condemn the land and to take immediate possession of it pending a determination of its value, because the government has the right to seize land to build sidewalks. Then, the rest of the eminent domain case will be over the fair market value of the land taken.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A city government plans to build a sidewalk as part of a highway improvement project. The sidewalk will partially touch a building on private property, and the city intends to acquire the entire tract/lot according to Virginia Code. The property owner refuses the city's offer to purchase the land. Which of the following best describes the legal situation and the likely outcome?\n\nA) This is an inverse condemnation case, and the property owner can successfully challenge the city's action in court to prevent the sidewalk construction.\n\nB) This is an ordinary condemnation case, and the city will likely succeed in acquiring the land through eminent domain, with the court process focusing primarily on determining fair market value.\n\nC) The property owner can successfully argue that building a sidewalk is not a valid public purpose, preventing the city from using eminent domain powers.\n\nD) The city must abandon the sidewalk project if the property owner refuses to sell, as partial use of the land for a sidewalk does not justify taking the entire tract.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario describes an ordinary condemnation case, not inverse condemnation. The city is actively seeking to acquire the property through legal means, which is characteristic of regular condemnation. Inverse condemnation occurs when the government takes property without due process or compensation.\n\nThe construction of a sidewalk as part of a highway improvement project is considered a valid public purpose, giving the government the right to use eminent domain. The city will likely succeed in acquiring the land through an eminent domain action if the property owner refuses their initial offer.\n\nIn such cases, the court typically rules in favor of the government's right to condemn the land for public use. The main focus of the legal proceedings then shifts to determining the fair market value of the property being taken.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect because they mischaracterize the nature of the case or the likely outcome based on established eminent domain principles and practices."

Let us assume she did not fear for her life, she acted only to end the assault, would that be murder, manslaughter, or simply self defense?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [colorado](/questions/tagged/colorado \"show questions tagged 'colorado'\")\n\n### Short Answer\n\nThis woman was engaged in legally permitted self\\-defense when she killed the man with a knife in the kitchen under Colorado law, and she has not committed any crime. Her conduct would also not provide a basis for a valid lawsuit for money damages against her.\n\n### Long Answer\n\n**Applicable Law**\n\nIn Colorado's state criminal code, the relevant statutory section, Colorado Revised Statutes, \u00a7 18\\-1\\-704, states, in the pertinent parts (emphasis mine):\n\n> **Use of physical force in defense of a person \\- definitions.**\n> \n> \n> (1\\) . . . a\n> person is justified *in using physical force* upon another person in\n> order to defend himself . . . and he may use a degree of force which he\n> reasonably believes to be necessary for that purpose.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) *Deadly physical force* may be used only if a person reasonably\n> believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate and: . . .\n> \n> \n> (b) The other person is using . . .\n> physical force against an occupant of a dwelling . . . while committing or attempting to commit burglary as\n> defined in sections 18\\-4\\-202 to 18\\-4\\-204; or\n> \n> \n> (c) The other person is committing or reasonably appears about to\n> commit . . . sexual assault as set forth in section 18\\-3\\-402, or in\n> section 18\\-3\\-403 as it existed prior to July 1, 2000\\.\n\nThe referenced definition of burglary as relevant to this fact pattern is that:\n\n> A person commits . . . burglary, if the person knowingly breaks an\n> entrance into, enters unlawfully in, or remains unlawfully after a\n> lawful or unlawful entry in a building or occupied structure with\n> intent to commit therein a crime against another person or property.\n\nNote also that it doesn't matter for purposes of the burglary statute, if this is her kitchen, or someone else's, so long as it is not his kitchen.\n\nAlso he need only be \"attempting to commit burglary\", so even if he was trying unsuccessfully to get into the house and assaulting her from just outside a door or window, her use of deadly force to prevent burglary would be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, if he was lawfully present in the home (perhaps a husband or roommate), the burglary justification for the use of deadly force would no longer be present.\n\nThe referenced sexual assault statute states in the pertinent part that it is committed if:\n\n> Any actor who knowingly inflicts sexual intrusion or sexual\n> penetration on a victim commits sexual assault if: The actor causes\n> submission of the victim by means of sufficient consequence reasonably\n> calculated to cause submission against the victim's will . . . \\[which\n> includes any case in which:] The actor causes submission of the victim\n> through the actual application of physical force or physical\n> violence\\[.]\n\nEven if he does not \"reasonably appears about to commit\" sexual penetration or intrusion (which are necessary for the crime to be sexual assault for purposes of the use of deadly force law in Colorado), unlawful sexual contact is a crime against a person in an occupied dwelling, so it constitutes burglary that justifies the use of deadly force, even if it doesn't constitute sexual assault.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the woman may use deadly physical force if she reasonably believes a lesser degree of force is inadequate to cause the rapist to cease committing sexual assault, *and any other crime against person or property* in the home.\n\n**Application Of Law To Facts**\n\nThere is no reasonable doubt that the man is, at a minimum, in the process of committing burglary, and very likely sexual assault as well, although the language of the question is somewhat coy on this point as relevant to the Colorado definition of sexual assault.\n\nHe has proven himself capable of physically overpowering her efforts to resist him with non\\-deadly force without success. This demonstrates that non\\-deadly force was inadequate.\n\nShe used a knife to kill him for the legally authorized purpose of ending a burglary and probably also a sexual assault.\n\nTherefore, her use of a knife to kill him is almost certain be a use of deadly force for purposes of self\\-defense which is permitted by Colorado law. As a result, she would not be legally guilty of any crime for killing him with a knife in these circumstances.\n\nIncidentally, she would also have [no civil liability in tort for money damages in this situation in Colorado](https://www.ncsl.org/civil-and-criminal-justice/self-defense-and-stand-your-ground).\n\n**Application To Other U.S. States**\n\nThe exact wording of self\\-defense statutes differ from one U.S. state to another and I don't personally know every fine statutory detail of every one of them. But, Colorado's statute is quite typical. A state where her actions did not constitute legally justified in these circumstances would be an extreme outlier in U.S. law. I would be surprised if there was any U.S. state in which her actions would not constitute legally justified self\\-defense.\n\n**Historical Note**\n\nSuppose that the man in the question were the woman's husband in their own home where they were both lawfully present.\n\n> Prior to the 1970s, marital rape was legal in every US state. It was\n> partially outlawed in Michigan and Delaware in 1974, then wholly\n> outlawed in South Dakota and Nebraska in 1975\\. The court case *Oregon\n> v. Rideout* in 1978 was the first in which someone stood trial for\n> raping his spouse while they lived together. By 1993 marital rape was\n> a crime nationwide.\n\n([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape_in_the_United_States))\n\nUnder current U.S. law in every U.S. state, the sexual assault justification analysis would be no different because there is no marital immunity for the crimes of sexual assault, although the burglary justification would no longer be present, so an intent to commit unlawful sexual contact without penetration or intrusion would not justify the use of deadly force.\n\nBut, when marital immunity to sexual assault was part of the law, as it was in every U.S. state prior to 1974, and as it was in some U.S. states until 1993, she would be guilty of second degree murder or manslaughter.\n\nThe distinction between second degree murder and manslaughter in that case would hinge upon whether she had an intent to kill or only intended to harm (as in [a case cited by Jen in her answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/92909/9517)). Also, she would have a good argument for manslaughter due to provocation by the victim that was not sufficient to justify the use of deadly force, even if jury concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that she did intent to kill him.\n\nColorado's self\\-defense statute (in a subsection omitted because it was not applicable to the facts in the question) also permits the grade of a criminal offense caused in the course of conduct intended as self\\-defense that does not meet the statutory standards for self\\-defense (e.g. because non\\-deadly force would have been sufficient) to downgrade the severity of the offense for which the person may be convicted, in a manner similar to the \"heat of passion\" defense.\n\nBut, these facts present no plausible justification for a first degree murder, which is often a charge punishable by death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole, since it was not premeditated or committed in connection with a crime by the perpetrator.\n\nRealistically, under the circumstances of the question, if he was her husband and they were in their own home, during a time frame when there was marital immunity from sexual assault charges, she would most likely be convicted of manslaughter under these circumstances.\n\n**Side Observation**\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has held in *Kennedy v. Louisiana*, 554 U.S. 407 (2008\\) that the 8th Amendment to the United States Constitution, directly and as incorporated against the states under the 14th Amendment, prohibits the imposition of the death penalty for a rape not resulting in death (even the rape of a child).\n\nThe death penalty has been unconstitutional in cases involving the rape of an adult woman in the U.S. since U.S. Supreme Court case of *Coker v. Georgia*, 433 U.S. 584 (1977\\).\n\nThere are many serious felonies (including some omitted from the Colorado statute above because they were not applicable to this fact pattern) for which the use of deadly force in self\\-defense is authorized even though the U.S. Constitution prohibits the use of the death penalty upon a conviction of that offense which does not result in someone dying.",

The attacker is using physical force against an occupant of a dwelling while committing or attempting to commit burglary.\n2. The attacker is committing or reasonably appears about to commit sexual assault.\n\nOption A is incorrect because fear for one's life is not explicitly required by the statute.

The SIPC's authority to take action is triggered by information from certain sources suggesting that a securities industry firm is insolvent.\n\nThere are similar laws and agencies addressing insolvent savings and loan institutions, and insolvent defined benefit pension plans.\n\nIn general, there are not similar agencies addressing insolvency by insurance companies (which is why some business contracts require insurance companies used to fulfill covenants in the contract to have a certain minimum credit rating), or most kinds of mutual companies (i.e. consumer owned companies) which have a history pre\\-FDIC of having very low insolvency rates because they aren't incentivized to leverage themselves in the same way.\n\nThe SIPA was in many ways prescient. Securities firms didn't go bankrupt in large numbers until the 2007\\-2008 financial crisis when many brokerage and investment banking firms converted themselves from being owned by the managing partners of those firms to being owned by third\\-party investors.

The comparisons they used were nothing like our home and were not in our subdivision, and the homes he did use to make their assessment were near a trailer park. We had our realtor do a market analysis for us and by his estimation, the home is worth $120,000 over what they quoted. We filed an appeal but were wondering what to do if they deny our request. Can I hire a real\\-estate lawyer and fight their appraised amount?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is possible. Your basis for legal action would be the [Homeowner's Protection Act](https://ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/manuals-guides/federal-consumer-financial-protection-guide/compliance-management/lending-regulations/homeowners-protection-act-pmi-cancellation-act), [12 USC Ch. 49](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/chapter-49), which requires removing the PMI requirement in circumstances that relate to the 80% interest threshold. The specific requirements are in [\u00a74902](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/4902). One of the triggers is the [\"cancellation date\"](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/4901), which relates to the initial amortization schedule, basically the day when by making regular payments the loan is reduced to 80% of the initial value (not the loan amount). This completely ignores later appraisals, though the bank can require proof that the value of the property has not declined (and that evidence is \"of a type established in advance and made known to the mortgagor by the servicer promptly upon receipt of a request under paragraph (1\\))\"). The law excludes inflationary changes in equity, where e.g. one has an initial 5% interest that swells to a 20% interest over a few years because of inflation. Refinancing is always a legal option, but maybe not the ideal financial choice depending on interest rate differences and refinancing costs.\n\nIf this is about Canada, there may be different laws.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the homeowner's options under the Homeowners Protection Act?\n\nA) The homeowner can immediately sue the bank for using inappropriate comparisons in their appraisal.\nB) The homeowner has no recourse if the bank's appraisal is lower than expected, as the bank has sole discretion in determining property value.\nC) The homeowner can request PMI removal based on the original amortization schedule when the loan balance reaches 80% of the initial property value, regardless of current appraisals.\nD) The homeowner must refinance their mortgage to remove PMI if they disagree with the bank's appraisal.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Homeowners Protection Act provides for automatic termination of PMI based on the original amortization schedule, specifically when the loan balance reaches 80% of the initial property value. This is referred to as the \"cancellation date\" in the Act. This provision operates independently of current appraisals or market value fluctuations. While the bank can require proof that the property value hasn't declined, they cannot prevent PMI removal based solely on a new, lower appraisal if the loan has reached the 80% threshold according to the original schedule. Options A and B are incorrect as they misstate the legal situation. Option D is not necessarily true, as refinancing is an option but not the only or required method to remove PMI under the Act."

According to the information provided, attorneys are generally not placed under oath during court proceedings, and their statements are not considered evidence. However, in situations where an attorney has personal knowledge of facts relevant to the case, they may be competent to present actual evidence. In such cases, the attorney would need to be sworn in as a witness and would be subject to cross-examination.\n\nHowever, this creates a conflict with their role as the client's legal representative. The Model Rule 3.7 mentioned in the passage suggests that an attorney who becomes a witness would likely be disqualified from acting as an attorney in the same case. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action would be for the attorney to withdraw from representing the client, be sworn in as a witness to provide their testimony, and allow another attorney to take over the client's representation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because simply swearing in the attorney mid-proceedings without addressing the conflict of roles is not appropriate.\nOption B is partially correct in that the attorney's statements are not evidence, but it doesn't address the fact that the attorney has relevant information that could be properly presented as evidence.\nOption D is incorrect because attorneys are not subject to cross-examination regarding their statements made as legal representatives."

Checking the label on the packet it was obvious how, it was declared at only a fraction of the value I had paid. Do I have any legal obligation to report this to customs or is this entirely on the sender? It is already in the tags, but to be sure: This is **Switzerland**.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Swiss customs has a form to submit questions like this and they gave me a very informative answer. As it turns out the receiver is also part of the customs process. If for some reason customs decides to open an investigation assuming that something regarding declaration/import was wrong the receiver will also be part of the investigation and it is possible that they determine that the receiver is at fault as well. In this case in addition to the import fee additional fines or fees might be imposed on the receiver. I do not know how they determine this, but from a law perspective it is clear.\n\nThere is always the option to just report a wrong declaration upon receiving the package which means you have to pay the import fee, but no other fines, fees or investigations will include the receiver (assuming the goods involved can be imported legally).\n\nThe legal part points towards (this part sadly does not exist in English): [Zollschuldner Art. 70 Zollgesetz](https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20030370/index.html#a70) (specifically section 70 (2\\) c.).

If an investigation is opened due to a wrong declaration, the receiver can be held partially responsible. To avoid potential fines or fees, the resident should report the wrong declaration upon receiving the package. This allows them to pay the correct import fee without facing additional penalties or investigations.

What typically tends to come up as the subject of dispute is rooted in the urban legend that one cannot obtain a patent (utility) on software. This is substantially incorrect, and any patent attorney asserting to the veracity of this makes a substantially false conclusory statement of law knowingly and willfully controverting the actual state of law in, at least, all Western jurisdictions as it omits to assert to the fact that one is not barred to obtain a patent on any system that comprises of non\\-obvious software, and hardware to run on is entitled to a patent \u2014 except in the U.S. where one must also comply with the *Alice* decision requiring that at least one hardware component in addition to the hardware of a generic computer be necessary for the utility of the system. However, in the U.S., one may obtain a software\\-centered patent through a (i) method or (ii) a computer program product in addition to (iii) systems or apparatuses which are available avenues for patents everywhere else.\n\nWhen disputes around IP and software come up, this is typically at the crux of the debate: May one obtain a software patent? The answer is: One is not barred merely because the non\\-obvious aspect of an invention is software. For example, if one uses hardware that are prior art, in fact, patented to someone else, but by the use of software a system, method and/or computer program product achieves a different objective (since utility patents, axiomatically, must have a utility objective) one may obtain a patent, and a layman may very well consider their invention of the system as that particular component that appears to them as having required any inventive steps, encompasses the inventive novelty (understandably) which, in many cases may be software.\n\nSo the advice from a patent attorney that \u201cyou can\u2019t patent software\u201d is simply malicious (or wide and far disbarringly incompetent).\n\nOne may patent software so long as it is an invention, and the administrative (or at times judicial) process requirements are complied with.\n\nNevertheless, since the question inquired about \u201cIP\u201d, below is the answer to other avenues of intellectual property.\n\n**Copyrights**\n\nThe software code written to make this operable could be the subject of copyright as long as it is not substantially identical with another solution (or such to give reasons to believe it to be a derivative thereof) that also put buttons in the four corners.\n\nThe visual design may possibly also enjoy copyright protection, but that is less plausible to imagine since not only the copyrighted work of art is protected, but anything that may objectively be deemed a derivative work (regardless of whether the \u201cre\\-author\u201d actually knew about the copyrighted material that it may be deemed the derivate of).\n\n**Design patents**\n\nIt is possible that one could get design patents for the actual graphical design of the layout provided there isn\u2019t something substantially similar already out there protected by a design patent.\n\n**Utility patents**\n\nThis would most certainly not overcome obviousness, that is, the requirement for one to obtain a patent which needs that a presented invention not be obvious for anyone \u201cwith ordinary skill in the art\u201d (an ordinarily knowledgable person in the field of the specific area of tech).\n\n**Trademark**\n\nI have a hard time stretching my imagination to see how this could be applicable.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In California, a resident notices their neighbor has installed a camera that points directly at their apartment door and can see inside their apartment through a window. Which of the following legal actions would be most appropriate and potentially successful for addressing this situation?\n\nA) File a lawsuit against the neighbor for invasion of privacy\nB) Contact local law enforcement to have the camera removed\nC) Seek a restraining order under California's civil stalking laws\nD) Install their own camera pointing at the neighbor's apartment\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) While privacy concerns are valid, filing a lawsuit for invasion of privacy may not be successful as the camera is installed in a common area and not directly in the resident's private space.\n\nB) Local law enforcement likely cannot force the removal of the camera if it's on the neighbor's property or in a common area, as its installation is probably legal.\n\nC) This is the most appropriate action. California's civil stalking laws could potentially be applied in this situation, allowing the resident to seek a restraining order that prohibits the neighbor from monitoring their front door. This approach addresses the specific concern without immediately escalating to more severe legal action.\n\nD) Installing a counter-surveillance camera would likely escalate the situation and could potentially lead to legal issues for the resident themselves.\n\nThe correct answer, C, provides a legal recourse that directly addresses the resident's concerns about being monitored, utilizing existing California laws that are designed to protect individuals from unwanted surveillance or harassment."

It looks God\\-awful now.\n\nIs this legal? What can the property management company and/or the property owner do about this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question is if a renter can significantly alter the property or the property's appearance \\- in this case the exterior with the signs. I doubt the fact that the alterations are signage is really significant; unless they are stolen, or they cause someone to make a wrong turn into the corner of the building. :)\n\nIt's probably in the lease that a renter can't make significant changes to the property's appearance without permission from the property owner or management; i.e. many leases don't allow you to repaint rooms, put in new carpet, etc. without permission from the landlord.\n\nBut, it all depends on the lease. If you both have the same property management company, see what is in your lease about property alterations.\n\nEvery lease I have ever seen (and most of the free template lease forms on the web have) had a clause stating that making unauthorized changes to the property is not permitted, along with the possible penalties, like paying for the damages, losing a deposit, even eviction.\n\nThe fact that you're in CA really doesn't matter when it comes to the lease; damage clauses, though pretty much universal, are by choice of the landlord. (As an aside, CA does have statewide laws about lead paint, for one example, that are required to be disclosed in leases.)\n\n> Is this legal?\n\nThis depends on the lease, as above.\n\n> What can the property management company and/or the property owner do\n>  about this?\n\nThat's up to them, but a possibility is for someone to call the property manager and let them know what's happening.",

The legality and potential consequences of the tenant's actions primarily depend on the terms outlined in the lease agreement. Most lease agreements include clauses that prohibit tenants from making unauthorized alterations to the property, including changes to its appearance. The property owner or management company's ability to take action (such as requiring removal, charging for damages, or even pursuing eviction) would be based on these lease terms. While local regulations might play a role, the lease agreement is the primary document governing such situations. Options A and B are incorrect because they oversimplify the issue and ignore the importance of the lease agreement. Option D is incorrect because there is no mention of a specific California law prohibiting road sign installation on residential properties in this context."

A US visa stamp is only required for entering the United States. As long as the wife maintains her legal status within the US (which is done through the I-539 extension), she does not need to get a new visa stamp in her passport.

It states that:\n\n> The Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.\n\nThis might be read as immediately applying by its own force to render laws inconsistent with the *Charter* to be void. And language to this effect has been even used by the Court, saying that a provision inconsistent with the Constitution is \"invalid from the moment it is enacted\" (e.g. *Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Martin; Nova Scotia (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Laseur*, [2003 SCC 54](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/2088/index.do)). But for Section 52 to have effect \"requires the exercise of judicial power to declare the law to be unconstitutional\" (*R. v. Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://decisions.scc-csc.ca/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/19390/index.do) at para. 54\\). That a law is inconsistent with the Constitution is \"revealed through litigation, specifically the judgment that declares the inoperability of the impugned law\" (*Sullivan* at para. 55\\). Section 52 has no practical effect aside from Courts or other decision\\-makers declining to apply law that is inconsistent with the Constitution. Whether a law was void as soon as the *Charter* was enacted is not really a meaningful question nor even detectable until a Court declares the law to be invalid.\n\nThe Court has also clarified that declarations of invalidity are not necessarily retroactive to the moment of enactment (internal citations removed):\n\n> \\[60] ... Mr. Sullivan points to the idea that an unconstitutional law is invalid from the moment it is enacted. But the strict enforcement of such a principle \u201ccannot easily be reconciled with modern constitutional law\u201d. Instead, it is subject to a number of exceptions and s. 52(1\\) must be read \u201cin light of all constitutional principles\u201d. In *Albashir*, my colleague Karakatsanis J. explained that declarations of unconstitutionality are generally retrospective, consistent with the notion that a law is unconstitutional from its enactment. However, other constitutional principles may require a purely prospective declaration of unconstitutionality or a suspended declaration. Similarly, the legal effect of a s. 52(1\\) declaration by a superior court must be defined with reference to constitutional supremacy, the rule of law, and federalism.\n\nI'll say this one more way: while it's true that some laws were immediately inconsistent with the *Charter*, s. 52(1\\) did not have any observable effect until a court declared such laws to be invalid.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court of Canada's interpretation of section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding laws that were inconsistent with the Charter when it came into effect?\n\nA) Such laws were automatically void and unenforceable from the moment the Charter came into effect.\n\nB) Such laws remained in effect until a court explicitly declared them invalid.\n\nC) Such laws were immediately suspended pending judicial review.\n\nD) Such laws were retroactively invalidated once the Charter came into effect, without need for court intervention.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. While section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 states that laws inconsistent with the Constitution are \"of no force or effect,\" the Supreme Court has clarified that this provision requires judicial intervention to have practical effect. As stated in R. v. Sullivan (2022 SCC 19), the inconsistency of a law with the Constitution is \"revealed through litigation, specifically the judgment that declares the inoperability of the impugned law.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because, although some language used by the Court suggests laws could be \"invalid from the moment of enactment,\" the practical application of section 52(1) requires judicial declaration.\n\nOption C is incorrect as there is no automatic suspension of potentially inconsistent laws pending review.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while declarations of invalidity can sometimes be retroactive, this is not automatic and requires court intervention. Moreover, the Court has clarified that declarations of invalidity are not necessarily retroactive to the moment of enactment.\n\nThe key point is that while laws may have been theoretically inconsistent with the Charter upon its enactment, the practical effect of section 52(1) only manifests through court declarations of invalidity."

According to the information provided, visitors to pornographic websites are not legally obligated to take specific action when recognizing potentially non-consensual content. The responsibility primarily falls on the uploader and the video platform. In Germany, website owners/operators are required to remove content that contains criminal activity (\u00a7 10 TMG), but this obligation does not extend to viewers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no mentioned legal requirement for visitors to report suspected non-consensual content.\n\nOption C is incorrect because accidentally viewing such content is not illegal, especially since viewers cannot know for certain whether the participants have consented to the upload.\n\nOption D is overly restrictive and not supported by the given information. Viewers are not required to actively avoid specific categories of content to remain legally compliant.\n\nThe key point is that visitors are generally not held legally responsible for content they view, particularly when they cannot verify consent or legality. The legal focus is more on the production, distribution, and hosting of such content."

This retention period applies even if the records contain sensitive personal information of former employees, such as bank account details and addresses. The law takes precedence over general GDPR principles in this case, giving companies a legal basis for retaining such data beyond the period of employment.\n\nOption A (1 year) and B (2 years) are incorrect as they are too short and do not meet the legal requirement. Option D (6 years) is the retention period for public companies under the same act, but is longer than necessary for private companies in this context."
