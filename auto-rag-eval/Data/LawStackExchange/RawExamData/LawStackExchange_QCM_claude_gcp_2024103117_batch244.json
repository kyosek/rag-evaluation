Even though the car was previously declared a total loss, the at-fault driver is still liable for the damage they caused to the mirror. The overall condition of the car does not negate the value of individual parts that were in good condition before the accident. The owner can file a claim for the full replacement cost of the mirror against the at-fault driver's insurance, as the mirror had value and was damaged due to the other driver's negligence.

The police officer can attempt to persuade the doctor but lacks the legal authority to enforce such a demand across state lines. Only courts have the power to order licensed medical practitioners to refrain from writing legal prescriptions, and even then, courts in one state don't have jurisdiction over actions in another state.

There\nare many cases in the current system where defendants don't even try to give an alibi and this often puts\na wasteful burden on investigators. Are there any such candidate justice systems in other countries? or\nam I missing something that makes such a system impossible?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThe \"right to remain silent \" is a feature of US law, inherited, like much of the basic structure of US law, from the British law of the late 1700s. The right is also retained in modern UK law, in a somewhat different form.\n\nThe laws of many countries that do not inherit their legal system from the English/British source do not include the right. For example, the legal system of France does not. Such a system is clearly possible and need not be an arrant tyranny. Whether such a right improves the justice and fairness of the system could be debated, but it is not essential.\n\nNote that it is not the case that a jury must pretend that a defendant would have testified in accord with a defense lawyer's opening statement. Indeed the jury is routinely told that opening statements are not evidence and should not be regarded as such. But a US jury is instructed that it should not draw any inference or conclusion of guilt because a defendant remains silent. A defendant is entitled, by remaining silent to in effect say to the state \"Prove it!\" and need not offer a competing version of the events of the alleged crime. In UK law, an accused person's failure to deny the crime may be considered at the trial.\n\nHistorical origin\n-----------------\n\nThe right arose as a reaction against certain specific practices considered to be abusive and unfair. In several English courts, particularly the [Court of the Star Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Chamber), the practice arose of compelling suspected persons to attend and asking them under oath if they had commuted various illegal acts. If such a suspect had in fact committed the act asked about, then the suspect had the choice of confessing to a criminal act that carried a severe penalty (often death), or committing perjury, which was both a criminal act and was widely believed to be a grave sin, possibly condemning a person's soul to hell. Or if the accused remained silent, a serious punishment for contempt of court could be imposed, and that might be treated as evidence of guilt.\n\nThese practices contributed to the abolition of the Star Chamber court in 1641\\. The right to silence seems to have been established in English law after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, as described in the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_silence#History), although it was not fully established until well into the 18th century.\n\nCurrent US Practice\n-------------------\n\nThe right in the US not only applies during a trial for the protection of the accused.\n\nThe right permits a person being questioned by the police to refuse to answer questions, with the assurance that such refusal may not later be used in court to help convict the suspect. Many lawyers advise anyone questioned by the police who are or might be under suspicion to refuse to answer any questions at all.\n\nThe right also means that a witness who is not a defendant may not, in a criminal or civil trial, be required to answer a question if the answer might later be used to help convict that person of a crime.\n\nThere are other implications of the right, and the details are too long to go into in this answer \u2013 whole books have been written about the right and what it does and does not cover, and the reasons behind it.\n\nThe general principle may be taken to be that when the government accuses a person of crime, it must undertake to prove the crime by its own resources, not compel the accused to assist in the process.\n\nA system in which an accused is required to respond to specific questions can be imagined. To some extent it has existed at various times and places. It need not involve torture or coerced confession, but could require an accused, during a trial, to respond to specific questions. It would violate the principle that the state must make its case without help from the accused. The value of that principle can be debated.\n\nOther Legal systems\n-------------------\n\nIn the article [\"French Criminal Procedures\u2014Surprising Features of a French Trial](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/insight-french-criminal-procedures-surprising-features-of-a-french-trial) from Bloomberg, it is said that:\n\n> **The \u201cright to silence\u201d is limited.** During a trial, the judges usually turn to the defendant and ask for the defendant\u2019s response to the evidence in the record.

In contrast, the French system has a more limited right to silence. During a French trial, judges typically ask defendants to respond to evidence, and a refusal to respond can lead to a strong inference of guilt.

Madison established the practice of Judicial review in the United States, though the principle existed before the case. This gave the Supreme Court power to invalidate laws, or portions of laws, that it found unconstitutional. By the same token, it limited the Supreme Court to a court of appeals with respect to [writs of mandamus](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1789-1850/5us137) and not as a court with original jurisdiction on the matter.\n\nMarbury v. Madison, like any other Supreme Court case, is subject to being overturned either by the Supreme Court, or by amendment to the constitution. If this were to happen, that means the Judicial Act of 1789 regains full force of the law, and presumably the power to issue writs of Mandamus with original jurisdiction. But there is another part of the case that led me to ask this question...\n\nQuestion\n========\n\nIf Marbury v Madison was overturned, thereby reinstating in full the Judicial Act of 1789, does this also mean that the Surpeme Court loses the power of Judicial review? And, if so, does this loss of power apply to all cases where it has been applied?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Marbury V. Madison* did not establish judicial review. It was simply the first case where that power was used. It was clearly spelled out in [**The Federalist** \\#78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._78) that this power would exist in the new constitution, and those who voted to ratify it understood, or should have understood, that it would exist.\n\nAll that *Marbury V. Madison* decided was that the Supreme court did not have original jurisdiction to issue Writs of *Mandamus* That could be overturned, or the constitution could be amended to grant such jurisdiction to SCOTUS. That would not have any major effects on the US judicial system as far as I can tell.\n\nI suppose that the constitution could be amended so as to deny the power of judicial review to the courts. But I think the resulting system would be potentially unstable, and this would require a far more fundamental change than simply \"overruling *Marbury V. Madison*\"\n\nAs \\#78 of *The Federalist* said:\n\n> By a limited Constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex\\-post\\-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, **whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void.** Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing. (*emphasis added*)\n> \n> \n> The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. A constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law.

Off.\" or the letter R enclosed within a circle, thus \u00ae; and in any suit for infringement under this chapter by such a registrant failing to give such notice of registration, no profits and no damages shall be recovered under the provisions of this chapter unless the defendant had actual notice of the registration.\n\nNotice that display of the symbol is optional, the registrant \"**may** give notice\" by using the phrase or the \u00ae symbol. But if such notice is not given a significant element of damages in case of an infringement is forfeit unless the infringer had \"actual notice\" of the registration of the mark.\n\nSince the purpose is to give notice that a word, symbol, logo or other indication is in fact a registered mark, making the registration so small that it cannot easily be seen might tend to defeat that purpose. If an infringer claimed not to be aware that an indication was a registered mark, and if the notice was displayed or printed in so small a form that this claim was plausible, it **might** raise an issue in an infringement suit.

Don't criminal cases vary significantly in complexity? How is this addressed with respect to public defender compensation?\n\n(1\\) as opposed to \"per defendant\", but that's besides the point.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer depends on the jurisdiction, the court, and how the public defender system is set up. This answer addresses state court indigent defense at the trial level.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, state courts are organized by counties. In many of these counties, particularly larger and urban counties, public defenders are a department of county government (like the district attorneys who prosecute, or public works, or the tax assessor). These defenders are county employees, and paid a wage. They are not compensated \"by the case.\"\n\nIn other jurisdictions, there may be no county\\-level public defenders. Courts there will appoint private attorneys to defend indigent defendants, and will compensate the defenders pursuant to a fee schedule promulgated by the court, or the judge's whim. The fee schedule may be time\\-based or flat fee, and usually provides differentials for type of case, amount of time required, investigative and witness fees, and often allows the lawyer to seek additional compensation if the lawyer thinks it's warranted. The court may decline the lawyer's motion, of course, at the risk that the lawyer won't take future appointments, a serious difficulty for the court which must, under the law, provide counsel for indigent defendants who face incarceration.\n\nMore than this, it's tough to generalize. The setup in Los Angeles County, California, for instance, will be different than the experience in Alliance, NE, or a small county in another state.\n\nThe same challenges face the federal courts. I'm only familiar with the California federal courts at the trial level, where a parallel system applies, with defenders on salary and employed by the federal government.\n\nWhile some states provide representation on appeal using defenders employed by the state government, other states rely on individual lawyers being appointed, rather like the trial\\-level system.\n\nSource: I'm a prior county public defender and private attorney in California.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of public defender compensation systems in the United States, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) All public defenders are paid on a per-case basis, regardless of the jurisdiction or court level.\n\nB) Federal public defenders are always compensated differently than state-level public defenders.\n\nC) Public defender compensation methods can vary significantly depending on factors such as jurisdiction, court level, and local government structure.\n\nD) Urban counties always use salaried public defenders, while rural areas exclusively use appointed private attorneys paid per case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

I find *proper means* to be a bit vague here. Take the following scenario;\n\nIn my country (Norway), it is illegal to cut power to someone who isn't paying their electrical bills if a resident is a minor.\n\nIn a minor\\-free residence, a company making the threat \"if you don't pay up, we will cut your power\", satisfies (a) and (b). However, if they make the same threat to a residence that houses a minor, (a) is still satisfied. As for (b), I am not quite sure; is threatening to do something illegal an \"improper\" way of inforcing the demand? It wouldn't surprise me, but I interpreted \"proper\" more to mean, \"the thing you're threatening to do is the best way of maximizing the likelihood that you get what you want\". If this interpretation is correct, then it would be improper for the company to orally deliver the threat to a resident that is blind, deaf and at the moment of deliverance, without other people to relay the message. It is improper, because the use of the menaces weren't the best way; heck, not a way at all; to inforce the demand.\n\nHowever, maybe legality is a criterium for the use of menaces to be proper? A threat requires there to be the promise of a harm or loss to a person or their property. However, when the person fail to pay the electrical bills, the electricity running to their house is no longer their property. So, when the company says they'll cut the power to this minor\\-housing residence, they aren't threatening them (since they don't own the electricity anymore), but they are saying that they'll do something illegal. Does the fact that the act of which they're saying they'll do is illegal, make their speech constitute threats, and thus their act constitute extortion?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Washington state, the term \"threat\" is [defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.110) as follows:\n\n> \"Threat\" means to communicate, directly or indirectly the intent: (a)\n> To cause bodily injury in the future to the person threatened or to\n> any other person; or (b) To cause physical damage to the property of a\n> person other than the actor; or (c) To subject the person threatened\n> or any other person to physical confinement or restraint; or (d) To\n> accuse any person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be\n> instituted against any person; or (e) To expose a secret or publicize\n> an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject any person\n> to hatred, contempt, or ridicule; or (f) To reveal any information\n> sought to be concealed by the person threatened; or (g) To testify or\n> provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect\n> to another's legal claim or defense; or (h) To take wrongful action as\n> an official against anyone or anything, or wrongfully withhold\n> official action, or cause such action or withholding; or (i) To bring\n> about or continue a strike, boycott, or other similar collective\n> action to obtain property which is not demanded or received for the\n> benefit of the group which the actor purports to represent; or (j) To\n> do any other act which is intended to harm substantially the person\n> threatened or another with respect to his or her health, safety,\n> business, financial condition, or personal relationships;\n\nHowever, the illegality of a \"threat\" comes from specific statutes declaring a particular type of threat to be illegal, and a statute may require a narrower set of conditions, for instance [RCW 9\\.61\\.160](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.61.160) which is a class B felony (second most severe degree) requires that a person specifically threaten to\n\n> bomb or otherwise injure any public or private school building, any\n> place of worship or public assembly, any governmental property, or any\n> other building, common carrier, or structure, or any place used for\n> human occupancy...\n\nA misdemeanor variety of threatening (legally subsumed under the rubric [\"harrassment\"](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.46.020)) if you knowingly and without lawful authority threaten\n\n> (i) To cause bodily injury immediately or in the future to the person\n> threatened or to any other person; or (ii) To cause physical damage to\n> the property of a person other than the actor; or (iii) To subject the\n> person threatened or any other person to physical confinement or\n> restraint; or (iv) Maliciously to do any other act which is intended\n> to substantially harm the person threatened or another with respect to\n> his or her physical or mental health or safety\n\nAs it happens, in Seattle, it was until the end of February to evict a tenant for non\\-payment of rent: but it was not illegal to communicate an intent to evict (it was simply legally futile to do so). Such a communication doesn't fall within the scope of harrassment\\-type threats because it does not damage person or property, or to confine a person. A fanciful interpretation of clause (iv) is precluded because the \"threat\" must be \"malicious\", which by definition\n\n> import\\[s] an evil intent, wish, or design to vex, annoy, or injure\n> another person.

This seems to be different from how other laws are modified, where bills propose to modify the text of existing laws. Is there a legal or historical reason for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best explanation is \"tradition\", followed by \"Congress does *not* actually rewrite laws\" (it passes laws whose effect changes what counts as the law). Traditionally, Congress would enact some law, then it could later enact a law which effectively modifies existing laws. That modification could be implicit, by stating a new legal fact, which \"corrects\" some earlier legal fact. For instance, the [6th Congress](https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwsllink.html) enacted a law (session I, p. 4: Ch. III in second volume) entitled \"An Act supplementary to the act, intituled 'An Act to provide for the valuation of Lands and Dwelling Houses, and the enumeration of slaves, within the United States'\", which was enacted by the 5th Congress Ch. LXIX, p. 580\\. The amendment added a power to the commissioners created by the first act \"to revise, adjust and vary valuations\". This is done by simply stating a new power, and does not require re\\-writing the entire earlier text \u2013 it was understood that the new act \"overrides\" the old act.\n\nContemporary statutory practice (as opposed to constitutional practice) is that congressional acts which revise older laws will state, in some fashion, how the previous law should be edited. Officially speaking, the law \"is\" the historical sequence of acts of Congress and therefore Congress does not actually rewrite laws (except on some occasions where it does).\n\nAn example of an editing instruction enacted by Congress is an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act which states that\n\n> (n) IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT.\u2014 (1\\) Section 411(b) of the\n> Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1521(b)) is amended by\n> striking \"and under the general policy guidance of the United States\n> Coordinator for Refugee Affairs (hereinafter in this chapter referred\n> to as the 'Coordinator')\" and inserting \"the Secretary of State\".\n\nIt is very difficult to keep track of the hundred of thousands of acts of Congress making up the Statutes at Large, therefore we also have the US Code system which effectuates the various historical changes. For the most part, the codified (re\\-written) laws accurately reflect the complex sequence of statutes passed by Congress. though there was a whoops\\-moment when\nThe Act of Sept. 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 753 [\u00a792](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/92) was omitted from inclusion of the US Code because it was mistakenly thought that that section had been repealed ([sorted out](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/508/439/) in 1993\\).\n\nGiven how few and how autonomous the amendments to the US Constitution have been, there is no compelling need to adopt a \"wholesale rewrite\" model of amendments for the Constitution, though the election of POTUS is one area where it might make sense to delete previous text (still, it's not difficult to read the whole document, as opposed to reading the entirety of the Statutes at Large).\n\nA wholesale rewriting of the US Constitution *is* possible, and [happened in 1787](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation).

As such I'm not demanding a perfectly definitive answer, I suspect there is no absolute answer, I'm more asking to better understand how choice of law decisions are made by applying a very specific use case I have run into not trying to get legal advice on rather or not to use such contracts.\n\nI already asked, and got a pretty good answer, on the generalities of how choice of law are applied [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77757/if-one-state-respects-a-contract-and-another-doesnt-how-do-we-know-if-it-will-b/77763#77763). I think I understand the generalities, but I'm not sure which state has the more substantial claim in case of child support and what constitutes a 'public policy' strong enough for a forum state to refuse to respect the other states precedent.\n\nSo to give context known sperm donors are a thing, where a man agrees to donate sperm to a women without involving a doctor, to cut down on the extensive cost of doctor involvement. Generally it's agreed that a women will give up any claim to child support, and the donor give up on visitation rights, as part of this agreement. However, this will not always be supported by state law. In California donor contracts are fully supported, and there are a few states that explicitly do not support these contracts, the general claim is usually that a parent cannot sign away the child's rights to financial support or visitation, and the vast majority of states don't have any precedent either way. Given this the general advice given is usually that recipients should always get contracts 'just in case', and that donors should always understand that there is no guarantee such a contract will provide any legal protection, unless they all happen to live in CA obviously.\n\nGiven all that It makes me curious what happens if one person were lived in CA, the only state that definitely supports these contracts, and another person lived in a state that explicitly does not support these contracts what will happen? Can the people signing the contract simply say \"CA law applies\" and be certain their covered? Or is it possible that if the case is brought in the other state that state will refuse to respect this because they consider the signing away of child support to be violating it's public policy.\n\nTo further complicate things while it's possible to sign a contract in person and do the donation the same way it's also possible for donor sperm to be shipped across state lines, meaning that there may not be any clear answer as to where the contract was sign or the donation took place since both acts happened across state lines.\n\nSo, what is the probability that one could ensure CA law applies under these sort of circumstances? and if someone didn't explicitly state what state's laws should apply how would they decide which state's laws should apply?\n\nIf one person lived in a state without clear precedent and another in a state with a clear precedent would the fact that one state's laws are more explicit be a factor in deciding who should handle the dispute?\n\nI'm mostly asking about child support being signed away, as claims against donors for child support are far more common then donors trying to force visitation, sometimes states will even force recipients who didn't want to claim child support to do so before they can get other forms of disability/welfare. Still I am curious if the rules would be any different for a dispute over visitation then for child support.\n\nI'm also assuming the sperm donation was through artificial insemination done at home. As I understand it if the women gets pregnant by sex then it doesn't matter what contract you sign the donor is the legal father.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the law\n---------------------\n\nLet\u2019s assume there is a valid contract with a choice of law clause nominating CA. In a CA court, that contract would be enforceable.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that there is another state, XE, with some connection to the contract such that a court in XE decides it has jurisdiction.

There is a question over at [Travel Stack Exchange](https://travel.stackexchange.com) that makes it clear that some Schengen countries do not stamp the documents of third\\-country nationals who have a residence permit from a Schengen country: [Which Schengen countries don't stamp passports of ordinary residence permit holders?](https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/157743/19400)\n\nThe stamping requirement is stated thus:\n\n> 1. The travel documents of third\\-country nationals shall be systematically stamped on entry and exit. In particular an entry or exit stamp shall be affixed to:\n> \n> \n> (a) the documents, bearing a valid visa, enabling third\\-country nationals to cross the border;\n> \n> \n> (b) the documents enabling third\\-country nationals to whom a visa is issued at the border by a Member State to cross the border;\n> \n> \n> (c) the documents enabling third\\-country nationals not subject to a visa requirement to cross the border.\n\n(There are some additional provisions that do not apply to the hypothetical circumstances under discussion contained in 11(2\\) through 11(5\\). I would note that a \"residence permit\" is distinct for these purposes from the \"residence card\" provided for in the free movement directive [2004/38/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02004L0038-20110616).)\n\nIt is perhaps to be argued that \"third\\-country nationals not subject to a visa requirement\" includes residence permit holders who would need a visa if they didn't have a residence permit, but let us assume for the sake of argument that it does not. In that case, none of the examples enumerated in 11(1\\) covers those people. But none of the subsequent exceptions covers them either. It would seem therefore that the general requirement established in the first sentence of 11(1\\) should apply to them.\n\nSome countries appear to have concluded the contrary: that because such people are not covered by the \"in particular\" list in 11(1\\), their passports do not need to be stamped.

On the contrary, travel documents of third\\-country citizens shall always be stamped as long as it is technically possible (maybe even on a separate paper given by border guards like visa is special cases).\n\nBtw. At Madrid Barajas airport, they stamp even passport of EU citizens. Once we entered via Madrid Barajas with a group of 20 of reduced mobility with assistance (my wife injured her leg). They took passports of the whole group, my wife gave them new passport, old passport, residence card (Article 10 EU 2004/38/EC) in a passport format. Eventually, she got stamps in all 3 documents. Meaning that they did not even count number of \"passports\" and people and they did not care that my wife and me were exempt of stamps.

As the user is choosing to send me an email, do I need to state anything about the email communication between us both)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When you collect or process personal data, you must provide information to data subjects. The required information is listed in Art 13 GDPR, though most privacy notice also include the items from Art 14 GDPR (if there are third party data sources) and Art 15 GDPR (which simplifies responses to data subject access requests). The ICO has provided detailed explanation and a checklist [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/). The list seems fairly long, but for such a simple site it will mostly be boilerplate.\n\nNote that if you engage third parties to process personal data on your behalf, you need to sign a data processing agreement with them. This may be a separate document or may be part of the normal terms of service, but must fulfil the requirements in Art 28 GDPR. Importantly, the data processor must only use the data as instructed by you, and not for their own purposes.\n\nThat the logs are routed through US servers is very unfortunate since this is an international transfer of personal data. Such transfers are allowed, provided that there are suitable safeguards. The Privacy Shield was considered a safeguard, but in 2020 was ruled to be invalid due to concerns about mass surveillance and the rule of law in the US. Any notices about Privacy Shield in your hoster's documentation are of purely historical significance. Transfers can continue if there's another safeguard, such as Standard Contractual Clauses. However, SCCs are ineffective if the recipient can't legally comply with them. If it was impossible for an US\\-based company to provide for an adequate level of data protection under Privacy Shield, they likely won't be legally able to sign SCCs as well. This can be fixed by supplemental security measures such as end\\-to\\-end encryption, but that's not really feasible in a cloud context.\n\nAll of this is a complicated way of saying: you can either find another hoster that doesn't transfer personal data into the US, or adopt an interpretation that the Schrems II case doesn't apply to your circumstances. My personal non\\-lawyer opinion is that while the first solution is obviously the correct one, a risk analysis could indicate that a purely static site (that does not process any personal data other than the necessary connection data) is of such low risk that the transfers may continue for the meanwhile. But this is a bet on the ICO's goodwill.\n\nThe privacy notice on your website must first deal with processing activities relating to the website. It's OK if you don't explain how you'll process emails.

The documentation emphasizes that even for a simple personal website, a comprehensive privacy policy is necessary under GDPR. This policy should include details about IP address logging, data retention periods, and the fact that logs may be routed through US servers. The invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield in 2020 is also a crucial point that needs to be addressed. The policy should cover all aspects of data processing, including third-party processors and international data transfers.

But this is not the case \\- ToS mention law of Hong Kong (<https://www.binance.com/en/terms> , section X.2\\)\n\nSo the main question is: on what basis could the Dutch claim their jurisdiction? Or could it be that the Dutch did not request the freeze in a legally binding way, they just advised Binance to comply? But according to the article, Binance had to freeze the funds.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Countries have jurisdiction in criminal matters primarily because either (1\\) the crime affects people in their country, or (2\\) the crime is carried out in their country.\n\nThe Netherlands is well within established norms of criminal jurisdiction to enforce money laundering laws that impact commerce in or with the Netherlands, which appears to be what happened in this case.\n\nAlso, the locus of where a crime that takes place on the Internet occurs is also somewhat nebulous. If Dutch residents are parties to those transactions, and the transactions constitute money laundering under Dutch law, there is a fair argument that the money laundering transactions take place in the Netherlands for legal purposes.\n\nThe main issue, as a practical matter, is what the Netherlands can do in order to force Binance to comply with its orders if Binance fails to do so.\n\nThe political and legal reality is that as long as the Dutch courts have the practical ability to enforce their orders, the Netherlands has jurisdiction to enforce those orders from a legal perspective if the Dutch courts agree that they have the power to do so.\n\nI lack the technical level understanding of the operations of Binance to know precisely what the Dutch government could do in this case, however. Someone with a deeper technical understanding will have to address that issue. It could simply be that the Dutch government is confident that it could successfully extradite Binance officials who willfully disobeyed its orders from whatever countries they reside in.\n\nUsually extradition is available, if there is an extradition treaty in force, if both countries have laws criminalizing the same basic type of conduct with similar degrees of seriousness. So, if the country where the Binance officials are located has a money laundering law that is in broad outline similar to that of the Dutch money laundering law, and if the two countries have an extradition treaty, the Dutch threat to have the offenders outside the Netherlands arrested and extradited to the Netherlands is a credible one.\n\n[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance):\n\n> **Binance** is a cryptocurrency exchange which is the largest exchange in the world in terms of daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies.

But, multinational business executives can be greatly hampered if warrants for their arrest are outstanding in much of the world.\n\nAlso, China, while it is prone to ignore business corruption for extended periods of time, every now and then embarks on harsh, mass, anti\\-corruption campaigns in which large numbers of allegedly corrupt business people are executed or imprisoned with little or no formal due process in short order and with little warning. So, Chinese based executives of the company know that if they become too much of a problem to the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China, that they can be \"thrown under the bus\" in a manner much more literal than the way that this term is usually used.

The provided information indicates that US Title 47 Section 508, which prohibits undisclosed paid promotions, specifically applies to \"radio stations\" as conventionally understood and defined in terms of radio transmission of energy. Spotify, being a streaming platform, does not fit this definition and is not subject to FCC licensing like traditional radio stations. There are currently no equivalent laws explicitly covering streaming platforms like Spotify. While this practice might be considered ethically questionable, it is not illegal under current US law. Answer A is incorrect because the law does not apply to all music distribution platforms. C is incorrect because \"payola\" laws have not been updated to include digital platforms.

I mentioned that I'd need to draft an agreement with a prospective client and wished to know approximately how much the law firm would charge for it, specifically mentioning \"For now I'd just like to know the approximate charges for the above types of requirements, so that I could compare and decide which legal firm / lawyer would be appropriate, based on my requirements\". \n\nIn response they've sent me an engagement letter where they typed my mobile number wrongly (they mentioned my name correctly, my email id correctly, but have put somebody else's mobile number), they've mentioned the background and scope of work, their hourly fees (which does not look reasonable to me), a clause for termination of the agreement etc. \"*The engagement will commence from execution of this Engagement Letter and will remain valid, subject to revision of professional fee annually.

Does their sending of an engagement letter mean that I pay them for their time of drafting the letter? I wasn't expecting an engagement letter. I was expecting something like an ordinary email which said something like \"this is our approximate hourly fee\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. \n\nAn engagement letter is a written confirmation that you have hired a lawyer which also sets forth the contractual obligations of the parties (i.e. the basis upon which attorneys' fees will be charged in the case). \n\nInstead of serving as an \"estimate\" or \"approximate quote\" of the fees to be charged, it is evidence that there is an attorney\\-client relationship and it sets forth the contractual terms of that relationship.\n\nUnless the engagement letter is for a fixed fee (which is uncommon but not unheard of), it only sets forth a method for determining what legal fees are owed and does not predict in advance what those fees will be.\n\nAn engagement letter often does set forth a \"retainer\" amount that must be paid when the lawyer is hired, but a \"retainer\" is more akin to a security deposit on a lease than an estimate of what the total charges for the representation will be.\n\nLawyers are required as a matter of professional ethics to put these things in writing.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be improper for an engagement letter to include an estimate of the fees that will be charged in a representation as well as the other matters described above. But, that would be rather unusual.\n\n> Firstly, since these people didn't even type my mobile number\n>  correctly, I'm uneasy about them drafting a legal agreement for me,\n>  where I wanted each and every clause to be thoroughly checked.

I wouldn't blow a simple typo in writing a phone number out of proportion.\n\n> How do I tell them that I do not need their services?\n\nAdvise them by telephone, or better yet by letter, email or text, that you have decided not to retain their services. \n\n> Does their sending of an engagement letter mean that I pay them for\n>  their time of drafting the letter?\n\nThe firm probably could charge you, but it is customary not to charge for drafting an engagement letter.\n\n> I wasn't expecting an engagement letter.

The engagement letter constitutes a contract between the parties if the engagement is commenced. An informal communication, followed by a formal one, could lead to confusion over which one applies and could lead to mistakes where someone given an informal communication never received the required formal engagement letter.\n\n> their hourly fees (which does not look reasonable to me)\n\nLawyers are expensive, and good lawyers are worth it.

The engagement letter is a standard and ethically required practice for lawyers when potentially entering into an attorney-client relationship. It doesn't mean the client has agreed to hire the firm, but rather sets forth the terms if they choose to do so. While the typo is unfortunate, it doesn't necessarily reflect on the firm's legal expertise.

There is no law that requires landlords to charge equally for all types of pets. However, landlords generally have the right to set their own pet policies and fees, as long as these are clearly stated in the lease agreement.

There aren't universal, hacker-specific laws that broadly restrict how hackers use their knowledge. However, various laws (like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US) do prohibit unauthorized access to computer systems and other malicious activities. The legality of hacking activities often depends on intent, consent, and specific actions taken. Ethical hacking, when authorized, can be legal, while malicious hacking is generally illegal.

The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of works that will satisfy this requirement, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive. \n> \n> \n> (d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.\u2014 If a notice of copyright in the form and position specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant\u2019s interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in the last sentence of section 504 (c)(2\\).\n\nYou'll notice that the wording of the law is broad, except that it gives the Register of Copyright the power to prescribe positioning of notice.\n\nA notice that falsely claims a later first publication year does not extend the term of copyright protection \u2014 if you first published an article on your website in 2010, a copyright notice that states 2015 does not extend the protection.\n\nSo:\n\n* You don't need a copyright notice at all, but it's helpful\n* [You can put a later year on the notice, but this doesn't protect it for longer](http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf)\n* Each of your examples would have the same effect.
