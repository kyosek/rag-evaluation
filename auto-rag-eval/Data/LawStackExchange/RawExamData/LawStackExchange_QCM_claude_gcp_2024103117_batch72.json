Dance Hall Keeper Licenses historically served as a regulatory measure to control and restrict dancing in establishments that served food and alcohol. This reflects a long history of prohibitions against dancing, especially in combination with drinking, in the United States. The example of New York City's Cabaret Law, which forbade dancing at establishments serving food and liquor without a license until its repeal in 2017, illustrates this regulatory purpose. While these licenses may have generated some revenue, their primary purpose was regulatory control rather than simple revenue generation (ruling out option A).

However, judges have discretion in considering mitigating factors during sentencing. The fact that a law changed to reduce the severity of punishment for an offense after it was committed can be considered by the judge when evaluating the seriousness of the crime, but it doesn't automatically require the application of the new law.

Meng*, [2020 BCSC 785](https://canlii.ca/t/j7x3n).\n\nThe authority to extradite is via the extraditing state's treaty with the U.S. and its domestic implementing legislation. In Canada, this is the *Extradition Act*.

The court ruled that the effects of US sanctions could be considered as background context, but the core issue was whether Ms. Meng's alleged conduct would amount to fraud under Canadian law. The charges were framed as fraud based on concealment of sanctions violations, rather than direct enforcement of US sanctions.

[8 USC 1227](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1227) makes certain crimes deportable offenses, but shoplifting isn't one of them.

I say that because [summary judgment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_56) motions often come after the discovery phase (not always, but the rule is one must be filed within 30 days of the conclusion of the discovery phase), which may take a significant amount of time. Perhaps, of course, the judge becomes aware of new information unrelated to discovery. Nonetheless, if the dismissal were on jurisdiction grounds or some other issue that was known ahead of time, it is unlikely he or she would wait to dismiss. \n\nThat said, courts may act *[sua sponte](https://legaldictionary.net/sua-sponte/)*, which means on its own / absent a motion by the parties. \n\nWith respect to a new trial or not, an example of being dismissed without prejudice and, thus, allowing the trial to begin again, may be a major error in the plaintiffs filing.

In this scenario, the judge's sua sponte dismissal for a procedural error likely occurred before an actual trial took place. Rule 59 typically applies to situations after a trial has occurred, so it would not be the appropriate mechanism for seeking a new trial in this case. However, if the judge's dismissal was without prejudice (which is possible for procedural errors), the plaintiff would have the option to correct the error and refile the case. This is not technically a \"new trial\" under Rule 59, but it does allow the plaintiff to start the legal process again.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while Rule 59 generally applies after a full trial, the question here is about a dismissal before trial.\nAnswer B is incorrect because a pre-trial dismissal is not typically considered equivalent to a trial for Rule 59 purposes.\nAnswer D is incorrect because the judge's failure to rule on the MSJ before dismissal does not automatically grant a new trial under Rule 59."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38830/can-a-state-in-the-u-s-require-candidates-to-release-taxes-to-be-on-the-ballot", "docs_id": 38830, "title": "Can a State in the U.S. require candidates to release taxes to be on the ballot for national office?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We have learned that many important constraints on elected officials are norms rather than rules.

The court held that an Arkansas law \"prohibiting the name of an otherwise\\-eligible candidate for Congress from appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate has already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate\" was unconstitutional, and \"Allowing individual States to adopt their own qualifications for congressional service would be inconsistent with the Framers' vision of a uniform National Legislature representing the people of the United States\". The same reasoning would hold for setting qualifications for the office of President. However, in [Bush v. Gore](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/), 531 U.S. 98, the court pointed out that \"The individual citizen has no federal constitutional right to vote for electors for the President of the United States unless and until the state legislature chooses a statewide election as the means to implement its power to appoint members of the electoral college\", noting that \"The State, of course, after granting the franchise in the special context of Article II, can take back the power to appoint electors\".\n\nIt is uncontroversial that states have the right to impose conditions on ballot access, and that a person does not have an automatic right to be on the ballot simply by applying for candidacy. You might argue that being required to 20,000 signatures on a petition constitutes imposing an unconstitutional qualification on a candidate, but the Supreme Court has so far not clearly found such ballot access provisions to be unconstitutional.\nStill, there is some room for argumentation. [This page](https://www.law.cornell.edu/background/ballot/supreme.htm) lists the 11 decisions regarding ballot access. In the first case, [Williams v. Rhodes](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/393/23/), 393 U.S. 23, the court overturned a requirement to garner 15% of the total votes in the last gubernatorial election for a new party to be on the ballot, finding that the laws \"are invidiously discriminatory and violate the Equal Protection Clause\", but later decisions tended to accept requirements with later filing dates or lower percentages. Filing fees are generally seen as an unconstitutional burden ([Bullock v. Carter](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/405/134/), 405 U.S. 134, [Lubin v. Panish](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/415/709/), 415 U.S. 709\\). It is hard to see how requiring a candidate to submit their tax returns could be seen as an unconstitutional burden.\n\nWhen it comes to state elections, there is even less of an argument that a state cannot impose such requirements (on dog\\-catcher, legislator, or governor).

However, we should set aside the emotional elements of a jury trial and focus on legal principles. The basic question is whether a person has the right to use force to [defend against an unlawful battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense_(United_States)): \"a person is privileged to use such force as reasonably appears necessary to defend him or herself against an apparent threat of unlawful and immediate violence from another\". This right to defense also extends to defense of others. But it has to appear to be to unlawful, which is to say, you have to reasonably believe that the force used against the victim is unlawful. If a couple of thugs try to drag a person away, then an observer probably has a reasonable belief that this is an unlawful battery. But if a couple of police officers are observed dragging a person away (arresting him), apparently acting officially, the force used (up to a point) is apparently lawful and would not constitute battery of the victim. For defensive force against police to be lawful, the forced used by the police must be excessive.\n\nThe outcome then depends on what a reasonable person would conclude (this is where the jury or judge makes a rather subjective decision). If a reasonable person would conclude that the assailants are acting lawfully in arresting the person, then a higher bar must be clear to justifiably use force in defense of others. Wearing a jacket that says \"Police\" favors the \"appears lawful\" side (though if you happened to know for a fact that the person wearing the jacket is *not* a police officer, then the \"police exception\" would not be applicable). In the relevant case, the facts point to the appearance of a lawful arrest (even if were to turn out to be judged unlawful).\n\nIn the case that this is an apparent arrest, it would have to be the case that a reasonable person would find the force used to be excessive. Generally speaking, force used by officers is held to be reasonable, except in some cases where it is not. See for example the matter of [Eric Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Eric_Garner), where the officers involved were not indicted. On the third hand, in this case, it might matter what the actual legal status of the \"officers\" is (they are not Chicago police).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United Airlines incident where a passenger was forcibly removed from a plane, if another passenger had intervened to defend the removed passenger by using force against the officers, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal consequences for the intervening passenger?\n\nA) The intervening passenger would likely be found not guilty due to the right to use force in defense of others against unlawful battery.\n\nB) The intervening passenger would be convicted of assault on a law enforcement officer, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nC) The intervening passenger might avoid conviction, but it would depend heavily on whether a reasonable person would perceive the officers' actions as lawful and whether the force used was excessive.\n\nD) The intervening passenger would be protected under Good Samaritan laws and face no legal consequences.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the legal outcome would depend on several factors. The key considerations are whether a reasonable person would perceive the officers' actions as a lawful arrest (even if later judged unlawful) and whether the force used appeared excessive. The right to defend others exists, but it's limited when applied to apparent law enforcement actions. The jury would need to determine if the intervention was justified based on how the situation appeared at the time, not on hindsight. Options A and B are too absolute, ignoring the nuanced nature of such cases.

But the bills (water, light, etc...) are sent to my parents. I don't know if this could be relevant.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note: All links in Spanish (sorry).\n\nRegardless or your father being or not the legal owner of the home, the issue at play is that of \n***alimentos***1.\n\nThis is an obligation between some family relationships to help each other so if family member (the *alimentista*) is in dire need of help (i.e., needs the help to survive) the others have the obligation to provide the help.\n\nThe [relatives of the *alimentista* affected are](http://iabogado.com/guia-legal/familia/los-alimentos-entre-parientes#01100200000000), in order:\n\n* The couple, always when married and only when expressly agreed upon for non\\-married couples.\n* Descendants: sons/daughters and grandsons/granddaughters.\n* Ascendants: parents and grandparents.\n* Brothers: Only when indispensable and the minimum amount.\n\nThe order determines who of all the family members is under obligation to provide the help; in case of multiple people in the same category the amount is to be divided between them in function of their income.\n\nThe amount of the help is not fixed and will depend of the circunstances of the situation2; and it is possible to provide by providing the needs(shelter, food) directly.\n\nNow, until when does a father/grandfather need to provide *alimentos* to a son or daughter? Certainly until s/he is 183, as this is the date of full age in Spain, but it is usual to consider that the obligation exists while the *alimentista* is studying and lacks of his/her own means of subsistence.\n\nThat is not a \"free rider\" situation, as *alimentos* may be denied by several reasons:\n\n* Obviously, because the person that should provide the help does not have the means to do so without endangering his own subsistence.\n* The *alimentista* gets his/her own means of subsistence.\n* Any of the causes that would make the *alimentista* unable to inherit from the person providing the help4: attempted murder, coercion to change their will, and other grave crimes.\n* The *alimentista* does not do enough to get his/her own means of subsistence. If a judge decides that the *alimentista* son/daughter is neither studying nor seriously trying to get a job, the help can be revoked. [Judges seem to be progressively taking a harsher stance against descendants who refuse to do their part](http://www.eldiario.es/sociedad/nini-ocde-pension-audiencia-tribunal_supremo_0_536146504.html). The article quotes the case of a 19 years old guy whose claim to the pension was denied.\n\nAs a side note, rejecting to pay *alimentos* is another of the causes that would cause the person doing it to lose any right to inheritance from the *alimentista*.\n\nIf for whatever the reason you do not qualify for *alimentos*, the details of the agreement between your father and your grandfather for the home become relevant5:\n\n* If your father has formally rented the house then your grandfather position is not relevant, as your father has all of the rights6.\n* If your grandfather allows your father to live in the house without paying rent, then it is your grandfather rights as owner against your father rights as an occupant. No idea about the outcome of that situation.\n\n**UPDATE:**\nYou still do not tell about your grandfather stance about the issue, which is important. If your grandfather agrees with your father7 then the only way to stay at home is that of *alimentos*.\n\nWhat you describe is a situation of either [*precario* or *comodato*](https://www.mundojuridico.info/diferencia-entre-precario-y-comodato/), where your grandfather allows the use of the home without compensation. The differences are:\n\n* *precario* is for an undefined time.\n* *comodato* is for a defined time/use (e.g. for X years).\n\nNow, I have to suppose that you are not part of the agreement so it is just between your father and grandfather. That makes it your father's dwelling, and beyond *alimentos* he cannot be forced to share his dwelling with you.\n\nBut if this is a situation of *precario* (which is what most often happens) your grandfather has the \"nuclear option\"8 of threatening to evict your father, as it is a relatively easy (in the legal sense, not the personal one) procedure. In a situation of *comodato* your grandfather could not evict your father until the conditions of the cession expire, making threats somewhat weaker.\n\nAs a final note, and given how specific this answer has become:\n\n* I am not a lawyer, you have not provided enough specific info, and this is not legal advice. Talk to a lawyer. Maybe a lawyer will check the agreement and it will turn out that your father is paying rent by performing some service, voiding the *precario* aspect. Maybe with the details provided the lawyer can find a way to an agreement that is more amenable to all. Talk to a lawyer.\n* Shut up. The issue at hand may be stressful, and sometimes it might be tempting to boast to your father about the issues of *alimentos* or *precario*. Don't. If there is something to be said about that, let your lawyer do the talking. Try to stay calm.\n* Consider the effect of your actions before taking them. While there is nothing wrong with talking to a lawyer, going beyond that and beginning a legal battle with members of your own family is most of the times an ugly affair. It could easily have an effect for a very long time in your relationship with most of your family, even with those who are not directly implied.

While adult children in Spain may be entitled to continued support and housing from their parents in certain circumstances (such as while pursuing education), this right is not absolute. \n\nThe correct answer is B because if the grandfather, who is the legal owner of the house, agrees with the father's decision to evict the adult child, there would be limited legal recourse for the child to stay.

The following answer is specific to US law.*\n\nUnder US law, the copyright of a \"work for hire\" belongs to the party paying for it, not the creator. However, to be considered as a work for hire, the creator must either be an employee or have a signed a written contract stating that this is a work for hire:\n\n> A \u201cwork made for hire\u201d is\u2014\n> \n> \n> 1. a work prepared by an employee within the scope of his or her employment; or\n> 2. a work specially ordered or commissioned for use as a contribution to a collective work, as a part of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, as a translation, as a supplementary work, as a compilation, as an instructional text, as a test, as answer material for a test, or as an atlas, if the parties expressly agree in a written instrument signed by them that the work shall be considered a work made for hire.\n\nWhether or not the creator is an employee of the company hinges upon many factors; see [Community for Creative Non\\-Violence v. Reid (1989\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_for_Creative_Non-Violence_v._Reid) for more details. But if the work was not a \"work for hire\", then the creator generally retains copyright.\n\nThat said, it is also likely that if someone does work for a company without a contract, that company gains an [implied license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_license) to use the work for the originally intended purposes. Moreover, if the creator receives \"consideration\" (i.e., anything else of value) for the work, this license is irrevocable. In [Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon (2008\\),](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_Marketing_Systems,_Inc._v._Gagnon)\na contractor tried to revoke his permission for a company to use code that he had written. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found that if a company pays a creator to create a work, the work is delivered to the company, and the creator intends for the company to copy \\& distribute that work, then the company has an implied, non\\-exclusive, irrevocable license to distribute the work.\n\nIf this situation applies, then a creator probably can't force the company to stop using the work for the originally intended purposes. However, if the company started using it for substantially different purposes, the creator might be able to stop them from doing that. Establishing what counts as \"substantially different\", and what was \"originally intended\" in the case of a verbal contract, is something that gets established in court on a case\\-by\\-case basis; that's why lawyers get the big money.\n\nETA, after seeing your comment: nothing in what I've said is specific to \"companies\" licensing and/or owning copyright in the work.

Based on the information provided, this situation closely aligns with the concept of an implied license. While John likely retains the copyright to the designs (as there was no written work-for-hire agreement), the fact that Sarah paid for the work and used it for its intended purpose suggests she has an implied license to continue using the designs for their original purpose. This license is likely irrevocable, as established in cases like Asset Marketing Systems, Inc. v. Gagnon (2008).

Second, the license agreement / copyright transfer contains an indemnification clause whereby the author vows that they have the sole right to authorize publication of the material, and the author agrees to legally protect the publisher (pay their legal costs and any judgments, etc) in case their have infringes copyright, or any other legal harm that could arise from publishing the author's contribution.

The law recognizes the property right which a person has when they create a thing, such as a font, and that right is encoded in the law of copyright.

Eg. I have a billing module for issuing invoices, keeping records of my finances, etc. This software is solely for my own personal use, there is no way I will ever give anyone access or source codes to run their own instances.\nNow, the backbone of this software is obviously a comprehensive database with such records as people and companies.\n\nAnd I wonder, how legal this technically is? This database obviously contains a lot of personal information/data, information entered exclusively by me. This information is accessible only by me, it's not and will not ever be used for any commercial purposes (I won't ever sell the information itself, nor the information metadata).\n\nSo, am I technically breaking any laws/regulations just by having such software?\n\nFor instance, intuitively it seems to me that having a directory with people, their phone numbers, emails, addresses, etc. clearly breaks GDPR rules. However, on second thought, this is precisely what the contacts app on my phone is \\- a directory of people with their personal information. So is this the same thing, or does the exact same concept break different rules when it's implemented in the phone vs. custom software?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not illegal to have such software. The question is how you use it. Some uses of your phone's contact app can be a GDPR violation as well.\n\nThe GDPR has an exemption for \u201cpurely personal or household purposes\u201d. When an ordinary user uses some software for managing their personal or family life, that is not subject to GDPR. E.g. I have a contact list with friends and acquaintances and that is not subject to GDPR at all.\n\nYou are mentioning invoices. Issuing invoices is not a purely personal activity. It affects people outside your friends and family. Your understanding of the term \u201cpersonal\u201d (the software is custom\\-tailored for your needs) is different from the GDPR's concept of \u201cpurely personal\u201d.\n\nWith respect to processing activities that you perform e.g. as a freelancer, you must consider the GDPR. For all such processing activities, you need a legal basis. For invoices this is simple because you're legally required to issue correct invoices. But if your software has aspects of a customer relationship management system, things would be a bit more tricky. The GDPR offers a choice of legal basis, but here there might be a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d to keep track of people with whom you have a business relationship. But it is not the features of the software that are relevant here, but which processing activities you're going to carry out with that data via the software. Mere storage of information is already a processing activity in the sense of the GDPR, though.\n\nIf you're using the same systems for purely personal activities and business activities, it might be difficult to understand your obligations with respect to your data. If possible, it is best to keep your private life separate from business activities so that no confusion arises. For example with a contacts app, it could make sense to use different user accounts for personal and business use.\n\nTypical GDPR issues with a contact information database could be:\n\n* not having a clear purpose for which this data is being stored and used\n* storing the information for longer than necessary\n* storing information about people with whom you do not have an appropriate relationship\n* sharing the data with others, without a proper legal basis\n* unsolicited marketing to people, though some kinds of direct marketing are allowed by the laws in your country", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A freelance graphic designer creates custom software to manage their business, including a database of client information.

Often, the non\\-profit or civic organization is one in which people somehow connected to the firm are involved.\n\nIn almost all cases, large law firms are also image conscious and will only take cases that would reflect well on the firm if they were reported upon in a newspaper story from a reporter willing to listen to their side of the story.\n\nIn a pro bono case, the law firm wants to be on the side of the case where they are wearing the \"white hats\" (i.e. the good guys).\n\n**When Do Law Firms Have A Policy Of Declining Pro Bono Representation?**\n\nOn the other hand, in addition to actual direct conflicts, where the law firm represents the other side of a dispute with you, which of course, no one would expect the firm to represent you in on any basis, most large law firms have a class of potential clients that they refuse to accept because they constitute \"business development conflicts.\"\n\nFirms that are hired by insurance companies to represent defendants in personal injury cases will almost never take on a personal injury plaintiff. Firms that represent residential landlords will almost never represent a residential tenant. Firms that represent big businesses that do business with the general public will almost never take on a consumer protection lawsuit for a consumer. Firms that represent manufacturing and utility companies won't take on lawsuits to enforce environmental laws. Firms that represent employers don't represent unions.\n\nThey don't take on these kinds of clients both because their existing and prospective clients don't like it from an appearances and \"loyalty to the cause\"/solidarity perspective, and because they don't want to end up making precedents as a result of their skillful representation that end up hurting most of their clients.\n\nFinally, law firms almost never represent someone who can afford their services on a paying basis for the work in question.\n\nSimilarly, law firms like to represent pro bono clients who are appreciative and reasonably tolerable to deal with.

On the other hand, what you are proposing is vastly more transformative than putting searchable scans online, and the \"effect on market\" would arguably be positive (that is, no sales would be lost because a free copy was acquired instead \\-\\- the work itself would not be available).\n\nHowever... we also treat music differently (there is a separate section of code, [17 USC 114](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/114)).

Why does the government care who stays in who's house, while paying money? Is there some third party that is negatively affected if the guidelines aren't followed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, to be clear, this is almost never a state level limitation. To the extent that the link in the question implies otherwise, it is incorrect.\n\nInstead, local governments, typically a municipality or in an area that is not part of any municipality, a county, enacts land use regulations, the most common of which is usually called a \"[zoning code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning_in_the_United_States).\" There are also usually locally adopted building codes that supplement the zoning code.\n\nA zoning code typically establishes rules regarding how different kinds of real estate can be used in different enumerated zones. Usually, there are several different zones in which residential uses are allowed and different rules apply in each one. One of the typical limitations in a residential zone is to establish the number of unrelated people who don't own the home who may live there.\n\nThe purpose of such limitations is to discourage the establishment of boarding houses, group homes, women's shelters, homeless shelters, flop houses, and halfway houses in relatively low density residential zones, on the theory that these uses are undesirable in terms of neighborhood character and cause undesirable people to move into a neighborhood that lowers property values for other people who live there.\n\nMore crassly, people in affluent neighborhoods want to ban property uses that make it possible for poorer people to live near them.\n\nOften the actual scope of the limitations, however, is far broader than is necessary to prohibit these particularly unpopular \"[NIMBY](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Not-in-My-Backyard-Phenomenon)\" (not in my backyard) uses. The drafters of zoning codes are frequently more concerned about preventing loopholes in their restrictions from being identified than about limiting property rights in a respect that most current property owners in the zone don't avail themselves of anyway.\n\nFor example, in Denver, where I live, the City Council recently passed a Group Living Amendment to its zoning code easing restrictions on uses of residences by unrelated people. This measure was sufficiently controversial that members of the public used their referral powers to petition to have [the repeal of the recently enacted legislation places on the November 2021 general election ballot](https://denverite.com/2021/10/07/denver-referred-question-2f-vg-2021/) for voters to consider repealing it.\n\nAs the link in the question notes, homeowner's associations, frequently also impose limitations on this kind of use of a residence, which are often even more strict, and are frequently adopted for the same reason. HOAs have more authority to do so than local governments because as private entities, they aren't required to meet constitutional law limitations on their authority.\n\n> The question is, if both parties agree to forgo any safety measures\n> that it might be there to protect, who exactly is it hurting if one\n> person pays the other to stay over?\n> \n> \n> In simple terms: why is it illegal?

But, they aren't barriers to enacting laws if people with the power to enact legislation disagree.\n\nThe simple rule is that in the real world, legislation is not required to adhere to a liberal/libertarian ideal in which laws are enacted only to regulate matters in which someone else may arguably be harmed. Subject to light constitutional regulation, the authority of local government's to enact legislation regulating the use of property is frequently plenary (i.e. unlimited) or close to it. The government can do anything it wants that it isn't forbidden from doing by the constitution or a higher level government's statutes. Courts aren't permitted to second guess the accuracy or desirability of these legislative determinations in most cases.\n\nMany states, furthermore, have \"[home rule cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_rule_in_the_United_States)\" that are expressly protected from having their legislative authority limited in many respects by state legislation.\n\nA [regulatory taking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_takings_in_the_United_States), the prevents property from having any beneficial use, must be compensated by the government enacting the regulation of its use. But regulatory laws may reduce the value of property by limiting the uses to which it can be put so long as there is still some beneficial use of the property that remains available.\n\nA very light and disputed impact that is perceived to be negative, such as the one in this case, is a sufficient [rational basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_basis_review) for a municipal or local government to enact such legislation, and many local government zoning codes do, in fact, regulate this kind of activity.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld the authority of local governments to enact this kind of legislation in the United States in the face of a constitutional challenge to it, in the case of  *[Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_of_Euclid_v._Ambler_Realty_Co.)* in 1926, although some more extreme versions of limitations on non\\-related people sharing a home have subsequently been held to be invalid, mostly as a result of later enacted federal fair housing laws.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A local government in the United States enacts a zoning ordinance that limits the number of unrelated individuals who can live in a single-family home in a residential neighborhood.

Such ordinances are generally considered constitutional if they have a rational basis, such as maintaining neighborhood character or property values. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while the ordinance does limit property rights, it's not necessarily unconstitutional if it serves a legitimate government interest.\n\nOption B is incorrect as zoning regulations are typically enacted at the local level, not the state level.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the regulatory takings doctrine only requires compensation if the regulation deprives the property of all economically beneficial use, which is not the case here."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8976/design-theft-by-a-former-client", "docs_id": 8976, "title": "Design Theft by a Former Client", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had a client that I worked for a number of years.

This keeps the website owner out of the dispute between the copyright holder and the user.\n\nOption A, while well-intentioned, could expose the website owner to legal risk by delaying the takedown of potentially infringing content. Option C directly violates the DMCA's requirements and would likely result in loss of safe harbor protection. Option D involves the website owner in determining the validity of copyright claims, which is not their role under the DMCA and could lead to legal complications.\n\nBy immediately removing the content, notifying the user, and providing information on how to submit a counter-notice (B), the website owner complies with the DMCA, maintains their safe harbor protection, and still gives the user a path to challenge the takedown if they believe it to be incorrect."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/52848/how-to-search-for-court-records-regarding-medical-malpractice-for-a-particular-p", "docs_id": 52848, "title": "How to search for court records regarding medical malpractice for a particular physician?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: New York state (US) here.

The United States could claim jurisdiction under 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 7, which extends U.S. jurisdiction to \"any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to an offense by or against a national of the United States.\" As John is a U.S. citizen, this provision applies.\n\n2. The United Kingdom could claim jurisdiction based on the victim's nationality and their laws regarding crimes against British citizens abroad.\n\n3. While the yacht is registered in Panama, this doesn't limit prosecution to only Panama. Many nations now undertake to enforce laws in cases where their citizens are victims or perpetrators of crimes, even on the high seas.\n\n4.

It was originally a court\\-made concept, adopted by Congress in the Copyright Act of 1976, now [17 USC](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/). It is specifically defined in [17 USC 107](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107).\n\nWhether a use is a fair use is always a highly fact\\-dependent determination. There is no single clear formula or rule. There are uses which are highly likely to be held to be fair use, and uses pretty clearly not covered, but between those is a wide area where the details matter.\n\nWhether a use is a fair use depends on the nature of the work making use of copied or derived content, on the nature of the work copied from, on the kind of use made of the copied content, on the amount of the source work that is copied, and on the effect of the copying on the market or potential market for the source work. None of these dominates, a balance is struck in each case that a court considers. The law lists the factors to be considered as:\n\n> in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n\n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n\n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n\n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n\n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n\nIt is essential to examine the details of a proposed use to see how the four factors apply in each case. Unfortunately here details are lacking as to the nature and purpose of the use, and as to how much content would be quoted from any particular source.\n\nIf the proposed work is an analysis and discussion of various published works, one which does not compete with them, that would tend to favor fair use. In general a short quotation can be made when the purpose is to analyze or discuss that quote or the work from which it comes. An image may be used when that image is being commented on, or in some cases to identify the work in question. It should include no more of the source image than is needed for such a purpose, and should often be at a reduced resolution.\n\nIf the new work serves as a replacement for the source work, so that people are less likely to purchase the source work, that weighs against a finding of fair use. This may be the most important factor in the analysis.\n\nThe more of the source work that is used, the less likely it is to be a fair use. But there are cases in which the entire source work was copied but this was held to be a fair use, and in *Harper vs Nation* the copying of about 300 words from a 500\\-page book was held to be too much.\n\nValid fair use usually includes attribution, listing the source and authorship of the work from which content has been copied or derived.\n\nThe more the use is for a different purpose than the original, the better the case for fair use. For example, a popular song is written and published to make an emotional effect on the listeners. A text on how to write popular music quotes the song to discuss meter and rhyme scheme, a very different kind of use. A stirring line in a famous speech may be quote4d ironically, to argue that the ideals of the original have not been achieved, again a very different use. Such different uses are called *transformative* in copyright law. Transformative uses are more likely to be held as fair use than uses that are not transformative.\n\nAdvertisements are no different from other protected works. The same rules apply when quoting an ad as when quoting a novel, or a poem, or a news story. However, creative works, such as poems, songs, and novels, are generally more strongly protected than factual works such as news stories, advertisements, or textbooks. When the source is a creative work fair use is somewhat less likely.\n\nThe question also mentions trademarks. Trademarks are only protected against being used in trade. That is, one may not, without permission, use someone else's trademark to advertise or identify a product or service, or to suggest that it is endorse or approved by another when it has not been. A trademark may be used to identify a trademarked product, for example in comparative advertising (\"Brand X performs better than Brand Y.\") But if the proposed work is not itself advertising or selling anything (except perhaps itself) then trademark law is probably not an issue.\n\nWithout more specifics on the proposed, this set of general principles on fair use is the beat answer that I can give.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A blogger wants to write a critical review of popular advertisements from the last decade.

Despite that I am a litigant in person and a secure tenant, my recent research in Possession claims confirmed to me that Judgement was obviously wrong and unfair. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need to look at [rule 52](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part52#52.3) of the Civil Procedure Rules. This says that appeals from a County Court lie to the High Court (probably the Chancery Division in this case), and that permission to appeal can be granted either in the County Court or the High Court. It also says (52\\.1(4\\)) that permission to appeal is usually decided without a hearing (on paper), but that the appellant may apply for a reconsideration at an oral hearing; it would be sensible to check exactly what the Circuit Judge will be doing.\n\nIt appears that you are not distinguishing properly between the appeal and the application for permission. If your appeal is dismissed by the High Court, it may be possible (if you get permission) to go to the Court of Appeal; but it's premature to worry about that now, since if permission is refused, there will be no appeal, and the Court of Appeal could not consider the case even if it wanted to.\n\nThe Circuit Judge will not determine the merits; his job is solely to determine whether there is a \"compelling reason\" (52\\.6(1\\)) for the appeal to be heard. This usually means that the judgment arguably made an identifiable error of fact or law, which the High Court needs to decide on. There is no point saying that the judgment was biased or unfair; you need to say exactly what error you think should be corrected.\n\nWhen the Circuit Judge has heard all the arguments, he will give his decision. If permission is granted, you will need to file an appellant's notice in the High Court, and contact the Chancery Listing office; I imagine the County Court staff will be able to help with the details. If it is refused, the order will say (52\\.3(3\\)) whether a further application for permission may be made, and to whom. If he is acting in the High Court (this will be set out in the heading of the order you receive), there is nothing further to be done: the Court to which the appeal would lie has refused to hear it. If he is acting as a County Court judge, you may have the right to apply to the High Court to reconsider the decision (52\\.3(2\\)(b)); but you should definitely consult a solicitor before doing so, no matter how strongly you feel. This is not just another roll of the dice which may be lucky. There will be considerable costs: there are time limits that have to be observed: you have to draw up an appellant's notice: and in the end the High Court Judge will merely consider, on paper, whether a colleague on circuit made a decision that was obviously wrong, which is statistically unlikely.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A litigant in person is appealing against a possession order from a District Judge to a Circuit Judge.

If they don't move out, they must still pay the rent.\n\n> If the tenant...moves out of the property half way through their rental period, can the tenant claim a refund on the rent already paid which reflects the time between when they left the property and when the rental period would expire?\n\nFor a tenancy which started before 1 October 2015, there is no automatic right to a refund. The tenant can of course ask the landlord for one, though the landlord would only be obliged to refund rent if a new tenant moves in before the end of that period.\n\nFor tenancies made after [1 October 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/994/article/11/made), [s35 of the Deregulation Act 2015](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/20/section/35/enacted) amends [s21 of the Housing Act 1988](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/50/section/21) to allow the 2 months' notice to end on any day (after the end of a fixed term), not just the end of a rental period.

So, after that date, there is likely to be a delay until the case can appear before a court.

It was not entirely clear how these matters were to be dealt with in the early days of the US democracy.\n\nHow exactly then was SCOTUS made the ultimate judge? Was there amendments to the constitution involved? What exactly was the process?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This came in the famous case of [Marbury v. Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison) (1803\\). At the last moments of his term, President Adams and Congress appointed a bunch of new judges to the courts. One of those was Marbury, but his new commission was not delivered by the outgoing Secretary of State John Marshall. The incoming President Jefferson had the undelivered commissions thrown out and ignored by his own Secretary of State (Madison). So Marbury sued to have his commission instated.\n\nThere were some peculiar subtleties to the case. One is that Marbury sued directly in the Supreme Court, rather than an inferior court. A law passed by Congress had granted SCOTUS authority to be the trier of certain cases; said law was repealed before the case went before the court. Another oddity is that the Chief Justice was the very same John Marshall that had originally failed to deliver the commission; he did not recuse himself.\n\nThe case was very contentious. Congress and the President were both very combative and eager to claim control of \"constitutionality\" for themselves. Congress would not much appreciate its laws being thrown out, and Jefferson was of the (combative) mind that it was in fact the President who decided the constitutionality of laws (the constitution can be said to explicitly charge him with enforcement of the laws and protection of the constitution), etc. The court risked getting neutered by both sides with just the slightest misstep. The President was sure to ignore any attempt to make him do anything, and Congress would retaliate if anyone but them threw out their laws. And simply declaring themselves impotent was the same set of problems. That the ruling effectively avoided all such problems makes it one of the great examples in SCOTUS opinions to this day, though not all hold it up in a positive way (it arguably intentionally handled the case backwards, so as to yield a ruling rather than a dismissal; some even argue the case may have been manufactured as a way to formally let SCOTUS claim this power).\n\nThe ruling basically said the following:\n\n(1\\) Does Marbury have a right to this commission? Yes, the commission was validly created and the deliverance of it is just a non\\-discretionary formality, failure of which is an injury that can be fixed (give him the commission).\n\n(2\\) Do we have the power to force the Executive branch to do something like this? Yes, for non\\-discretionary duties that are non\\-political and owed to a particular person, the courts may order the lower ranks of the Executive branch to do things.\n\n(3\\) Do we even have the authority to hear this case? No. It is held that the law in question would grant us original jurisdiction over this issue, but that is unconstitutional: our original jurisdiction is completely enumerated by the Constitution, and cannot be expanded by legislation.\n\n(4\\) So what do we do? Nothing, we just dismiss it. Madison can be ordered to do this thing, but won't actually be so ordered since the law required to let us do so is invalid. And we can invalidate that law, but don't actually do so since Congress has already repealed it.\n\nIn this way both Congress and the President were left with no real angles to hold a beef over the court, as neither one of them had effectively had their authority directly neutered or compelled. The ruling did nothing but what was already done, and simply asserted the Judiciary had certain powers it could flex later: it could rule on the constitutionality of laws, and it could order the Executive branch to do things. For what it's worth, the Marshall court never really invoked these powers again, seemingly still mindful of a contentious battle for power between the branches of government that could render the courts impotent, but one way or another the ruling successfully claimed the power to decide the constitutionality of things for the courts.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: The landmark case Marbury v.

The fact that he says he has a legal place to dispose of the trash is part of your contract. That fact \\- either verbal (or in writing) in that contract \\- should really absolve you of any responsibility of what happens to the trash. You don't need to actually know all the details of his legal dumping place, but you can hold him/her to the agreement if it happens that they do illegally dispose of the property they have been hired to remove.\n\nIn reality, this person is advertising this service as a business (on Facebook) and has been operating for some time, so they are probably legally disposing of refuse in a landfill while making some money from whatever might be valuable. The trash hauler probably depends on some of your trash being valuable, in terms of recycling or repairing or selling collectables (\"old toys\"), and not all of that will be disposed of in a landfill.\n\nI suppose it's possible a municipality could accuse you of illegally disposing of the trash if it was somehow tracked back to you, i.e. personally identifiable items or papers in the trash that was found illegally dumped. But you have the contract with the trash hauler to show you acted in good faith. Ask in the Facebook group if indeed this person disposes of trash in a legal manner, or ask others who have hired him/her. Clearly outline your stipulations for legal disposal with them.

The law regarding takedown notices and host liability is [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512#c_3). The notice includes \"Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed\", a \"signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed\", and a statement that \"the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law\".

Under DMCA and US copyright law, copying is infringing, programming is not infringing. The complaint does not clearly allege unauthorized copying of another person's intellectual property, and their complaint is based on the theory that certain programming actions constitute copyright infringement. I don't actually think they are confused, I think they are testing the boundaries.\n\nGithub has no reasonable options but to comply; the authors have the option of filing a counter\\-notice; then RIAA has the option of claiming that they have filed a copyright infringement lawsuit.

This is a separate offense in Title 17\\. [17 USC 501(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/501) defines infringement of copyright, saying\n\n> Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner\n> as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided\n> in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or phonorecords into the\n> United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of the\n> copyright or right of the author\n\nProduction of an anti\\-circumvention technology is not included in those sections: on a plain reading of the law, this is not infringement.\n\nTo summarize the legal dance at issue: RIAA has taken the first legal step in alleging infringement, and Github has taken the material down *because Github does not get to decide what the courts would conclude*. Let's assume the authors file a counter\\-notice stating that there is no infringement; then, equally, let's assume that RIAA states that they files a lawsuit. Github will leave the material down. Let's also assume that RIAA actually files suit. Under the prior assumption that the material violates 17 USC 1201(a)(1\\)(A) which seems likely, the authors could be slapped for being in violation: but they would not have been in violation of \u00a7106\\-122\\.

In addition, other US laws, not part of COPPA, prohibit knowingly furnishing to a minor sexually explicit or otherwise \"inappropriate\" content, even when this is not legally obscene and would be protected when furnished to an adult. Marking content as \"not for children\" and attempting to verify age might help avoid application of such laws.\nThe [Wikipedia article about COPPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act#Criticisms) says:\n\n> In 2019, the Government of the State of New York sued YouTube for violating COPPA by illegally retaining information related to children under 13 years of age. YouTube responded by dividing its content strictly into \"for kids\" and \"not for kids\". This has met with extremely harsh criticism from the YouTube community, especially from gamers, with many alleging that the FTC of the United States intends to fine content creators $42,530 for \"each mislabeled video\", possibly putting all users at risk. However, some have expressed skepticism over this, feeling that the fines may actually be in reference to civil penalties, possibly intended for the site's operators and/or warranted by more serious of COPPA violations or specific cases of \"mislabeling videos.\" (*citations omitted*)\n\n[This WGN news story \"All You Need To Know About COPPA On Youtube\"](https://wgnradio.com/wgn-plus/mason-vera-paine/all-you-need-to-know-about-coppa-on-youtube/) includes a link to an interview with Peder Magee, a Senior Attorney of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection. Magee says in the interview that recent actions under the law were for failing to properly handle PI collected from children. At time 5:02 Magee says \"...and if you are collecting personal information \\[from children] you may have to comply with the law\".\n\nCOPPA does not make any content \"illegal\". What it prohibits is collecting excessive PI from children, not obtaining consent for collecting PI in some cases, or refusing to delete such PI on request. If a site does not collect any PI from users, 15 USC \u00a7 6502 simply does not apply to that site.\n\nWebsite operators may **choose** to restrict the access of children to avoid possible applicability of 15 USC \u00a7 6502 and its administrative requirements. They have the option of providing access but complying in regard to any PI collected.\n\nNote that COPPA is, in theory, applicable to non\\-US sites that are targeted at US users or collect PI from US users. However, according to [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Online_Privacy_Protection_Act#International_scope):\n\n> in practice, the FTC has never (as of 2015\\) actually issued any enforcement action against foreign companies, and attempts to do so may be frustrated by the lack of jurisdiction.\n\nObviously, laws in countries other than the US are likely to be different.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under the United States' Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which of the following statements is true regarding online content and its designation as \"for kids\" or \"not for kids\"?\n\nA) COPPA requires all online content to be labeled as either \"for kids\" or \"not for kids\" to protect children under 13.\n\nB) Marking content as \"not for kids\" automatically exempts a website from COPPA compliance.\n\nC) COPPA does not require content labeling, but focuses on the collection and handling of personal information from children under 13.\n\nD) Content creators can be fined $42,530 for each video incorrectly labeled as \"not for kids\" on platforms like YouTube.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: COPPA does not actually require content to be labeled as \"for kids\" or \"not for kids\". Its primary focus is on the collection, use, and protection of personal information from children under 13 years old. The law requires website operators to provide notice about information collection, obtain parental consent, and maintain reasonable procedures to protect children's data. Marking content as \"not for kids\" may be a strategy used by some platforms to avoid COPPA's requirements, but it doesn't automatically exempt a site from compliance if they are knowingly collecting data from children. The claim about fines for mislabeled videos is not accurate according to the information provided by the FTC attorney. COPPA violations are more likely to be related to improper handling of children's personal information rather than content labeling."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60668/can-i-de-commodify-ideas-by-means-of-the-creative-commons", "docs_id": 60668, "title": "Can I \u201cde-commodify\u201d ideas by means of the Creative Commons?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I often have ideas for a product or a company. Instead of resorting to intellectual property law and patents to protect my ideas, I'd like to encourage as many people and organizations as possible to make use of my ideas.

I'm therefore considering to license my ideas by means of a CC\\-BY or CC\\-BY SA license.\n\nMy question is: would either (or both) of these these creative commons licenses allow others to make use of my ideas for commercial purposes, while at the same time prevent them from appropriating my ideas by means of patents?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Creative Commons licenses grant more or less limited permission to use works protected by copyright, the details demanding on the particular license selected. They can only grant or restrict permissions to the extent that copyright law permits. Ideas are not subject to copyright protection. If others learn an idea of yours, they are free to use it, including commercially, unless it is protected in some way other than a CC license.\n\nSome ideas can be protected by a patent for a limited time. More exactly, inventions using that idea may be protected. Filing a patent application is complex, and involves fees and costs. To be successful, professional help is often needed. The requirements vary somewhat depending on the country involved.\n\nIf an idea has been published, that may hinder or prevent anyone gaining patent protection for inventions using that idea. If a document describing an idea is published under a CC license, that **might** help it to be considered as \"prior art\" if someone else wants to patent an invention based on the content, but it is the publication more than the license thsat will have this effect. It may help if the document carries a date of publication.\n\nIdeas can also be protected as trade secrets, but this is not compatible with making them widely available for others to use.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An entrepreneur wants to share their innovative ideas widely while preventing others from patenting these ideas.

Can matters like this only be settled from only one country (plaintiff or defendant)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You forgot an element of criminal copyright infringement, a minimum amount of copying. I believe the US statute specifies at least $1,000 worth of copied works within a 6\\-month period, but by policy the DOJ does not prosecute unless the matter is much bigger than that.\n\nA matter of terminology: criminal charges are not \"settled\". They are prosecuted, leading either to a trial or a plea\\-bargain. If not prosecuted, charges are dropped.\n\nAny country where infringing products are produced or distributed **may** choose to prosecute criminal infringement. However, the country where the products are produced and thus where the criminals, or some of them, are located, has an advantage in arresting them and bringing them to trial. Thus the country of production is often the one to do any prosecuting that gets done.\n\nHowever, often such criminals choose a country with a relatively weak law\\-enforcement system, or one that does not much care about enforcing foreign (to it) copyrights, to operate in. Thus the the country that could arrest the criminals doesn't, and the country that might want to, can't get hold of them. International criminal copyright prosecutions are, I believe, rather rare.\n\nAs a practical matter, almost all copyright enforcement is by private suit, not criminal prosecution.\n\n> Since each country has jurisdiction on the infringement happen within their country, does the mean the criminal case to be settled in each 179 countries? If that is the case, then don't you think this increases the paperwork?\n\nThere is no need to \"settle\" the case in every, or indeed in any, jurisdiction. Any country where a criminal act occurred may prosecute if it chooses. In practice, few if any will choose to do so.\n\n> Can matters like this only be settled from only one country (plaintiff or defendant)?\n\nNo, several countries can bring cases if they so choose. There is no such thing as double jeopardy between separate countries, unless an agreement specifies that there is, and that is not common. Such countries may need to negotiate over possession of individual defendants \\- If country A has arrested Joe Thug, country B may not be able to try Joe without the cooperation of country A.
