The project is completed, but the final invoice is delayed due to some agreed-upon changes. Six months pass without any communication from the contractor. Which of the following statements most accurately reflects Alice's legal position regarding payment?\n\nA) Alice is no longer obligated to pay as the contractor's right to bill has expired\nB) Alice must pay immediately if billed, regardless of the delay\nC) Alice still owes payment, but has stronger negotiating leverage due to the delay\nD) Alice can legally withhold payment for the same duration as the contractor's delay\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from the given documentation and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The statute of limitations for breach of contract (4 years in Washington State) has not expired, so Alice is still legally obligated to pay for the work done.\n\n2. The contractor's significant delay in billing (6 months) does not negate Alice's responsibility to pay, but it does potentially weaken the contractor's position in negotiations.\n\n3. The contractor has likely lost the right to file a mechanic's lien after 90 days, reducing their leverage to enforce payment.\n\n4. While ethically Alice should pay for work done, the delay gives her more room to negotiate the final amount, especially if there were agreed-upon changes that need to be accounted for.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to bill hasn't expired within the statute of limitations. Option B is too extreme, as it doesn't account for the negotiating leverage Alice has gained. Option D suggests an incorrect interpretation of contract law, as there's no legal basis for withholding payment for an equal duration.

Is there any way a state could be expelled from the US without its consent? A Constitutional amendment could do this just as easily as one could allow a state to voluntarily secede, except that \"no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" If a state is removed from the Union, it obviously is not represented in the Senate. However, at this point, is it a state for the purposes of the constitution?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Constitution does not describe such a method, and no one has ever tried to do so.\n\nDuring and immediately following the U.S. Civil War, states that attempted to secede from the U.S. to join the Confederate States of America were not represented in Congress until their insurrections ceased and a post\\-war government approved by the Union forces in the Reconstruction era was in place. But this was not on the theory that these areas had ceased to be states, it was on the theory that there was a vacancy in the positions because these areas had not held elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, had not nominated U.S. Senators, and were in degradation of the U.S. Constitution once the 14th Amendment was adopted (denying the right to serve in office to confederate leaders until Congress acted otherwise).\n\nPrior the 14th Amendment this denial of U.S. government representation was simply viewed as a function of practical reality and the war powers of Congress, and perhaps the \"invasion or insurrection\" and \"Republican government\" clauses of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nCertainly there is no recognized roadmap for doing so today.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A state legislature, frustrated with federal policies, proposes a constitutional amendment to expel their state from the Union without the state's consent.

The correct answer is A because the Equal Suffrage Clause states that \"no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.\" Expelling a state without its consent would violate this principle, as it would lose its Senate representation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because retaining Senators for an expelled state would contradict the purpose of expulsion and create a paradoxical situation where a non-state has representation.\n\nOption C seems plausible but is a misconception. The Constitution doesn't provide a mechanism for involuntary loss of statehood, and interpreting it this way would create a loophole to circumvent the Equal Suffrage Clause.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while unanimous consent might seem logical, it's not a constitutional requirement for amendments.

So, if they are a plumber, then they are required to install the plumbing to the applicable building codes and to the standard that a reasonably competent plumber would do so.\n\nIf they fail to do the work or fail to do it to the required standard then they are liable for any damages the principal suffers as a result.\n\nFurther, an independent contractor is liable for any tort that they may commit against a third party.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, independent contractors are liable for their acts and omissions.

It is a good rule of thumb. When you are paying a professional to represent you, why make things complicated by speaking on your own behalf about the same issue?\n\nAs you point out, not everyone follows this rule. In some circumstances there might be benefits to discussing your case publicly, such as fundraising or deterrence. Whether the risk outweighs the benefits will depend on the details of the legal case and your role in it. Lawyers are likely to emphasise the following risks:\n\n* If you are a witness whose credibility is in issue, any public statement could potentially become a [prior inconsistent statement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_consistent_statements_and_prior_inconsistent_statements) which is used against you in cross\\-examination. Again, one of the purposes of hiring a lawyer is to be careful about how you communicate your position on a litigious matter and reduce the risk of careless remarks having unexpected consequences. Speaking publicly undermines this goal.\n* In Commonwealth countries, there is a significant risk that public comment on a case before the court could amount to [sub judice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_judice) contempt of court. Attempting to litigate the case in the media can be perceived as undermining the authority of the court. Lawyers are expected to uphold public confidence in the administration of justice and would be reluctant to condone anything that could be regarded as a contempt. This contributes to a culture where discussing active litigation is \"not the done thing\" and may itself cause problems with a witness's perceived credibility, aside from the risk of a contempt allegation.\n\nSpeaking publicly about litigation is risky and the consequences are difficult to predict, which is why people often engage lawyers to do it.

This question requires analysis and application of the concept to a real-world scenario (L3 in Bloom's taxonomy).\n\nThe correct answer (C) reflects the comprehensive nature of the term, covering both primary legislation (laws passed by parliament) and secondary legislation (regulations created by government departments under the authority of primary legislation).

Option B goes to the other extreme, excluding primary legislation which is a crucial component of the legal framework.

The review of the application of the law is more on the decisions the judge made and not the prosecutor. Typically if the judge was in error, the case is vacated and remanded to the lower court to be tried again with the recommended corrections to avoid the past mistake. This essentially means that the case that was appealed never happened (thus removing Double Jeopardy concerns and allowing the Prosecutor to try the defense again, if he still has sufficient cause to retry. Many cases where new evidence is produced will do this as the evidence might not be enough to change a Jury Panel's mind.).\n\nA successful first level appeal also unfetters the Prosecutor from Double Jeopardy restrictions.

My mom is nearing 60 years of age.\n\n**The issue**\n\nMy sister and I are like night and day. I completed both a bachelor's and a master's degree debt free, have $100,000\\+ in savings and got hired out of college as a software developer at a healthy $90,000 starting salary. My sister on the other hand has a long history of psychiatric problems, drug use and promiscuity. She has dropped out of college and has **net earnings of \\< $5,000 annually**. She never has more than $20 in her bank account and spends all her money on reiki healing, crystals and all that other pseudoscientific healing garbage. My sister also lives off my mom and has never held a serious job. **Psychiatrists have suggested diagnoses of both schizophrenia and/or borderline personality disorder**.\n\nI have severe concerns about inheriting a home jointly with someone who is disordered should anything happen to my mom. Myself and my sister get along (usually) however the big issue is that she has nowhere to go should my mom pass away and will refuse to sell the home whereas I want to sell the home as fast as possible such that I do not own a joint venture with her. **She does not understand that owning a home doesn't mean one \"owns\" the home \\- there is mortgage to pay, property taxes, utilities, etc. In her opinion, this is a conspiracy by Big Brother government to overthrow the public.** Inevitably, the home will be lost due non\\-payment, neglect, among other possibilities.\n\n**The question**\n\nA question from my mom: Is it possible to re\\-draft a will such that a third party could sell the home on our behalf? What are the steps involved?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: On this site, this question cannot be given an answer that will solve the issue. But directions as to what to explore/drive at can be given. Having researched these yourself, you will be in a far more equipped position when talking to a lawyer to get things underway.\n\n**Direction 1: Trusts**\n\nYour issue may not be solvable by a will because what a will does is essentially **distribute** assets. It simply specifies who gets what of what the deceased owned \u2014 as opposed to ordering people to do certain things. The house could certainly be granted to a third party, but there will be no way to oblige that party to sell it and transfer back to you; they could keep it for themselves and you and your sister would get nothing.\n\nA [trust](https://www.investopedia.com/university/estate-planning-guide/estate-planning5.asp) (instead of a will) can probably be a solution.\n\n**Direction 2: Guardianship of your sister**\n\nMentally ill persons can own property but their ability to decide what to do with it can be taken away by [guardianship](https://www.specialneedsalliance.org/guardianship-and-mental-illness/). So, if someone (you or a third party) obtains guardianship of your sister, she will no longer have a legal say of what to do with the house, but will still remain the beneficiary of her half of it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A mother is considering how to structure her estate to protect her two adult children with vastly different financial situations and capabilities.

Option B is the best solution because:\n\n1. A trust, as mentioned in Direction 1, allows for more complex instructions than a simple will. It can provide ongoing management of the asset beyond mere distribution.\n\n2. Using a neutral third party as trustee addresses the mother's question about having someone else sell the home on behalf of the children.\n\n3. A trust can be structured to protect the interests of both children while preventing the financially unstable child from mismanaging the property.\n\n4. It avoids the pitfalls of joint ownership (Option A), which could lead to the scenario the financially stable child fears - being unable to sell due to the other's refusal.\n\n5. Option C unfairly excludes one child and places a burden on the other, while Option D doesn't solve the management issues and could lead to property neglect.\n\n6. A trust can be designed to account for the younger child's mental health issues without requiring immediate guardianship proceedings, which addresses aspects of Direction 2 more flexibly.\n\nThis solution requires understanding of estate planning tools, consideration of mental health impacts on property management, and balancing the interests of multiple parties - demonstrating higher-order thinking in legal problem-solving."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/49943/is-a-minor-liable-to-pay-old-dues-to-his-father-on-attaining-majority", "docs_id": 49943, "title": "Is a minor liable to pay old dues to his father on attaining majority?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had some stepfathers and an equal number of fostermothers in my life.

The correct answer is C because the expenses incurred for raising a child, whether by biological parents, stepparents, or foster parents, are generally considered legal obligations or gifts, not loans to be repaid.\n\nKey points supporting this conclusion:\n1. There's no mention of any formal loan agreement made during the individual's minority.\n2. Guardians (legal or de facto) have an obligation to provide for a child's necessities.\n3.

If the authorities that enforce a statute affirm that they are not enforcing it, this is often enough to defeat a case on standing grounds.\n\nFor example, rather than establishing a landmark precedent decriminalizing polygamy (or declining to do so), the 10th Circuit held in *[Brown v. Buhman](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca10/14-4117/14-4117-2016-04-11.html)*, Case No. 14\\-4117 (10th Cir.

The correct answer is C because, as illustrated in the documentation, it is indeed possible for an unconstitutional law to remain in effect if no case with proper standing can be brought to challenge it. \n\nIn this scenario, the law's limited enforcement in a county without affected individuals creates a situation where it may be difficult to find plaintiffs with proper standing.

But if, somehow, it comes out that Fred was innocent of the crime, and he was actually trying to take the fall for Mark, then what consequences could Fred face?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A confession is (usually) taken after the court finishes its pre\\-trialing stage. There is a weightage and importance of such confession determined before the calculation of the gravity score of such crime.\n\nIf the attorney somehow (fakely) proves Fred as the killer, Mark is declared innocent, and later on its discovered that Fred is innocent; the court can take some action against Fred.\n\nIt would be first checked whether was Fred in a logical state of mind or not. If being manipulated by Mark, it would not be their fault of Fred. The court will also most likely see the age of the confessor to determine the importance of this. Here is a source from the National Registry of Exonerations which states the age of crime, and the percentage of groups with false crime declarations:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1rrf.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/x1rrf.jpg)\n\nOne reason is that minors can be easily psychologically manipulated, and so by chance Fred if under 18 would not be considered to give any worth of confession unless proven to go against him.\n\nIn some cases, the individual who made the false confession may be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice, particularly if their false confession led to an innocent person being convicted or if their false testimony impeded an ongoing investigation when the individual is not a minor. This is covered by perjury, a crime of expressing fake statements. In United States Code, Chapter 79 of Section 1632, it states:\n\n> (1\\) having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true; or\n\n> in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;\n> is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.\n\nThe following law only applies to a sensible adult, who has intentionally, without a psychological circumstance, made a false statement to defend someone. It is hard later, for the prosecutor to prove the claimant innocent if the confession has solid ground and worth.\n\n---\n\nNote that though false confession can come under perjury crime, an exemption exists for minors or those psychologically unwell or influenced. It reminds us of *Miranda v Arizona*, where Miranda, an inmate in prison cased over by Phoenix Police (Credits:[@TannerSwett](https://law.stackexchange.com/users/18320/tanner-swett)) who would torture an innocent inmate to confess a crime. In collective terms, it was called Miranda Warnings, where the inmate was warned, using torture to confess fakely.\n\nIt would be clear from torture. In the 1936 case *Brown v. Mississippi*, which was the first time the Supreme Court excluded a confession from a state court prosecution, this was the issue. For days, three suspects had been tortured. The deputy in charge testified when asked how hard one of the defendants had been whipped: Not too much for a Black person; not nearly as much as I would have done if I had been in charge.\n\nAn image of courtesy, The Crisis Magazine 1935:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVT2q.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/AVT2q.jpg)\n\nThe Supreme Court passed American reforms where Miranda was passed, and torturing was banned with evidence for both interrogation and confession. At the time Miranda was written, more \"modern\" methods of questioning were being used: rather than beating, isolation, deception, and exhaustion. It seems unlikely that an innocent suspect would confess to a serious crime if they were not subjected to torture or other forms of violence or death threats. Confessions are extremely potent forms of proof of guilt for precisely this reason.\n\nTo sum up, we conclude:\n\n1. If Fred was a stable adult, he is punished under the perjury crime\n2.

The correct answer, C, is the most likely to avoid copyright infringement while allowing publication. \n\nOption A doesn't sufficiently protect against copyright claims because, as stated in the documentation, \"the selection and arrangement of the effects attributed to each card is an expression of the author's creativity,\" and simply changing names and artwork wouldn't be enough if the mechanics remain identical.\n\nOption B still uses copyrighted elements (names and artwork) and is therefore likely to infringe, even with altered mechanics.\n\nOption D, while potentially protected under fair use for personal education, would likely not be considered fair use when published on GitHub due to its potential effect on the market value of the original work.\n\nOption C represents the best balance.

Otherwise, you have no basic for taking them to court. On the other and, you could be trying to say something entirely different, namely that someone has taken the name of your goods but not the goods themselves, and sold something else under your name (or a very close approximation therein). That could be trademark infringement, and you could go to court over that.\n\nThe nature of your product name would matter significant. If the product were named \"Artisanal Jewelry\", there is little hope for success for success in a lawsuit (given that this is not a registered name). Such a name is a descriptive mark, and you would have to prove that the public associates \"Artisanal Jewelry\" specifically with your product. If the product is named Xoachhcaox Jewelry, that is an arbitrary and unique name, and it would not be too difficult to establish that they have infringed your trademark right. Let's say that the competitor names their product Xoachcaox Jewelry \u2013 the likelihood that a person would be confused as to which is which is very high.

The correct answer is B, file a trademark infringement lawsuit. \n\nThe question presents a situation where there was no explicit contract regarding naming rights, ruling out option A (breach of contract).

As explained in the top answer, there's an implied \"acting reasonably\" expectation in contract law. The contractor cannot arbitrarily reject all proposed engineers without good reason, as this would frustrate the purpose of the clause.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the situation doesn't necessarily warrant contract termination. The doctrine of frustration typically applies when performance becomes impossible due to unforeseen circumstances, not when a party is being unreasonable.\n\nOption C, while potentially a last resort, is not the most likely first step. Courts generally prefer parties to resolve disputes within the framework of their contract before intervening directly.\n\nOption D, specific performance, is a possible remedy but less likely in this scenario. It's typically used for unique goods or services, not for selecting a third-party professional.\n\nThe implied covenant of good faith (B) is the most appropriate principle here. It requires the contractor to act reasonably in approving an engineer, balancing their right to approve with the need to give effect to the contract's dispute resolution mechanism. If the contractor persists in unreasonable rejections, this principle would allow the owner to seek court intervention based on the contractor's breach of this implied covenant, rather than immediately bypassing the contractual process."}, "25": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/35747/key-elements-of-software-engineering-nda", "docs_id": 35747, "title": "Key elements of software engineering NDA", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Everyone knows what an NDA is at a high level, a contract preventing one party from disclosing information deemed confidential by the other party. However, I am interested in how to write an NDA from scratch DIY without a lawyer, and am having a hard time finding any examples online that seem respectable.\n\nIf one would like to share information with another party (either an employee of another company or just a friend or acquaintance), I am confused as to what exactly would count as a valid NDA.\n\nFrom what I've seen, many of the example NDAs say something along the lines of \"...confidential information will be shared orally, and followed up in 30 days in written form so as to be valid.\" I was initially under the impression that just having the NDA say everything was purely communicated orally \\-\\- with nothing in writing \\-\\- would be sufficient. But maybe perhaps writing down what is confidential that was talked about somehow makes it better.\n\nAlso, I don't see how you can write it down efficiently enough, so as to avoid essentially creating a detailed patent document lol. If you describe orally something for an hour, that could be the outline of a patent in principle, so it would seem that you would then need to \"follow up with them in 30 days or less with a written form of the confidential information\". This to me seems (a) hard and time consuming, and (b) a security leak. At the same time it would help clarify exactly what was talked about, that's for sure.\n\nSo my question is, what the key attributes are of an effective (software related) one\\-sided NDA.\n\nIt seems to me that you could simply have a generic NDA for all of potential software ideas, saying basically \"Anything I share with you related to any legally allowable business activity or idea is confidential\" and that's it, not needing to list anything in particular. Once you start saying you need to list particular things, I don't see how you can avoid going down the rabbit hole and writing a detailed patent\\-like document.\n\nAlso I'm wondering what sorts of edge cases you must cover. Or, in general, if a legal document must cover every possible edge case, or can somehow just cover the main ones and leave the rest as assumed somehow. For example, some NDAs say something to the effect of \"You are free to reveal the confidential information to authorities if it comes down to it\" or \"You may disclose information to whomever if you first get written permission from me.\" I don't see why it's necessary to say this stuff. There's so much you could potentially say, I don't see why you can just leave this out. If it turns out that the situation comes up where they would like to disclose something in the future to someone, then they could ask you and you could come up with an amendment to the contract, or another contract specific to that. It seems better that way, rather than trying to cover every edge case, but I'm not sure what is the best approach.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is not that easy. There is no such thing as an all\\-encompassing perfect contract, nor are there magical words. In fact, many contracts contain uses language such as the one you found (example: the \"freedom\" to reveal confidential information to authorities \"if it comes down to it\") or are in violation of legislation.\n\nThe protocol you saw as to oral disclosure and its 30\\-day follow up really helps no purpose. It is unclear why that contract would outline that rule or how it would protect trade secrets.\n\nInstead, you should read court opinions and try various [search keywords](http://www.leagle.com/leaglesearch?all=software%20clause&exact=non%20disclosure%20agreement) to get an idea of how NDA controversies are decided.

I believe all of the examples can be addressed by the following rules:\n\n1. **A vehicle on a roadway has the right\\-of\\-way over a vehicle not on a roadway.** Therefore, the vehicle leaving a parking lot always yields to a vehicle in a parallel road.\n2. **Absent another rule, the vehicle on the right always has the right\\-of\\-way.** So if two vehicles are leaving adjacent parking lots, the left one waits for the right one to go if there is any potential conflict.\n\nOf course, not enough people know these rules, so in practice if you can't get the vehicle with the legal right\\-of\\-way to take it I teach drivers to be as decisive and cautious as possible: I.e., *take* the right\\-of\\-way, but not so fast that you can't avoid the other vehicle if it decides to go after all, because legally you will be at fault in a collision.

The correct order is determined as follows:\n\n1. Car A has priority over both B and C because it is on the main roadway, while B and C are exiting parking lots. As stated in the documentation, \"A vehicle on a roadway has the right-of-way over a vehicle not on a roadway.\"\n\n2. Between Cars B and C, which are both exiting parking lots, Car C has the right-of-way over Car B. This is because of the rule that \"Absent another rule, the vehicle on the right always has the right-of-way.\" From the perspective of a driver on the main road, Car C is to the right of Car B.\n\n3. Therefore, the correct order is:\n   - Car A proceeds first, turning right into the far parking lot.\n   - Car C goes second, turning right onto the main road after Car A has completed its turn.\n   - Car B goes last, turning left onto the main road after both A and C have cleared the intersection.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex traffic scenario, apply multiple rules simultaneously, and understand how these rules interact in a real-world situation.

In determining the appropriate legal remedy, which of the following is the most accurate application of the Constructive Trust doctrine in this scenario?\n\nA) Bob can only recover the $1 face value of the ticket, as that was the actual loss at the time of theft.\nB) Bob can recover $50 million, but must split it equally with Alice as she sold the winning ticket.\nC) Bob can recover the full $50 million based on Constructive Trust, as all elements are satisfied.\nD) Charlie keeps the winnings but must pay Bob $1 million as punitive damages for the theft.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario perfectly aligns with the Constructive Trust doctrine as outlined in the documentation. Let's analyze the four required elements:\n\n1. Wrongful appropriation: Charlie stole the lottery ticket from Bob, satisfying this element.\n2. Charlie has title: By attempting to claim the prize, Charlie effectively has title to the $50 million winnings.\n3. Bob can trace his property: The stolen $1 ticket directly led to the $50 million prize, establishing a clear trace.\n4. Unjust enrichment: Charlie would be unjustly enriched by $50 million if allowed to keep the winnings from a stolen ticket.\n\nAll four elements of Constructive Trust are met, allowing Bob to recover the full $50 million.

However, the documentation does not specify how vehicles are treated in the disposable capital calculation.\n\nGiven these factors, the most accurate answer is D. While the total assets exceed \u00a38,000, vehicles often have special considerations in means-testing for benefits and legal aid.

There are also data residency concerns that the website must be hosted on the University's servers instead of services like GitHub Pages or Netlify because of that.\n\nI view these concerns with a great deal of incredulity. **Is a site that collects no visitor data yet displays publicly available information affected by the GDPR?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Personal data is any information relating to an identifiable person, whether that information is public or not. The student website is definitely processing personal data of faculty. Any website is also necessarily processing personal data of visitors due to technical reasons, even though hosting has been outsourced to a third party. There's always a server, you just might not be managing it yourself.\n\nThus, GDPR applies.\n\nJust because it processes personal data doesn't mean that the student website would be illegal. It just means the students are responsible for GDPR compliance of that website. Since the website is controlled by students and not by the university, the university DPO has no say here and the university can't demand the website to be hosted in a particular manner. Nevertheless, the DPO's suggestions might be quite sensible.\n\nTypical GDPR compliance steps include:\n\n* having a clear purpose for which the personal data is being processed\n* having a legal basis for that processing (here, probably a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d which will require a balancing test), see Art 6\n* providing transparent information to the data subjects\n\t+ providing a privacy notice to website visitors, see Art 13\n\t+ notifying faculty per the requirements in Art 14 GDPR\n* preparing to fulfill data subject rights such as access, rectification, and erasure\n\t+ when using a legitimate interest, there's also a right to \u201cobject\u201d (opt\\-out)\n* implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure security and compliance of your processing activities, see Art 24\\+32\n* making sure that third parties to which you outsource processing activities are contractually bound as \u201cdata processors\u201d to only use the data as instructed by you, see Art 28\n* if you transfer data to non\\-European countries, having appropriate safeguards in place\n\nDoes this sound complicated? It can be complicated. The point is that the internet is no longer the lawless Wild West. Just because you *can* easily publish a site with personal data, doesn't mean that you *should*. The GDPR is about requiring data controllers to find an appropriate balance with the rights and interests of the affected persons. Of course there are countries with less regulation, but there are also countries with fewer taxes and that isn't necessarily good for society.\n\nThe easiest way to avoid these responsibilities will be to stop publishing the site as students \u2013 and instead taking up the university DPO's offer to have the university run the site. Which is less fun, of course, but the adult thing to do. If this motivates you further: note that the data controller (the people responsible for the site) must publish their contact information in the privacy notice, typically name \\+ email \\+ street address.\n\nThe GDPR contains no exceptions that would help here.\n\n* There is an exception for purely personal or household activities. But if the website would be available to the general public, it would be difficult to argue that this is purely personal. There's also case law such as the *Lindqvist* case requiring a narrow interpretation of that exception.\n* In Art 9, the GDPR does mention that some restrictions are lifted if the data subject made the information public themselves.

Option A is incorrect because, as the documentation states, GDPR applies to any processing of personal data, regardless of whether it's public or if visitor data is collected. The site is still processing faculty members' personal data.\n\nOption B is the most appropriate action.

In saying \"*reduce* the Software to a human\\-perceivable form\", the choice of the word \"reduce\" is no doubt significant. A reasonable man would conclude that an effort to simplify the raw binary code into something more graspable (such as opcodes) is a reduction to perceivable form. However, a screen dump via cat or a hex print doesn't affect the informational content of the file, it just changes the mode of representation: it makes it perceivable, but does not reduce the software in any way (does not reduce the entropy of the bit pattern). If they had intended to say \"*render* it in a human perceivable form\", they could have, so we should focus on the impact of \"reduce\".

While it makes the binary data viewable, it doesn't inherently reduce or simplify the software's complexity, as mentioned in the top answer: \"a hex print doesn't affect the informational content of the file, it just changes the mode of representation.\"\n\nOption C (logging system calls and API usage) is a form of dynamic analysis that doesn't directly involve transforming the executable itself. While it provides information about the software's behavior, it doesn't reduce the software to a human-perceivable form in the same way as disassembly.\n\nOption D (using 'cat' to print the executable) is explicitly mentioned in the documentation as likely not violating the license, as it doesn't reduce or simplify the software's content.\n\nThis question tests the ability to interpret legal language in a technical context, understand the nuances of different reverse engineering techniques, and apply critical thinking to determine which actions most clearly violate the spirit and letter of the license agreement."}, "36": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89450/what-laws-prove-tax-protesters-are-wrong", "docs_id": 89450, "title": "What laws prove tax protesters are wrong?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Tax protesters are frequently penalized for raising the \"frivolous\" argument that the individual income tax is not mandatory but voluntary.\n\nCan anyone provide the specific provision of the tax codethat states that the income tax on individuals (not businesses) is mandatory and not voluntary?\n\nI have not found it myself, but I would like to have it to reference when I am approached with this topic in conversation.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The 16th Amendment to the Constitution says:\n\n\"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.\"\n\nCongress has exercised that power and the main controlling law is in the United States Code, Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter A, Part I \\- Tax on Individuals.\n\nYou can read it yourself at:\n[US Tax Code](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section1&num=0&edition=prelim)\n\nThere are multiple possibilities based on your situation, which you did not specify, but, for example there is this:\n\n[![Tax on married individuals](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mpVyY.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mpVyY.png)\n\nAs far as mandatory, vs. voluntary, the code also gives the Internal Revenue Service the power and authority to enforce the Internal Revenue Code:\n\n26 U.S. Code \u00a7 7608 \\- Authority of internal revenue enforcement officers\n\nIt also has numerous sections on the penalties for failing to obey the code, which I will not quote here, but which you can easily find for yourself.\n\nSo in answer to your question:\n\n1.

This mechanism has been used in the past e.g. to force the Irish DPA to correctly apply the GDPR against companies from the Meta group, like WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nThough it might slow things down, it could be advantageous to have multiple DPAs involved, precisely so that the investigation is double\\-checked. If the lead supervisory authority declines the case, this would also enable the other DPA to do its own investigation.\n\nSo, it would be a good idea to lodge a complaint with the DPA of your home country, and let it forward the issue to other DPAs as needed.

These laws are not intended to protect adult robbers (if the person engaged in robbery were an armed seven years old, that might be another story). California, however, has discarded the attractive nuisance doctrine that used to be part of its law, in 1970, in the case of *Beard v. Atchison*.\n\n**Common Law Premises Liability In California**\n\nThe common law duty that a property owner owes to trespassers is to keep it free of deadly traps. You have liability if you turn your lawn into a literal mine field full of explosive land mines. But, you did not at common law owe a duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable accidental injury to trespassers such as robbers. So, there would be no common law duty here.\n\nBut, California has abandoned the strict common law distinction in premises liability between invitees, licensees, and trespassers in lieu of a general duty to use reasonable care that is fairly tailored to the precise circumstances of the accident. [California Civil Jury Instruction No. 1001](https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1000/1001/) (2000\\) citing *Ann M. v.Pacific Plaza Shopping Center*, 6 Cal.4th 666, 674\\-675, 25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207 (1993\\).\n\nCalifornia, rather than focusing on the nature of the duty that the landlord owes to a trespasser, focuses more on this factor as part of the question of issues like whether the harm was foreseeable.\n\n**A Statute That Is On Point And Controlling Here**\n\nDespite this evolution in California's common law of premises liability, however, California does have a statute that singles out felons who are injured on someone else's property in the course of a felony, specifically, [California Civil Code \u00a7 847](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/civil-code/civ-sect-847.html), which states (emphasis added):\n\n> (a)\u2002**An owner**, including, but not limited to, a public entity, as\n> defined in Section 811\\.2 of the Government Code , of any estate or any\n> other interest in real property, whether possessory or nonpossessory,\n> **shall not be liable to any person for any injury or death that occurs upon that property during the course of or after the commission\n> of any of the felonies set forth in subdivision (b) by the injured or\n> deceased person.**\n> \n> \n> (b)\u2002The felonies to which the provisions of this section apply are the\n> following: \u2009(1\\) Murder or voluntary manslaughter; \u2009(2\\) mayhem; \u2009(3\\)\n> rape; \u2009(4\\) sodomy by force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of\n> great bodily harm; \u2009(5\\) oral copulation by force, violence, duress,\n> menace, or threat of great bodily harm; \u2009(6\\) lewd acts on a child\n> under the age of 14 years; \u2009(7\\) any felony punishable by death or\n> imprisonment in the state prison for life; \u2009(8\\) any other felony in\n> which the defendant inflicts great bodily injury on any person, other\n> than an accomplice, or any felony in which the defendant uses a\n> firearm; \u2009(9\\) attempted murder; \u2009(10\\) assault with intent to commit\n> rape or robbery; \u2009(11\\) assault with a deadly weapon or instrument on a\n> peace officer; \u2009(12\\) assault by a life prisoner on a noninmate; \u2009(13\\)\n> assault with a deadly weapon by an inmate; \u2009(14\\) arson; \u2009(15\\)\n> exploding a destructive device or any explosive with intent to injure;\n> \u2009(16\\) exploding a destructive device or any explosive causing great\n> bodily injury; \u2009(17\\) exploding a destructive device or any explosive\n> with intent to murder; \u2009(18\\) burglary; \u2009**(19\\) robbery**; \u2009(20\\)\n> kidnapping; \u2009(21\\) taking of a hostage by an inmate of a state prison;\n> \u2009(22\\) any felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or\n> deadly weapon; \u2009(23\\) selling, furnishing, administering, or providing\n> heroin, cocaine, or phencyclidine (PCP) to a minor; \u2009(24\\) grand theft\n> as defined in Sections 487 and 487a of the Penal Code ; \u2009and (25\\) any\n> attempt to commit a crime listed in this subdivision other than an\n> assault.\n> \n> \n> (c)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section arises at\n> the moment the injured or deceased person commences the felony or\n> attempted felony and extends to the moment the injured or deceased\n> person is no longer upon the property.\n> \n> \n> (d)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section applies only\n> when the injured or deceased person's conduct in furtherance of the\n> commission of a felony specified in subdivision (b) proximately or\n> legally causes the injury or death.\n> \n> \n> (e)\u2002The limitation on liability conferred by this section arises only\n> upon the charge of a felony listed in subdivision (b) and the\n> subsequent conviction of that felony or a lesser included felony or\n> misdemeanor arising from a charge of a felony listed in subdivision\n> (b). \u2002During the pendency of any such criminal action, a civil action\n> alleging this liability shall be abated and the statute of limitations\n> on the civil cause of action shall be tolled.\n> \n> \n> (f)\u2002This section does not limit the liability of an owner or an\n> owner's agent which otherwise exists for willful, wanton, or criminal\n> conduct, or for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against\n> a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.\n> \n> \n> (g)\u2002The limitation on liability provided by this section shall be in\n> addition to any other available defense.\n\nThis statute is controlling and would probably immunize the property owner from liability in the fact pattern of the question.

The correct answer is B, based on California Civil Code \u00a7 847. This statute specifically protects property owners from liability for injuries or deaths that occur on their property during the commission of certain felonies, including robbery.\n\nWhile the homeowner violated the Santa Monica Municipal Code regarding pool fencing, this violation is superseded by the state-level protection provided by Civil Code \u00a7 847. The statute states that an owner \"shall not be liable to any person for any injury or death that occurs upon that property during the course of or after the commission of any of the felonies set forth in subdivision (b),\" which explicitly includes robbery.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, although the homeowner violated the fencing ordinance, negligence per se does not apply in this case due to the overriding protection of Civil Code \u00a7 847. Additionally, pool fencing laws are primarily intended to protect children, not adult intruders.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the homeowner's failure to fence the pool, while a code violation, does not rise to the level of criminal negligence required for involuntary manslaughter charges, especially given the circumstances of the intruder's felonious entry.\n\nOption D is plausible but ultimately incorrect.

The laws in question such as [18 USC 2251](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2251) refer to the fact that the minor \"engage\\[s] in, any sexually explicit conduct\". Sexually explicit conduct is defined in [18 USC 2256](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256), and would include \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\" (which does not include nipples of anyone). Federal law does not define \"lascivious\", but the ordinary meaning of the word does not include the situation that you describe. The Justice Department, which goes after child pornographers, provides [this guide to federal child porn laws](https://www.justice.gov/criminal-ceos/citizens-guide-us-federal-law-child-pornography).\n\n[Georgia's child porn law](https://law.justia.com/codes/georgia/2010/title-16/chapter-12/article-3/part-2/16-12-100) is only marginally different, referring to \"Lewd exhibition\" rather than \"Lascivious exhibition\" , and including the \"Condition of being fettered, bound, or otherwise physically restrained on the part of a person who is nude\" (so a picture of a person holding a naked baby would technically qualify, but is highly unlikely to be prosecuted as production of child porn).\n\nThese laws pertain to any form of child porn, including \"private use only\". Dissemination would be an added charge.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A professional photographer is hired to document a family's day at the beach, which includes young children playing in the sand and water. During the photoshoot, a 2-year-old girl removes her swimsuit top. The photographer captures candid shots of the child building sandcastles. Later, the child's mother becomes concerned about potential legal issues. Which of the following best describes the legal status of these photographs under federal law?\n\nA) The photographs are automatically classified as child pornography due to the child's exposed chest.\nB) The photographs are legal as long as they are kept for private family use only.\nC) The photographs are likely legal, as context and intent are crucial in determining if an image constitutes child pornography.\nD) The photographs are legal only if the child's chest is digitally censored before any viewing or distribution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the legal concepts presented in the documentation. The correct answer is C because the key factors in determining whether an image constitutes child pornography under federal law are context and intent, not merely the presence of nudity. \n\nThe documentation states that \"There is no law against taking a picture of a child who is entirely naked or exposing certain body parts.\" It emphasizes that the legal issue arises when a minor engages in \"sexually explicit conduct,\" which is defined to include \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\" Importantly, this definition does not include nipples or chest areas of young children.\n\nThe scenario described in the question involves a non-sexual context (a family beach outing) and lacks any indication of lascivious intent. The photographer is documenting normal childhood activities, not creating sexually explicit material.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the law and ignores the crucial elements of context and intent. Option B is a common misconception; the legality of the photographs doesn't depend on whether they're kept private. Option D presents another misconception, suggesting that censorship is necessary when it isn't required by law in this context.\n\nThis question challenges test-takers to apply legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking about the nuances of child pornography laws rather than simple memorization of facts."}, "41": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46366/given-the-doctrine-of-contra-proferentem-wouldnt-it-be-better-for-the-non-draft", "docs_id": 46366, "title": "Given the doctrine of Contra proferentem wouldn&#39;t it be better for the non-drafting party to not point out ambiguity?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question is a follow up to [If a party says something about interpretation of contract, is it binding?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/38269/if-a-party-says-something-about-interpretation-of-contract-is-it-binding) Since courts usually interpret an ambiguous term [in the favor of the party that did not draft it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem), why would the non\\-drafting party want clarification?

Everett WA has [local ordinances](https://www.codepublishing.com/WA/Everett/html/Everett10/Everett1024.html#10.24.010) against \"lewd conduct\" (there are versions of this at the state level and in most municipalities). Having sex and masturbation are included in the class of \"lewd acts\", and are also included in \"sexual conduct\". An activity is \"obscene\" if three things are true. First, \n\n> the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would\n>  find, when considered as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest\n\nand\n\n> when considered as a whole, and in the context in which it is used,\n>  lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\n\nI think having sex or masturbating could pass these two tests. The third condition is that the act\n\n> explicitly depicts or describes patently offensive representations or\n>  descriptions of... \\[sex, masturbation, or excretion]\n\nThe prohibition is more narrow:\n\n> A person is guilty of lewd conduct if he or she intentionally performs\n>  any lewd act in a public place or under circumstances where such act\n>  is likely to be observed by any member of the public.\n\nIf lewd conduct were completely illegal, you could not excrete or have sex withing the city limits. Now we have to turn to the definition of \"public place\":\n\n> an area generally visible to public view, and includes streets,\n>  sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots,\n>  automobiles (whether moving or not), buildings open to the general\n>  public, including those which serve food or drink or provide\n>  entertainment and the doorways and entrances to buildings or dwellings\n>  and the grounds enclosing them, and businesses contained in structures\n>  which can serve customers who remain in their vehicles, by means of a\n>  drive\\-up window\n\nFocusing not on the probable intent but on the words, it is primarily defined as \"an area generally visible to public view\". Your house *qua* building is probably generally visible to public view, as is a public toilet or hotel. The inside of your bedroom is probably not generally visible to public view, nor is the inside of a toilet stall. While the building is probably a public place, a closed stall within the building does not meet the definition (nor does a hotel room). It *might* however qualify under the clause \"or under circumstances where such act is likely to be observed by any member of the public\". The statute does not give a definition of \"observe\", but under ordinary language interpretation, observation may be seeing or hearing. Silent sex, masturbation or defecation might not qualify as being public. \n\nObviously, excretion in a stall of a public bathroom cannot be a lewd act, presumably because the average person does not generally consider ordinary excretion as appealing to the prurient interest: but there could be contexts where it does.\n\nAnother avenue for prosecution is the [Indecent Exposure](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.88.010) state law which is when one\n\n> intentionally makes any open and obscene exposure of his or her person\n>  or the person of another knowing that such conduct is likely to cause\n>  reasonable affront or alarm.\n\nIt is totally non\\-obvious that sex or masturbation in a toilet stall is \"open\". There is a slippery slope regarding quiet sex or masturbation w.r.t. knowing that the conduct is likely to cause reasonable affront or alarm.\n\nBecause the contexts where sex and masturbation are not clearly spelled out by statutory law, the matter would depend on how courts had interpreted previous cases. There have been arrests in Washington of people having bathroom sex, but I don't know if anyone has ever or recently\\-enough been convicted for having quiet sex out of view in a toilet stall, or similar place. There is a potentially applicable case, [Seattle v. Johnson](https://casetext.com/case/seattle-v-johnson), 58 Wn. App. 64, which seems to involve public sex, and the conviction was overturned because the complaint was defective, in not including the element \"that the defendant must know 'that such conduct is likely to cause reasonable affront or alarm'\".

Neither the shooter nor the decedent was aware that a safety net had been erected at the 8th floor level to protect some window washers, and that the decedent would most likely not have been able to complete his intent to commit suicide because of this.\n> \n> \n> Ordinarily, a person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds, even if the mechanism might not be what they intended, is defined as having committed suicide. That he was shot on the way to certain death nine storeys below probably would not change his mode of death from suicide to homicide, but the fact that his suicide intent would not have been achieved under any circumstance caused the medical examiner to feel that he had homicide on his hands.\n> \n> \n> Further investigation led to the discovery that the room on the 9th floor whence the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and his wife. He was threatening her with the shotgun because of an interspousal spat and became so upset that he could not hold the shotgun straight. Therefore, when he pulled the trigger, he completely missed his wife, and the pellets went through the window, striking the decedent.\n> \n> \n> When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. It was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun. He had no intent to murder her; therefore, the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.\n> \n> \n> But further investigation turned up a witness that their son was seen loading the shotgun approximately six weeks prior to the fatal accident. That investigation showed that the mother (the old lady) had cut off her son's financial support, and her son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun threateningly, loaded the gun with the expectation that the father would shoot his mother. The case now becomes one of murder on the part of the son for the death of Ronald Opus.\n> \n> \n> Now comes the exquisite twist. Further investigation revealed that the son, Ronald Opus himself, had become increasingly despondent over the failure of his attempt to get his mother murdered. This led him to jump off the ten\\-story building on March 23, only to be killed by a shotgun blast through a 9th story window.\n> \n> \n> The medical examiner closed the case as a suicide.\n\nI feel like this sequence of interpretations both makes sense and doesn't make sense. For example, I'm surprised that in the 4th paragraph, they're talking about murder instead of manslaughter, which seems more appropriate for an accidental killing.\n\nNow, I know that law requires a jurisdiction. Since the original creator of the story worked at the universities of Cincinnati and Southern California, I'm wondering whether the above story, and especially the legal claims and observations the forensic examiner make, hold up under Ohio or California law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No it's not.\n\nThis is important because we have an inaccuracy in this paragraph:\n\n> When one intends to kill subject A but kills subject B in the attempt, one is guilty of the murder of subject B. The old man was confronted with this conclusion, but both he and his wife were adamant in stating that neither knew that the shotgun was loaded. It was the longtime habit of the old man to threaten his wife with an unloaded shotgun. **He had no intent to murder her; therefore, the killing of the decedent appeared then to be accident. That is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.**\n\nThere's a riddle that many people who are teaching gun safety courses like to ask their class to drive the point home early: \"How can you tell if a gun is unloaded? Answer: The Gun is always loaded!\" The point here is that one should never, ever treat a gun as if it is unloaded. Always assume that it is loaded and ready to be fired, and will destroy the thing it is pointed at. Because of this, in the United States, the act of pointing a gun at someone in a threatening manner (and without affirmative defense of self\\-defense) constitutes an assault **even if the person pointing the gun knows it's not loaded, inoperable, or not even a real gun.** So the husband, by dint of the fact that he pointed a gun that the wife reasonably believed was a work, albeit unloaded, gun at her, had assaulted his spouse (assault need not include physical harm aka Battery but only the threat of physical harm, by most legal definitions.).\n\nIn addition, in U.S. common law, there is a provision called \"Felony Murder\" in all jurisdictions. This legal concept states that if, while in the comission of a felony crime, someone dies, you are guilty of 1st Degree Murder (if the crime is a misdemenor, you are guilty of \"Misdemenor Manslaughter/3rd degree murder). This is not something you want to face because you need not prove that you killed the person but that you committed a crime and someone in proximity to this act died (The classic example is a bank robber yells \"this is a stick up! Nobod move unless I tell you. Teller, give me all the money in the vault!\" and after saying this, a little old lady who was there to deposit her social security check has a fatal heart attack and dies. Even though the robber didn't even point the gun at her, he is now guilty of Felony Murder because she died while he robbed the bank. Doesn't matter if her heart attack was induced by the excitement of the situation or she didn't get proper medical attention because EMS will not enter a hostile situation until the police clear it or that her heart attack had nothing to do with this.). Thus, because the Husband was committing a felonious crime (assault) upon his wife, the fact that the man jumping had the misfortune of being at the wrong place at the wrong time does not matter. The Husband murdered the man with intent because he intended to assault his wife by threatening her with his gun and thus is liable for the legal consequences related to that crime. Intent to committ murder does not factor here.\n\nWhat's more, at trial this is easy to prove as the investigating officers would be able to testify that the husband and wife both told them at the scene that they believed the gun was unloaded (Stupid but not a crime) when he pointed the gun at her (stupid and a crime).\nThis is not a violation of hearsay as statements against the opposite party's interests are admissable under U.S. rules of evidence. The Husband would not be required to testify as he has a fifth amendment right against self\\-incrimination and the prosecution could not call the wife under spousal\\-immunity privilege (unless she waived it), but this is something their attorney would need them to try and refute.\n\nFurthermore, the cornor would likely not rule this a suicide unless he/she learned of the details of the man's death prior to or during the course of the autopsy. There would be trace evidence (glass from the window) or lack of trace evidence (lack of Gun Shot Residue) to lead the cornor to conclude the fatal injury was a gun shot, not a suicide by jump. I'm no doctor, but I'm pretty sure the two injuries look nothing alike.\n\nAdditionally, there are cases that would come into play even if somehow the fall (and not the sudden stop) killed our jumper. As a general rule, it's murder if you inflict a fatal injury to what you reasonabley believe to be a dead person that is infact a living person (or if you inflict a seemingly fatal injury to what you reasonably believe to be a living person that is in fact a dead person), so the fact that the jumper was going to die no matter what doesn't mitigate that the death by fall was not what killed him.\n\nFinally, as crazy as it may seem, humans have survived falls from greater heights. There are multiple recorded instances of people who tried to jump from the Golden Gate Bridge (the second most popular suicide spot in the world) and seemingly miraculously lived to tell of the experience. The deck of the Golden Gate bridge is 245 feet from the water's surface, which makes this a fall from 23 stories up, more than double the building height in this scenario. As a general rule, it's a good bet someone jumping from 10 stories (108 feet) will die, it's not a garentee as we have multiple survivors who jumped from 245 feet and lived.\n\nIn conclusion, Coronors do not work that way, nor does the law. The only thing saving the man from conviction is a sympathetic jury that finds that it's not illegal to accidentally kill a man who is in the process of committing suicide. Given the facts of this case, I find it hard to get twelve people to sympathize with the man, but hey, stranger things have happened.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: In the Ronald Opus case, the elderly man who fired the shotgun is initially considered for murder charges. However, given the complexities of the case and legal principles, which of the following best describes the most likely legal outcome for the elderly man under U.S. common law?\n\nA) He would be charged with manslaughter due to the accidental nature of the shooting\nB) He would be acquitted of all charges because he believed the gun was unloaded\nC) He would be convicted of felony murder due to the death occurring during the commission of assault\nD) He would be charged with negligent homicide for failing to check if the gun was loaded\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their application to a complex scenario. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The elderly man committed assault by pointing a gun at his wife, regardless of whether he believed it was unloaded. In U.S. law, pointing a gun at someone in a threatening manner constitutes assault, even if the person knows it's not loaded or functional.\n\n2. The concept of \"Felony Murder\" applies in this case. Under U.S. common law, if someone dies during the commission of a felony (in this case, assault), the perpetrator can be charged with first-degree murder, regardless of their intent to kill.\n\n3. The man's belief that the gun was unloaded does not negate the felony murder charge, as he still committed the underlying felony of assault.\n\n4. Option A (manslaughter) is incorrect because felony murder supersedes considerations of accidental death.\n\n5. Option B (acquittal) is incorrect because the belief that the gun was unloaded does not negate the assault charge or the resulting felony murder.\n\n6. Option D (negligent homicide) is incorrect because it doesn't account for the felony murder rule and understates the severity of the crime.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple legal concepts, apply them to a complex scenario, and understand the nuances of criminal law beyond simple intent-based classifications."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58719/what-is-the-legal-understanding-of-institutional-racism", "docs_id": 58719, "title": "What is the legal understanding of &#39;institutional racism&#39;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is racism and there is institutionsed racism.

It is also unlawful to discriminate on the basis of race in several other situations, such as jury service, law enforcement actions, and official governmental business. There are similar prohibitions of discrimination on the basis of color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or age. Some states or localities add additional classes that are protected against discrimination and some add additional situations where protection id available.\n\nDiscrimination on the basis of race is prohibited regardless of whether the motive is individual or institutional racism. From a legal standpoint, there is no difference. However, if institutional racism is know to exist in a particular setting, or can be proved to exist, that might be evidence which will help to prove that a particular action was racial discrimination.\n\nNote that it is not illegal in the US to discriminate on the basis of race where no anti\\-discrimination law applies, nor to discriminate against people on a basis that is not a protected class (for example against left\\-handed people). Such actions may incur public disfavor, but not legal redress.\n\nSo (in the US at least) there really is no \"legal understanding\" of *institutional racism* or indeed of *racism* in any form. There is only the legal concept of unlawful discrimination on the basis of race.

Prior to us living there the space was used as an office and work space for a dog grooming business (there is a very small bedroom, bathroom, shower and another room kept constantly locked because they're growing pot in it, supposedly legally.) We are not allowed to have anything in the main entry way because they still come down frequently to tend their marijuana plants and occasionally wash dogs. The lease is for a set duration of time (through the end of July).\n\nThey did not provide us with a copy of the lease agreement, although we asked, and my understanding is that any part of a lease that violates tenant law is unenforceable.\n\nFrom memory, I recall the lease stating that they may enter the unit whenever they wish with or without notice, that although they are permitting us to have our 2 cats, in situations where they need to use the unit for dog washing, the cats are to be confined to the small bedroom. Also that they may, at any point, with our without cause, terminate the lease, at which point we must vacate within 5 days.\n\nThe \"landlord\" isn't exactly the nicest of people, and the floor/ceiling is extremely thin, so every small noise from the main house is heard in our living area, yet we're expected to stay extremely quiet.

Under [RCW 59\\.18\\.150](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.150), the landlord may enter the unit in case of an emergency, and otherwise\n\n> shall give the tenant at least two days' written notice of his or her\n>  intent to enter and shall enter only at reasonable times.

The situation with dog\\-washing is unclear, since normally a landlord can't decide to use a person's apartment for a dog\\-washing operation (the common law right to quiet enjoyment). If there is such a clause in the lease then that would be allowed, but they can't now decide that they have this right (the terms of a lease can't be changed in the middle). They can restrict the cats from areas outside your unit.

Option C is the most appropriate and legally sound response because:\n\n1. Under RCW 59.18.065, the tenant has a right to obtain a copy of the lease, which the landlord must provide.\n\n2.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The school must inform the student of the specific offense as per Section 11(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\nB) The school can proceed with punishment without informing the student, as internal disciplinary matters are exempt from Charter protections\nC) The school must follow criminal procedure guidelines, including formal charges and a trial\nD) The student can invoke Section 11(a) to delay the disciplinary process indefinitely\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in a real-world scenario. The correct answer is B because Section 11(a) of the Charter, as explained in the documentation, only applies to criminal offences and quasi-criminal offences with criminal proceedings. This was established in the Guindon v. Canada case (2015 SCC 41). \n\nSchool disciplinary actions, even serious ones like suspension for cheating, do not fall under the category of criminal or quasi-criminal offences. They are internal administrative matters governed by school policies and education laws, not by criminal law or the Charter.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misapplies the Charter to a non-criminal context. Option C is incorrect because it wrongly suggests that school disciplinary matters follow criminal procedures.

Both agree.\n\nCOLLAGER then sends ARTIST a proposed layout, which has \"\u00a9 COLLAGER \\[year].\" written unambiguously on the collage.

And is signing next to it considered assent? As long as COLLAGER doesn't say that the previous contract is void/replaced, does ARTIST have any risk of losing copyright ownership to COLLAGER?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The artist and collager have a contract that states that the artist retains the copyright to the final collective work. To arrive at any other outcome, they both must agree to a new contract. One could argue that no new contract was agreed to for two separate reasons:\n\nFirstly, the request to \"approve by signing next to the copyright statement\" is not very specific, understandable contract language that unambiguously is intended to transfer the copyright to the collager. Whether the specific language the collager used to make the new proposal is indeed a contract is debatable. A contract requires \"mutual assent\", which is tested legally by how a \"reasonable person\" would interpret the contract \\- it's far from guaranteed that most reasonable people would interpret the correspondence as a mutual decision intended to transfer copyright.\n\nSecondly, a contract requires *consideration* \\- one cannot enter into a contract where one side gets unilateral benefit and the other side gets nothing whatsoever. Even if the language used would constitute terms specific enough for a contract, there is certainly no consideration involved \\- the collager is proposing that they get the copyright to the collective work, while the artist gets nothing. Because there is no consideration for the artist, it is not a valid contract.\n\nFor these two reasons (especially the second one), the artist has a strong case that they have not entered into any other contract or contract amendment other than what they originally agreed to, which states that the artist owns the copyrights to both the original and collective works. The legal argument is that collager never proposed a valid new contract, because they used ambiguous language that did not result in mutual assent, and did not offer anything in return.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: ARTIST and COLLAGER have a contract for creating a collage using ARTIST's works.

The correct answer is C because ARTIST retains copyright ownership due to lack of consideration in COLLAGER's implied proposal. \n\nThe original contract explicitly states that ARTIST retains all copyright of individual works and the final collective work. For this to change, a new valid contract or amendment would be required. COLLAGER's request for approval and the copyright statement do not constitute a valid contract modification for two key reasons:\n\n1. Lack of clear mutual assent: The language used by COLLAGER (\"Please approve this by signing next to the copyright statement\") is ambiguous and doesn't clearly communicate an intent to transfer copyright. A \"reasonable person\" standard would likely not interpret this as a clear offer to modify the existing contract terms.\n\n2. Lack of consideration: More importantly, even if the language was clear enough to be considered an offer, there is no consideration provided to ARTIST. In contract law, consideration (something of value exchanged) is essential for a valid contract. COLLAGER is essentially asking for the copyright without offering anything in return to ARTIST.\n\nOption A is incorrect because signing next to a copyright statement, especially in the context of approving a layout, does not automatically transfer copyright ownership, particularly when there's an existing contract stating otherwise.\n\nOption B is incorrect because COLLAGER's request lacks the necessary elements of a valid contract amendment, primarily due to the absence of consideration and clear mutual assent.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a copyright statement on a layout proposal does not have the power to void a pre-existing contractual agreement about copyright ownership.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply contract law principles to a real-world scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts (copyright law, contract formation, and contract modification) and critical thinking about the legal implications of actions in a business context."}, "70": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/34025/i-live-in-bulgaria-should-i-worry-about-a-patent-that-has-been-granted-in-the-u", "docs_id": 34025, "title": "I live in Bulgaria.

The correct answer, C, represents the most strategic approach given the current state of unjust enrichment law as described in the documentation.\n\nArguing solely based on 'unjust factors' (option A) might be limiting, as it relies on fitting the case into established categories, which may not fully capture the complexities of international tax overpayments. Similarly, focusing exclusively on the 'absence of basis' approach (option B) might be risky in a jurisdiction that hasn't fully adopted this theory.\n\nThe hybrid approach (C) allows for a more comprehensive argument.

The correct answer, B, provides the most legally sound approach that balances the tenant's rights with legal obligations.\n\nOption A, while tempting given the poor conditions, risks putting the tenant in breach of the lease without following proper procedures.

Option B is the most effective and legally feasible strategy based on the information provided and historical precedents.\n\nThe Nazi party's use of the Enabling Act and Reichstag Fire Decree, as mentioned in the documentation, provides a historical example of gradually amending laws to consolidate power.

Option C, ruling by decree, is more associated with military coups and would lack the veneer of legitimacy that option B provides.

For example, a smart lightbulb might expose a `SetBrightness(value)` interface that other software can use to actuate the bulb's functions. Now that the 12\\-year battle of [Google v. Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.#Decision) is over, with SCOTUS ruling in favor of Google, is the non\\-copyrightability of software APIs considered settled law?\n\nI was considering using a GPL\\-licensed library that claims that merely *referencing* the library's API, even if the library is not actually included in the product, would require the entire project to be GPL. In light of Google v. Oracle, it *seems* like that claim is no longer valid. Is my interpretation correct, or am I missing something? Obviously, anyone can sue anyone for anything, but in light of the SCOTUS decision it seems that if the author of a GPL library were to bring suit against another for using the API *without the library*, it would probably be easy to get a summary dismissal with that case as the basis.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not settled law: neither the copyright question, nor the fair use question.\n\nIn [*Google LLC v. Oracle America, Inc.*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/593/18-956/#tab-opinion-4382274), 593 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2021\\), the US Supreme Court addressed the reproduction of a [subset of the Java API](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/9530/46948).\n\nThe majority assumed for the sake of argument that the Java API was protected by copyright, but went on to hold that the reproduction was a fair use.\n\n> We shall assume, but purely for argument\u2019s sake, that the entire Sun Java API falls within the definition of that which can be copyrighted. We shall ask instead whether Google\u2019s use of part of that API was a \u201cfair use.\u201d Unlike the Federal Circuit, we conclude that it was.\n\nSo, it is an open question whether an API is protected by copyright, but the precedent from the Federal Circuit will be persuasive authority. The Federal Circuit held that the API is protected by copyright and the Supreme Court did not upset that conclusion.\n\nSecond, the factors that led the court to conclude the reproduction of part of the Java API was fair use could turn out another way in another fact scenario. Some of the reasoning seems to generalize, but some seems specific to the Java development ecosystem. Briefly, the court recognized:\n\n* API authorship is a creative process, but is \"functional in nature\"\n* The reproduction was intended to assist interoperability; it was commercial; there was no evidence of bad faith\n* The amount of code taken was a small amount of the entire Java work, an amount consistent with its goals\n* The market harms to Oracle were dubious\n\nMy prediction is that there will continue to be significant case\\-by\\-case uncertainty as to the applicability of the fair\\-use defence in this context.\n\n---\n\nHowever, *Google v. Oracle* was about API *reproduction*, not API use.

The company is sued for copyright infringement. Given the context of the Google v. Oracle case and current legal understanding, what is the most likely outcome of this lawsuit?\n\nA) The lawsuit will be summarily dismissed as APIs are not copyrightable\nB) The company will be found guilty of copyright infringement and forced to release their software under GPL\nC) The case will proceed to trial, focusing on whether the use of the API structure constitutes fair use\nD) The company will be required to license the API from the GPL library authors but won't need to release their code\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of several complex legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Google v. Oracle case did not definitively settle the question of API copyrightability. The Supreme Court assumed, for the sake of argument, that APIs could be copyrighted, but focused their decision on fair use.\n\n2. The Federal Circuit's previous ruling that APIs can be copyrighted still stands as persuasive authority, meaning a summary dismissal (option A) is unlikely.\n\n3. Simply using a similar API structure without including the actual code is different from Google's reproduction of the Java API, so the fair use argument would need to be re-evaluated in this specific context.\n\n4. Option B is incorrect because even if copyright infringement were found, it wouldn't automatically require releasing the entire project under GPL - that's a separate issue related to license compliance, not copyright law.\n\n5. Option D misunderstands the nature of GPL and copyright law. APIs can't be \"licensed\" separately from the code they describe in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the case would proceed to trial, focusing on whether the use of the API structure constitutes fair use in this specific scenario.

What you have is a delinquent debt that is proving difficult to collect. Not paying your debts is not a crime, so it is of no interest to the police.\n\nAll you can really do is keep chasing the person down and asking for your money.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. Fraud is not clearly established, as there's no evidence of intent to deceive at the time of borrowing.

The first thing to do is get an elementary understanding of the law, perhaps by studying the questions and answers on Law SE. Since wills are not contracts, you would learn that contract law is not an important issue (and eventually you could learn how it does become relevant). The biggest impediment to self\\-drafted contracts and wills is the author's lack of basic understanding of law.

They are now unable to afford the rent payments. If they refuse to pay and return to the US in the future on an H1-B work visa, what is the most likely legal scenario they might face?\n\nA) They will be denied entry at the US border due to the unpaid debt\nB) They may face arrest upon arrival for violating the rental contract\nC) They could be subject to wage garnishment if the landlord obtained a court judgment\nD) Their H1-B visa application will be automatically rejected due to the outstanding debt\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the given scenario and US legal system. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that owing money or having an uncollected judgment against you is not a reason for denying a visa. Therefore, options A and D are incorrect.\n\n2. The answer explicitly mentions that even if there is a money judgment against you for rent owed, you will not be arrested for that debt upon returning to the US. This eliminates option B.\n\n3. While not explicitly stated in the documentation, wage garnishment is a common method of enforcing court judgments in the US. If the landlord sued and obtained a judgment while the person was away, they could potentially seek to enforce it through wage garnishment once the person returns and starts working on an H1-B visa.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts (visa regulations, debt collection, and contract law) and apply them to a real-world scenario.

They could have undercover operatives waiting to be sent encrypted material. The encryption system that a user chooses to use might not be as secure as advertised (making it very easy to distinguish from noise if you know its weakness). \n\nIf *all* the government had was access to the communication channel and listened there, then you're right, it would be hard to prove and enforce, but they have access to more than that.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A government has implemented a ban on all encryption in communications.

The correct answer, B, is based on the key point from the documentation that \"there's no practical way to tell [encrypted messages] apart\" from random noise, and that a reasonable statute \"would not make it a crime to send random noise.\"\n\nOption A is easier to detect as it doesn't resemble true random noise. Option C, while clever, still involves encryption and could be detected if the images are analyzed. Option D, although advanced, still involves encryption and would clearly violate the ban.\n\nTransmitting genuinely random data (B) exploits the law's difficulty in distinguishing between encrypted messages and random noise. As the documentation states, \"if all the government had was access to the communication channel and listened there, then you're right, it would be hard to prove and enforce.\" This strategy would be the most challenging to prosecute, as the sender could claim they were simply transmitting random data, which isn't explicitly banned.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about law enforcement limitations, technological understanding, and the practical implications of the ban, rather than mere recall of facts."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30426/what-does-monitor-the-behavior-of-individuals-in-the-eu-mean", "docs_id": 30426, "title": "What does &quot;monitor the behavior of individuals in the EU&quot; mean?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [https://www.truevault.com/blog/do\\-i\\-need\\-to\\-be\\-gdpr\\-compliant.html](https://www.truevault.com/blog/do-i-need-to-be-gdpr-compliant.html)\n\n> GDPR was created by the European Union to protect its citizens, and so it only affects organizations with some kind of relationship with the EU or its people. That said, it does not only apply to companies based in an EU country. According to Article 3, you will be affected if you are a data controller or data processor and any of the following apply:\n> \n> \n> * you are established in the EU (or somewhere else subject to EU law), or\n> * you offer goods or services to individuals in the EU, or\n> * you **monitor the behavior of individuals in the EU.**\n\nWhat does the last point here, \"monitor behaviour of individuals in the EU\", mean?\n\nLet's say, for basic functionality of a website, some rudimentary use of cookies is required to make the UI function as expected. Would that amount to \"monitoring behaviour\", because some UI state information might be saved in cookies?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The text from Article 3 of [the regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) is:\n\n> 2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\n> \n> \n> (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\n> \n> \n> (b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.\n\nArticle 3 is about the scope of the regulation. This particular question is clarified by [Recital 24](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-24/) (emphasis added).\n\n> 1 The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. 2 In order to determine whether a processing activity can be **considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects**, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\n\nThe point of all this is that if you are collecting data about someone who is currently in the EU then the GDPR applies to you, regardless of where you are. The \"currently in the EU\" bit is significant: the GDPR doesn't apply if you collect data about the activities of an EU citizen who happens to be currently in the US, but it does apply to a US citizen who is visiting the EU. The term \"behaviour\" is used to distinguish data about what someone is currently doing from static data such as date and place of birth (which is presumably much more tied to nationality than current location).\n\nBased on this recital, it seems unlikely that some functional cookies constitute \"monitoring\". If the cookies are only used for short\\-term functionality then you can make sure of this by giving the cookies a short expiry date or making them [session cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Session_cookie).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A US-based e-commerce company is expanding its operations and plans to target customers in the European Union. The company's website uses cookies for various purposes, including user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and personalized product recommendations based on browsing history. Which of the following scenarios would most likely require the company to comply with GDPR regulations?\n\nA) The website uses session cookies that expire when the user closes their browser\nB) The company collects and analyzes user behavior data to create targeted marketing campaigns\nC) The website uses functional cookies to remember user preferences for UI customization\nD) The company stores user account information, including shipping addresses in the EU\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and applies them to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere memorization.\n\nThe correct answer is B because it involves \"monitoring the behavior of individuals in the EU,\" which is explicitly mentioned in the documentation as a trigger for GDPR compliance. The company's collection and analysis of user behavior data for targeted marketing campaigns aligns with the explanation in Recital 24, which states that \"profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes\" is considered monitoring behavior.\n\nOption A is incorrect because session cookies that expire when the browser closes are typically not considered long-term monitoring and are unlikely to trigger GDPR compliance on their own.\n\nOption C is a distractor based on the question in the documentation about UI functionality cookies. While these cookies do store some information, they are primarily for short-term functionality and are not likely to be considered \"monitoring behavior\" in the context of GDPR.\n\nOption D is tricky because it involves storing personal data of EU residents. However, simply storing account information doesn't necessarily constitute \"monitoring behavior\" as defined in the GDPR context. This option tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between different types of data processing activities.\n\nThis question challenges the examinee to analyze the different aspects of data processing and user interaction, and to apply the GDPR principles to a specific business scenario, thus targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}}
