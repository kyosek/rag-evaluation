[RCW 9A.76\\.020](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.76&full=true) outlaws obstructing a law enforcement officer, which this would be: it is a gross misdemeanor. In using lethal force, you would have committed first degree murder, under [RCW 9A.32\\.030](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.32&full=true). There is a defense that can be used, per [RCW 9A.16\\.050](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16&full=true), that homicide is justified when:\n\n> In the lawful defense of the slayer, or his or her husband, wife,\n>  parent, child, brother, or sister, or of *any other person in his or\n>  her presence* or company, when there is reasonable ground to apprehend\n>  a design on the part of the person slain to commit a felony or to do\n>  some great personal injury to the slayer or to any such person, and\n>  there is imminent danger of such design being accomplished.\n\nLaw enforcement officers have access to justifiable homicide defenses as well under 9A.16\\.040, for example\n\n> (b) When necessarily used by a peace officer to overcome actual\n>  resistance to the execution of the legal process, mandate, or order of\n>  a court or officer, or in the discharge of a legal duty\n\nor\n\n> (c) When necessarily used by a peace officer or person acting under\n>  the officer's command and in the officer's aid: (i) To arrest or\n>  apprehend a person who the officer reasonably believes has committed,\n>  has attempted to commit, is committing, or is attempting to commit a\n>  felony\n\nThe outcome of the case would hinge in part on whether the officer's arrest and use of force was lawful. To take two extremes, if the guy on the ground had just killed a dozen people and was aiming to rack up another dozen kills, the officer's arrest would almost certainly be held to be legal and his degree of force justified. Your personal belief that the suspect was compliant and unarmed might be refuted by the facts. On the other hand, if the guy on the ground had slept with the officer's sister and the officer wanted to rid the world of this vermin, then the arrest and force would almost certainly be held to be not legal.\n\nIt can be legal to use deadly force to resist unlawful arrest. See [John Bad Elk v. United States, 177 U.S. 529](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/177/529/case.html), where the court held that\n\n> if a party resisted arrest by an officer without warrant, and who had\n>  no right to arrest him, and if, in the course of that resistance, the\n>  officer was killed, the offence of the party resisting arrest would be\n>  reduced from what would have been murder, if the officer had had the\n>  right to arrest, to manslaughter\n\nThe court also said\n\n> where the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which\n>  naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law\n>  looks with very different eyes upon the transaction when the officer\n>  had the right to make the arrest from what it does if the officer had\n>  no such right. What might be murder in the first case might be nothing\n>  more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no\n>  offense had been committed.\n\nThis ruling has been somewhat eroded, in [US v. Simon](http://openjurist.org/409/f2d/474/united-states-v-simon):\n\n> We recognize that law enforcement officers are frequently called on to\n>  make arrests without warrants and should not be held, so far as their\n>  personal security is concerned, to a nicety of distinctions between\n>  probable cause and lack of probable cause in differing situations of\n>  warrantless arrests. It is for this reason we believe that the force\n>  of John Bad Elk has been diminished\n\nThe upshot of this is that (assuming no warrant), leeway is granted to officers in assessing probable cause (I'm not sure anybody really knows at a general conceptual level what constitutes \"probable cause\". The court seems to imply that the remote hearsay used as the basis for the arrest would not have been sufficient for a warrant, but it was \"reasonable grounds\" for believing accused had committed a crime).\n\nYour premise that the officer is about to shoot would have to be substantiated by some fact, such as a declaration \"I'm gonna kill you\". Otherwise, your belief that the officer was about to commit unjustified murder would itself be unjustified.

The legality of using force against a police officer in such a scenario is complex and depends on multiple factors. While it can potentially be legal to use force to resist an unlawful arrest or prevent unjustified lethal force, this is subject to strict conditions. The lawfulness of the officer's actions, your reasonable belief of imminent danger, and the actual circumstances (which may differ from your perception) all play crucial roles. Additionally, intervening against a police officer carries significant legal risks, including potential charges of obstruction or assault on a law enforcement officer.

This may make the IP clause voidable by the employee. The contract terms regarding off-hours work might also be considered unconscionable, especially given the substantial impact on the employee's income.

Landlord refuses to return deposit until tenant pay for a replacement of bath tub including professional installation.\n* Signed lease agreement: none. Only some emails.\n* Venue is White Plains, NY, US\n\nI moved in 21 Apr and moved out 18 Nov 2017\\. Until now landlord has not returned my $750 deposit.\n\nAccording to landlord, the bath tub was spotless when I moved in, but I could see it had been in use for at least 5 years. There was already another tenant in the other guest room when I moved in. My room had been used by Landlord's son. All of these occupants have only one bath tub to share.\n\nA few months later we noticed minor mold in the bathtub. Landlord insisted (by email) that the other current tenant (Zuhur) and I restore it to the original condition, using our own money to pay for two thirds of the total cost.\n\nThere\u2019s no ventilation to prevent mold, but there are many wet objects in the bath room creating moisture.\n\nThe crack became visible to everyone a few days after I moved in, when there was another short\\-term tenant \\+ me sharing the common bathtub. No idea who caused it, but there's a clue \\-\\- the plastic (not ceramic) bathtub lacked solid support underneath, so much so that any adult standing on it would notice the base sinking down. This was noticed by all tenants I have spoken to. The wife of the landlord confirmed that the installation was not perfect and missed the support beneath the tub. Unfortunately no one is willing to provide written witness. This crack is probably the main reason for the replacement, even though the landlord has always mentioned it as a second \"problem\" to be fixed \\-\\- his emails always singles out the mold as the primary problem.\n\nIn Dec 2017, landlord finally fixed the bathtub. He didn't treat the mold but instead replaced the entire bathtub and sent me a bill over $3000\\. I replied to say let court decided how much I should pay. Landlord then counter\\-sued me for $5000 damage to his property.\n\nAs to the \"ordinary cost of repairs\", for mold it should be a few hundred dollars. Total area of mold added up to less than my thumb fingernail. For the crack, total cost is the replacement cost, probably $1000\\+ rather than the $3000 bill he sent me.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your rights and responsibilities in this realm are a matter of local law, sometimes down to the level of the city, plus whatever is stipulated in the lease. In [San Francisco](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/California/health/article11nuisances?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:sanfrancisco_ca$anc=JD_581), for example, \n\n> No Person shall have upon any premises or real property owned,\n>  occupied or controlled by him, or her, or it any public nuisance\n>  \\[which includes] Any visible or otherwise demonstrable mold or mildew\n>  in the interiors of any buildings or facilities\n\nThis does not say whether the owner or the occupant is liable for remediating the situation. Shower mold is gross but not a health hazard (the SF ordinance just lumps all mold into one category).\n\nSince you have no written lease, there is no automatic clean\\-up requirement. There might be a law requiring a tenant to clean the premise to its original condition, for instance in [Washington](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.130), tenant must\n\n> Upon termination and vacation, restore the premises to their initial\n>  condition except for reasonable wear and tear or conditions caused by\n>  failure of the landlord to comply with his or her obligations under\n>  this chapter.\n\nLandlord duties are [here](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.060): there is no duty to provide ventilation.\n\nHowever, the bathtub appears to be in a common area and not your particular unit. The landlord duties also require the landlord to\n\n> Keep any shared or common areas reasonably clean, sanitary, and safe\n>  from defects increasing the hazards of fire or accident\n\nso in Washington, it's his problem and not yours.\n\nIn general, even if a tenant is responsible for some form of cleanup, that does not constitute legal license for a facility upgrade. It might cost a couple hundred dollars to hire a person to wash ordinary mold accumulation, and does not justify getting a $5,000 new tub. Since this is in a common area, you would not be solely liable for whatever the damage was.\n\nThe part where you say \"crack in a common bath tub\" is a large red flag: it suggests to me that somebody negligently broke the bathtub, and then caused behind\\-the\\-wall damage by letting water infiltrate without notifying the landlord. If you broke the tub and let it rot, you could be liable. If the tub was broken already and the landlord didn't bother to do anything about it, that is his negligence.\n\nThe three questions that you should try to answer are: (1\\) what are the duties of landlord and tenant in my jurisdiction, (2\\) what was the actual harm done, and who did it, (3\\) what is the ordinary cost of whatever repair was done.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in White Plains, NY is in a dispute with their landlord over a security deposit.

Without a written lease, local laws typically govern, and many jurisdictions place the responsibility for maintaining common areas on the landlord. The tenant could be responsible for a reasonable cleaning fee for the mold, but not for a full bathtub replacement, especially if the crack was due to improper installation or existed before their tenancy.

This approach allows for compliance with current laws (such as allowing service animals) and any future legal changes without needing to update the contract.\n\nOption A is too restrictive and could be seen as discriminatory against people with service animals, potentially violating laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nOption C, while more specific, may become outdated if laws change or if other types of assistance animals are recognized in the future. It also doesn't account for potential state or local laws that might be more expansive than the ADA.\n\nOption D is too broad and doesn't reflect the property management's intended restriction on pets.\n\nBy using the phrase \"except as required by law,\" the contract maintains its intended restrictions while also ensuring compliance with current and future legal requirements, reducing the risk of the entire contract being voided due to an unenforceable provision."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/44606/initialed-items-on-contract", "docs_id": 44606, "title": "Initialed items on contract", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Customer signed the contract and initialed the line items where indicated.

You don't mention that the signature disappeared. It is unclear, though, whether the initialed items can be clearly proved to be part of the same contract that contains customer's signature.\n\nIf also the customer's signature were missing, the employee's act of producing the customer's initials suggests that the employee/company would be unable to prove the customer's consent to the contract. That puts the employee and the company in a legally vulnerable position.\n\nOn the other hand, if the signature reasonably evidences that the customer factually consented to the clauses requiring initials, the employee's initialing \"on behalf\" of the customer might be inconsequential.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is quite inappropriate for a party to *unilaterally* produce a counterparty's mark(s) for the purpose of evidencing the formation of a contract or transaction (by \"*unilaterally*\" I mean the act of doing so without the counterparty's provable consent).

And, has this been annulled by France as well after the gradual dissolution of French Union?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Note: The links will be French language as they were better than the English language sources I could find. However, see bottom for two English\\-language references.*\n\nHistorical Context\n==================\n\nIn 1946, France was in the middle of restructuring after World War II. One of the major issues was its relationship with its colonies. Having been under Nazi occupation during the war, many in France did not want to appear as a Nazi\\-like power to their colonies. However, it did not want to give the colonies equal power and become a \"colony of its former colonies\" \\[1, pg. 9\\-10].\n\nIt was with this context that the [provisional French government](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouvernement_provisoire_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_fran%C3%A7aise) set out to write a new constitution for France. However, this issue was so important, that the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law was passed *ahead* of the Constitution of 1946\\. It states in its original French:\n\n> \u00c0 partir du 1er juin 1946, tous les ressortissants des territoires d'outre\\-mer (Alg\u00e9rie comprise) ont la qualit\u00e9 de citoyen, au m\u00eame titre que les nationaux fran\u00e7ais de la m\u00e9tropole et des territoires d'outre\\-mer. Des lois particuli\u00e8res \u00e9tabliront les conditions dans lesquelles ils exerceront leurs droits de citoyens.\n\nTeska's translation \\[2, pg. 1]:\n\n> Beginning on the 1st of June 1946, all inhabitants of the overseas territories (including Algeria) have the quality of citizen, of the same title as French nationals from the metropole and overseas territories. Specific laws will establish the conditions under which they will exercise their rights as citizens.\n\nThe exact meaning of this law has been and continues to be debated. In particular, why say \"have the quality of citizen\" instead of \"are citizens\", and how would these rights be exercised?\n\nThe Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law: Replaced by the Constitution of 1958\n==========================================================\n\nThe Constitution of 1946 created a new [French Union](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_fran%C3%A7aise) to replace the French Empire that had existed before the war. The Constitution incorporated the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law word\\-for\\-word into Article 80\\. \n\nHowever, in [Article 81](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_du_27_octobre_1946#Article_81) a French *Union* citizenship was created, one that was distinct from the citizenship that existed before the war. However, it is not clear if this citizenship is distinct from the one in the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law/Article 80 \\[2, pg. 56\\-58].\n\nThis ambiguity, among other issues, led to the demise of the French Union, to be replaced by the [French Community](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communaut%C3%A9_fran%C3%A7aise_(Cinqui%C3%A8me_R%C3%A9publique)) defined in the new [Constitution of 1958](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_France_de_1958_(version_initiale))\u2014the current constitution of France. As originally passed, Article 77 stated: \n\n> \\[...] Il n\u2019existe qu\u2019une citoyennet\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9. Tous les citoyens sont \u00e9gaux en droit, quelles que soient leur origine, leur race et leur religion. Ils ont les m\u00eames devoirs.\n\nMy translation:\n\n> \\[...] There exists but one citizenship of the Community. All citizens are equal in the law, regardless of their origin, their race, and their religion. They have the same duties.\n\nThis Constitution replaced the earlier one, however, since the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law was passed *ahead* of the Constitution of 1946, it is not automatic that it has been replaced as well. I've come up with three arguments as to why I believe it has in fact been replaced:\n\n* Article 80 of the Constitution of 1946 copied the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law word\\-for\\-word and thus incorporated it. As such, the law was replaced when the Constitution was.\n* The Constitution of 1958 redefines citizenship and thus supersedes the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law\n* ***If*** the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law and Article 81 of the Constitution of 1946 refer to the same Union citizenship, then the new Community citizenship defined by the Constitution of 1958 replaced that citizenship and thus also the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law.\n\nNote that the French Community itself was not successful and has since been amended out of the constitution.\n\nA note on the former colonies\n=============================\n\nIf I'm correct that the law was replaced by the Constitution of 1958, then most colonies would not have had to take any action to annul it as they gained independence after 1958\\. The only exception I'm aware of is Guinea, which voted against joining the French Community \\[1, pg. 22].\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nOutside of Wikip\u00e9dia fran\u00e7ais, I found the following two sources to be the most informative on the topic and cite them in this answer:\n\n1.

The Loi Lamine Gueye was likely superseded by the Constitution of 1958, which redefined citizenship in the context of the French Community. This conclusion is supported by several factors:\n\n1. The Constitution of 1958 replaced the earlier Constitution of 1946, which had incorporated the Loi Lamine Gueye verbatim.\n2. The 1958 Constitution introduced a new definition of citizenship for the French Community, stating \"There exists but one citizenship of the Community.\"\n3. The new constitutional definition of citizenship likely took precedence over the earlier law.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the law is not considered to be in effect today, having been superseded by subsequent constitutional changes.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there's no evidence of France explicitly annulling the law. Instead, it was likely rendered obsolete by constitutional changes.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because most French colonies gained independence after 1958, by which time the law had likely already been superseded by the new constitution.

In this case, the Texas Health and Safety Code 245 was enacted in 1989, when the term \"woman\" was commonly understood to refer to biological females capable of becoming pregnant. Even though societal definitions and understandings have evolved since then, the legal interpretation would likely adhere to the original intent of the law.

Not necessarily money laundering as others have suggested. Because, ultimately, there is no money on their end except what they seek to steal from their mark.*\n\n*As others have pointed out, variations on this also include the **[Overpayment Scam](http://www.scambusters.org/overpayment.html)** and hat tip to the **[Spanish Prisoner Scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Prisoner)** of the 16th century for historical context.* \n\n### Banking asymmetry is the key\n\nThe basic idea is that funds clear U.S. banks faster than foreign banks. More specifically, money transfers to points inside the U.S. from points outside the U.S. take longer to clear than transfers from points inside the U.S. to outside the U.S. The ongoing success of this confidence scam rests upon that single feature of the global banking system. \n\nThis asymmetry will eventually land you in a situation where your funds clear (leave your account) but theirs don't (i.e., never enter your account) \u2014 yet at first appear to do so \u2014 until you find out later their funds \"bounced.\" By that time, they will be long gone but the bank will come after you for the bounced funds. And, of course, your money will be gone. Thereby leaving you holding the bag.\n\n### Best response: stop communicating\n\nThe best thing to do is to just stop communicating with them. You can try reporting it to your state's Attorney General but, quite frankly, I wouldn't bother. These are so common you just have to treat it like \"background noise.\"\n\n### Cautionary tale: sad and common\n\nThis is really sad. But I used to work in a retail location of a large national bank. Our clients were mostly members of a small suburban neighborhood. At least once per week, and sometimes two or three times per week, like clockwork, we would always see a different person coming into the bank asking to withdraw all their funds to send out of the country. \n\nAfter asking a couple questions it was always clear that this was another variation of the 419 Confidence Scam. The marks were usually older people (who are more gullible and trusting of strangers than the average population. Something to do with simpler times in the past, I guess.) Often times the marks were so convinced by the con that we could not explain to them what was happening in a way they would believe us and got conned anyway. Losing all their money.\n\nIt's all very sad, but a cautionary tale and an example of how convincing these cons can be. Also, to illustrate how common it all is, imagine that this probably happened in every retail location serving every neighborhood in the U.S. Very sad.

What type of scam is this most likely to be?\n\nA) Money laundering scheme\nB) Phishing attempt\nC) Nigerian Prince Confidence Scam (419 Scam)\nD) Identity theft operation\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario most closely resembles the Nigerian Prince Confidence Scam, also known as a 419 Scam. The key elements that identify this as such include:\n\n1. Initial contact via email with poor grammar and unusual urgency\n2. Offer of a large sum of money for a relatively simple task\n3.

Money laundering typically involves cleaning illegally obtained money, which isn't the primary goal here. Phishing usually aims to obtain personal information, and identity theft focuses on stealing personal data, neither of which are the main objective in this case.

Software patents are unenforceable in most parts of the world anyway.\n\nWhat matters here is copyright. Every work contract has a clause that everything an employee creates as part of their employment is copyrighted by the company. So using company\\-owned code to build an own project would be a copyright violation. There are also other legal tools in some jurisdiction which can be used against employees trying to misuse intellectual company property. But that's a topic for [Law Stackexchange](https://law.stackexchange.com/).\n\nAlso, this isn't really related to a BYOD policy. Being able to bring your own device to work and then back home might make data theft more convenient, but isn't required. There are many other ways to steal sourcecode, like USB drives or uploading them to the internet. \n\nTo prevent the first you would have to design your software development offices like a supermax prison facility with meter\\-high walls (so nobody can throw a device over it) and strip searches on everyone leaving the building. This is neither feasible nor reasonable for anything below matters of national security.\n\nTo prevent the second, you would have to completely prevent internet access from developer workstations, which would greatly impede the productivity of any software developer.\n\nSo most companies do not even try to physically prevent employees from stealing sourcecode.

It is complicated, but here are the broad strokes of that requirement.\nThere are a number of requirements of government disclosure (a), and then there are defendant's disclosure rules (b). If defendant requests, the government must disclose defendants statements, also the defendant's prior record, documents and objects, test results. There is also a duty to disclose w.r.t. expert witnesses. Specifically excluded are government\\-internal documents regarding the investigation or prosecution (things that won't be introduced at trial), and grand jury transcripts. There are conditions and exceptions within the exceptions: all of these obligations are \"if the defendant requests\".\n\nThe defendant must disclose certain documents if the defendant requests and the government complies under Rule 16(a)(1\\)(E) which is the government's obligation to disclose objects. Then\n\n> the defendant must permit the government, upon request, to inspect and\n> to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs,\n> tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of\n> these items\n\nif the defendant has it and intends to use it. There is a similar requirement to report test results in his possession that he intends to use, if he has so requested of the government, and also expert witnesses have to be disclosed. Not subject to disclosure by the defense are\nanything statement\\-like made by or to the defendant or his attorney by defendant, a witness or a prospective witness (on either side). This is pre\\-trial discovery. [Rule 26\\.2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_26.2) applies during trial:\n\n> After a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct\n> examination, the court, on motion of a party who did not call the\n> witness, must order an attorney for the government or the defendant\n> and the defendant's attorney to produce, for the examination and use\n> of the moving party, any statement of the witness that is in their\n> possession and that relates to the subject matter of the witness's\n> testimony.\n\nSo the government or defense must comply with that order as well.\n\n\"Surprise witnesses\" are allowed.

However, the lack of documented cases where victims have been prosecuted for failing to report suggests that in practice, the law is not typically enforced against victims.

It has even distributed videos in which various employees describe how they reported such improper practices and how the company responded. \n\nOf course, I don't know how your former employer's policies on such things read, or how they are enforced in practice.

The section claims that intrastate drugs \"contribute to swelling the interstate traffic,\" and concludes that \"federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate incidents of such traffic.\" Thus, the federal government will continue to enforce the federal controlled substances laws regardless of state legalization.

For example, the original Gun\\-Free School Zones Act of 1990 (since amended and complemented by a 1994 law using the condition\\-of\\-funding approach), was struck down by the Supreme Court in [*United States v.

The law, banning possession of handguns near schools, was found to be an overreach of the Commerce Clause authority. But it was amended by adding the additional interstate nexus of the gun having been moved interstate, which was a very minor limitation in practice. Since it only exempts individuals with a license issued by the state where the school is, it has significantly limited the ability of states to pass \"constitutional carry\" laws and allow for CCP reciprocity, because many highways and homes fall within its reach.\n\nSo, if a state is willing to lose all of its federal funding, then Congress can't ever force it to create, maintain, or enforce a state law.

Mexico has a \"right to publicity\", including the right to allow or deny the use of one's image([https://en.uhthoff.com.mx/articles/publicity\\-and\\-image\\-rights\\-in\\-mexico/](https://en.uhthoff.com.mx/articles/publicity-and-image-rights-in-mexico/)). *However,*\n\n> We were the principal supplier of jewelry (50K/year) to a customer who refused to raise the price 7 years (January 2000\\-December 2017\\).\n\nThis suggests the possibility of a contract. The contract can contain multiple terms, including potentially the granting of the right to use imagery that the cooperative holds(which they possibly might hold on behalf of their members). Additionally/alternatively, the permissions to use such images may have been obtained from the subjects by the photographers directly.\n\nIf not a term of the contract, such permission may possibly be revoked (though receiving payment can potentially complicate this); if part of the contract, it may still be revoked, but doing so may necessitate the termination of the contract.\n\nSide note: Generally speaking, unless mandated by law (unlikely, especially since they are not an employer) or contract terms, the buyer is not required to raise prices. The seller may be able to refuse to sell at the old prices (unless required to do so by contract terms).\n\n> That business was sold in 2018 to a lady who used to be the stock girl; she claims no knowledge of any accounting before her tenure. We want to \"close the books\", since we dont have the complete record; only the customer kept track of the differences so as to round everything off in their favor.\n\nThe buyer's records should be irrelevant to your accounting\\*. The buyer could sell the jewelry, give it away, or destroy it, and this should be irrelevant to In general, the cooperative gives the buyer jewelry and receives either money or debt in return. In either case, normally one receives a record recording of the receipt jewelry from the buyer (e.g. \"On DD/MM/YYYY, received 5 bracelets\" or whatever)\\*\\*.\n\n\\*Unless the \"buyer\" is not actually buying the jewelry, but rather selling it on consignment, which is a completely different relationship and scenario.\n\n\\*\\*Thus, even in the case of debt, this should not matter, as the cooperative should have its own, independent, records of its delivered property, funds, debts and invoices pending, for tax purposes if nothing else.\n\n> What makes this different, is that these people assure their customers that they are doing a good deed for traditional third\\-world artisans. Otherwise, probably, they would not purchase. Can these people somehow be legally held to the principles they espouse to their customers?\n\nGenerally, this would be dependent on the laws of where the borrower sells to their own customers. Usually, one is only held to account to act in accordance with laws and obligations(such as those established by contract); however, there are frequently \"false advertising laws\" prohibiting lies in advertising products.

According to the documentation, Mexico does have a \"right to publicity,\" which includes the right to control the use of one's image. However, the situation is complicated by the long-standing business relationship between the cooperative and the original business. There may have been contracts or agreements in place that granted permission to use these images. Additionally, the sale of the business to a new owner adds another layer of complexity. While the cooperative likely has some rights regarding the use of their images, exercising these rights may not be straightforward and could depend on the specifics of their past agreements and the terms of the business sale. Therefore, while they have potential legal recourse, it's not as simple as immediately suing for damages (B) or having no recourse at all (A).

The example given from Colorado's \"Junction Box Statute\" clearly states that \"The resulting entity is the same entity as the converting entity.\" This means that Company Y would inherit all of Company X's contracts and obligations, making the contract valid and giving Y the right to sue based on that contract.

If Flex truly merged as a corporate entity with Olio Devices, or if Olio Devices purchased the Flex entity and then changed its name to Flex, there would be liability from the consumer to Flex is a cause of action could be established.\n\nBut, if Flex merely purchased selected assets from Olio Devices for cash, any liability would run from the consumer to Olio Devices, and would be limited to the cash received by Olio Devices in the deal.\n\nIf that cash was insufficient to pay liabilities owed by Olio Devices to its consumers, in order to prevail against Flex, the consumers would have to establish that the sale to Flex of its assets was a \"fraudulent transfer\" which doesn't necessarily require proof that there was an actual intent to defraud, but does require a showing that (1\\) the total liabilities of Olio Devices (including contingent future liabilities) exceeded the value of its assets at the time of the sale, (2\\) that Olio Devices did not receive \"substantially equivalent value\" for the assets it sold to Flex, (3\\) that the sale was not ratified by a bankruptcy court if Olio Devices was in bankruptcy, and (4\\) that the sale of assets from Olio Devices to Flex took place more than four years before the lawsuit seeking to set aside the fraudulent transfer. Alternately, the statute of limitations could be longer, the threshold of proof could be lower, and punitive damages up to 50% of the recovery otherwise available, if there was an actual intent to defraud the consumers of Olio Devices in the sale of assets transaction that could be established.\n\nIt is also possible that Olio Devices was kept intact as an entity, whose shareholders were now a parent company, and the parent company didn't take any assets out of the subsidiary, which would make it hard to sue the parent company.\n\nOf course, all of this hinges on whether there is an underlying case against Olio Devices.\n\nAssuming that the watches were sold in 2015 and 2016 without an intent to defraud at that time, one would have to determine what the nature of the contractual arrangement for post\\-sale service by Olio Devices was with respect to those watches. This would not be an elementary matter and would take review of relevant documents (e.g. warranties and license agreements) and consideration of case law in other circumstances that might be relevant regarding implied contractual terms. The outcome of that would be a close question. If the contract didn't have such a term, or expressly disavowed such liability, then the next question would be whether the absence of such term would render the contract unconscionable causing a term like that to be implied in law.\n\nAssuming that the consumers established that there was an implied contractual term that the watches would be supported by Olio Devices indefinitely, the next question would be when the statute of limitations started to accrue. Generally speaking, this happens when there is a breach of the contract and that breach is known to the consumer, which would probably happen in late 2017\\. The [statute of limitations in California](https://statelaws.findlaw.com/california-law/california-civil-statute-of-limitations-laws.html) for a breach of a written contract is four years, and for an oral contract is two years, but I don't know what the relevant statute of limitations would be in the case of a contractual term implied in law or in fact.\n\nThere might be a consumer protection law specific provision, intertwined with the implied contractual term, but my guess is that this is unlikely.\n\nAll of the relevant questions would arise primarily under state law. The law that would apply would again be fact specific. Normally a contract to enter into a sale of goods is governed by the state where the sale takes place and runs between the seller and the buyer, who would often not be the underlying manufacturer, so the warranty or license or service contract from the underlying manufacturer might be the controlling document and would usually have a choice of law provision which would probably choose California law as the governing law.\n\nIt is also conceivable that this issue could be framed as a product liability issue with the product being defective because it relied upon a service that could be discontinued. This liability would run directly from the consumer to Olio Devices. The statute of limitations in California for a products liability lawsuit involving personal property is generally three years.\n\nRealistically, the only economic way to bring any economic lawsuit would be via a class action lawsuit, but if any contract or license running from Olio Devices directly to the consumer contained an arbitration clause (which it is quite likely that it would) then a class action lawsuit would probably be barred and an arbitration proceeding would have to be commenced instead.\n\nSo, there are facts not present in the question that are necessary to provide an accurate answer, but the clock is definitely ticking and many theories of relief are likely to be barred some time in 2020 or 2021 depending upon the theory, and some causes of action may already be time barred.\n\nOf course, if this happened in 2017, it is very likely that someone already did bring a lawsuit, which may have been settled, resolved in arbitration proceedings, or resolved in a class action proceedings that was concluded or is still pending. If there was a class settlement of such a lawsuit, it may still be possible to apply to receive a payment under that settlement. It would be surprising for someone to wait until now to sue, if there were many thousands of units sold that were rendered useless and there was a viable litigation option. Somebody would almost surely have investigated the matter before then and there are multiple law firms in California that specialize in these kinds of lawsuits and usually figure out opportunities for lawsuits first and recruit clients second.\n\nOther Factual Background\n========================\n\nFactual background [here](https://www.soft32.com/blog/platforms/another-one-bites-dust-long-olio/) and [here](https://www.soft32.com/blog/platforms/update-another-one-bites-dust-long-olio/).\n\nData on the sale of the company/assets [here](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/97958-44).\n\nThe most valuable asset of Olio Devices was probably [its patent license revenues from Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/2016/01/25/microsoft-and-olio-devices-announce-patent-licensing-agreement/).\n\nIt appears that the purchase price was [$14 million.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/olio-devices#section-overview)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer purchased an Olio Model One smartwatch in 2016 for $995.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the consumer's legal options?\n\nA) The consumer can easily sue Flex Ltd. for a full refund, as they are clearly liable for Olio's products.\n\nB) The consumer has no legal recourse, as too much time has passed since the API shutdown.\n\nC) The consumer might have a case against Olio Devices, but the statute of limitations has likely expired for most potential claims.\n\nD) The consumer can definitely file a class action lawsuit against both Olio Devices and Flex Ltd. with a high chance of success.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement. While the consumer might have had a case against Olio Devices based on implied contractual terms or product liability, the statutes of limitations for most potential claims have likely expired by 2023. In California, the statute of limitations for breach of written contract is four years, for product liability is three years, and these would have started running in late 2017 when the API was shut down. Additionally, suing Flex Ltd. directly would be challenging unless the acquisition was structured as a full merger or if fraudulent transfer could be proven. The other options are either overly optimistic about the chances of success (A and D) or too pessimistic about legal options (B). It's important to note that without knowing all the specific details of the contracts, warranties, and the exact structure of the Flex acquisition, it's impossible to give a definitive answer, but option C best reflects the likely legal reality in 2023."}, "50": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46217/honest-advertising-in-polls", "docs_id": 46217, "title": "Honest advertising in polls?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Are there laws restricting polls, similar to laws restricting advertisements?\n\nPolls can ask questions that contain false premises, or an hypothetical assumption that is so unlikely that just saying \"what if\" is in itself a claim that the hypothesis is not absurd on its face, which could be seen as a lie.

Why else would the case still exist 14 years later? Same with forging a car registration or anything similar?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statute of limitations is quite relevant.\n\nA couple points to help explain why:\n\n* First, there are a lot of different legal actions that could arise from someone stealing property. You could have criminal charges for theft, you could have a civil claim for conversion (to pay the value of the stolen property), you could have a civil claim for replevin (to return the stolen goods), and you could have a civil action to determine the true owner of the property.\n\nAll those cases arise under different laws, and all of them could have different SOLs. The fact that time has run out for one doesn't necessarily mean that time has run out for all of them.\n* Second, improperly obtaining title *does not* mean that you are not and never will be the true title holder. Take a look at the doctrine of \"adverse possession,\" which basically allows you to become the true owner of real or personal property by simply acting like the owner for a long enough period of time \\-\\- ranging from 5 to 21 years, depending on the jurisdiction.\n* Third, SOL is a restriction on when you can *start* a lawsuit. Sometimes, as Dale M said, it starts when you actually learn about the transfer, but it could also start when you *would have* learned about the transfer if you had exercised reasonable diligence. So the fact that a lawsuit is happening now regarding something that happened a long time ago doesn't necessarily mean the SOL was inoperative; it may just mean that the SOL didn't start until long after the transfer, or it majy just mean the litigation is dragging out.\n* Fourth, the Facebook example is not a good one. [That lawsuit](http://i.zdnet.com/blogs/cegliavszuck.pdf) is primarily focused not on the transfer of property, but on breaches of contract, for which [the relevant statute of limitations is six years](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/civil-practice-law-and-rules/cvp-sect-213.html). Second, those breaches are focused on a contract reached in 2004\\. Because the lawsuit began in 2010, it was started within the statute of limitations.

Sarah discovered the fraud in 2020 and wants to take legal action. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the statute of limitations (SOL) and Sarah's ability to pursue legal recourse?\n\nA) The SOL doesn't apply because the transfer was fraudulent, so Sarah can always claim ownership.\nB) The SOL started in 2005 when the fraudulent transfer occurred, so Sarah is likely time-barred from any legal action.\nC) The SOL may have started in 2020 when Sarah discovered the fraud, potentially allowing her to pursue certain legal actions.\nD) The SOL is irrelevant because John's adverse possession of the land for over 15 years makes him the legal owner regardless of the initial fraud.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate. The statute of limitations (SOL) is relevant in this case, but it doesn't necessarily start at the time of the fraudulent transfer. In many jurisdictions, the SOL for fraud cases begins when the victim discovers or reasonably should have discovered the fraud (known as the \"discovery rule\"). Since Sarah discovered the fraud in 2020, she may still be within the SOL for certain legal actions, such as a civil claim for fraud or an action to determine true ownership.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the SOL does apply even in cases of fraudulent transfers. Option B is likely incorrect because the SOL for fraud often doesn't start at the time of the fraudulent act, but rather upon discovery. Option D is incorrect because while adverse possession is a real concept, the requirements vary by jurisdiction and it's not automatically granted after 15 years, especially in cases of fraud."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/86605/how-should-i-make-a-asset-protection-irrevocable-trust", "docs_id": 86605, "title": "How should I make a Asset Protection Irrevocable Trust?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to make a irrevocable trust to protect me against potential lawsuits and future divorce (I am not yet married).\n\nAt the same time, I want to be able to invest my assets (cash/securities right now) the way I want.\n\nCan I put a family member as trustee?

However, I'll address some misconceptions that you have:\n\n> to protect me against potential lawsuits and future divorce\n\nNone of the scenarios will protect you from these. If you are a beneficiary of the trust then you own the beneficial interest. A beneficial interest is (for most purposes) an asset like any other and can be bought, sold, or taken away from you in a lawsuit.\n\n> I want to make a irrevocable trust\n> \n> \n> I would be the beneficiary.\n\nThese two aspects are mutually incompatible. If you are the beneficiary, then in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") (and probably in many other jurisdictions), under the rule in [Saunders v Vautier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saunders_v_Vautier) you can collapse the trust and merge the beneficial and legal interests. If you have the power to take back the legal interest to all trust assets then it is not irrevocable.\n\n> Can I put a family member as trustee? How about a company that I am a\n> part of? How about a company that I am the only owner of?\n\nYou can generally name anyone you like to the a trustee, including all of the above. The only thing you cannot do is have the trustee(s) be the exact same set of people as the beneficiary(s), because then there isn't a trust at all. This is because the beneficial and legal interests are held by the same people and the trust terms are unenforceable since you cannot sue yourself.\n\n> Are these cases still provide the correct protections?\n\nNone of them will provide you with protection against lawsuits and future divorce, for the reason I stated at the start.\n\nNote: my answer is largely based on [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") but with the assumption that it probably applies to most common law systems given that these are basic trust law principles.

He plans to be the sole beneficiary and wants to maintain control over investment decisions. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the effectiveness of this trust arrangement?\n\nA) The trust will effectively protect John's assets as long as he names a family member as the trustee.\nB) The trust will provide full protection if John creates a company he solely owns to act as the trustee.\nC) The trust will be irrevocable and protect John's assets if he names multiple beneficiaries besides himself.\nD) The trust is unlikely to provide the protection John seeks, regardless of the trustee arrangement, due to his status as beneficiary.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because, as the documentation states, if John is a beneficiary of the trust, he owns the beneficial interest. This beneficial interest is considered an asset that can be targeted in lawsuits or divorce proceedings. Additionally, as the sole beneficiary, John could potentially collapse the trust under the rule in Saunders v Vautier, making it effectively revocable. The trustee arrangement (whether family member, owned company, or third party) does not change this fundamental issue. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest that the trustee choice would provide protection, which it does not in this case.

Statute 776.08 explicitly lists carjacking as a forcible felony. Therefore, witnessing an armed individual attempting to forcibly enter another vehicle would qualify as an imminent forcible felony, justifying the use of deadly force to prevent it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law doesn't require an explicit request for help to justify intervention.

What are the legal obligations of a government employer, when it comes to handling allegations against a prospective employee?\n\nI would like to use a different example. Instead of a Supreme Court nomination, suppose that a person is applying to a teaching position in a public school, and someone claims that she had inappropriate contact with a minor. \n\nWhat kind of due process is the school required to abide by in approving or rejecting the candidate? Is a mere allegation enough to warrant refusal to hire, or is there legal precedent against that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, there is legal precedent against this that would only apply to a government employee. First, let's discuss the private sector.\n\nIn this case, you are a private employee that comes to your place of work and accuses you of \"stealing the cookies from the cookie jar\" which is a serious criminal offense. They wish to talk and your boss is in the room. You plead the 5th, but your boss says you're fired if you don't talk to the cops. This is legal because you still have the right to refuse to talk, you just lose your job. A private employer has the right to free association, and wants nothing to do with cookie thieves, alleged or actual.\n\nHowever, in the government employ, your boss is an agent of the government. This same situation is different because the government pays the boss and the agent... so in essence the government is saying talk or be fired. This is unconstitutional as the government cannot retalitate against you for your refusal to talk.\n\nGenerally, in order to talk to you, the investigator would need either a signed Garrity Statement or a Signed Kalkines Statement. The former is a statement saying that they are investigating a wrong doing but you cannot lose your job if you refuse to speak to the investigators, where as Kalkines says you must talk but you are granted immunity for your part in the wrong doing, so long as you make truthful statements.\n\nFor more on this, check this [legal blog](https://www.spigglelaw.com/employment-blog/surviving-workplace-investigations/).\n\nThere is also the matter that a false accusation (and let me be clear... this is academic, I'm not saying the accusation in the real life topic is false, nor am I saying that the defense is false... we're merely discussing a possibility) is made to your employer and they do not offer the job on the basis of the accusation alone, this is grounds for defamation actions... and in certain jurisdictions, it's criminal defamation, so there could be jail time.\n\nIt's interesting you mentioned teachers, because this happens alot. Kids do know that there are certain things that get a teacher fired quickly, so teachers do get the occasional false accusation of sexual assault (I know one teacher who has had multiple accusations over the course of her career). One of the few good things I can say about the Teachers Union is they cover the legal defense of accused teachers. The accusations do get the teacher removed from the class for sometime, but they don't lose their jobs over this matter. It's followed up but the accusation doesn't immediately lead to the teacher getting fired..", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A public school is considering hiring a new teacher. During the hiring process, an allegation is made that the candidate had inappropriate contact with a minor in the past.

As a government employer, the public school is required to provide due process and cannot make decisions based solely on allegations. A thorough investigation is necessary before making a hiring decision. This approach balances the need to protect students with the legal rights of the candidate.\n\nOption A is incorrect because rejecting a candidate based solely on an allegation without investigation could be grounds for a defamation lawsuit and violates due process principles for government employees.\n\nOption B is inappropriate because it disregards the potential risk to students and the school's responsibility to investigate serious allegations.\n\nOption D is problematic because it could potentially violate the candidate's Fifth Amendment rights and does not provide a proper investigative process.\n\nThe correct approach involves a careful investigation, potentially including signed Garrity or Kalkines statements, and ensuring due process before making a final decision on the candidate's employment."}}
