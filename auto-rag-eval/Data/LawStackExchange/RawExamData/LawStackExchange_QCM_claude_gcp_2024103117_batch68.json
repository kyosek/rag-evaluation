There could be other laws that apply to the misleading statement, either under EU law or national law.\n\nHowever, the regulation is somewhat complex. For example, Article 7 (the latter half of your quotation) says that the compensation amounts apply \"where reference is made to this Article.\" But Article 6 (the first half of your quotation) *makes no reference to Article 7\\.* Article 7 is only invoked in Articles 4 and 5, concerning denied boarding and flight compensation, respectively.\n\nRather, Article 6 provides that in covered cases, passengers shall be offered\n\n> (i) the assistance specified in Article 9(1\\)(a) and 9(2\\); and\n> \n> \n> (ii) when the reasonably expected time of departure is at least the day after the time of departure previously announced, the assistance specified in Article 9(1\\)(b) and 9(1\\)(c); and\n> \n> \n> (iii) when the delay is at least five hours, the assistance specified in Article 8(1\\)(a).\n\n(Item (i) concerns meals, refreshments, and communications (phone/fax/e\\-mail).

This can include a pile of ash that they allege contained convincing and unambiguous evidence of guilt. Of course, if that's all they've got the prosecution would probably be censured by the judge for wasting everybody's time and money, more likely, a prosecutor wouldn't lay charges in the first place.\n\nAs to punishment for an evidence tampering conviction: you have been convicted of evidence tampering, not drug production so you will be punished for evidence tampering, not drug production. The legislature sets different punishments for these for a reason, possibly a reason known only to them but a reason nevertheless.

In the meanwhile, I became financially stable and started entertaining the idea of pursuing justice and regain a fair share of the my grandfather's land from my uncle.\n\nHowever, I have two questions:\n\n* Should I first try and speak with my uncle, asking for him for a fair share of my grandfather's inheritance, but also mentioning to him that I'm also prepared to sue him in court for that?\n* Should I get a lawyer and directly go to court, suing my uncle for the unjust outcome without any prior discussions with him?\n\nIn the first case, I'm afraid that it could result in him suing me for extortion of something which was already signed to him (in this case, the fair share of my grandfather's land that should've belong to my father).\n\nI'm mostly asking so I could get my thoughts sorted out and decide what to do next.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **You need to speak to a lawyer.**\n\nFirst of all inheritance laws vary greatly from one location to the next, so you need someone who is familiar with your local laws and processes. You also need to collect all paperwork that's related to the inheritance. Typically an estate need to get \"settled\" and there is an official statement that (often issued by the town or a local court) that spells out all the details and conditions (if any). Try to document any type of follow up discussion or dispute in as much detail as possible including dates, means of interaction, topics, etc. \n\nOnce you have all this, have a lawyer or equivalent look it over. They then can assess the legal situation and advice you on the best course of action.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a complex inheritance dispute involving land distribution after a grandfather's death without a will, what is the most appropriate first step for a grandchild seeking to rectify an unfair distribution?\n\nA) Directly confront the uncle who received most of the land, threatening legal action if a fair share is not given\nB) File a lawsuit against the uncle without any prior communication\nC) Consult with a lawyer familiar with local inheritance laws and gather all relevant documentation\nD) Attempt to negotiate with the uncle informally, without mentioning potential legal action\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate first step is to consult with a lawyer familiar with local inheritance laws and gather all relevant documentation. This approach is recommended because:\n\n1. Inheritance laws vary greatly by location, so local expertise is crucial.\n2. A lawyer can assess the legal situation and advise on the best course of action.\n3.

Even if this doesn\u2019t happen, there is still a degree of record checking and matching.\n\nFor example, \u201cdo we have anyone in the system with this date of birth and similar features but different name?\u201d And other efforts to match the prisoner\u2019s identity with one known to the master database.\n\nIn court there appears no effort to exercise skepticism with respect to the litigants\u2019 identities and little safeguards in the way of preventing anyone for standing in for our impersonating any of the parties. Not in the courtroom, and not upon entering the building and passing security. Not even inspection of ID documents.\n\nFrom experience, this appears true in the magistrates', Crown, and county courts although in criminal proceedings one is asked to confirm one\u2019s identity including date of birth is correct.\n\nIn general, is there a reason for this lack of exercised skepticism and forensic scrutiny when courts are generally so principally concerned with truth and probity?\n\nApart from this empirical/historical question about court practice, what about the legality? One can easily imagine that in Criminal proceedings, impersonating a defendant and then actively, explicitly deceiving the court is unequivocal contempt and perjury.\n\nBut suppose one wishes to bring a civil action under an alias that one assumes from the beginning of pre\\-action proceedings until the conclusion of the action. Practically speaking there appears to be nothing standing in the way of this.\n\nAnd furthermore, I recall a decision from either the UKHL or the EWCA that discussed how generally the laws of England have always allowed one to assume and use whatever name one may please to.\n\nHow does this compute with the litigation question here? Is there anything unlawful of assuming a different name under which one wages a lawsuit?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In an adversarial legal system, the parties are responsible for framing the issues in dispute and adducing relevant evidence. The parties, and perhaps more importantly their lawyers, also have an obligation of candour to the court. Courts routinely accept unchallenged assertions because there are serious consequences for misleading the court, and the opponent (rather than the court which should remain neutral) is in the best position to investigate and prove any suspected dishonesty.\n\nIt is a matter for the party commencing proceedings (plaintiff or prosecutor) to decide how the parties will be named. People often change their names, and may use multiple spellings. It is not uncommon for typographical or other errors to appear. Generally, it is in the interest of at least one party to name the parties \"correctly,\" ie. consistently with other government records that will be used to enforce any judgment, but a person's name is ultimately a formal matter that can be corrected if necessary. In cases of uncertainty, aliases can be specified, as occurred in *Microsoft v McDonald (aka Gary Webb)* [\\[2006] EWHC 3410 (Ch)](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2006/3410.html).\n\nA person who is genuinely known by an alias (ie. the use of the alias is not part of an attempt to mislead the court) should use their \"real\" name in court, but could potentially conduct litigation using the alias without anybody noticing. However, court proceedings are public and this would not necessarily protect the person's identity. To achieve this, an anonymity order under [CPR 39\\.2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/3132/rule/39.2) is required, as explained in *XXX v Camden London Borough Council* [\\[2020] EWCA Civ 1468](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/XXX-v-London-Bor-of-Camden-judgment.pdf) \\[13]\u2013\\[22].", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the English legal system, what is the primary reason courts generally accept unchallenged assertions about parties' identities without extensive scrutiny?\n\nA) Courts have access to comprehensive identity databases that are automatically checked for every case\nB) The adversarial nature of the legal system places the responsibility on parties and their lawyers to raise identity issues\nC) English law prohibits the use of aliases or alternative names in court proceedings\nD) Judges are required to personally verify the identity of all parties before a case can proceed\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In an adversarial legal system like England's, the responsibility for framing issues and presenting evidence falls on the parties and their lawyers. Courts generally accept unchallenged assertions because:\n\n1. There are serious consequences for misleading the court, which acts as a deterrent.\n2. Lawyers have an obligation of candor to the court.\n3. The opposing party, not the court, is best positioned to investigate and challenge any suspected dishonesty about identity.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because courts do not automatically check comprehensive identity databases for every case.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect. English law actually allows individuals to use different names or aliases, and courts can accommodate this through methods like specifying aliases in case names.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect.

I contacted them offering to settle without going to court and they made me an initial offer.\n\nTheir initial offer includes a clause about them making no admission of guilt. The language in the offer is (paraphrased):\n\n> **No admission of liability** This settlement does not in any way constitute an admission of guilt, liability, or wrongdoing by The Company. Any such liability is expressly denied.\n\nFrom what I understand, this is to prevent any future claims against The Company \\- however the same agreement also includes a section where I promise not to sue them for **any other reason** ever again (I object to this and tell my lawyer that when they return) \\- so even if they do admit guilt (and I agree to never sue them for any reason ever again) it makes no difference to their bottom\\-line, right?\n\nI do know that many times when a defendant is a company and they settle with a plaintiff it's done to make the problem go\\-away because the cost of a settlement would be cheaper than the cost of hiring lawyers and running an investigation to verify the claims \\- as well as to prevent word getting\\-out if reputations would be damaged by any public court action, even if they would be acquitted.\n\nBut those reasons don't apply in my case \\- I don't believe The Company gains anything at all by refusing to admit guilt or wrongdoing.\n\nI would gain immense personal satisfaction if The Company would just say in writing \"we broke the law\" \\- and hopefully \"sorry\" too.

It is intended to make sure that the settlement covers the entire dispute between you and the Company, that you do not later come up with some aspect that was not covered by the agreement now being negotiated, and file a new suit. The provision should be so worded that it covers only causes of action that arose **prior** to the date of the agreement; it should not immunize them from being sued for future wrong doing. It could be further limited to causes related to the transaction or issue now under dispute, but the Company is likely to insist that it be fairly broadly worded. If told that you object to the provision, they are likely to say something like \"well, what other claims does he have?

However, companies are often reluctant to admit fault as it could harm their reputation and potentially be used as evidence in other cases. The answer states that you can ask, but the company is likely to refuse unless you have a very strong case. \n\nOption A is incorrect because you can always propose changes to a settlement offer.

Exercise \"eminent domain\" on patents, forcing mandatory licensing or pooling of patents.\n4. Compensate the inventor, but potentially not at market rates.\n\nOptions A and C are incorrect because they overstate the inventor's control over the patented technology when government interests are involved.

Or are they actually mine because I paid for everything? What can be done to get them out of the company?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The directors are in control of the company, and the directors are appointed by a majority of shareholders. As a minority shareholder, the general rule is that you have to accept the decisions of the directors while they have the support of the majority shareholders. It does not matter what the majority shareholders paid for their shares or if they received them in exchange for other contributions to the business.\n\nHowever, the law does recognise that the general rule creates the potential for [oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression_remedy) of minority shareholders. In Australia, the courts can order that a company be wound up, or that some members \"buy out\" other members' shares, if \"the conduct of the company's affairs is oppressive to, unfairly prejudicial to, or unfairly discriminatory against, a member\": [s 232](https://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s232.html) of the *Corporations Act 2001* (Cth).\n\nApplying for such a court order is expensive and complex. The court fee alone starts at [$1,530](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/forms-and-fees/court-fees/fees), and litigation of this kind would normally be conducted by professionals at a cost of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars. The unsuccessful party would generally be required to pay the successful party's legal costs. Almost invariably, it would be in the mutual interest of all parties to negotiate a settlement.\n\nFor more information about shareholders' oppression in Australia, see Victorian Law Reform Commission, [The oppression remedy in the *Corporations Act*](https://www.lawreform.vic.gov.au/publication/trading-trusts-oppression-remedies-report-3/3-the-oppression-remedy-in-the-corporations-act/) (2021\\):\n\n> Irreconcilable differences may establish a basis for winding up, they do not of themselves constitute oppression or unfair prejudice \u2026 oppression connotes a lack of probity and fair dealing (although this is not a necessary condition), is something which is burdensome, harsh or wrongful, or is inequitable or unjust, or exhibits commercial unfairness \u2026 Examples of oppressive behaviour given by Brockett include where a majority shareholder:\n> \n> \n> * runs the company in their own interests and ignores the interests of minority shareholders\n> * improperly issues shares to themselves to outvote other shareholders\n> * excludes a minority shareholder from being involved in the management decisions of the company\n> * redirects business opportunities from the company to themselves\n> * pays themselves excessive salaries at the expense of paying dividends to shareholders.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, where a minority shareholder in Western Australia feels oppressed by the other two shareholders who control the company, which of the following is the most appropriate and legally sound course of action for the minority shareholder to pursue?\n\nA) File a lawsuit to claim full ownership of all shares, arguing that since they paid for the company registration, they are the rightful owner of all shares.\n\nB) Unilaterally remove the other two shareholders from the company registry and declare themselves the sole director and shareholder.\n\nC) Apply to the court for an order under s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), seeking relief from oppressive conduct.\n\nD) Withhold company resources and funds until the other shareholders agree to sell their shares.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most appropriate and legally sound course of action. Under Australian law, specifically s 232 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), a minority shareholder who feels oppressed can apply to the court for relief. This can include orders for the company to be wound up or for other shareholders to buy out the minority shareholder's shares. While this process can be expensive and complex, it is the proper legal channel for addressing oppressive conduct by majority shareholders.\n\nOption A is incorrect because paying for the company registration does not automatically entitle the payer to ownership of all shares, especially if there's documentation showing agreed share allocation.\n\nOption B is illegal and would likely result in legal action against the minority shareholder.\n\nOption D is also illegal and could be considered a breach of director's duties.\n\nWhile negotiation for a settlement is often advisable, the legal remedy provided by s 232 is the correct answer in this context."}, "27": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17359/is-trump-s-barring-of-select-media-outlets-from-white-house-press-conferences-a", "docs_id": 17359, "title": "Is Trump\u2019s barring of select media outlets from White House press conferences a violation of the First Amendment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From the [New York Times](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/us/politics/white-house-sean-spicer-briefing.html):\n\n> \\[...] Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, barred journalists from The New York Times and several other news organizations from attending his daily briefing, a highly unusual breach of relations between the White House and its press corps.\n> \n> \n> \\[...] Reporters from The Times, BuzzFeed News, CNN, The Los Angeles Times, Politico, the BBC and The Huffington Post were among those shut out of the briefing.\n\nHave First Amendment rights been violated?\n\nNothing from [Cornell Law's page](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/first_amendment) seems to indicate that not admitting certain parties to a press conference is in violation of the First Amendment:\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n---\n\nThe First Amendment is so concise I'll reproduce it here for everyone's perusal:\n\n> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or\n> prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of\n> speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to\n> assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nIs there any law that requires the U.S. President to include representatives from certain media outlets in any forum in which he or his delegate speaks to other representatives of \"the press?\" No.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the relationship between the First Amendment and the White House's ability to exclude certain media outlets from press briefings?\n\nA) The First Amendment explicitly prohibits the White House from barring any news organizations from press briefings.\n\nB) Excluding specific news outlets from White House press briefings is a direct violation of freedom of the press as guaranteed by the First Amendment.\n\nC) The First Amendment requires the White House to provide equal access to all news organizations for press briefings.\n\nD) The First Amendment does not mandate that the White House include representatives from all media outlets in press briefings.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and press from government interference, but it does not require the government to provide equal access to all media outlets for every event. The White House has discretion in managing its press briefings, including which outlets to invite. While excluding certain outlets may be controversial and potentially harmful to transparency, it does not inherently violate the First Amendment. The amendment primarily prevents the government from censoring or punishing speech, rather than mandating equal access to all forums.

I would like to put up a site where I share the recipes I used. I sometimes use recipes from the cooking book which obviously copyrighted work. Therefore, I decided what if I 'retell' the process involved when I am cooking the dish myself, producing 'my own' 'cooking instruction'? Of course, I would like my recipe to have the same ingredients as the reference book I am using, else the taste is not going to be the same. Is this allowed? How about international law since I am not in the US. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Recipe books can be, and often are, protected by copyright. If the individual recipes are by others, this would constitute a collective work or compilation. See [this recent answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/64800/17500) for more on the rights protected for a collective work.\n\nThe selection of which recipes to include would be a creative element, protected by copyright, and could not be copied or closely imitated without permission. However, division into groups by type of dish would be a \"natural and obvious\" arrangement, and not protected. So would alphabetical or chronological arrangement within a group, or over all. A \"non\\-obvious\" order of recipes would however be a protectable element.\n\nAn individual recipe may be protected by copyright, but this protects less than one might think. Copyright does not protect facts or methods. This means that the list of ingredients is not protected, nor is the general list of steps of preparation. Only the exact wording of the recipe will be protected.\n\nCreating a new collection of recipes based on several different previously published collections of recipes (whether from the web, books, magazines, or other media) and making one's own selections of which ones to include that is significantly different from any of the previous collections would not violate the collection copyrights of any of the previous collections. If the actual recipes were rewritten so that any creative expression from the originals was not copied, then it seems that no copyright infringement has occurred. Most recipes, after all, are not fully original but are modified from older ones.\n\nThere is no set figure for how many recipes could be copied from a given source before this becomes infringement. That would be, if a suit was field, a matter for the judgement of the count as to whether the new book was \"based on\" the alleged source. The more the list in the new work resembles a particular source, the more like a derivative work it seems and the more likely that it would be held to be an infringement. One could always ask for a license from the older source, to avoid any risk of suit, but it might not be available or the copyright holder might demand an excessive fee. Asking for a license risks drawing attention to the new work, as well, and might cause a holder to file suit who otherwise would not.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A food blogger wants to create a cookbook using recipes from various sources.

For example, the Clay Institute\u2019s [Millennium Prize](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems) does exactly what you propose: it pays people who solve unsolved math problems. Similarly, the the Everglades Foundation used a [prize](https://www.evergladeswaterquality.org/meet-the-teams) to get people to come up with new ways to get phosphates out of the water sources.\n\nTo do what they did, you need to follow their lead, and set up and run a non\\-profit (aka, 501(c)(3\\), named after the relevant provision of the tax code).\n\nBecause non\\-profits are tax exempt under US tax law, you have to apply to the IRS to become a non\\-profit. Speaking broadly, the IRS imposes two requirements on non\\-profits: 1\\) It must serve a charitable purpose; 2\\) It must spend a certain percentage of its money every year doing charitable work.\n\nTo set up a foundation you have to specify the charitable purpose you will serve (\u201cencourage research in mathematics\u201d), and have a plan to do so (\u201cwe will award a cash prize to people who solve important unsolved problems\u201d). If the IRS decides your plan is genuine, then they give you a pass on paying taxes.\n\nTo make sure you are carrying out your charitable plan, the IRS requires you to spend a certain percentage of your money each year on charitable work. (This is called the \"distribution requirement.\") Meeting the distribution requirement may be a problem, since you may not award prizes every year.\n\nYou may be able to get a general idea about how the IRS deals with such situations by searching on line. At some point, however, you will probably need to talk to a lawyer with experience setting up non\\-profits. (FWIW, it looks to me as if the Clay Institute meets its yearly spending requirement by supporting lots of other activities that count towards the spending requirement.)\n\nOne other problem that it seems you won\u2019t have involves giving prizes directly to individuals. For obvious reasons, the IRS is generally suspicious of prizes given to individuals, so they impose restrictions. For example, for the winner to avoid taxes, the prizes have to be for previous work.\n\n**Where to go for more information:**\n\nUSA.gov has a nice overview of the application process [here](https://www.usa.gov/start-nonprofit). The IRS has several publications and websites that you might find helpful: [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4220.pdf), [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf), [here](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4221pc.pdf), and [here](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/application-process).

However, there are important considerations and requirements:\n\n1. The organization must apply to the IRS for non-profit status and demonstrate a charitable purpose.\n2. It must meet annual distribution requirements, spending a certain percentage of its money each year on charitable work.\n3. Simply holding funds for future prizes may not be sufficient to meet these requirements, so the organization may need to engage in additional charitable activities (like the Clay Institute does) to satisfy IRS regulations.\n4. There are specific IRS rules regarding prizes given to individuals that need to be considered.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while a charitable trust is a possibility, a 501(c)(3) non-profit is more commonly used and offers more flexibility.

The underlying law, [RCW 43\\.06\\.220(h)](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.06.220) empowers issuing an order prohibiting \"Such other activities as he or she reasonably believes should be prohibited to help preserve and maintain life, health, property or the public peace\". Therefore I can walk my dog. When I do, there are a lot of people also out walking their dogs, so that provides a letter\\-of\\-the\\-law permitted exception to the stay\\-at\\-home order. Nothing in the order specifically addresses the situation where you pause your dog\\-walk to talk to a neighbor (the \"appropriate social distancing\" sub\\-rule only applies to recreational departures from your home).\n\nIt is well\\-established that the central legal issue is what the \"compelling government interest\" is, and whether these restrictions fail on grounds of narrow\\-tailoring or least\\-restrictiveness. The failure to include \"go to your brother's place for lunch, provided you follow appropriate social distancing guidelines\" as a permitted activity is a candidate for not being least\\-restrictive. The problem is that the courts will not engage in an infinite regress of second\\-guessings about whether certain measures are \"truly necessary\".\n\nThere is a [SCOTUS challenge](https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/19A1032-Stay-App.pdf) where the Pennsylvania Supreme Court [upheld that's state's order](https://cases.justia.com/pennsylvania/supreme-court/2020-68-mm-2020.pdf?ts=1586811868), but a SCOTUS order requires the state to reply to a petition by Monday.

As of the information provided, stay-at-home orders issued by state governors are considered legally valid until successfully challenged and overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS). The documentation mentions that \"governors have prevailed at the state level\" and that the \"status quo\" is that these orders are legal. While there have been challenges, including one to SCOTUS regarding Pennsylvania's order, no definitive ruling has been made to invalidate these orders broadly.\n\nOption A is incorrect because SCOTUS has not struck down these orders as unconstitutional. Option C is false because the example given shows that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court upheld the state's order, contradicting the claim that state supreme courts consistently rule against these orders.

The precise scope of what actions are sufficient to establish that duress is present vary. A credible threat that someone will kill you or your child is generally sufficient in every state that recognizes the defense. There is also a closely related defense known as \"choice of evils.\"\n\nThis said, eight years is a very long time and usually the defense of duress is available only if the threat was imminent or immediate. So, it is probably less likely than not that a finder of fact would conclude that it was impossible to seek to involve authorities in the situation, for all of the time in that eight year time period, without reasonably risking the threatened harm.\n\nAlso, while you call his acts \"treasonous\", in reality the crime of treason is defined very narrowly in the U.S. Constitution to taking up arms against your country and providing aid and comfort to people who are doing so, and the fact pattern suggested probably does not constitute treason under U.S. law.\n\nFinally, while his circumstances only dubiously are sufficient to assert a defense of duress over the sustained eight year time period, this doesn't mean that authorities couldn't choose to refrain from prosecuting him, or that the couldn't seek only lesser charges with mitigating circumstances conceded in sentencing, in an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. Often this exercise of prosecutorial discretion would be conditioned upon cooperation in the case brought against other defendants in related cases.\n\nIn an exceptional case, the pardon power could be invoked for relieve him from criminal liability as has been done in some past insurrections in U.S. history like the Whiskey Rebellion and the U.S. Civil War.

This raises the question of whether the design or the name/word may also be protected as \"registered trademarks\" when used separately, and the answer is no. A registered trademark is \"considered as a whole\" and if you want to protect parts of it, you would be required to apply separately for registration of those parts.\n\nA registration of a \"standard character\" mark may give much broader protection for a distinctive name than if it is only registered in combination with something else. Contrarily, a valuable (recognizable) logo may be the most important element, regardless of whether the name is with it.\n\nIn the USA, registration of a trademark is completely optional for enforcement in state or federal courts, although registration gives additional valuable rights, including \"national preemption\".\n\nSo, in theory, one could register a combination word\\-mark and design and then enforce the design (alone) or the word\\-mark (alone) outside of the registered rights (e.g., national preemption), and even place (tm) on it, but not \u00ae (circle R), if it is not federally registered as shown.\n\nThere are numerous gray areas in most aspects of trademark rules for registration, let alone enforcement, often tied to subjective evaluation of \"distinctiveness\" or \"related fields\" that may \"create a likelihood of confusion\" among reasonable consumers in that market.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A company wants to trademark both its name \"TechInnovate\" and its logo, which features a stylized gear.

At someone else's trial, he testifies on relativity as an expert. Answering questions, he explains both his special and general theories in terms a jury understands. Counsel thanks him. Opposing counsel in cross\\-examination asks Einstein if his theory includes a \"cosmological constant\". Einstein testifies firmly: \"No.\" Opposing counsel reads to the court from an earlier publication by Einstein that there is a cosmological constant. Einstein seems urgently about to say something but the judge reminds him that he may only answer questions he is asked and no questions are pending at the moment. Opposing counsel has no further questions, counsel who brought Einstein does not seek to ask anything (perhaps because not expecting this turn of events) and the witness is dismissed. Someone searching history would find that Einstein had publicly said that the cosmological constant was the \"biggest blunder of his life\", but a jury is not allowed to do outside research before issuing its verdict and this is not a nonjury trial. I understand that impeachment frequently works to persuade a trier of fact to disregard impeached testimony; assume such persuasiveness succeeds in this case.\n\nI think this illustrates an inadequacy of the system of determining the state of scholarship through expert testimony, among other reasons because it discourages bringing an expert who might ever have published a statement they would later dispute, and that would exclude most research scholars with long publication histories.

He can ask a question, such as \"Did you say ...?\", which provides Einstein an opportunity to answer in a way that maintains the credibility of his testimony, but consel cannot just enter his own testimony into the record. In addition, counsel on \"his side\" has the opportunity to pose appropriate clarifying questions, e.g. could ask \"Did you repudiate that idea 88 years ago?\", though there is a problem that the attorney may not have the technical expertise to recognize the subject\\-matter question that they should ask. \n\nExpert testimony does not attempt to determine the state of scholarship in an area, it attempts to resolve a specific factual matter. The two are not the same thing. Einstein would not testify as to what his general and special theories of relativity say, except in a bizarre universe where some person is accused of the crime of denying the theory of relativity. Instead, he might be testifying for the defense, where the defendant is accused of an act that (it turns out) is physically impossible in light of the theory of relativity. If Einstein had been in the habit of posing random mutually\\-contradictory conjectures on a weekly basis, opposing counsel's question could be relevant to establishing that the witness's testimony is not reliable. Theoretically, counsel could \"hint\" that the witness is scientifically flighty, so Einstein would have to have a credible explanation for changing his position.

In [Church of God, Etc. v. Amarillo Indep. Sch](http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/511/613/1429691/)., 511 F. Supp. 613, plaintiffs successfully sued the school district \"to enjoin the enforcement of the Amarillo School District's absence policy which limits the number of excused absences for religious holidays to two days each school year\", where \"A fundamental tenet of the Church of God is that members must abstain from secular activity on seven annual holy days\". The school district imposed an absence polity where \"School work missed may be made up whether an absence is excused or unexcused\", and \"Excused absences shall be granted to students for a maximum of 2 days for religious holidays in each school year\". The court concluded that \"This policy poses an unquestionable burden on the Plaintiffs' religious belief\", and \"This burden is not ameliorated by the make\\-up work provision. The provision does not require a teacher to evaluate the work made up. It in fact directs the teacher to enter a zero for that work\". In this case \"Summary judgment is granted and judgment rendered enjoining the enforcement of the Amarillo Independent School District's excused absence policy insofar as it limits the number of excused absences for religious holidays\".

If he actually refuses to cash your mailed check then that's all to the good for you.\n\n3\\) You can ignore any requirements imposed by the new landlord that aren't in the lease, just as the landlord could ignore any new requirement imposed on him by you.

Some tenants are currently away and unable to pay in person. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenants' rights and obligations in this situation?\n\nA) Tenants must comply with the new landlord's request to pay in person or risk eviction.\n\nB) Tenants can ignore the new payment requirement entirely without any consequences.\n\nC) Tenants can pay by mail using certified mail, and the landlord cannot legally evict them for doing so.\n\nD) Tenants must negotiate a new lease with the new landlord before making any rent payments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, tenants have the right to pay rent by mail, and no judge would evict a tenant for doing so. The new landlord cannot unilaterally impose new requirements that aren't in the original lease. Using certified mail provides proof of payment attempt. The landlord cashing the check would confirm acceptance of payment, and refusing to cash it would work in the tenant's favor. While tenants can't entirely ignore the landlord's communications, they are not obligated to comply with new requirements not specified in their lease, especially with such short notice.

The key phrase is \"all rights to all material created **in the course of your employment** with the Company\"\n\nThis means things created as part of your new job.

Why or why not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, the ePrivacy Directive is way more general than cookies. The translated Swedish law seems close to the original in the ePrivacy Directive:\n\n> Member States shall ensure that the storing of information, or the gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned has given his or her consent \\[\u2026]. This shall not prevent any technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user to provide the service.\n\n(from Art 5(3\\) [ePrivacy Directive](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02002L0058-20091219))\n\nSo, the general question when you access some JavaScript API is: what is the **purpose** of this access?\n\n* Is the access necessary for performing a service that the user explicitly requested? Then fine. For example, reading the browser window size or device class for the purpose of providing an appropriate layout is fine, because the user explicitly requested you to show them the website. Using LocalStorage to store user data for an offline\\-capable webapp is perfectly fine.\n* Otherwise, you will need consent. For example, reading the browser window size or device class for the purpose of better ad targeting would require consent, because the user did not explicitly request that you show them targeted ads. The user requested to see a website, and showing ads is not strictly necessary for that. Similarly, using any technologies that access or storage on the user's device to access, store, infer, or construct an advertising ID would require consent.\n\nThe WP29 has discussed this aspect of the ePrivacy Directive in their [Opinion 9/2014 on device fingerprinting (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp224_en.pdf). They explicitly note that \u201cJavaScript objects (e.g., document, window, screen, navigator, date and language)\u201d can be used to form a fingerprint, for example by accessing \u201cinformation relating to the screen size, colour depth and available system fonts. Other APIs may request access to information elements stored in the firmware (e.g. the CPU type), operating system (e.g. the OS type) or graphics card model. API calls may also reveal the presence of installed software (e.g. browser plug\\-ins) or even the precise version number\u201d.\n\nThe document defines criterion A and B to refer to the \u201ccarrying out the transmission\u201d and \u201cstrictly necessary for a service explicitly requested by the user\u201d exceptions, respectively.\n\n* For the specific case of first\\-party analytics purposes, WP29 notes:\n\n> However, the Opinion also stated that currently there is no exemption to consent for cookies that are strictly limited to first party anonymised and aggregated statistical purposes. Therefore, first\\-party website analytics through device fingerprinting do not fall under the exemption defined in\n> CRITERION A or B and consent of the user is required.\n* Similarly, for a user tracking for online behavioural advertising use case, WP29 states:\n\n> Opinion 04/2012 emphasised that third\\-party advertising does not fall under the exemption defined in CRITERION A or B. Therefore, device fingerprinting for the purpose of targeted advertising requires the consent of the user.\n\nThe [Opinion 04/2012 (PDF)](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2012/wp194_en.pdf) discusses these \u201ccookie consent exceptions\u201d in more detail, but of course this is more general than cookies and applies equivalently to any JavaScript API. In the summary, they caution that the \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d criterion must be interpreted narrowly:\n\n> When applying CRITERION B, it is important to examine what is strictly necessary from the point of view of **the user**, not the service provider.\n\nThese guidelines are rather dated, but since ePrivacy has remained essentially unchanged since then the WP29 guidelines and opinions are still the most authoritative discussion of these matters. The only relevant change is that the GDPR changed the definition of consent. The ePrivacy directive leaves no room for national derogations from the consent exception, though some countries like the Netherlands and (until 2021\\) Germany do provide exceptions. However, it is expected that the ePrivacy Directive will eventually be replaced by an ePrivacy Regulation that allows for access in case of a legitimate interest, similar to the more flexible approach chosen by the GDPR.

The general rule is that whoever creates the thing (book, song, software) has the exclusive right to the thing. If an employee of Company 1 writes software for Company 2, that employee might (rarely) hold the copyright, but typically that scenario would involve a \"work for hire\", where the employee is hired by Company 1 to do such tasks as part of his duties with Company 1 (which might then be given to Company 2\\). This would then be a [work for hire](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ09.pdf), and the copyright is held by Company 1\\. If the actual author was an independent contractor, he would hold the copyright \u2013 see [Community for Creative Non\\-Violence v. Reed](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/490/730/case.html) for analysis of the subtle nuances in making that determination.\n\nThe concept \"work for hire\" which crucially involves the \"employee\" relationship would not be applicable to Company 2 paying Company 1 for a product, and as long as the actual author is an employee of C1, C1 has not created a \"work for hire\" in the legal sense. Without some explicit disposition of copyright, Company 2 is in a sketchy position. Since C1 holds copyright, they must grant a license to C2 so that C2 can legally use it; or, C1 must transfer copyright to C2\\. This does not happen automatically, and (if C1 does not want to remedy the situation after the fact) C2 would need to take C1 to court to force a resolution to the situation. At that point, the issue would be what C1 *implicitly* promised, even though they didn't put it in writing. It is likely that the initial exchange was along the lines \"Can you make us a program that will do X?\", and the answer was \"Sure, that will cost Y\", and then \"Okay, go ahead, looking forward to the product\".

Once the company wishes to upgrade to a less ambiguous status, it can start by informing you accordingly and proceed based on your response.\n\nFurthermore, the prolonged uncertainty of both processing and granting of your visa in a country would make it inequitable to preclude you from trying to secure a job elsewhere.

The Art 2(2\\)(c) exemption for \u201cpurely personal or household activity\u201d does not apply since you're offering the service to the public.\n\nYou must consider GDPR compliance here. This is especially important as you are showing personal data to the *public*. Don't do that unless you have a very good reason, appropriate safeguards, and are clear to users how their information will be shown.\n\nOn a high level, GDPR compliance involves working on the following questions:\n\n* For what *purpose* are you processing personal data?\n\nContext: purpose limitation principle per GDPR Art 5(1\\)(b)\n* What is the *legal basis* for processing?\n\nGDPR Art 6(1\\) lists the available legal bases. Here, consent, necessity for performance of a contract, or a legitimate interest could be a legal basis. They may have further obligations attached. A legitimate interest requires a balancing test that considers the data subject's rights and freedoms. Consent must fulfil the conditions per Art 7 in order to be valid.\n* What is the *minimal data necessary* to achieve the purpose?\n\nPer the Art 5(1\\)(c) data minimisation principle, it is illegal to process personal data beyond what is necessary and adequate. You must provide *data protection by design and by default* per Art 25\\. Special categories of data per Art 9 such as health data are illegal to process outside of narrow exemptions. You must delete data once it is no longer necessary.\n* What *appropriate safeguards* and security measures should you apply?\n\nPer Art 24 and 25, you are responsible for determining and implementing appropriate measures. This depends a lot on your specific context, so there's no checklist you can apply. Per Art 25(1\\) you must pseudonymize the processed information if that is compatible with the processing purpose.\n* What *further compliance measures* do you have to consider?\n\nThere are additional GDPR and non\\-GDPR compliance measures. From the GDPR side:\n\n\t+ Use the answers to these questions to write a privacy policy, including the information that you must provide to data subjects per Art 13\\.\n\t+ Consider whether you have to maintain a Records of Processing document per Art 30, or if you have to make a Data Protection Impact Assessment per Art 35\\.\n\t+ If you use third party services, figure out whether they are a *joint controller* or *data processor* and apply appropriate safeguards.\n\t+ If you have data processors, ensure that you have a contract in place that covers the items from Art 28(3\\).\n\t+ If you share data with other controllers (not processors) you need a legal basis for doing so.\n\t+ If you transfer data into a non\\-EU/EEA country (after 2020: non\\-UK country) you need a legal basis per Art 44 and have to cover additional items in your privacy policy. Ideally, the target country is covered by an EC adequacy decision per Art 45\\. For US\\-based companies, this is the case only when they have self\\-certified under the Privacy Shield framework.Non\\-GDPR compliance steps could include cookie consent banners, or showing a VAT ID.\n* How can you prepare for *data subject requests*?\n\nData subjects have various rights per Arts 15\u201323, subject to the modalities in Art 12\\. For example, a data subject could request that their information is erased from your website. The exact rights also depend on the legal basis you selected.

It addresses several key GDPR principles:\n\n1. Data minimization (Art. 5(1)(c)) by only collecting essential information.\n2. Data protection by design and default (Art. 25) through pseudonymization.\n3. Accountability (Art. 5(2)) by conducting a DPIA, which is likely necessary given the public display of personal data.\n4. Transparency (Art. 12-14) by providing a clear privacy policy.\n\nWhile option A includes important elements (consent and encryption), it doesn't address data minimization or transparency requirements.

But, that isn't the only conceivable procedural approach.\n\nBut, it isn't obvious that you couldn't have a process in which the determination were made first, administratively, and could be contested within a reasonable time after the person affected has notice of it by having the affected person bring a lawsuit challenging the determination.\n\nThe process would have to have a timeline that would not prevent a person who successfully challenged the classification from running for and winning public office.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the copyright of this work?\n\nA) The musician can only copyright the lyrics, as the melody is from a public domain folk song.\n\nB) The musician can copyright the entire song, including the melody, as she has created a new arrangement.\n\nC) The musician can copyright the lyrics and the recording, but not the melody itself.\n\nD) The musician cannot copyright any part of the work, as it's based on a pre-existing melody.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, copyright is automatic and begins to exist when a work is created. In this case, the musician's original lyrics are protected by copyright. Additionally, the recording of the performance is also protected by copyright. However, the melody itself, being from an old folk song, is likely in the public domain and cannot be copyrighted by the musician simply for reusing it. The combination of the public domain melody with the original lyrics is protected, but not the melody on its own. Options A and B are incorrect because they either understate or overstate what can be copyrighted. Option D is incorrect because it falsely suggests that nothing can be copyrighted when parts of the work are indeed eligible for copyright protection."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2207/driving-through-a-red-after-traffic-lights-have-been-broken", "docs_id": 2207, "title": "Driving through a red after traffic lights have been broken", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A situation happened to me today that got me thinking. I live in Victoria, Australia.\n\nI was driving and entered an intersection on a green light to make a turn. I waited until there was no oncoming traffic, by which time the light turned amber, to complete my turn. As I was completing my turn the lights started to flash amber, which indicates an error with the signals and that drivers need to follow the rules for unregulated intersections. (There are also some pedestrian crossings with red\\-amber\\-green lights that flash amber as part of their cycle before turning back to green, but not in the area I was driving.)\n\nAfter I completed the turn I could see that at least the next two sets of lights had been affected too and were flashing amber as well. As I approached the first set it changed back to red and I was able to stop in time. I was wondering what would have happened if I drove through the intersection just as the light changed to red (with not enough time to stop) and got a fine for driving through a red light? Would the authorities realise that there had just been an outage of the traffic lights and not issue it or would I have to prove that the lights had just been down to avoid having to pay the fine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you were to be issued a ticket in such circumstances, you would likely be able to bring up an affirmative defense that it was not possible for you to stop safely in the circumstances, an action most likely required by the statutes.\n\nP.S. I've actually sat through a traffic trial where some guy in KW, Ontario, was defending against a red\\-light ticket he has gotten when passing a red light in the winter. I recall that his defense basically amounted to the fact that he would not have been able to stop safely in the circumstances (a requirement / exception of the statute), that the pavement was too slippery, other cars were nearby (maybe a car that followed, which would not have been able to stop had he stopped?), and that the light was likely still yellow when he crossed into the intersection (he took quite some time to cross\\-examine the cop). I recall that he was acquitted, but the guy did look quite exhausted from the trial!", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Victoria, Australia, a driver enters an intersection on a green light to make a turn. While waiting for oncoming traffic to clear, the light turns amber. As the driver completes the turn, the traffic lights begin flashing amber, indicating a system error. The driver approaches the next set of lights, which suddenly changes from flashing amber to solid red. The driver passes through this red light, unable to stop safely. If issued a ticket, what is the driver's best course of action?\n\nA) Accept the fine, as passing through a red light is always illegal regardless of circumstances\nB) Argue that the ticket should be dismissed because the lights were malfunctioning\nC) Present an affirmative defense that it was not possible to stop safely given the sudden change from flashing amber to red\nD) Claim ignorance of the law and request leniency from the court\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The best course of action for the driver is to present an affirmative defense that it was not possible to stop safely given the circumstances. This aligns with the information provided in the documentation, which mentions that such a defense is likely to be valid when it's not possible to stop safely. The sudden change from flashing amber (indicating a system error) to solid red creates a situation where the driver may not have had sufficient time or distance to stop safely. This defense addresses both the unusual circumstances of the malfunctioning lights and the safety considerations, making it the strongest option. Options A and D are incorrect as they don't utilize the valid defense available. Option B, while touching on the malfunctioning lights, doesn't fully address the safety aspect, which is crucial in traffic law."}}
