This notice should specify the time of the visit, who will be conducting it, and the reason for the inspection.

However, the 1911 Act contains no explicit statement of who adjudicates any disagreement as to whether or not a particular bill contains \"any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years\". Who would adjudicate any such disagreement?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Before getting into the technical answer to this question it is worth noting that when matters of a constitutional nature are involved then in practice it is not just a matter of a technical \"legal\" answer. Students and academics like to pose hypothetical questions such as \"What would happen if the Queen refused assent to a Bill?\" or \"If Parliament is supreme, could it abolish the courts?\" etc. The practical reality is that a liberal democracy, such as ours, ultimately relies on those in positions of power to respect the democratic conventions and preserve the constitution. When there is a legal angle to some constitutional issue the courts will play their part but, whatever legal analysis their judgments may contain, they will always have in mind the importance of maintaining our democratic system. It is also worth noting that where an Act contains an \"ouster\" clause (saying that a certificate of X shall not be questioned in any court of law) the courts always find a way to interpret that so that it does not apply in any case where the courts think they should adjudicate!\n\nThose preliminaries out of the way, I think the technical legal answer to your question is that first of all the Speaker decides and provides a certificate under s.2(2\\). You will see that s.2(1\\) deals with \"any other bill\" (your third bullet point) and s.2(2\\) requires a certificate from the Speaker that \"the provisions of this section have been duly complied with\" (i.e. that it is indeed in the \"any other bill\" category).\n\nOf course there is a further question of whether, if the Speaker gets it wrong, the courts could intervene and exactly how that might happen (the so\\-called \"John Bercow question\" of what if a Speaker goes rogue), but the initial technical answer to you question is \"the Speaker of the House of Commons\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Parliament Act 1911, who has the primary responsibility for determining whether a bill contains \"any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years,\" and what potential checks exist on this determination?\n\nA) The Prime Minister makes the determination, with the Supreme Court able to review the decision if challenged.\n\nB) The House of Lords collectively decides, with no formal mechanism for external review.\n\nC) The Speaker of the House of Commons makes the determination, but the courts may potentially intervene if the decision is disputed.\n\nD) The Monarch makes the final determination, with advice from the Privy Council.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Speaker of the House of Commons has the primary responsibility for determining the nature of bills, including whether they contain provisions to extend Parliament's duration beyond five years. This is consistent with the Speaker's role in certifying money bills under the Act. However, the answer acknowledges the potential for judicial intervention in extreme cases, reflecting the complex interplay between parliamentary procedure and the courts in the UK's constitutional system. While the Act doesn't explicitly state who would adjudicate disagreements about bills extending Parliament's duration, the courts may find ways to intervene if they deem it necessary to preserve democratic norms, especially in cases where a Speaker might be seen as acting improperly. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they misattribute the primary decision-making power and don't accurately reflect the potential for judicial review in the UK's constitutional framework."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13111/moved-to-colorado-been-here-60-days-my-license-plate-expired-what-can-i-do", "docs_id": 13111, "title": "Moved to Colorado, been here 60 days &amp; my license plate expired.

Therefore, the most conservative and likely correct interpretation is that the one-year period begins from the date the individual was wrongly sent to prison, making option C the correct answer."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24243/what-legally-justifies-eminent-domain", "docs_id": 24243, "title": "What, Legally, Justifies Eminent Domain?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the United States, under the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Federal Government's power of Eminent Domain is established:\n\n> nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\n\nTherefore, even in a case where the use of Eminent Domain went against the expressed wishes of a given State, so long as it was \"justly compensated\" the Federal Government has full legal authority of the claiming of land.\n\nMy question is: why? I know arguments about public necessity, and the origins of the practice in English Common Law, but what I'm looking for, is twofold:\n\n1. Where in the Constitution is it stated the Federal Government has full legal jurisdiction over all State land?\n2. Is this interpretation (that the Federal Government has complete control over State land) actually correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Article I, Section 8 of the United States lists the powers of Congress (and a handful a sprinkled elsewhere in the U.S. Constitution and its amendments, such as the power to regulate court jurisdiction in Article III and the enforcement powers of the 13th and 14th Amendments, to give a non\\-exclusive list).\n\nThese powers include powers reasonable and necessary to achieve the other powers.\n\nVarious federal statutes authorize eminent domain power exercises in different contexts for different purposes expressly set forth in those statutes and the constitution.\n\nThe [Supremacy Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) of the United States Constitution (Article VI, Clause 2\\) makes federal law supreme over state law in every state. It states:\n\n> This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be\n>  made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be\n>  made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme\n>  Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,\n>  any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary\n>  notwithstanding.\n\nThe federal government has control over everything happening in U.S. states to the extent that it is in furtherance of the limited powers of the federal government set forth in the constitution, and not in violation of any prohibition on federal action in that area (e.g. the federal government can bribe state governments but cannot generally force them to take a particular action on its behalf)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the U.S. Constitution and the information provided, which of the following statements most accurately describes the federal government's power of eminent domain in relation to state lands?\n\nA) The federal government can only exercise eminent domain over state lands with explicit permission from the state government.\n\nB) The federal government has unlimited power to seize any state land without compensation, as long as it's for public use.\n\nC) The federal government can exercise eminent domain over state lands for purposes within its constitutional powers, provided just compensation is paid.\n\nD) States have the right to nullify any federal eminent domain action within their borders, regardless of compensation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. This answer aligns with the information provided in the documentation. The federal government's power of eminent domain stems from the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which allows for private property to be taken for public use with just compensation. The Supremacy Clause (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that federal law is supreme over state law. Additionally, Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution outlines the powers of Congress, which include powers necessary to achieve other constitutional powers.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the federal government doesn't need explicit state permission to exercise eminent domain, as long as it's acting within its constitutional powers.\n\nOption B is wrong because it overstates the federal government's power. While the government can exercise eminent domain, it must provide just compensation and the taking must be for public use.\n\nOption D is incorrect because states cannot nullify federal actions that are constitutionally valid.

It is reasonable to presume that none of the current tenants entered their respective leases knowing that a new fee would be invented sometime during their lease.\n\nThe landlord can always add a clause on service fee in future leases, but he is bound by the terms of the current leases and cannot alter them by means of a memo.\n\nMutual consent might be inferred, though, in the case of any tenants who henceforth abide by the memo."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Washington state, a property manager attempts to implement a new $25 service fee for all tenants by leaving a memo at their doors.

Option C correctly reflects this legal requirement. Option A is incorrect as it disregards the need for proper notice and lease term completion.

Colo. 2003\\) is a \"reverse piercing\" case which involves different considerations than ordinary veil piercing. The Court in that case reasoned that if the debtors in bankruptcy were the only people with any ownership interest in the LLC that the debtors' control passed to the bankruptcy trustee notwithstanding the general rule under Colorado law that a transferee of a member of an LLC loses all control rights in the company. \n\nIn part, this decision flows from the particular feature of Colorado LLC law at the time that the default rule otherwise would have been that no one at all would ever have any right to control the operations or management of the LLC because there was no statute providing for who could control an LLC in Colorado which had no members because all members of the LLC were transferees of members without voting or control rights.\n\nThe fact that the LLC was a single member LLC is really less relevant than the fact that all owners of the LLC were bankrupts and that no one else had any control rights with regard to the company.\n\nAlso, importantly, *Albright* is not, as the question claims, a \"judicial foreclosure\". It is an exercise of the rights of a bankruptcy trustee whose is carrying out right to ownership of the debtor's property in accordance with federal bankruptcy law that overrides conflicting state law. Essentially, the Court ruled that notwithstanding the plain language of state law that a bankruptcy trustee is a substitute member of an LLC with the same control rights as the debtor, rather than an economic interest owner with no control rights as would be the case normally in a voluntary transfer of a membership interest without the permission of the other members to admit the new member.\n\nSo, under the reasoning of *Albright* any bankrupt debtor whose membership interest was transferred to the bankruptcy trustee who had the power to dissolve the company would give the bankruptcy trustee the same power, even if the LLC was not a single member LLC.\n\n[*Olmstead v. FTC*](http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/decisions/2010/sc08-1009.pdf), Case No . SC08\\-1009 (Fla. June 24, 2010\\) is also a reverse piercing case. It involves a debtor of an owner of an LLC trying to seize the ownership interest, just as a creditor of an owner of a corporation could seize the shares of the corporation that the debtor owns including all voting rights in the corporation. The seizure of the assets of the LLC is only indirect as a result of the control rights obtained by seizing ownership of the ownership interest of the debtor. \n\nBut, unlike *Albright*, *Olmstead* does not involve a bankruptcy court and in instead an attempt to enforce a judgment against the owner of an entity.\n\nIn answer to that question, the Court in *Olmstead* holds that:\n\n> For the reasons we explain, we conclude that the statutory charging\n>  order provision does not preclude application of the creditor\u2018s remedy\n>  of execution on an interest in a single\\-member LLC.\n\nAs a matter of policy, the concerns associated with veil piercing are very different from the concerns associated with \"reverse piercing\" by allowing a creditor to seize by execution the membership interests of a debtor, so I would expect the trend to continue. There is no good policy reason to deny a creditor the right to an ownership interest in an entity of a debtor when the exemption law of a state do not so provide, as they generally do not.\n\nSimilar laws have disregarded self\\-settled trusts as a defense against the settlor's creditors."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A creditor is attempting to seize the ownership interest of a single-member LLC owned by a debtor.

FTC case established that creditors can seize the ownership interest of a single-member LLC, including all voting and control rights, despite statutory charging order provisions. The Florida Supreme Court ruled that the charging order provision does not preclude the creditor's remedy of execution on an interest in a single-member LLC. This decision reflects a trend towards allowing creditors to access LLC interests more directly, particularly in cases of single-member LLCs where there are no other members' interests to protect.

This has to be a course of conduct intentionally calculated to utterly crush someone emotionally without justification, generally through some form of humiliation. The nature of the conduct must far exceed what would ordinarily be considered harassment or taunting. There is also a closely related concept called a [prima facie tort](https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/bulr63&div=36&id=&page=) which involves intentional and unjustified harm to others not covered by another recognized tort, which is much less widely recognized.\n\nThe U.S. also recognizes a common law tort known as \"[negligent infliction of emotional distress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent_infliction_of_emotional_distress)\" which applies to allow a non\\-economic damages recovery from someone in the \"zone of danger\" of an accident that causes physical injury to another person or to property. The classic case would be brought by a parent holding hands with a child whose child is hit by a car and grievously injured or killed right before their eyes. This tort is not very common and not accepted in all jurisdictions. \n\nClosely related to negligent infliction of emotional distress damages are awards for [loss of consortium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_consortium), which is a claim for non\\-economic harm caused to a spouse by tortious conduct that injures the spouse by the non\\-injured spouse directly against the wrong doer by the non\\-injured spouse (in some states a parent can also make a loss of consortium claim with regard to a child).\n\nAlso somewhat related is the concept of a wrongful death lawsuit, which is typically vested by statute in the next of kin of the person wrongfully killed, rather than in the decedent's probate estate, and can include both economic and non\\-economic damages. Often in a wrongful death case, rather than seeking economic damages, one can seek a flat compensatory amount fixed by statute called a \"[solatium](https://www.ffcolorado.com/overview-of-damages-available-in-colorado-wrongful-death-cases/)\" that is primarily representative of non\\-economic harm to the next of kin.\n\nThere are also other U.S. torts which can give rise to non\\-economic damages without physical or economic harm to person or physical property.\n\nNon\\-economic damages without physical harm are frequently awarded in civil rights lawsuits brought against someone acting under the color of law pursuant to [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) even when the right violated, such as a right to vote, or a right to use public accommodations in a manner not subject to discrimination, does not involve damage to person or property. Similarly, a violation of a discrimination or sexual harassment statutes, such as the federal [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964), by a private individual can give rise to a claim for non\\-economic damages even without proof of economic damages.\n\nThe U.S. also recognizes some [privacy torts](https://www.shmoop.com/study-guides/civics/right-to-privacy/privacy-torts) (not all of which are recognized in every state) and claims for [breaches of fiduciary duty](https://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/business-laws-and-regulations/breach-of-fiduciary-duty.html), for which there may be a cause of action for non\\-economic damages even in the absence of proven economic damage. For example, if an attorney breaches his duty of confidentiality to publicly reveal highly embarrassing personal facts about you, you could sue the attorney for non\\-economic damages.\n\nClaims for [nuisance](https://lawshelf.com/shortvideoscontentview/tort-law-the-rules-of-private-nuisance/) (e.g. from a neighbor's noisy or smelly conduct on the neighbor's own property) can give rise to claims for non\\-economic damage, and while they would often include claims for related economic damage (often quantified in the form of lost rental value of property), this isn't always required.\n\nMost U.S. states have abolished their [heart balm torts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alienation_of_affections) such as alienation of affection (i.e. causing someone to divorce their spouse), \"criminal conversion\" (i.e. adultery), and also torts related to broken engagements to marry, but a few states, most notably, North Carolina, retain them and essentially allow private adultery lawsuits for both economic and non\\-economic harm (or one without the other).\n\nClaims for [libel *per se*](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1154), which involve a false statement about another which accuses him/her of a crime, immoral acts, inability to perform his/her profession, having a loathsome disease (like syphilis) or dishonesty in business, can give rise to a claim for non\\-economic damages, in the absence of any proof of specific economic harm arising from the related damage to your reputation.\n\nThe U.S. [does not recognize defamation lawsuits based upon truthful statements](https://injury.findlaw.com/torts-and-personal-injuries/defamation-law-the-basics.html), even though, under many historical criminal defamation statutes, statements tending to harm the reputations of the dead, and statements calling attentions to the natural deficiencies of the living (i.e. mocking mentally or physically disabled people) were actionable.

If I take an article published by Jones in an obscure journal and publish it to another journal under my name, with some light paraphrasing, that is both plagiarism and copyright infringement. If I publish that article under Jones' name, that is copyright infringement and not plagiarism. If I completely rewrite the ideas of the article and publish under my name (not crediting the original author, that is plagiarism and not copyright infringement). The essence of plagiarism is taking the ideas of another without giving credit. The essence of copyright infringement is copying without permission. So there is no legal penalty to taking credit for someone else's ideas.\n\nAs for your economic question, an infringer may be liable for compensatory damages.

Many of the issues now being considered problematic were raised not only at the time, but years earlier.\n\nMy question is:\n---------------\n\nDo the Prime Minister's current statements mean that his previous actions in signing the Withdrawal Agreement were threatening to \"deprive\" the monarch of her territory, and that by pushing it through Parliament at speed and in the manner in which he did, that he \"intimidated or overawed\" at least one of those Houses in this regard?\n\nAs I have no legal training, I cannot trust my own interpretation of the Act: my interpretation would mean all republicans would be in prison for life, which clearly doesn't happen.\n\nI am *not* asking if the Withdrawal Agreement actually has the effect that the Prime Minister claims it has, but rather what would be true if one assumes it has the effect that the Prime Minister claims it has.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do the Prime Minister's current statements mean that his previous actions in signing the Withdrawal Agreement were threatening to \"deprive\" the monarch of her territory, and that by pushing it through Parliament at speed and in the manner in which he did, that he \"intimidated or overawed\" at least one of those Houses in this regard?\n\nNo. The Queen will not be \"deprived\" of any of her territory. She is still Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has not reunified with Ireland, nor has Scotland declared independence and also removed her as Head of State.\n\nHe also did not \"intimidate or overawe\" at least one of the Houses. This is for two reasons:\n\n1. The prime minister has political and legal legitimacy through the holding of a (sometimes substantial) majority in the Commons. If the Act passes the Commons, it will be because the prime minister enjoys the support of the MPs on their side (or at least a majority of MPs in the House, e.g. the Tory\\-DUP agreement of recent years).\n2. Under the Salisbury Convention, the House of Lords will not block any legislation that was promised in a Government's election manifesto. While the prime minister did not enter office on the back of a General Election when he agreed the Withdrawal Agreement with the EU, the subsequent amending and implementing Act of 2020 *was* mentioned in the Government's election manifesto in December 2019 and therefore the Lords will not block such legislation.\n\nGiven these two facts, it is almost impossible to declare that either House were \"intimidated or overawed\". For example, the prime minister did not hold a gun to the heads of his MPs, he did not surround the House of Lords with an army until they voted the way he wanted them to. The fact that the Commons willingly supported his legislative programme, and by convention the Lords didn't block it, is evidence that the prime minister and his government enjoys political, and subsequently legal, legitimacy.\n\nIn any event, the Queen cannot commit treason against herself. Anything done on the advice of her ministers cannot, on the face of it, constitute treason.\n\nFurthermore, the Prime Minister has not, on the facts, done anything that constitutes treason. Even if he were to *technically* commit treason by the letter of the Act somehow, the matter would have to be proven beyond reasonable doubt and it is highly likely that all but the most obvious and egregious examples would not meet the threshold for prosecution.\n\nFor example, it would almost certainly not be in the public interest to prosecute a prime minister for delivering on their legitimate policy aims in line with the legal (correct) functioning of our legislative system.\n\nIndeed, it is hard to imagine any court agreeing that such activities are treason when the relevant Acts passed both Houses, and the Government of the day had legitimacy in the Commons with a substantial majority after a General Election in which the legislation formed a key manifesto commitment, and the Salisbury Convention means that the Lords didn't oppose it; they would likely hold that such activities are the intended outcome of our current democratic system.\n\nI cannot think of any examples (barring something like murdering the monarch) where a sitting prime minister could conceivably be charged with treason. Even advising the Queen to abdicate would not constitute treason, provided that the necessary Act had passed in both Houses. Perhaps it might be treason if the prime minister advised so without any legislation in place, but that would seem more of a political matter for Parliament to deal with in reality.\n\nI suppose it is possible that *if* a prime minister advised the Queen to abdicate without the legitimate consent of Parliament (as expressed through the passing of legislation), it is possible that they would be removed from office if a no\\-confidence motion was passed by the Commons and then they *might* be prosecuted, but it seems most unlikely."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the analysis of the Treason Felony Act 1848 and the Prime Minister's actions regarding the EU Withdrawal Agreement, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The Prime Minister's actions in signing and pushing through the Withdrawal Agreement constitute treason under the Treason Felony Act 1848.\n\nB) The Prime Minister's statements about the EU potentially blocking food products to Northern Ireland prove he intended to deprive the monarch of her territory.\n\nC) The Prime Minister's actions do not constitute treason, as they were carried out through legitimate political and legal processes.\n\nD) The House of Lords was intimidated or overawed by the Prime Minister's actions in pushing through the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The analysis indicates that the Prime Minister's actions, while controversial, do not constitute treason under the Treason Felony Act 1848. The actions were carried out through legitimate political and legal processes, including passing legislation through both Houses of Parliament with a majority in the Commons and adhering to the Salisbury Convention in the Lords. The Queen was not deprived of any territory, and there's no evidence of intimidation or overawing of either House of Parliament. The passage of legislation through normal democratic channels, even if rushed or controversial, does not meet the threshold for treason as defined in the Act."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53508/what-relevance-does-litigation-misconduct-have-in-custody-cases-does-the-pkpa-p", "docs_id": 53508, "title": "What Relevance Does Litigation Misconduct Have In Custody Cases?

The title given to the PKPA in the [US Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1738A) says it all: *Full faith and credit given to child custody determinations.* The PKPA tells state courts when they have to give \"full faith and credit\" (ie, recognize and apply) to the custody decisions of courts in other states.\n\nThe PKPA was meant to prevent a parent who *already had a judicial custody order* from *forum shopping,* going to another state hoping to get a better order from its courts.\n\nThe situation you describe is pretty much why the PKPA only applies to parents who have judicial order. When the parents don't have a court order, they will have to get one. That means they first have to find a court to take the case. Then, in order to come up with a custody order, that court will have to sort through a bunch of evidence. The court will ask what the parents have already agreed. It certainly could consider those texts. Depending on what the texts say, and what else is going on, the court may even accept the texts, but it does not have to do so. However, by law the court has to consider a bunch of other stuff, such as the \"best interests of the child.\"\n\nIn such circumstances, whether there is an informal \"agreement\" that courts should follow is an open question that some court will have to answer. Under the PKPA, if there is a court order that meets the PKPA tests, the question is no longer open \\-\\- the court must implement the existing order.

This prevents parents from engaging in forum shopping by moving to another state in hopes of obtaining a more favorable custody order. The act does not directly prevent parents from taking children across state lines, nor does it automatically grant custody or allow free relocation.

For a U.S. court to have jurisdiction, there needs to be a nexus (connection) between the company's actions and the United States. Without such a connection, the court would not have the authority to hear the case or enforce any judgment. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the reach of U.S. courts.

So, the new owners have an \"in rem\" responsibility to pay those taxes that can be collected against them solely by foreclosing on the tax lien and seizing the property if the tax isn't paid. Whether the previous owners also have any responsibility for the unpaid property taxes depends on state law which varies and on the terms of the real estate purchase and sale contract and deed in the transaction.\n\nWhere I live, the real estate buyer is protected against a surprise tax bill once the sale is done in two main ways. \n\nFirst, the title company provides insurance against unpaid real estate taxes and will deduct any potential unpaid real estate taxes from the funds provided to the seller at closing unless the country treasurer has verified in writing to them that there are no real estate tax arrears for that parcel of property.\n\nSecond, if the property is conveyed by a warranty deed that does not exclude a warranty that there are no property tax liens in existence for the relevant years, then the buyer has a right to sue the seller for the unpaid back taxes if that warranty turns out not to be true. Almost all sales of real property for full consideration between unrelated parties are carried out by a general warranty deed of this type that doesn't exclude property tax liens except for the current calendar year.\n\nIf there is no title company involved in the transaction and/or the property is not conveyed by a warranty deed (e.g. it is conveyed by a quitclaim deed), then you could still avoid this risk by checking with the county treasurer to see if any back property taxes are owed on the parcel being sold and getting a certification in writing from the county treasurer of that fact, before agreeing to close on the sale.\n\nThe title insurance company, or you, if there is no title insurance company, should also check the county real estate records normally maintained by a county clerk or recorder, to confirm that the seller really owns the property sold and that it has not been sold in a tax sale which would eliminate the back tax obligation but which would also mean that the seller no longer owns the property."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A real estate buyer is considering purchasing a property and wants to protect themselves against potential unpaid property taxes from the previous owner.

In using lethal force, you would have committed first degree murder, under [RCW 9A.32\\.030](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.32&full=true). There is a defense that can be used, per [RCW 9A.16\\.050](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.16&full=true), that homicide is justified when:\n\n> In the lawful defense of the slayer, or his or her husband, wife,\n>  parent, child, brother, or sister, or of *any other person in his or\n>  her presence* or company, when there is reasonable ground to apprehend\n>  a design on the part of the person slain to commit a felony or to do\n>  some great personal injury to the slayer or to any such person, and\n>  there is imminent danger of such design being accomplished.\n\nLaw enforcement officers have access to justifiable homicide defenses as well under 9A.16\\.040, for example\n\n> (b) When necessarily used by a peace officer to overcome actual\n>  resistance to the execution of the legal process, mandate, or order of\n>  a court or officer, or in the discharge of a legal duty\n\nor\n\n> (c) When necessarily used by a peace officer or person acting under\n>  the officer's command and in the officer's aid: (i) To arrest or\n>  apprehend a person who the officer reasonably believes has committed,\n>  has attempted to commit, is committing, or is attempting to commit a\n>  felony\n\nThe outcome of the case would hinge in part on whether the officer's arrest and use of force was lawful. To take two extremes, if the guy on the ground had just killed a dozen people and was aiming to rack up another dozen kills, the officer's arrest would almost certainly be held to be legal and his degree of force justified. Your personal belief that the suspect was compliant and unarmed might be refuted by the facts. On the other hand, if the guy on the ground had slept with the officer's sister and the officer wanted to rid the world of this vermin, then the arrest and force would almost certainly be held to be not legal.\n\nIt can be legal to use deadly force to resist unlawful arrest. See [John Bad Elk v. United States, 177 U.S. 529](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/177/529/case.html), where the court held that\n\n> if a party resisted arrest by an officer without warrant, and who had\n>  no right to arrest him, and if, in the course of that resistance, the\n>  officer was killed, the offence of the party resisting arrest would be\n>  reduced from what would have been murder, if the officer had had the\n>  right to arrest, to manslaughter\n\nThe court also said\n\n> where the officer is killed in the course of the disorder which\n>  naturally accompanies an attempted arrest that is resisted, the law\n>  looks with very different eyes upon the transaction when the officer\n>  had the right to make the arrest from what it does if the officer had\n>  no such right. What might be murder in the first case might be nothing\n>  more than manslaughter in the other, or the facts might show that no\n>  offense had been committed.\n\nThis ruling has been somewhat eroded, in [US v. Simon](http://openjurist.org/409/f2d/474/united-states-v-simon):\n\n> We recognize that law enforcement officers are frequently called on to\n>  make arrests without warrants and should not be held, so far as their\n>  personal security is concerned, to a nicety of distinctions between\n>  probable cause and lack of probable cause in differing situations of\n>  warrantless arrests. It is for this reason we believe that the force\n>  of John Bad Elk has been diminished\n\nThe upshot of this is that (assuming no warrant), leeway is granted to officers in assessing probable cause (I'm not sure anybody really knows at a general conceptual level what constitutes \"probable cause\". The court seems to imply that the remote hearsay used as the basis for the arrest would not have been sufficient for a warrant, but it was \"reasonable grounds\" for believing accused had committed a crime).\n\nYour premise that the officer is about to shoot would have to be substantiated by some fact, such as a declaration \"I'm gonna kill you\". Otherwise, your belief that the officer was about to commit unjustified murder would itself be unjustified. With better fleshing out of the circumstances, you could manufacture a justified\\-homicide scenario."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A civilian witnesses a police officer about to discharge his firearm at a person lying face down on the ground.

Until now landlord has not returned my $750 deposit.\n\nAccording to landlord, the bath tub was spotless when I moved in, but I could see it had been in use for at least 5 years. There was already another tenant in the other guest room when I moved in. My room had been used by Landlord's son. All of these occupants have only one bath tub to share.\n\nA few months later we noticed minor mold in the bathtub. Landlord insisted (by email) that the other current tenant (Zuhur) and I restore it to the original condition, using our own money to pay for two thirds of the total cost.\n\nThere\u2019s no ventilation to prevent mold, but there are many wet objects in the bath room creating moisture.\n\nThe crack became visible to everyone a few days after I moved in, when there was another short\\-term tenant \\+ me sharing the common bathtub. No idea who caused it, but there's a clue \\-\\- the plastic (not ceramic) bathtub lacked solid support underneath, so much so that any adult standing on it would notice the base sinking down. This was noticed by all tenants I have spoken to. The wife of the landlord confirmed that the installation was not perfect and missed the support beneath the tub. Unfortunately no one is willing to provide written witness. This crack is probably the main reason for the replacement, even though the landlord has always mentioned it as a second \"problem\" to be fixed \\-\\- his emails always singles out the mold as the primary problem.\n\nIn Dec 2017, landlord finally fixed the bathtub. He didn't treat the mold but instead replaced the entire bathtub and sent me a bill over $3000\\. I replied to say let court decided how much I should pay. Landlord then counter\\-sued me for $5000 damage to his property.\n\nAs to the \"ordinary cost of repairs\", for mold it should be a few hundred dollars.

In [San Francisco](http://library.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/California/health/article11nuisances?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:sanfrancisco_ca$anc=JD_581), for example, \n\n> No Person shall have upon any premises or real property owned,\n>  occupied or controlled by him, or her, or it any public nuisance\n>  \\[which includes] Any visible or otherwise demonstrable mold or mildew\n>  in the interiors of any buildings or facilities\n\nThis does not say whether the owner or the occupant is liable for remediating the situation. Shower mold is gross but not a health hazard (the SF ordinance just lumps all mold into one category).\n\nSince you have no written lease, there is no automatic clean\\-up requirement. There might be a law requiring a tenant to clean the premise to its original condition, for instance in [Washington](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.130), tenant must\n\n> Upon termination and vacation, restore the premises to their initial\n>  condition except for reasonable wear and tear or conditions caused by\n>  failure of the landlord to comply with his or her obligations under\n>  this chapter.\n\nLandlord duties are [here](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=59.18.060): there is no duty to provide ventilation.\n\nHowever, the bathtub appears to be in a common area and not your particular unit. The landlord duties also require the landlord to\n\n> Keep any shared or common areas reasonably clean, sanitary, and safe\n>  from defects increasing the hazards of fire or accident\n\nso in Washington, it's his problem and not yours.\n\nIn general, even if a tenant is responsible for some form of cleanup, that does not constitute legal license for a facility upgrade. It might cost a couple hundred dollars to hire a person to wash ordinary mold accumulation, and does not justify getting a $5,000 new tub. Since this is in a common area, you would not be solely liable for whatever the damage was.\n\nThe part where you say \"crack in a common bath tub\" is a large red flag: it suggests to me that somebody negligently broke the bathtub, and then caused behind\\-the\\-wall damage by letting water infiltrate without notifying the landlord. If you broke the tub and let it rot, you could be liable. If the tub was broken already and the landlord didn't bother to do anything about it, that is his negligence.\n\nThe three questions that you should try to answer are: (1\\) what are the duties of landlord and tenant in my jurisdiction, (2\\) what was the actual harm done, and who did it, (3\\) what is the ordinary cost of whatever repair was done."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a mold and crack issue in a shared bathtub in a rental property in White Plains, NY, with no signed lease agreement, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's liability?\n\nA) The tenant is fully responsible for the $3000 bathtub replacement cost because they used the bathtub during their tenancy.\n\nB) The tenant has no liability because the bathtub is in a common area and the landlord is responsible for maintaining common areas.\n\nC) The tenant is partially liable for the cost of mold remediation, but not for the full replacement of the bathtub or the crack repair.\n\nD) The tenant is fully liable for both the mold remediation and the bathtub replacement, including the crack repair, as they failed to report the issues immediately.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because:\n1.

However, it did not want to give the colonies equal power and become a \"colony of its former colonies\" \\[1, pg. 9\\-10].\n\nIt was with this context that the [provisional French government](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouvernement_provisoire_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_fran%C3%A7aise) set out to write a new constitution for France. However, this issue was so important, that the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law was passed *ahead* of the Constitution of 1946\\. It states in its original French:\n\n> \u00c0 partir du 1er juin 1946, tous les ressortissants des territoires d'outre\\-mer (Alg\u00e9rie comprise) ont la qualit\u00e9 de citoyen, au m\u00eame titre que les nationaux fran\u00e7ais de la m\u00e9tropole et des territoires d'outre\\-mer. Des lois particuli\u00e8res \u00e9tabliront les conditions dans lesquelles ils exerceront leurs droits de citoyens.\n\nTeska's translation \\[2, pg. 1]:\n\n> Beginning on the 1st of June 1946, all inhabitants of the overseas territories (including Algeria) have the quality of citizen, of the same title as French nationals from the metropole and overseas territories. Specific laws will establish the conditions under which they will exercise their rights as citizens.\n\nThe exact meaning of this law has been and continues to be debated. In particular, why say \"have the quality of citizen\" instead of \"are citizens\", and how would these rights be exercised?\n\nThe Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law: Replaced by the Constitution of 1958\n==========================================================\n\nThe Constitution of 1946 created a new [French Union](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_fran%C3%A7aise) to replace the French Empire that had existed before the war. The Constitution incorporated the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law word\\-for\\-word into Article 80\\. \n\nHowever, in [Article 81](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_du_27_octobre_1946#Article_81) a French *Union* citizenship was created, one that was distinct from the citizenship that existed before the war. However, it is not clear if this citizenship is distinct from the one in the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law/Article 80 \\[2, pg. 56\\-58].\n\nThis ambiguity, among other issues, led to the demise of the French Union, to be replaced by the [French Community](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communaut%C3%A9_fran%C3%A7aise_(Cinqui%C3%A8me_R%C3%A9publique)) defined in the new [Constitution of 1958](https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_de_la_France_de_1958_(version_initiale))\u2014the current constitution of France. As originally passed, Article 77 stated: \n\n> \\[...] Il n\u2019existe qu\u2019une citoyennet\u00e9 de la Communaut\u00e9. Tous les citoyens sont \u00e9gaux en droit, quelles que soient leur origine, leur race et leur religion. Ils ont les m\u00eames devoirs.\n\nMy translation:\n\n> \\[...] There exists but one citizenship of the Community. All citizens are equal in the law, regardless of their origin, their race, and their religion. They have the same duties.\n\nThis Constitution replaced the earlier one, however, since the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law was passed *ahead* of the Constitution of 1946, it is not automatic that it has been replaced as well. I've come up with three arguments as to why I believe it has in fact been replaced:\n\n* Article 80 of the Constitution of 1946 copied the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law word\\-for\\-word and thus incorporated it. As such, the law was replaced when the Constitution was.\n* The Constitution of 1958 redefines citizenship and thus supersedes the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law\n* ***If*** the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law and Article 81 of the Constitution of 1946 refer to the same Union citizenship, then the new Community citizenship defined by the Constitution of 1958 replaced that citizenship and thus also the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law.\n\nNote that the French Community itself was not successful and has since been amended out of the constitution.\n\nA note on the former colonies\n=============================\n\nIf I'm correct that the law was replaced by the Constitution of 1958, then most colonies would not have had to take any action to annul it as they gained independence after 1958\\. The only exception I'm aware of is Guinea, which voted against joining the French Community \\[1, pg. 22].\n\nReferences\n==========\n\nOutside of Wikip\u00e9dia fran\u00e7ais, I found the following two sources to be the most informative on the topic and cite them in this answer:\n\n1.

However, its current status is complex. The law was incorporated into the French Constitution of 1946, but this constitution was replaced by the Constitution of 1958. The 1958 Constitution redefined citizenship in the context of the French Community, likely superseding the Lamine Gu\u00e8ye law. While the law wasn't explicitly annulled, it was effectively replaced by new constitutional provisions. Most colonies gained independence after 1958, so they wouldn't have needed to annul the law specifically. The law is not considered active today in its original form, as French citizenship laws have evolved significantly since then.

At that time, the term \"woman\" was generally understood to mean a biological female capable of becoming pregnant. Changes in societal definitions and understanding of gender identity since then do not automatically alter the legal interpretation of the statute. Courts would likely interpret the law based on the legislators' intent at the time of enactment, rather than applying current evolving definitions.

Absent these, the ruling may be based on criteria of customary practice, such as the length of one billing period.\n\nThat being said, you can expect the company to dispute your claim by arguing that your reliance towards entering the contract was unreasonable.

But I used to work in a retail location of a large national bank. Our clients were mostly members of a small suburban neighborhood. At least once per week, and sometimes two or three times per week, like clockwork, we would always see a different person coming into the bank asking to withdraw all their funds to send out of the country. \n\nAfter asking a couple questions it was always clear that this was another variation of the 419 Confidence Scam. The marks were usually older people (who are more gullible and trusting of strangers than the average population. Something to do with simpler times in the past, I guess.) Often times the marks were so convinced by the con that we could not explain to them what was happening in a way they would believe us and got conned anyway. Losing all their money.\n\nIt's all very sad, but a cautionary tale and an example of how convincing these cons can be. Also, to illustrate how common it all is, imagine that this probably happened in every retail location serving every neighborhood in the U.S. Very sad. And very common."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A freelance web designer receives an email from a potential client offering a high-paying job. The client asks the designer to accept a large sum of money and then transfer a portion to a third party. What type of scam is this most likely to be?\n\nA) Money laundering scheme\nB) Phishing attack\nC) Nigerian Prince/419 Confidence Scam\nD) Identity theft attempt\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario is a classic example of the Nigerian Prince or 419 Confidence Scam. The key elements that identify it as such are:\n\n1. The initial email with poor grammar and immediate mention of payment.\n2. The offer of a suspiciously high payment for the job.\n3. The request to transfer a portion of the money to a third party.\n4. The use of banking asymmetry, where funds appear to clear quickly but are later found to be fraudulent.\n\nWhile options A, B, and D are all types of scams or fraudulent activities, they don't match the specific pattern described in this scenario.

They will check the TV and any other devices (such as a laptop, phone, etc.) that are capable of watching or recording live television as well as downloading or watching programmes on BBC iPlayer, and that will form part of the evidence in deciding whether to charge you with a criminal offence ([Section 363 of the Act](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/21/section/363)) or not.\n\nIf charged with an offence, you would go before a magistrate court and plead your case like any other criminal matter. Therefore, the system still operates on \"innocent until proven guilty\" because you will not acquire a criminal record unless the court is satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that you committed the relevant offence."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, regarding TV licensing and home inspections, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) TV Licensing officers have the legal right to enter your home without a warrant to check if you need a license.\n\nB) If you refuse entry to TV Licensing officers, you are automatically considered guilty of watching TV without a license.\n\nC) The TV licensing system operates on a \"guilty until proven innocent\" basis, contrary to standard legal principles.\n\nD) You are not obligated to let TV Licensing officers into your home unless they have a warrant, as per the Communications Act 2003.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to Section 366 of the Communications Act 2003, TV Licensing officers do not have the right to enter your home without a warrant. You are not required to let them in unless they have obtained a warrant. \n\nOption A is incorrect because TV Licensing officers cannot legally enter your home without your permission or a warrant.\n\nOption B is false because refusing entry does not automatically imply guilt. The case would still need to be proven in court if charges were brought.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the TV licensing system does operate on an \"innocent until proven guilty\" basis. If charged, you would have to be proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt in a magistrate court.\n\nOption D correctly states the legal position as outlined in the Communications Act 2003, respecting the principle of \"innocent until proven guilty\" and the need for a warrant to enter a private property without the occupant's consent."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87724/what-kind-of-compensatory-damages-are-available-in-a-class-action-lawsuit-landl", "docs_id": 87724, "title": "What kind of compensatory damages are available in a class action lawsuit (landlord/tenant)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The scenario: A landlord holding multiple rental properties/apartments has been found in a class action lawsuit to have been illegally overcharging renters for X amount of money per month each over a period of Y months time (Y differing based on how long a tenant was there, obviously).\n\nWhat kind of monetary compensations are the range of possible awards?

In cases of negligent overcharging without intentional fraud, courts typically award economic damages (the overcharged amount) plus prejudgment interest to compensate for the time the plaintiffs didn't have access to their money. Court costs are also usually awarded, but attorney fees are generally not included unless specified by the lease or state law. Punitive damages are unlikely in cases of negligence without fraud.
