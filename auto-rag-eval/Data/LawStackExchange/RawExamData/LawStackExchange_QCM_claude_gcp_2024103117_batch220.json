Copyright is always protected by the laws of a particular nation, by the courts of that nation. Because of the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright Convention, I can sue you outside of my country, and will be treated as a person of that country. The conventions don't say who has jurisdiction, that is where you have to sue, so you have to resort to conventional jurisdictional principles. If you are in Europe, under the Brussels Convention, that means I have to sue you in your country of domicile (if you reside in multiple European nations, I get to decide which country to sue you in). The English courts are slightly different in that they generally hold that you sue in the country where the act took place, but (Lucasfilm v Ainsworth) you can sue in UK courts for infringement that occurs in the US. As you can see, this can get complicated. I can't sue you in Mongolian courts (assuming neither of us has any connection at all to Mongolia), but I could sue you (being a hypothetical UK citizen) in UK courts if you did the infringing deed while in Mongolia.\n\nMongolian courts enforce Mongolian copyright law, US courts enforce US copyright law. Therefore you first have to decide what country you plan to sue in (from the plaintiff's perspective).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An author's work enters the public domain in Country A on January 1, 2024.

A significant event, as defined in that section, is where there is probably a technical screw\\-up in the office of chief medical examiner; the designated root cause analysis officer then develops guidelines for determining whether a significant event has occurred, then reporting, and other procedures.

He did not, I had to ask near the end of our conversation.) I told him that there were a number of cars parked the same way on the same street, in the direction he was heading once he left.

Whether communications are made to the lawyer himself or to employees, and whether they deal with matters of an administrative nature such as financial means or with the actual nature of the legal problem, all information which a person must provide in order to obtain legal advice and which is given in confidence for that purpose enjoys the privileges attached to confidentiality. **This confidentiality attaches to all communications made within the framework of the solicitor\\-client relationship, which arises as soon as the potential client takes the first steps, and consequently even before the formal retainer is established.**\n\nWhile the judgment somewhat conflates the terminology of confidentiality and privilege, these are distinct concepts.

I tried to extract answers by posing some scenarios but that proved to be inefficient. So I am trying a new way here to get the answer of the questions in my head.\n\nI might have irritated some of you by now but trust me this question is really a proper question, so read it extremely carefully.\n\n**Two** types of EU family reunification are there\\-\\-\\-for direct family, and for extended family. It seems that extended family members have little legal weight for succeeding in an appeal in case their application is rejected (for whatever reason). BUT, I have found that whenever genuine applications for extended family members (as defined by EU law) have been refused, they eventually succeed in their appeal and the Court finally overturns the refusal and grants residence card.\n\nExamples: [UK case](https://sterling-law.co.uk/en/right-of-residence-granted-to-an-extended-family-member-of-eea-national-after-refusal-based-on-insufficient-evidence/)\nand [Ireland case](https://berkeleysolicitors.ie/minister-ruled-to-have-been-incorrectly-applying-eu-law-relating-to-membership-of-the-same-household/)\n\nIn both cases the Court eventually found **that the Minister wrongly refused residence application by stating that the evidence or documentation is insufficient** while it was actually more than sufficient. This means that either such Minsters are deliberately doing that or they are incompetent, but it is likely that the former will be the case most of the times.\n\nBut anyway there is at least a right to appeal, even though extended family members have weaker rights in the courtroom than direct family members. At least they can **reach** the courtroom and in my opinion, that is all what is required, as the Court will definitely overturn a decision by the Minister ***which was wrongful*** (note that wrongful means that genuine cases and proper documentation was refused for some or the other reason(s)).\n\nHow do the rights of direct and extended family members differ when genuine cases with proper documentation always win in the end (be it directly, or after an appeal)? Extended family has weaker rights, but how? All genuine cases eventually win like the examples I provided above (Minister wrongfully stated that evidence was insufficient and the Court very well overturned that). In what way then, extended family members have weaker rights than Direct family members?\n\nI know you would say that extended family do not have residence **as a right**, like direct family has, but that's not my point. My point is that although extended family members do not have it as their right, genuine cases always make their way into the EU. If the minister takes advantage of the fact that extended family does not have any legislative backing/support, and that their applications can be refused on whatever grounds they like, the minister wouldn't succeed in his mission as the Court would eventually overturn the wrong practice of not accepting genuine cases and proper evidence. So how does having a right differ from not having a right (direct vs extended) *when the final outcome is going to be the same for genuine cases with proper documentation/evidence?* **I am asking *how does it differ?***\n\n***PS***: It is also not the case that Courts couldn't help extended family members because they don't have any European legislation for them. My examples clearly demonstrate that Courts **do** overturn decisions of ministers **even though extended family has nothing** **as a right** in EU law *simply because the Court will undo the illogical and unlawful*. Moreover, in the Irish case above, it is interesting to further note:\n\n*\"The court does not consider that a approach by a decision\\-maker which amounts, in effect, to \u2018Put in an application, I will not tell you even at the most general level, not even by way of non\\-binding guidance, what type of material I am looking for, but I will let you know if I do not see it\u2019 is reasonable or entails fairness of procedure. It is unreasonable and unfair that the Minister should know what, at a general level, he is looking for when it comes to assessing applications generally, but will give no sense to applicants as to what it is that he is looking for, i.e. the unreasonableness/unfairness flows not from the Directive or the Regulations per se but from the closeted manner in which the Minister has elected to discharge his obligations to the detriment of applicants who, as a consequence of his approach, are unfailingly operating to some extent \u2018in the blind\u2019 when making an application such as that at issue here.\"*\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The rights are different\n------------------------\n\nDirect family has an automatic right of residence \\- all they need to do is prove that they are direct family.\n\nExtended family has the additional obligation of proving hardship. In addition to proving their familial relationship they must also prove that they will suffer actual hardship if they remain where they are. Basically, that means that there are legitimate reasons that they are unable to earn a living commensurate with the standard in their home country not the \\[usually] better standard in the EU. For example, that they are unable to work because of age, disability or persecution.\n\nThe evidence for this hardship is subject to assessment by the decision maker to determine if the legal requirement has been met. In marginal cases, provided the decision maker has considered all the evidence and has arrived at a decision that a reasonable person could arrive at and has adequately explained their reasoning process *they are legally allowed to be wrong*.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the key difference between direct family members and extended family members in EU free movement rights?\n\nA) Direct family members must prove hardship, while extended family members have an automatic right of residence.\n\nB) Extended family members have stronger legal rights in court appeals compared to direct family members.\n\nC) Direct family members have an automatic right of residence, while extended family members must prove hardship in addition to their familial relationship.\n\nD) There is no significant difference in rights between direct and extended family members if their applications are genuine.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key difference is that direct family members have an automatic right of residence once they prove their familial relationship, while extended family members face an additional burden. Extended family members must not only prove their relationship but also demonstrate that they would face hardship if not allowed to reside in the EU. This additional requirement makes their application process more complex and subject to more scrutiny by decision-makers.

In general, it is fine to use trademarks to refer to the products trademarked, provided that a reasonable person would not be confused about who creates or provides the product, and would not think that the trademark holder has endorsed, authorized, or sponsored the book or other product that refers to the trademark.\n\nIt is common to include a disclaimer stating that trademarks are owned by specific parities, and the author or publisher is not claiming them, nor claiming any endorsement or affiliation.

Including a disclaimer that clarifies the ownership of trademarks and explicitly states no affiliation or endorsement further strengthens this approach. This method balances the need to discuss real-world technologies with respect for trademark rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because obtaining permission for each trademark mention is unnecessary and impractical for nominative use.

There is no general law of group responsibility in the US.\n\nUnder US law, when a group of people agree to do something jointly that is illegal, or using illegal means, they can all be charged with [conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_(criminal)), and the acts of one used in the trial of another. But it must be proven that an accused knowingly jointed in the conspiracy to convict that accused person. See [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 371](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/371)\n\nWhen [one person assists another to commit a crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accomplice), in any of various ways, a charge of \"accessory\" or of \"aiding and abetting\" or of \"being an accomplice\" can be brought. But this will again involve proof that the accused knew that the conduct involved was criminal.\n\nWhere a person commits or tries to commit a felony, alone or as part of a group, and a death results, the person can be charged with [felony murder](https://www.justia.com/criminal/offenses/homicide/felony-murder/). A classic example is where an armed bank robbery occurs and one of the robbers is shot and killed by a guard. Each of the robbers may be charged with felony murder, even if none if them knew or intended that anyone be harmed or killed. But the felony must be one of a limited list provided by statute. The federal statute is [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1111](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1111) which limits the crimes that can trigger the rule to \"arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, child abuse, burglary, or robbery\".

While not all participants could be automatically charged with felony murder, some could potentially face such charges depending on their specific actions and intent. \n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no general law of group responsibility in the US, and merely being part of the crowd would not be sufficient grounds for a felony murder charge.\n\nOption B is overly broad and incorrect. Entering the Capitol building alone would not automatically make someone an accomplice to murder. Prosecutors would need to prove knowledge and intent to assist in the crime.\n\nOption C is too narrow. While those directly causing harm could certainly be charged, US law also allows for charges against accomplices and conspirators under certain circumstances.\n\nThe correct answer (D) reflects the complexity of the situation. Charges would depend on individual actions, the specific felonies committed, and the intent of the participants. Some might face felony murder charges if they were engaged in qualifying felonies (such as burglary or robbery) that resulted in death, while others might face lesser charges or no charges at all, depending on their level of involvement and the evidence against them."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29619/legalities-of-using-trademarked-fictional-names-for-products", "docs_id": 29619, "title": "Legalities of using Trademarked Fictional Names for products", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is the legality of naming a product or service after a fictional name, object or character from a book or other creative material (movie, video game, etc)?\n\nIn each of these examples below, the question is:\nIf the owners of the trademark were to pursue charges for trademark infringement, would their allegations stand in court?\n\n1.

While using a name inspired by a fictional element from Star Trek could potentially attract attention from the trademark holders, the legal situation is not black and white. Trademarks are generally protected within the specific area of commerce in which they are used. A fitness app named \"Borg Fit\" is quite different from the context of the Borg in Star Trek.\n\nIf challenged, the startup could argue that their use of \"Borg\" in a fitness context is unlikely to cause confusion with Star Trek products or dilute the Star Trek brand. However, they might face legal challenges, and the outcome would depend on various factors, including how they use the name and whether it could be seen as capitalizing on Star Trek's reputation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because fictional names can be protected by trademark law.

This chess set is usually used by small kids, 2\\-5 year old, who move the large chess pieces, make around themselves, pretend to ride the horses, etc. \n\nOne day a much bigger kid, 10 year old or so, apparently elated by the lack of supervision, ran into that chess playground, and started throwing the 5 lbs chess pieces with force across the chess set in random directions, sometimes missing the toddlers by inches. The thrown pieces would sometime bump the other pieces around the toddlers, sometime miss a toddler's head or leg by inches, etc. This lasted for at least 5 min.\n\nAnd in those 5 min of quite dangerous bombardment not a single adult would attempt to restrain the minor. Some parents would take their toddlers out of the chess board games despite their protests; some would get closer to their kids within the chess board while watching the 10\\-yo, apparently with intent to intercept a chess piece if it would fly at their kid; some adults would just watch what's happening from the benches. And nobody would interfere with the apparently dangerous youth, not physically, and not even verbally.\n\nI gathered from the conversations nearby that the adults were just afraid to restrain the youth for the fear of being accused later that they were doing something illegal against the minor. The parents were more afraid to be branded abusers of that child than of the physical harm said child would do to their own kids.\n\nThus the question: how realistic where their fears in the state of California? If an adult physically restrains a child and claims that the child was a danger to others can the adult have legal problems?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If an adult had physically restrained the miscreant brat, they could be sued for / charged with battery (which does not mean \"beating up\", per [Cal Penal 242](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=240-248), it is the \"willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another\". In either case, there is a defense that can be mounted, the \"defense of others\" defense, to the effect that the person had a reasonable belief that it was necessary to prevent physical harm to others. Which means, the jury would imagine themselves in that situation and guess how likely it is that someone might get hurt. Lofting 5 lb chess pieces at a 2 year old *could* poke out an eye, especially since they haven't learned to duck at that age \u2013 however, I question (as would an opposing attorney) the characterization \"quite dangerous\". At any rate, it would depend on the level of danger posed. There is also a \"proportionality\" requirement for the defense of others defense: \"The defendant used no more force than was reasonably necessary to defend against that danger\" (CalCrim instruction 3470\\). The battery might not have been necessary, since simply getting between the criminal and his victims could have been sufficient. \n\nAs to whether there would actually be a lawsuit, that depends in part on the mind\\-set of the parents. Assuming that the level of force did not rise above simple bodily contact, it is unlikely that a jury would vote to convict / find liable, but certainly not impossible. If under those circumstances the results would not be in serious doubt, then it is unlikely that the person would be prosecuted (the prosecutor wouldn't bother with such a case). We may also assume that a decent attorney would persuade the offended parent\\-client that it is not a good use of their money to pursue he matter. Still, the risk is not negligible, since you don't know whether you'll have bad luck with the jury, or whether the child suffers from eggshell skull syndrome and *then* you would be is serious trouble.

In California, an adult who physically restrains a child in this situation could potentially be charged with battery, which is defined as the \"willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.\" However, the adult may have a viable \"defense of others\" defense. This defense requires that the person had a reasonable belief that it was necessary to prevent physical harm to others and that they used no more force than was reasonably necessary.

Are there grounds for some sort of a class action case here, for negligence and/or fitness?** Can we sue these manufacturers for failing to provide options for shutting the charger off at 50%, and for needlessly trickle\\-charging the batteries ad nauseam, resulting in premature failures, including loss of capacity and bulging? \n\nWouldn't this be an example of **negligence** to know about these things ([and it is widely known that batteries are best stored at 50% charge, even ***apple.com***/batteries/maximizing\\-performance/ has a memo](http://archive.is/zuddn#selection-404.0-415.390)), yet not doing anything in their products to accommodate stationary laptop and phone (w/ hotspot) usage?\n\nSome laptops are even explicitly advertised as desktop replacements \u2013 wouldn't it be a **fitness** issue if the manufacturer fails to provide a 50% charge option for extended desktop use? (Wouldn't it also be *fraud* if they subsequently sell replacement batteries at a nice profit, after ensuring their circuitry will effectively ruin Li\\-Ion and Li\\-Polymer batteries through such trickle charging as above?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Negligence**\n\nLiability for negligence relies on the existence of a duty to do something (or to not do something). The plaintiff must suffer some injury as a result of a breach of that duty. Damages will be awarded to remedy that injury.\n\nDoes Apple have a duty to provide software and hardware functionality to maximise the life of the batteries included with their products?\n\nProducts come in a variety of qualities and standards. Courts will impose some standards (e.g. ginger beer should not have dead snails in it: *Donoghue v Stevenson* \\[1932] UKHL 100\\), but there is no duty to ensure that ever product implements the state of the art. \n\nOne of the factors taken into account by a court in determining the existence of a duty to prevent injury is the cost of taking steps to prevent that injury. Adding additional features to a product would increase its cost. Given that the product is sold for a particular price which takes into account its features, is it reasonable to impose a duty on the manufacturer to include additional features, not bargained for, in the product?\n\nA court is unlikely to find that Apple is under a duty to include all possible battery\\-preserving features in its phone, thereby prohibiting the sale of phones at a particular price point.\n\nDetermining a negligence case requires the court to create social policy by drawing lines between, say, failing to put a fence at the edge of a cliff and digging the ground out from under someone near a cliffface. Is a failure to implement battery\\-maximising features the same as crippling a battery? Given that the starting point, historically, is a battery that is naively used, and 50% charge (etc) is an innovation that was added later, a court is unlikely to hold that Apple is somehow 'crippling' their batteries by not including batter\\-maximising features.\n\n**Consumer guarantees (fitness for purpose)**\n\nSome jurisdictions have consumer protection laws which include what the Australian legislation calls 'consumer guarantees', which are rules that a person supplying goods or services to a consumer must comply with. One such guarantee is fitness for purpose.\n\nWhat is the purpose of a laptop? Is a laptop totally useless if its battery will stop working at some point?\n\nAt one end, a laptop with a battery that never works does not serve the purpose of a laptop. At the other extreme, a laptop with a battery that dies after 100 years would nonetheless serve most people's purposes.\n\nHow long must the battery last? How long is a piece of string?\n\nConsumer guarantee legislation will sometimes specify factors for determining how long the piece of string is. These factors include price and any statements made by the consumer to the supplier about what they intend to use the product for.\n\nApple laptops are expensive but that is because they have a divinely\\-inspired aesthetic. After accounting for the divinely\\-inspired aesthetic, it is not surprising that there is no money left for battery\\-maximising features.\n\nA court is unlikely to conclude that the purpose of an Apple laptop requires the battery to last for the same period as a Thinkpad.\n\nTo put it another way, the rule about fitness for purpose is about fitness for purpose. There is no rule that any product must be state of the art.\n\n**Fraud**\n\nIf Apple said 'This battery will last for 300 cycles' and they knew that the battery would not, then that might be fraud. If, however, Apple said 'this battery might last for 300 cycles' or 'in lab tests, similar batteries lasted for an average of 300 cycles' or didn't say anything at all, then there is no fraud.\n\nKnowing that something will cost someone money is not fraud.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer purchases a high-end smartphone that does not include battery optimization features, such as limiting charging to 80% capacity.

Which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal position regarding potential claims against the manufacturer?\n\nA) The consumer has a strong case for negligence, as the manufacturer failed to implement known battery-preserving technologies.\n\nB) The consumer can successfully claim breach of fitness for purpose, as the phone's battery did not last as long as reasonably expected for a high-end device.\n\nC) The manufacturer could be held liable for fraud if they advertised the battery life without disclosing the lack of optimization features.\n\nD) The consumer is unlikely to succeed in a legal claim, as courts generally do not require manufacturers to implement all possible features or state-of-the-art technologies in their products.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Based on the information provided, courts are unlikely to hold manufacturers liable for not implementing all possible battery-preserving features. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. Courts don't typically impose a duty on manufacturers to ensure every product implements state-of-the-art features.\n2. The cost of implementing additional features is a factor considered in determining a manufacturer's duty.\n3. There's no clear standard for how long a battery must last to be considered fit for purpose.\n4. Fitness for purpose is about basic functionality, not having the best possible performance or longevity.\n5.

If that happens, and Supreme Court doesn't get involved in the issue \\- for example by refusing to hear either of the two cases \\- what happens then with the issue as far as subsequent cases arising in legal system?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: How often do circuit splits arise?\n==================================\n\nThe number of currently outstanding circuit conflicts on legal questions is probably in the range of many dozen on the low end and several hundred to several thousand on the high end. New circuit splits arise somewhere on some issue many times each year.\n\nIt is difficult to quantify this because there are lots of subtle differences of wording or application of the law between circuits that ordinarily are not considered circuit conflicts but could lead to a different result under some highly unusual set of facts. Establishing the existence of a circuit conflict, and becoming familiar with the conflicts that are most promising to see resolved, is one of the particular skills of lawyers who practice before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nIt is also worth noting that state courts can also enunciate questions of federal law that are presented to them without regard to the rule adopted by the federal circuit in which they are located (federal courts in U.S. territories and possessions are bound by the precedents of their federal circuit on questions of federal law). So, there are 50 states and each of the 13 federal circuits (1\\-11, DC and Federal) which are directly subordinate to the U.S. Supreme Court and could take a position on a question of federal law that could conflict with another jurisdiction leading to a split of authority that can only be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nWhat happens when a circuit split is not resolved?\n==================================================\n\nWhen a circuit split is not resolved courts in each circuit follow the precedents set by their particular circuit. Meanwhile, trial courts and appellate courts in circuits that have not taken a position in the circuit split give particularly careful and reasoned consideration to which side the court should take in an undecided circuit as a matter of first impression.\n\nUnresolved circuit splits are not uncommon and can last for decades on issues that the U.S. Supreme Court deems unimportant.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A federal circuit court issues a ruling on a matter of federal law that directly contradicts a ruling from another circuit court on the same issue.

This creates what's known as a \"circuit split.\" Courts in circuits that haven't yet ruled on the issue will carefully consider both sides of the split when the issue comes before them. This situation can persist for years or even decades on issues the Supreme Court deems less important. Option A is incorrect because circuit courts are not bound by other circuits' decisions. Option B is false because the Supreme Court is not obligated to automatically review circuit splits. Option D is incorrect because conflicting rulings remain valid within their respective circuits and courts do not need to wait for congressional action."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41896/meaning-of-a-memorandum-of-understanding", "docs_id": 41896, "title": "Meaning of a Memorandum of Understanding", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently watched a video of a controversial head\\-of\\-state expressing his views on MOU's in the context of international trade.

A witness actually saw one of the twins stab someone, to death but he can't tell which one. The knife has been found, and has the twins' DNA on it.

Indeed, there is a [current case](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-identical-twins-murder-confession-met-20160922-story.html) where a man alleged that he was the murder, though his identical twin brother was convicted. [This article](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2012/07/05/gr.136598.111) indicates that identical twins are not necessarily genetically indistinguishable. Assuming there is a lack of positive evidence such as fingerprints or an alibi which clearly identifies one versus the other, then one would predict no conviction because there would be a highly reasonable doubt.

It is not a criminal statute of limitations. I will answer with regard to civil cases, rather than criminal ones.\n\n[Section 40 of the Limitations Act of 1980](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/section/40) incorporates by reference a [schedule of transition provisions](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1980/58/schedule/2) that govern this question, and when a cause of action is not governed by the 1980 Act it usually defaults to the predecessor 1939 Act.\n\nThe problem is both bigger than just the fraudulent breach of trust unlimited statute of limitations under Section 21 of the Act, since the deadline only runs from when an action accrues that can be long after the act giving rise to the claim actually happened, and smaller, because the act (and [also its predecessor 1939 act](https://www.aplf.org/time_limitations_in_pursuit_of_damages_ukeurope/index.html)) allow statutes of limitations to be extended for equitable reasons under certain circumstances. \n\nThe [1881 Limitations Act, Section 27](http://moj.gov.jm/sites/default/files/laws/Limitation%20of%20Actions%20Act.pdf) had an exception to the general rule for concealed fraud tolling the statute so long as it was concealed, which probably carried over into the 1939 Act.\n\nSection 9 of the transition provisions states in the relevant part that:\n\n> (1\\)Nothing in any provision of this Act shall\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a)enable any action to be brought which was barred by this Act or (as\n>  the case may be) by the Limitation Act 1939 before the relevant date;\n\nThe [1939 Act limitations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitation_Act_1939) ran from when the act was committed, not when it was discovered, until the [1963 Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitation_Act_1963) changes that.\n\nA full analysis of the breach of trust issue is found [in this law review article](https://academic.oup.com/tandt/article-abstract/23/5/527/3868255/Statutory-limitation-periods-for-claims-related-to?redirectedFrom=fulltext).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A fraudulent breach of trust was committed in 1975.

The transition provisions in the 1980 Act refer back to previous acts. The 1939 Act's limitations ran from when the act was committed, which would normally bar this action. However, the 1881 Limitations Act had an exception for concealed fraud, which likely carried over to subsequent acts.

It's entirely possible for a work of fiction to be written by \"Jay Wood\" the author and stares a seperate person named \"Jay Wood\" as the lead actor, who just happens to land the lead role. Even fictional names are not protected as Anakin and Kal\\-el (or Kalel) are both names of people in the United States that were specifically introduced by fiction (On the Superman note, the name of Supergirl \"Kara\" was a Hebrew name but wasn't popularly used until after Supergirl's first issue appeared on comic stands).\n\nOne possible source of confusion is that in the U.S., Movie and TV actors will frequently take stage names because the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) has a specific rule that no members can have the same name, and one's name in film credits will be your SAG name as it appears on your membership card (or whatever they use). So if \"Jay Wood\" is a SAG actor, then you cannot be a second \"Jay Wood\" in SGA. Though the rules are specifically say \"No more than two Jay Woods\" so you can be \"Jay A. Wood\" or \"J. Wood\" or \"Jay Wood Jr\" without any issue. One of the more fun examples is that the guy who played Marty McFly in back to the future, Michael J. Fox, took his name to distinguish himself from another SAG member named Michael Fox. What does the \"J.\" stand for? Andrew! Michael J. Fox realized that he could use his legal name if he included an initial, but since his real middle name is Andrew, this would mean he'd be billed in all films and tv shows as \"Michael A. Fox\" and realized that it would get some snickers thrown his way. J rhymes with A and was available in the format, so that's why we have Michael J. Fox. It's also why most actresses will never \"take\" their husbands name as far as the public is aware. If they were SAG before marriage, they will still appear with SGA credits on their post\\-nuptial films, and would have to do promotions under that name. They may change their name and legally answer with their husband's sir name for all legal purposes. She might be Sarah Michelle Geller on all Buffy The Vampire Credits, but it's possible the actress by that name is legally Sarah Michelle Prince (married Freddie Prince Jr.) and would use that name at the bank or on her tax forms.

Using the name as a pen name for authorship is generally acceptable, but the author should be careful not to imply any association with the celebrity or trademarked entity.

The \"novel rule\" referred by Posner is:\n\n> If, then, the Courts are to regard the Constitution, and the Constitution is superior to any ordinary act of the Legislature, the Constitution, and not such ordinary act, must govern the case to which they both apply.\n\nBut how's Marshall's announcing this rule a \"**trick**\"? Marshall can't be blamed for the Judiciary Act of 1789's unconstitutionality ? If it were constitutional, then Marshall's rule WOULD apply. Thus this trick doesn't depend on Marshall. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here's how a court decision would normally go:\n\n> 1. Do we have jurisdiction?\n> \n> \n> \t* If no, terminate the case.\n> \t* If yes, proceed to step 2\\.\n> 2. Decide the case.\n\nHere's how the Marbury v. Madison decision went:\n\n> 1.

Do we have jurisdiction?\n> \n> \n> \t* If no, we cannot implement the particular remedies, but the rulings on the constitution and law from step 1 are still binding.\n> \t* If yes, we implement the remedies, and everything's binding.\n\nIn other words, what the decision basically did was implicitly start with \"Suppose we had jurisdiction...\" and then drew a bunch of conclusions. They could review acts of Congress and declare laws unconstitutional (which was not an accepted power of the Supreme Court at the time; Jefferson thought this power should be the President's), even laws that had already been repealed. They could review (some) acts of the Executive branch, and force it to do (some) acts; in particular, they said they could serve a writ of mandamus to certain officers of the Executive branch. This was, again, not something that was accepted as a power of the Supreme Court before this decision.\n\nBut then they said \"But the assumption that we have jurisdiction is faulty, because we just declared the law that gave us the requisite original jurisdiction\u2014the case was filed directly to the Supreme Court and did not go through a lower court\u2014to be unconstitutional.\" Thus the court would not actually force anyone's hand: Madison would not, in fact, be ordered to deliver Marbury's commission. This is important because Jefferson had a very adversarial attitude towards the Court, and was extremely likely to completely ignore any attempts by the Court to force the Executive branch to do anything. Doing so risked neutering the powers of the Judicial branch, and maybe worse.

Madison. Marshall first established the principle of judicial review, asserting the Supreme Court's power to declare laws unconstitutional. However, he then concluded that the Court lacked jurisdiction in this specific case due to the unconstitutionality of the relevant section of the Judiciary Act of 1789. \n\nThis approach allowed Marshall to establish a significant new power for the judiciary without directly challenging the executive branch or Congress in this particular case. By announcing the principle but not applying it to force action in Marbury's favor, Marshall avoided a potential conflict with President Jefferson while still setting a crucial precedent for judicial authority.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect as they mischaracterize Marshall's actions or motivations.

A court might order X to do something if Y petitions, but X is notified of the proceeding to which they are a party, and X will (should) object to the petition on the grounds that the petitioned relief is impossible or imposes an extreme burden on them.

However, courts do not order people to squeeze blood from a stone.\n\nA government agency may make such a demand, with minimal opportunity for you to object. Your recourse is very similar to the case where a party petitions the court to order you to do something. A law may exist whereby an agency is authorized to \"order\" a person to act in a certain way: there may be a requirement for a hearing, or you may have to sue the agency to overrule their demand. It is possible that you can appeal agency\\-internally that it is impossible, or too burdensome, to comply, or you may have to make that argument in court. It is usually best to persuade the agency that they are asking the impossible, since the courts tend to defer to government agencies that issue orders, unless your case is particularly egregious.\n\n\"It would be inconvenient for us\" is generally not a viable defense.

But that fear is mostly misguided.\n\nA trademark is not a right to have monopoly use of the mark in writing or other media. \"[Nominative use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominative_use)\" of a mark is legal and does not expose the person making nominative use of a mark to liability.\n\nWhat is prohibited is using the protected mark to market goods or services in commerce, in a market where the trademark one fears being infringed currently exists and is being used to market goods or services of that trademark owner, to give the false impression of an association, affiliation, or endorsement by the trademark owner.\n\nThe gravamen of a trademark infringement lawsuit is fraud and deception perpetrated on consumers to the detriment of the trademark owner. This is almost never a real risk in a fictional work.\n\nTo the extent that there is a legal concern at all about distinguishing a fictional firm from a real one, the bigger legal exposure is to defamation liability.\n\nIn other words, the bigger concern is the risk that the fictional work is viewed as making a thinly veiled false factual statement about the real world firm that damages its reputation (e.g. if it were to depict a fictional analogy of the real world firm \"Taco Bell\" making tacos out of horse meat as the real world firm has often, falsely, been accused of doing in real life because its prices are so low).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A popular video game features a fictional company called \"Bluerock Investments\" that engages in unethical financial practices.

True, in such a case the tenant would be put to the trouble and expense of finding another place at short notice, but then the landlord would have lost his income from the property. The provision allocates the losses between the parties in such a case.\n\nIf the property is not available at the specified time for the lease to start, but could be available a few days later, the quoted provision would not allow the landlord to just ignore the situation and end the lease.

The initial delay might be excusable, but the continued delay without apparent effort to resolve the issue goes beyond what would be considered reasonable. The landlord's attempt to terminate the lease after initially offering pro-rated rent suggests they may not be acting in good faith. Option A is incorrect because the 30-day period doesn't give the landlord carte blanche to terminate without reason. Option B is incorrect because the lease doesn't require indefinite pro-rating.

That seems highly unlikely to me; surely if an on\\-duty, not undercover cop saw for example a stash of illegal weapons in the open trunk of a car, with the criminal sleeping inside it, they would be obligated to act?\n\nMy suspicion is this: there isn't really a point where they're no longer allowed to use discretion. More likely, I think they always possess discretion and duty at the same time; they have a duty to stop crime to the best of their power, and they have the discretion to decide whether they're capable of stopping the crime at that point with more benefit than loss. No matter the situation, they technically possess the right to deem the situation too *something* to not intervene; their duty lies in making that judgement earnestly.\n\nWhich is where the practical line between discretion and duty comes in: as said, I think they probably exist at the same time, but certain situations are of a nature that it becomes clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer did not exercise their discretion earnestly. In these cases, they would face reprecussions not because they used a discretion that they didn't have, but rather because they **clearly** violated their duty to use that discretion earnestly. In the kinds of situations where e.g. a criminal is aiming a gun at someone, a cop may decide to not intervene due to their tactical/psychological/whatever judgement of the situation/criminal telling them that intervention would be more likely to cause more harm, and thus I expect a lot of violent situations to fall on the discretion side of this line. So, then the questions arise:\n\n1. Does such a line exist, and if so, what does (if anything) the law say about it?\n2. How is this line evaluated in practice?\n\n---\n\nI'm interested in the US jurisdiction. Someone mentioned that this depends extremely on the particulars of the situation. I'm more looking for an overview of the categories of situations that are usually treated as an \"officer's discretion rules\" versus the categories of situations where this isn't the case.\n\nTo aid in this, I'd like answers containing constructed scenarios (like my example of the criminal sleeping in his gun\\-loaded car) where discretion practically doesn't rule (*practically doesn't rule* in the sense I described above), and constructed scenarios where discretion definitely rules, and lastly, the constructed scenarios where it very much falls in a gray area that needs to be scrutinized due to a high contingency on the particular detials.\n\nOf course, the constructed scenarios could be replaced with real\\-life cases.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is an important distinction between moral duty and legal obligation. Even if an officer should arrest a person, given some moral standard, they are not legally obligated to do so. A test for legal obligation is whether an choice results in a negative legal outcome \u2013 is the officer sued or criminally penalized for acting or not acting? Unsurprisingly, the answer to the legal question is highly dependent on jurisdiction. I only consider US jurisdiction here (which incidently is not a single coherent jurisdiction, it is a phylum of jurisdictions), though some aspects of the answer extend to other countries.\n\nThe clearest cases are obligations to not act in a certain way \u2013 prohibitions. Police may not beat a suspect in order to obtain information. Period, end of story, no discretion. There is a putative bright line that police cannot cross, namely violating an individual's rights, and that constitutes a major exception to the doctrine of police immunity. If X is a clearly established right, police cannot violate that right and if they do, they can be sued or even prosecuted. Sometimes courts \"discover\" a particular right in a certain case, so the individual (plaintiff in a civil case) may be vindicated but the officer will not be subject to legal sanctions, since LEOs are not held to be appellate court justices who can divine the future discover of a legal right. [18 USC 242](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/242) statutorily describes certain circumstances where a choice is criminally proscribed, and [42 USC 1983](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983) allows for civil suits. This pertains to things that an officer does, saying what an officer does not legally have the discretion to perform an act.\n\nNow setting aside proscriptions where \"you may not...\", the doctrine of sovereign immunity prohibits civil or criminal actions against the government (including LEOs) unless a specific exception has been carved out.

There do exist statutory obligations to act imposed on LEOs, for example see [this AG legal opinion](http://www.myfloridalegal.com/ago.nsf/Opinions/85E4F114E318503185256570006E05B3) from Florida, stating that\n\n> A law enforcement officer, including a police officer, has a legal\n> duty to provide aid to ill, injured, and distressed persons who are\n> not in police custody during an emergency whether the law enforcement\n> officer is on\\-duty or acting in a law enforcement capacity off\\-duty.\n\nA famous case regarding (non)liability for police inaction is [Castle Rock v. Gonzales](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/04pdf/04-278.pdf). In this case, police declined to enforce a Temporary restraining order (TRO) against plaintiff's estranged husband (who then murdered the children). The Supreme Court observes that\n\n> the Due Process Clause does not \u201crequir\\[e] the State to protect the\n> life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by\n> private actors\u201d\n\nand also noted the lack of express statutory obligation to enforce that law. In [Everton v. Willard](https://law.justia.com/cases/florida/supreme-court/1985/63440-0.html), the Florida Supreme Court addressed the question of whether\n\n> discretionary police power authority to make or not make an arrest and\n> whether a decision not to take an individual into custody constitutes\n> a basic judgmental or decision\\-making function that is immune from\n> tort liability\n\nand they do\n\n> hold that the decision of whether to enforce the law by making an\n> arrest is a basic judgmental or discretionary governmental function\n> that is immune from suit, regardless of whether the decision is made\n> by the officer on the street, by his sergeant, lieutenant or captain,\n> or by the sheriff or chief of police\n\nThere have been disagreements on sovereign immunity, for example [Huhn v. Dixie Insurance Co.](https://casetext.com/case/huhn-v-dixie-ins-co), 453 So. 2d 70, which held that\n\n> when an individual suffers a direct, personal injury proximately\n> caused by the negligence of a municipal employee while acting within\n> the scope of his employment, the injured individual is entitled to\n> redress for the wrong done\n\n(the relevant action was not arresting a person for DUI).\n\nAs employees of the government, LEOs are subject to the over\\-arching rules of their employer. They may be ordered by their superiors to refrain from arresting a law\\-breaker during a riot, on the grounds that doing so will exacerbate a tense situation. The police department might be sued for such a decision, but it is unlikely that the government will be held liable for an essentially political decision. Likewise, enforcement of \"no public camping\" laws is highly variable, and the courts will most likely not sanction a city for not arresting homeless people who are camping on public property in violation of the law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal obligations of law enforcement officers (LEOs) in the United States regarding their duty to act?\n\nA) LEOs have a legal obligation to intervene in all situations where they witness a crime being committed.\n\nB) LEOs have complete discretion in all situations and cannot be held liable for failing to act, regardless of circumstances.\n\nC) LEOs have discretion in most situations, but can be held liable for failing to act in specific circumstances where there is a clear statutory duty or where their inaction violates clearly established rights.\n\nD) LEOs can only be held liable for actions they take, never for failing to act in any situation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption C is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

Some points to note:\n\n* It calls up (as do all subsequent revisions) [JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules \\& Procedures](https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/),\n* These allow the consolidation of arbitration\u2019s between different parties over the same issue,\n* Patreon\u2019s liability is limited to the amount collected from the particular user.\n\n> 1. Do Patreon's terms of service cause Patreon to lose a minimum sum of money to arbitration costs in all cases, even if the claim is immediately rejected?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nAs stated above, Patreon can ask that the arbitrations be consolidated. I see no reason why the request wouldn\u2019t be granted. That way they only pay for one.\n\nAlternatively, they can simply pay out their maximum liability if that is less than the expected costs. For many users, it\u2019s likely the commissions they have paid will be less than their $250 filing fee.\n\n> 2. If yes, is Patreon required to go through full arbitration for each individual claim made? Or is there some mechanism to avoid additional costs for subsequent claims that are essentially identical to one that was already decided?\n\nThere are no precedents set in arbitration so each has to be decided individually. However, it\u2019s likely there will be only one arbitration, see above.\n\n> 3. If yes, roughly what number of plaintiffs would be required for the combined claims to bankrupt (or seriously damage) a company like Patreon?\n\nWell, it depends if they are insured or not.\n\nIf they are insured for legal costs then the question is how much to damage their insurer. And the answer is \\- a lot.

I'm looking for cases addressing this question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several concepts that are very closely related: piercing the corporate veil, the alter ego doctrine, and fraudulent transfer laws.\n\nLots of conduct that does not qualify for piercing the corporate veil, or the alter ego doctrine, can still be used to hold the owner liable for a fraudulent transfer.\n\nUsually, if the owner transfers an asset from the company (even something intangible, like business prospects) without substantially equivalent value being paid in exchange, or if the owner takes actions calculated to make the entity debtor affirmatively hinder a creditor or conceal assets, there is a fraudulent transfer and the transferred asset can be recovered by the entity's creditors.\n\nPaying bona fide valid insider debts before paying third\\-party creditors can also constitute a fraudulent transfer that can be recovered.\n\nThe remedies available against the business owner personally would also depend upon the precise nature of the misconduct.\n\nKeep in mind that in an action for a tort, like negligence causing personal injury or professional malpractice, anyone who participated in the negligence that caused the personal injury has personal liability, notwithstanding the fact that this person was acting in their official capacity for the company while doing so. So, the details of who was involved in causing the injury to the customer matter. In a small closely held limited liability company, the owners is often personally involved in tortious conduct.\n\nFor example, suppose that a small closely held company makes a defective product and sells it to a customer who is injured by the defective product.\n\nCertainly, the company that sold the product would be exposed to product liability claims from the injured customer.\n\nBut, if the small company only has one or two people who design and manufacture the product, and one can prove that they were involved in designing and manufacturing this particular product (e.g. a custom item), then the individuals involved in designing and manufacturing the defective product have personal liability in tort in a product liability suit, not just the company.\n\nOn the other hand, if the liability is purely for a breach of contract, or the company is liable vicariously for conduct of someone other than the owners or managers or officers, and if the company made no fraudulent transfers, and was operating with proper formalities at the time of the incident, piercing the corporate veil, or applying the alter ego doctrine could be much more challenging (although, of course, the law varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and this is largely a matter of state law).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small company, XYZ LLC, manufactures custom furniture.

In a small closely held company where the owner is directly involved in the design and manufacture of a product that causes injury, the owner can be held personally liable in tort for product liability, regardless of the corporate structure. This is because anyone who participates in negligence that causes personal injury has personal liability, even if acting in an official capacity for the company.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because personal liability can stem from actions at the time of the injury, not just post-injury misconduct.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while piercing the corporate veil is one way to establish liability, it's not necessary when the owner directly participated in the tortious conduct.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while fraudulent transfer could be an additional basis for liability, it's not the only way John could be held personally liable.
