According to the New Jersey Courts' Appellate Process guidelines, filing an appeal does not automatically stay the lower court proceedings. The defendant must first move for a stay in the trial court (in this case, the Special Civil Part). If the trial court denies the stay, the defendant may then make a motion for a stay to the Appellate Division. This process gives both the lower court and the Appellate Division discretion in deciding whether to grant a stay, taking into account factors such as the potential for significant harm to the defendant if the eviction proceeds. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest automatic actions that do not align with the actual process. Option B is incorrect because it wrongly states that the lower court judge has no discretion, when in fact, the judge does have the authority to grant or deny a stay."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1758/can-you-be-penalized-for-pleading-not-guilty-if-youre-found-guilty", "docs_id": 1758, "title": "Can you be penalized for pleading not guilty if you&#39;re found guilty?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If you plead not guilty on a traffic ticket in New York City.

The creator of it has made a number of false, or at minimum deliberately very misleading, claims about the legal system, with apparently an intent to convince people who believe him to have sex with him. He doesn't claim to be a lawyer of any type. \n\nThe video is long, but as an overview it, correctly, claims that any child born in the USA or with a USA citizen as a father is a US citizen. It then falsely claims this theoretical child will get free schooling and college scholarship without having to pay taxes and that the child's (non\\-citizen) parents will get a green card when the child turns 21, which is not really accurate, as the child can't benefit from free schooling without someone paying taxes, a green card is not guaranteed at 21, and the part about college scholarships seems completely false.\n\nThis all leads to the argument that foreign women should get pregnant by having sex with the poster of the video so that they can have a child who is a US citizen and reap all these wonderful benefits the US citizen child will supposedly gain.\n\nSome very lenient reading of the claims could *almost* say that the claims are all technically true, though I believe in context it is clearly deliberately misleading for self gain. However, it leaves me with two questions.\n\nFirst, in general, if we assume he had made an intentionally false statement about the the legal code for something like this would it be legal? I'm pretty sure it would be fraud if he gained financially, but does convincing someone to have sex with you from a misrepresentation of the law actually violate any law?\n\nSecond, would any statements made specifically in this situation be considered false/fraudulent from a legal standard? That is assuming that there were cause to file a complaint against him would he be able to claim that every statement taken in isolation have some slight bit of truth to them and so are not fraudulent? If he hadn't made the claim about college scholarships, which seems blatantly false to me, would he be able to claim that technically a child would get free schooling without the parent having to pay taxes if the parent abandoned the child in the US to be adopted, or is that still too far of a legal stretch to ever be accepted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fraud involves **gain**.

So does one wrong (discrimination) trump another (lying) in a court of law?\n\nUpdate: since it\u2019s not clear, I\u2019m talking about a scenario where the \u201cAsian\u201d person is willing to admit they lied in a court of law. This isn\u2019t a question on how race is legally defined.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Lying may be wrong, but it in the United States, it is generally not illegal. [*United States v. Alvarez*, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-alvarez).\n\nFor a lie to be illegal, it generally needs to fall into one of a few specific categories, usually involving either [fraud](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1341) or the frustration of legitimate government activities (as in [perjury](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621), [falsification of records](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1519), or [lying to a federal agent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001)).\n\nIn any of these cases, the First Amendment is generally going to prohibit any penalties unless the false statement is material, i.e., it had the potential to change the outcome of the event in which it was uttered. As you noted, it is generally illegal to discriminate against Asians, so I would expect a court to treat the tenant's ethnicity as immaterial and require the landlord to honor the rental contract.\n\nOf course, this assumes that the landlord is prohibited from disciminating against Asians, which is not always true. The Fair Housing Act has [exemptions](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3603) for (a) private clubs; (b) for buildings with four or fewer units, one of which the landlord occupies; (c) for single\\-family homes that the landlord is renting without the help of an agent; and (d) for religious organizations.\n\nIn such a case, the landlord may be actually be permitted to disciminate against Asians, so the tenant's false statement about their ethnicity would become material the transaction, and a court may therefore permit the landlord to rescind the contract.\n\n(Note, though, that even though the FHA permits *discrimination* in those limited situations, it does not permit *advertising* discriminatory preferences. The landlord's \"No Asians\" language is therefore illegal, whether it is communicated on a sign in the window or in a classified ad or by word of mouth.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord owns a duplex and lives in one unit while renting out the other.

Which of the following is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The landlord's discrimination is illegal, and the tenant's lie is immaterial, so the rental agreement is valid and enforceable.\n\nB) The landlord's discrimination is legal under FHA exemptions, but his verbal statement is illegal; the tenant's lie is material, so the contract can be rescinded.\n\nC) Both the landlord's discrimination and the tenant's lie are illegal; the court would likely void the contract.\n\nD) The landlord's discrimination is legal under FHA exemptions, including his verbal statement; the tenant's lie is material, so the contract can be rescinded.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of Fair Housing Act (FHA) exemptions, the materiality of false statements, and the nuances of housing discrimination law. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The landlord owns a duplex and lives in one unit, which falls under FHA exemptions allowing discrimination.\n2. However, the FHA still prohibits advertising discriminatory preferences, even verbally.\n3. The tenant's lie about race would be considered material in this case, as the landlord is legally allowed to discriminate based on race in this specific situation.\n4. Due to the materiality of the lie, the contract could potentially be rescinded.\n\nA is incorrect because the landlord's discrimination is actually legal in this specific case. C is incorrect because the landlord's discrimination is legal, though his statement is not. D is incorrect because while the discrimination itself is legal, the verbal statement of preference is still illegal under the FHA."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/68179/do-i-still-need-to-check-if-users-are-inside-of-eea-uk-for-gdpr-consent-if-my-an", "docs_id": 68179, "title": "Do I still need to check if users are inside of EEA/UK for GDPR consent if my Android app is ONLY released in countries outside of EEA/UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Example:\n\n* A US user downloads the Android app from the US Google Play Store\n* The user does not view any consent form and begins using the app and viewing ads\n* The user then travels to EEA/UK and continues viewing ads\n\nWould a consent form be required to adhere to GDPR in this instance, even if personalised ads are disabled for EEA/UK users?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR roughly applies in the following scenarios:\n\n* Art 3(1\\): you have an establishment in Europe\n* Art 3(2\\): you do not have an european establishment, but\n\t+ Art 3(2\\)(a): offer goods or services to persons in Europe\n\t+ Art 3(2\\)(b): monitor the behaviour of people who are in Europe\n\n(where *Europe* means EU/EEA/UK as appropriate).\n\nArt 3(1\\) does not seem to apply for you. Art 3(2\\)(a) does not apply, since you're not actively targeting people in Europe. At the point in time where you are offering the app to users, those users are in the US.\n\nArt 3(2\\)(b) could apply if you collect some kind of tracking data, in particular (but not limited to) location data. But if you temporarily shut down collection of new data for personalisation while the user is in Europe, that's probably going to be reasonably safe. It might not be necessary to disable ad personalisation if that personalisation is based on data collected outside of Europe. In practice, unless your app is specifically targeted at travellers, no one will care about what your app does outside of the US.\n\nFor detailed guidelines on the territorial scope of the GDPR, consider reading [EDPB guidelines 3/2018 (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-32018-territorial-scope-gdpr-article-3-version_en). The document contains some relevant examples, but since it's official guidance they won't explicitly say that GDPR won't apply in a scenario like yours.

While in Europe, he downloads and uses a news app that is offered by a U.S. company.

It's monitoring the behavior of people in Europe through location tracking (Art 3(2)(b) of GDPR).\n\nOption A is incorrect because temporary travel by a US user doesn't typically trigger GDPR compliance, especially if the app isn't targeting European users.\n\nOption B is closer, but merely translating the app without actively targeting European users or accepting European currency might not be enough to require GDPR compliance.\n\nOption C is a gray area, but organic growth without active targeting or monitoring in Europe might not necessarily trigger GDPR obligations.\n\nOption D clearly shows the company is now offering a service specifically for use in Europe and monitoring user behavior there, which would likely bring it under GDPR's scope."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28128/can-lawyers-senate-public-commitee-meetings-ask-questions-which-might-be-covered", "docs_id": 28128, "title": "can lawyers/senate public commitee meetings ask questions which might be covered by NDA&#39;s", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm just taking the recent Mark Zuckerberg Senate hearings which were held in the open in the United States.

That means, I would have to compile a large data set containing all or most of the works of Seuss, and store it all in a text file, or series of files. For simplicity's sake let's say 1 file containing all the books/poems concatenated together. All copyrighted, all intellectual property (IP) of someone else.\n\nHere's a precursor question:\n**Is it legal to even create that document, for personal/educational/fair use?**\n\nAssuming it is, even vaguely, then imagine a case where I create said document, and plug it into a neural network to generate Seuss\\-like works, and now I want to share the application on GitHub, publically, so other people can train their own Seuss neural network. That would mean sharing the IP dataset too, because I can't very well expect everyone who wants to clone my repository to generate their own Seuss dataset, because that's not a trivial thing to do.\n\nThe last question (which I linked above) told me that no, sharing it in this way is sketchy and ambiguous at best, if I wanted to claim fair use.\n\n---\n\nSo then it became, \"How can I do what I want to do, but without copyright infringement?\" I had a couple of ideas on that, relating to encrypting the IP dataset.\n\nOne idea was to write a batch processing script that would do a simple en/decryption on a plaintext file, and include that with the repo.\n\nAnother idea was to encrypt the data initially before putting it in the repo, and include the decrypt script, as a subprocess to be run each time the neural network generates \\[samples] some original\\* data.\n\n\\*original being used loosely here, as poorly managed neural nets are prone to overfitting, or providing samples which are not unique enough to be considered original data...\n\nThis was sort of a crazy idea to me, to think that I could potentially train a NN on encrypted (seemingly junk) data, and then when it generates its own gobbledygook, being able to run the decrypt script on it which would turn out to be accurate, legible, and coherent. But it lines up perfectly with what I am trying to do. (**Is encrypted intellectual property still intellectual property in this case?**) \n\nWithin the repo, the encrypted IP data is junk, meaningless and without context. Within the neural network, which would be training on the encrypted data, it's also arguably meaningless. At least, is not utilizing or infringing on any intellectual property in any straightforward way. Only when the user tells the neural network to generate some Seuss\\-like text, it spits out what it has learned. But what it has learned will be, for all intensive porpoises, an illegible layer of encrypted nonsense. Only after running the output through the decrypt will it even remotely resemble the works of Seuss.\n\nSo... what about all that? :) **Does any of this resemble something legal?** Or are they just pipe dreams with little basis in the reality of law?\n\nAgain, remember that due to overfitting, the sort of black\\-box system I've described could potentially output data that decrypts into verbatim Seuss intellectual property. But in reality, the level of 'closeness' to Seuss falls along a spectrum, which I informally call 'variable likeness.'

These are functionally equivalent, but in the matter of international data transfers the practical details have diverged.\n\nIn [my answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/77286) that you cited, I argued that any website processes personal data, and is thus potentially in\\-scope for the GDPR. If you cause another organization to process this personal data outside of the UK, you are performing an international data transfer (called \u201crestricted transfer\u201d in UK guidance). For example, such non\\-UK processing occurs if you use cloud services that run outside of the UK.\n\nThe UK ICO has [guidance on international data transfers](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/#adequacy). As in an EU GDPR context, you can only perform the transfer if the data remains suitably protected, or one of the exceptions applies. The data remains suitably protected if the target country was attested and \u201cadequate\u201d level of data protection, or if you have implemented appropriate safeguards.\n\nAs of 2022, the list of countries considered adequate is generally equivalent to the EU list of adequacy decisions. Notably, the US is no longer on that list after the Schrems II decision that invalidated the Privacy Shield Agreement. Since this decision was made before Exit Day, it also applies in the UK.\n\nThis leaves \u201cappropriate safeguards\u201d for UK\u2192US restricted transfers. In the linked ICO page, read the section [Is the restricted transfer covered by appropriate safeguards?](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/#appropriate). In brief, you will need to perform a Transfer Impact Assessment, and sign Standard Contractual Clauses with the US data importer.\n\n* In a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA), you check that the data remains protected despite the transfer into a country without an adequate level of data protection.\n\nThere is no official guidance on conducting a TIA, but the [IAPP has a template](https://iapp.org/resources/article/transfer-impact-assessment-templates/) and the EU EDPB has [recommendations on supplemental measures to protect data transfers](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf), which might reduce the risk and affect a TIA in your favor.\n\nIt's worth noting that the EDPB recommendations were written in the wake of the Schrems II ruling, and can be summarized as \u201ccompliance is impossible when using US\\-based cloud services\u201d. But this is your assessment, and TBH it seems the UK is a bit more relaxed than the EU in this regard.\n* The Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are a pre\\-formulated contract that binds the foreign data importer to handle the data properly. In essence, this translates relevant aspects of the UK GDPR into contract law.\n\nMany service providers already provide a Data Processing Agreement that includes SCCs by reference, but you'll have to make sure that these contracts have been entered in a legally binding manner. Sometimes these apply automatically as part of the terms of service, sometimes you need to explicitly sign these documents.\n\nBut SCCs are one detail where UK GDPR compliance and EU GDPR compliance diverges a bit. The old EU SCC templates from 2004/2010 can no longer be used and have been replaced.\n\nFor compliance with the EU GDPR, the new [2021 SCCs](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) must be used.\n\nFor compliance with the UK GDPR, you have [two options](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/). You can either use the 2022 International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA), or you can use the 2021 EU SCCs along with the 2022 UK International Data Transfer Addendum which modifies the EU SCCs in some details.\n\nDon't want to deal with TIAs and SCCs?

When transferring data from the UK to a country without an adequacy decision (like the US), the UK GDPR requires appropriate safeguards. This involves two key steps:\n\n1. Conducting a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA) to ensure that the data remains protected despite the transfer to a country without an adequate level of data protection.\n\n2.

Option C is incorrect because while obtaining consent can be a basis for data processing, it doesn't address the specific requirements for international data transfers.

Could one take it to such an *extreme* as `reasonably cool` and still have a serious verdict?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It's a contract, vagueness is not something you want (from a legal perspective). If you want somebody to be \"reasonably kind\" you need to spell out what that means so that there is no question when it comes to breaking the contract. \n\nFor example, your contract should state something like:\n\n> I (Seph Reed, herein \"me\") will be John Doe's friend and provide\n>  snacks (defined in Section B) as long as John Doe:\n> \n> \n> * Does not call me names\n> * Invites me to at least 1 social activity per week\n> * etc...\n\nThe contract needs to be specific because if you want to ever break the contract you need to be able to prove a breach. Specifically in the above if \"John Doe\" texted that you are a \"STUCK\\-UP, HALF\\-WITTED, SCRUFFY\\-LOOKING NERF HERDER\", you could break your contract for a breach of item 1\\. \n\nHaving vagueness in a contract invites a lawsuit, one which may be expensive for you.

This approach reduces ambiguity and potential disputes. The documentation emphasizes the importance of specificity in contracts, stating that \"vagueness is not something you want (from a legal perspective)\" and advising to \"spell out exactly what you want and what constitutes a breach.\" By clearly defining abstract concepts through concrete actions or behaviors, both parties have a clear understanding of their obligations and what would constitute a breach of contract.

However, I seek clarification on whether claiming the game is similar to the original would infringe on the original game's intellectual property.

They are considered to be \"ideas, methods or procedures\". [17 USC 102(b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#102) provides that:\n\n> (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nIf the wording of the rules is not the same, and no art or visual design was copied or imitated, the fact that the gameplay is the same does not afford any copyright claim.\n\nClaims of Similarity\n--------------------\n\nA comment from the OP says:\n\n> I seek clarification on whether claiming the game is similar to the original would infringe on the original game's intellectual property.\n\nIf the maker or distributor of the new game states that it is similar to the old game, something like \"*This is a Flower version of Monopoly.*\" would that be any sort of IP infringement?\n\nSuch a statement would in no way infringe any copyright. Would it infringe the trademark rights on the mark \"Monopoly\". That is harder to say.\n\nThe key question in a trademark case is whether the use of a mark, or of words or images that refer to or suggest a mark, would cause reasonable people to falsely think that the new product or service is endorsed, sponsored, or approved by the makers of the old, or to falsely believe that the new product or service comes from the same source as the old one, that is, is made by the same firm or the same people. Whether a particular statement of similarity would do that is a question of fact, and would depend on the details of the statement and the overall presentation of the new game. But a disclaimer can and often does avoid a potential trademark infringement issue. A statement something like:\n\n> FlowerPoly is not endorsed, approved, or sponsored by Hasbro, the makers of Monopoly, and holders of the trademark on that name. FlowerPoly was created by a completely different group of people. One should not rely on the reputation of Monopoly when deciding to purchase or play FlowerPoly.\n\nIt would be wise to have the exact details of any statement of similarity, of any disclaimer, and of the name itself, reviewed by a lawyer with experience specifically in trademark law.\n\nIn general, merely suggesting a similarity is not trademark infringement. Specifically, comparative advertising is not infringement.

Game rules and mechanics are not protected by copyright, as stated in 17 USC 102(b). However, trademark issues could arise depending on how the similarities to Monopoly are presented or advertised. While a disclaimer can help, it doesn't guarantee protection against all potential trademark claims.

The SCO appears to be managing an existing case involving the student and department, suggesting some issues are already known. Universities often have policies allowing internal information sharing on a need-to-know basis for student case management.

He found that whenever a user posts something from their popular social media application, the device adds some data to that post that leaks the information related to their fingerprint.

These fingerprints are the gatekeepers to all the funds that are stored by the users on their devices.\n\nJohn Doe is now in a dilemma (legal not ethical).

The most likely order from a court would be \"compensate X for your actions or inactions\". Barring some peculiar circumstance, either you or the HOA would be liable to the downstairs person. You can look at the CCRs to see who is responsible for what, which mainly involves finding boundaries (where is the unit, and where are the common areas?). At some point, someone has to figure out what caused the damage. It is possible that via negligence, you caused damage (maybe the plumber was simply wrong); or maybe this is about rain, the ventilation system, and the common areas where the HOA is responsible. Whatever the case may be, the person below would sue to recover his cost of fixing the problem.\n\nProperty owners often have insurance that insures against damage to their property \u2013 it sounds like you have such insurance, and the guy below has insurance. It's also possible that the HOA has insurance.

That company naturally wants to limit their losses and collect from whoever is ultimately legally liable. You are under no legal obligation to respond to a neighbor's accusation, until the issue is formally escalated (the threat of a lawsuit, directly filed by him or by his insurance company). You don't have to accept or reject his beliefs.\n\nIf there are no insurance companies involved, and if you are certain that this is the responsibility of the HOA, then you would probably not consider taking on unnecessary expenses to diagnose the problem.

The decision on granting the e\u00fcH is made by the respective management of the prison as the enforcement authority. Numerous requirements must be met, the existence of which is carefully checked. The criteria to be met include in particular:\n\n> * The time to be served or still to be served does not exceed twelve\n> months or\n> * is not expected to exceed 12 months because, for example, a\n> conditional discharge can be expected.\n> * Suitable accommodation in the country\n> * Suitable employment\n> * Income for subsistence\n> * Health and accident insurance coverage\n> * Written consent of the people living in the same\n> household\n> * Prediction that after examining the living conditions, the\n> social environment and any risk factors as well as compliance with\n> the conditions to be imposed, this form of implementation will not be\n> misused\n\n> The necessary surveys to clarify the prerequisites or to create the supervisory profile are carried out with the support of the \u201cNeustart\u201d association by social workers.

Should some data be anonymized?\nShould the resume be returned from prospective clients?\nIs there any way to enforce a client to treat it confidential?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In answer to your questions, always get potential clients to sign a contract which covers the GDPR personal data processing requirements at a minimum, prior to giving them a copy of a consultant resume to retain. If you were sat in a meeting with them it is much simpler to record in your logs that the client had sight of the resume but was not left a copy of it in any format, than it is to keep track of which clients have a copy of which data and chasing up to ensure it is erased/destroyed when appropriate.\n\nTo ensure clients treat the resumes as confidential, make sure they are labelled in the header and footer as confidential. They could also be kept in an envelope clearly marked confidential. There could also be a footnote in small print that informs anyone with a copy, who the data controller is, and that processing is strictly subject to the terms of the 'client contract' or whatever you call it, and that it should be returned or shredded within X days of receipt for example. \nIf you have a computer system generate these it could even specify the client's name and the specific date it should be shredded by. Your notice could include a reminder that the personal data is protected under the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016 and that (client name) as a data processor could be held liable in the event of unauthorised disclosure or processing, if they act outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the data controller. \n\nWhilst this won't enforce responsible processing at least it will ensure that your business has done its best to ensure any recipients are fully aware of their responsibilities to protect the information and it would be very difficult for a client to claim they weren't aware the information was confidential or that they had legally binding responsibilities to protect it.\n\nIt's also worth noting that simply sending CV's/resumes (or other personal data) out via email (unless suitably encrypted) would not meet the requirement in GDPR recital 39 for personal data to be \"processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing.\" Email technology whilst convenient does not offer any guarantees regarding privacy and confidentiality, therefore instead of sending resumes as email attachments it might be better to use a web\\-based extranet system which authenticates users before granting access to view resumes. Emails could just let clients know there is a new resume or X number of resumes waiting for them to review and give them a link/button to login.\n\nThe records of processing activities are in GDPR Article 30 on page 50, and it does not specify a retention period nor that we can choose the retention period, but simply states that data controllers make the records available to the supervisory authority when requested to do so \\- this may imply indefinite retention of processing records even beyond the life of the processing system (e.g. discontinued products/services), however we may need to await further clarification on this issue from supervisory authorities to be sure.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A consultant is preparing to share resumes with potential clients.

This duty, however, does not require that the lawyer use special security measures if the method of communication affords a reasonable expectation of privacy. **Special circumstances, however, may warrant special precautions**. Factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the lawyer's expectation of confidentiality include the sensitivity of the information and the extent to which the privacy of the communication is protected by law or by a confidentiality agreement.\n\nBoth instances require reasonable efforts \\- those an ordinary person would use.\n\nABA Formal Opinion 1\\-459 tells us that\n*A lawyer sending or receiving substantive communications with a client via e\\-mail or other electronic means ordinarily must warn the client about the risk of sending or receiving electronic communications using a computer or other device, or e\\-mail account, where there is a significant risk that a third party may gain access.*\n\nThis comment pertains to specific situations, like a client emailing a lawyer from the client's work\\-computer.

The 40 km/h speed limit established by the earlier sign on Fitzgerald St remains in effect until it is explicitly changed by another speed limit sign.

The 60 km/h sign after the intersection marks the beginning of a new speed zone, not the retroactive application of a higher speed limit.

This waiver does not contain any provision requiring Stack Exchange (or anyone else) to moderate \"fairly\" or to be \"neutral,\" nor does it say anything about terms of service. Regardless, it's hard to see how they could violate these terms anyway:\n\n> Stack Overflow reserves the right to refuse, suspend or terminate your access to the public Network if it determines, **in its sole discretion**, that you have in any way violated these Public Network Terms or are otherwise ineligible to access or use the Network or Services. If your actions are determined by us to violate these Public Network Terms, Stack Overflow may, **in its sole discretion**, try to remediate that violation by working with you individually, but is under no obligation to do so, and if any such remediation efforts are unsuccessful (in Stack Overflow\u2019s sole discretion), then Stack Overflow may revoke your rights to the Network.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\nPublic forum\n------------\n\nA \"public forum\" in American Constitutional law normally refers to a situation where an agent of the government contracts with a private entity to set up a space in which the general public may speak or otherwise express themselves. Because the private entity acts on behalf of the government, the First Amendment is extended to the private entity, at least in the context of the space which it has set up. Stack Exchange, to the best of my knowledge, has no such relationship with either the federal or any state government. So the doctrine is inapplicable.\n\nIn California, the state constitution has a stronger provision which has been applied to private actors notwithstanding their lack of a relationship with the government. This case was [*Pruneyard v. Robins*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1979/79-289).

There is nothing in the GDPR that exempts a data controller from its provisions because the data is \"B2B\". It is true that the GDPR does not protect data that identifies businesses and other entities that are not natural persons. But a natural person is still a natural person when s/he is an employee. Data that identifies or is associated with an employee is still personal data.\n\nThe question also seems to assumes that publication of any data associated with a person requires that person's consent under the GDPR. That is also incorrect. The GDPR requires a ***lawful basis*** for any processing. Storage is processing. So is posting to a web site, whether internal to a business or on the open internet. All such processing requires a lawful basis. Consent is only one of the six possible lawful bases available under the GDPR.\n\nA company that wants to post an employee directory, or the contact info of selected employees so that a customer can send communications to them, may obtain the consent of those employees, which may be the simplest basis to establish. Or it might also use legitimate interest. It certainly seems to me that a business has a legitimate interest in letting its customers know how to reach the proper employee to deal with the customer's needs.\n\nIt does not matter who pays for a telephone, a telephone number that is associated with a specific natural person is still personal data (PD).

According to the GDPR, a company needs a lawful basis for processing any personal data, including employee contact information.

For example, they \"*may not* prevent or discourage your child from enrolling in or attending school because he or \nshe lacks a birth certificate\". Proof of residency can be challenging, for example you need two forms of proof for a drivers license transfer. A bank statement and library card may satisfy DMV.\n\nUnder the federal McKinney\\-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, you may qualify as technically \"homeless\", and homeless children cannot be required to show proof of residency. The Dept. of Education provides [this information](https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/qa-201101.pdf); it is unlikely that they will deny a student the right to enroll because of inadequate documentation.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A single mother is moving to Pooler, GA with her son and temporarily staying with her mother-in-law. She needs to enroll her son in school but lacks traditional proof of residency. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding her situation?\n\nA) She cannot enroll her son until she has a permanent address and can provide a utility bill or lease agreement.\n\nB) She must provide a birth certificate and immunization records, or her son will be denied enrollment.\n\nC) Under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, she may qualify as \"homeless\" and could enroll her son without proof of residency.\n\nD) She needs to obtain a Georgia driver's license first to prove residency for school enrollment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, individuals staying temporarily with others due to loss of housing or economic hardship may qualify as \"homeless.\" In this situation, the school district cannot require proof of residency for enrollment. This act ensures that homeless children have equal access to education.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while proof of address is typically required, exceptions exist for those in temporary living situations.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while these documents are generally required, the US Department of Justice states that lack of a birth certificate cannot prevent or discourage enrollment.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because obtaining a driver's license is not a prerequisite for school enrollment, and the mother's temporary living situation might make it difficult to obtain a license immediately."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1742/can-my-manager-make-me-do-unpaid-training-like-this", "docs_id": 1742, "title": "Can my manager make me do unpaid training like this?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Context: I work at a restaurant in the UK. I am new and haven't yet completed the online training Program's I have been asked to complete. It's pretty much a zero hour contract (I think it's 12 hours) but I work about 40 a week.\n\nThe training mentioned below can be done any time anywhere. Including at home.\n\nSituation: recently, whenever the restaurant gets less busy, my manager asks me to go upstairs and complete some more training without pay. They essentially keep me on site without pay incase they get busy. Today certain conditions led me to believe that it wasn't going to get busy for the rest of the day. They asked me to go do the training and I assumed I'd be upstairs until they were closing up, which takes about 40 minutes.\n\nI wasn't about to sit upstairs for 3 hours unpaid, so I politely let the manager know that I'd like to get back on pay or go home. They sent me home.\n\nAm I in the wrong here?

However, if your employment were to be terminated due to a disagreement then you may not be able to make any claim before an Employment Tribunal as you do not yet have a sufficient length of employment.\n\nThere are many legal complications, and each case is different and individual. Giving general legal advice is beset with all kinds of problems. You may wish to direct your employer to the Citizens' Advice page. If they do not agree to either pay you for your time there or allow you to leave when they do not wish to pay you then your best option might be to seek employment elsewhere.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK, an employee at a restaurant is asked by their manager to complete unpaid training during slow periods. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this situation?\n\nA) The manager's request is legal as long as the training is essential for the job and doesn't exceed 3 hours per week.\n\nB) The employee must comply with the manager's request or risk being fired, regardless of payment.\n\nC) The employee is entitled to be paid for all time spent at work, including training periods, even if there's no active customer service involved.\n\nD) Unpaid training is permissible under UK law if the employee is on a zero-hour contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to UK employment law, employees are entitled to be paid for all work they have done, including training time. The Citizens Advice Bureau states that employees should be paid if they are ready and willing to work, even if the employer hasn't provided them with specific tasks. This applies regardless of the type of contract (including zero-hour contracts). Options A and D are incorrect as they suggest unpaid training could be legal under certain circumstances, which is not the case. Option B is incorrect as it misrepresents the employee's rights and obligations. The correct answer, C, accurately reflects the legal requirement for employers to pay employees for all time spent at work, including training periods."}}
