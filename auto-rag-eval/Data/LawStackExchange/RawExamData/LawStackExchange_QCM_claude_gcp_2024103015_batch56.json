I paid this rent on time. However, I was notified later that day that the money order was 3 cents less than was due. The person who rang up my money order entered it incorrectly. This was at the end of the apartment's office hours, while I was still at work, so I had no way to pay it immediately. \n\nAt this point, there was one more day left to pay.\n\nThe next day I went to pay before I went to work, office was closed. So I left work in the middle of the day to pay the 3 pennies, and office was again closed. I was not permitted to leave work again. I was notified again that I did not pay it, I explained I came by twice and the office was closed.\n\nAt this point, it was at the end of the final day for rent to be due. \n\nThe next morning, I went to the office to pay 3 cents, as well as deliver a letter of apology, with the 3 pennies enclosed. The manager immediately told me they cannot accept change, and since it was technically late, I had to either pay the 3 cents with a money order or cashier's check.\n\nI had zero chance to leave work today. Therefore, I could not take care of it. I already had to be late for work to visit the office this morning. When I got home from work, there was an eviction notice on my door (pay or exit notice). The notice explained that I owe a total amount of $866\\.56, which is my total amount of rent ($795\\.36\\) as well as a late fee ($71\\.20\\). \n\nHowever, I had already paid $795\\.33 on time, which was 3 cents short of the total. This notice did not mention anything about owing 3 cents. Its exact words are:\n\n> You are hereby notified that you are indebted to \\[Apartment Name] **in the sum of $866\\.56** for rent, late fees, and the use of the premises indicated above now occupied by you and that the landlord demands payment of the rent or possession of the premises within (7\\) SEVENdays from the date of delivery of this notice. **Please pay the full amount above** which includes late fees of $71\\.20, in order to avoid further charges or action. Payment must be made by cashier's check or money order made payable to \\[Apartment Name]. Personal checks will not be accepted for payment of this delinquent balance.\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\nBasically, it's as if I never paid them a penny.\n\nIt is my understanding that legally, a notice of this nature *must* be *accurate*, and this notice was not accurate. There is no indication that I already paid a majority of it, and that I only owed 3 cents (plus late fee). Therefore, from what I've studied, this notice is nullified given the fact that it is asking for a balance which I already paid a majority of. \n\n**QUESTION**\n\nIs my understanding correct that since the notice has the incorrect amount, that the notice is nullified and invalid? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When you tendered three pennies, that should have satisfied the debt as the landlord does not have the right in this situation to insist on payment in a money order in lieu of currency. A money order requirement is only effective as a means by which to refrain from accepting personal checks, not cash. This is the ignorance of the property manager at work.\n\nAt a minimum, refusing to accept the pennies would constitute a violation of the landlord's duty of good faith:\n\n> \u00a7 383\\.550\\. \"Good faith\" obligation\n> \n> \n> Every duty under KRS 383\\.505 to 383\\.715 and every act which must be\n>  performed as a condition precedent to the exercise of a right or\n>  remedy under KRS 383\\.505 to 383\\.715 imposes an obligation of good\n>  faith in its performance or enforcement.\n\nImposing a late fee in this situation may also be unconscionable:\n\n> \u00a7 383\\.555\\.

The notice is probably attempting to comply with this statutory requirement:\n\n> \u00a7 383\\.660\\.

If the\n>  tenant's noncompliance is willful the landlord may recover actual\n>  damages and reasonable attorney's fees.\n\nBy not accurately stating the non\\-payment, the notice may be ineffective legally.\n\nThe circumstances of your case would not entitle the landlord to attorneys' fees. *O'Rourke v. Lexington Real Estate Co. L.L.C.*, 365 S.W.3d 584 (Ky. App. 2011\\).\n\nMy guess is that the late fee is $71\\.20 because there are really two components of your rent, one of which is $712 per month with a 10% late fee, and the other of which is $83\\.33 which is probably some passed through charge for utilities or a water and sewer bill or some sort of tax.\n\nIf indeed the late fee is a percentage of the unpaid rent, then first of all, the late fee shouldn't be more than 0\\.3 cents (which rounds down to zero), and second of all, the unpaid portion may very well be not rent, but a passed through charge that is not subject to the late fee, depending upon what the lease says about how amounts received are to be applied.\n\nIf the late fee is indeed a percentage of the amount owing, so that you owed at most 3\\.3 cents on the day after the rent was due, which rounds to 3 cents. Then, by tendering 3 pennies on that day, you satisfied your obligation in full and they are not living up to their obligation.\n\nIf the late fee is stated as a sum certain in the lease, however, and not as a percentage, you might be obligated to pay $71\\.23 by the terms of the lease, even though charge a late fee of $71\\.20 for paying 3 cents one day late probably violated usury and consumer protection laws in Kentucky, as well as the common law related to liquidated damages which requires penalties in contractual agreements to be proportionate to the breach of the contract. The maximum legal interest rate in Kentucky is set forth at \u00a7 360\\.010 of its statutes is is the greater of the commercial discount rate on 90 day paper plus 4%, or 19%, which is smaller. There is a civil penalty of double the amount of the usurious interest paid. \u00a7 310\\.020\\. Still, as a practical matter, it may be easier to tender a money order for $71\\.23 than to deal with a bureaucratic nightmare. \n\nHonestly, this is the sort of scrooge\\-like behavior that TV stations love to splash on the evening news, and contacting one of them might be one of your better options. Another option may be to contact a legal aid society, or to contact the local bar association to see if they have a pro bono lawyer available to take this case.\n\nAnother plausible option would be to communicate directly to the owner of the property in lieu of the property manager, setting forth the facts in writing.\n\nIf I were a lawyer for the landlord, I would be embarrassed to bring a case like this one, and the judge would probably chew me out for bringing it.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant paid their rent of $795.33 on time, which was 3 cents short of the total due. The landlord issued an eviction notice demanding $866.56, which included the full rent amount plus a late fee, without acknowledging the partial payment. The tenant attempted to pay the 3 cents in coins but was refused. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The eviction notice is valid because the tenant failed to pay the full amount on time.\n\nB) The landlord is within their rights to refuse payment in coins and demand a money order for the remaining balance.\n\nC) The eviction notice is likely invalid due to its inaccuracy in stating the amount owed and the landlord's refusal to accept legal tender.\n\nD) The tenant has no recourse and must pay the full amount requested in the eviction notice to avoid eviction.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The eviction notice is likely invalid for several reasons. First, it inaccurately states the amount owed by not acknowledging the partial payment made on time. Second, the landlord's refusal to accept legal tender (the 3 cents in coins) violates the principle of good faith in landlord-tenant relationships. The notice's demand for the full rent amount plus late fees, when only 3 cents was actually due, could be considered unconscionable under Kentucky law. Additionally, the disproportionate late fee for such a small amount may violate usury and consumer protection laws. These factors combined make the eviction notice likely invalid and unenforceable."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33932/at-what-point-is-it-breaking-the-law-during-an-online-scam", "docs_id": 33932, "title": "At what point is it breaking the law during an online scam", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Generally speaking, at what point it becomes illegal to be pretending that you're a Microsoft tech support (or better yet a random tech support not affiliated with any well known company) OR pretend to be a Nigerian Prince?\n\nIs it at some point while going through the script, for instance being granted access to the target's machine, or is it at the point where they receive money from the target?\n\nAssume either jurisdiction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At the moment when a person makes any false statement with the intent that it be believed by the other party, and that the liar benefit or the other party suffer harm because of this belief, the person has committed attempted fraud. If the lie is in fact believed, and harm does result, actual fraud has been committed. \n\nFraud is both a crime and a tort (private wrong). Often authorities choose to leave it to a civil suit by the victim rather than start a criminal prosecution. But that is a matter of policy or choice by the authorities, who may choose to prosecute any instance of fraud if they see fit.\n\nSuch a situation may involve other crimes as well. For example, in the US, if the false statement is transmitted electronically, it is probably **wire fraud**, [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1343 \\- Fraud by wire, radio, or television](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1343) provides that:\n\n> Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

This constitutes attempted fraud, even if no actual harm has occurred yet. Furthermore, under U.S. law, specifically 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1343 (wire fraud), merely transmitting a false statement as part of a fraudulent scheme via electronic means is illegal. This means the act becomes illegal very early in the process, well before any money changes hands or access to a computer is granted. Options A and B occur too late in the process to be correct.

However, most online stores' terms are very clear there is no contract when you place your order or when you get their automated reply; the contract comes into existence later when they do something. For [example](https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM#GUID-32F0D8DC-150F-4394-921F-77B2DB58A4F8__SECTION_5F2219ED7FA0401E868369AC40D9CE8B):\n\n> With respect to products sold by Amazon AU, your order is an offer to us for you to buy the product(s) in your order. ... **The Order Confirmation is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm our acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered.** **We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product(s) to you and send e\\-mail or post a message on the Message Centre of the website confirming that we've dispatched the product to you (the \"Dispatch Confirmation\").** ...\n\nNow, even without these terms, it's unlikely that your offer and the company's automated response created a binding contract because the company (as in, an actual person acting for the company) did not consent to the formation of the contract. Consent is fundamental: see [What is a contract and what is required for them to be valid?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/6263/what-is-a-contract-and-what-is-required-for-them-to-be-valid).\n\nWhat you received was an \"order confirmation\" \\- a reiteration of your offer to the company, not an acceptance of your order.\n\nConsumer protection\n-------------------\n\nMost jurisdictions have consumer protection laws that make it illegal to display an incorrect price.

The \"order confirmation\" is usually just an acknowledgment of receiving the order, not an acceptance of the offer to buy.

So I guess you are asking us to first devise a plausible injury to the candidate coming from the IRS action, and then see if that really gives them standing. At the outset, it is also important to fix on a reason why tax exempt status was not revoked (there is a separate law, the Church Audit Procedures Act about enforcing the Johnson provisions,\nsee [Branch Ministries v.

Racially\\-discriminatory private schools are not eligible for tax exemptions granted by the IRS: plaintiffs alleged that IRS procedures for vetting applicants on this ground were insufficient. The Supreme Court held that plaintiffs did not have standing to bring this lawsuit. The harms alleged in the suit are summarized as follows\n\n> First, they say that they are harmed directly by the mere fact of\n> Government financial aid to discriminatory private schools. Second,\n> they say that the federal tax exemptions to racially discriminatory\n> private schools in their communities impair their ability to have\n> their public schools desegregated.\n\nThese harms are analogous to ones that might be raised in your scenario.

You can't just sue the government because it isn't enforcing the law.\n\nThe problem is that the candidate is not obviously harmed by the Government giving tax relief to a third party.

Which of the following best describes Sarah's standing to bring such a lawsuit?\n\nA) Sarah has clear standing because the religious organization's actions directly harm her campaign.\n\nB) Sarah lacks standing because she cannot demonstrate a legally cognizable injury resulting from the IRS's inaction.\n\nC) Sarah has standing but the court would likely dismiss the case as a discretionary enforcement matter.\n\nD) Sarah has standing if she can prove that revoking the organization's tax-exempt status would significantly increase her chances of winning the election.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the principles outlined in Allen v. Wright and other precedents, Sarah likely lacks standing to bring this lawsuit. The key issues are:\n\n1. Sarah must identify a legally cognizable injury resulting from the IRS's inaction, not just a general complaint that the law isn't being enforced.\n2. The harm to Sarah's campaign from a third party's tax-exempt status is indirect and speculative.\n3. Courts have consistently held that \"an asserted right to have the Government act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court.\"\n4. Sarah doesn't have a \"right to win\" an election, only a right to run for office.\n5. It would be difficult to demonstrate that revoking the organization's tax-exempt status would directly address any injury to Sarah.\n\nWhile options A, C, and D might seem plausible, they don't align with the legal principles established in similar cases. Option B most accurately reflects the likely outcome based on existing precedent."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/87432/copyright-regulations-and-piping", "docs_id": 87432, "title": "Copyright regulations and piping", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: As I understand, the copyright regulations help non\\-proliferation of duplication and repetition but nothing to do with profiteering.

The license terms of an electronic book could be subject to various controls, and the license might be non\\-transferable.

They state that they are an Equal Opportunity Employer and list about 20 protected classes on the basis of which they ban discrimination. In our state, Michigan, only race, sex, and religion are protected classes under the law. But my company lists many more protected classes, including marital status, family size, sexual orientation, gender identity, political affiliation, and others. This is an internal policy, not law, but I'm wondering if this internal policy might conflict with the law.\n\nI know from personal experience that many religions require adherents to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Thus, nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is against those religions.\n\nAccording to the law, though, employers cannot discriminate on the basis of religion/religious affiliation. So when my company forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, as it does, it appears to violate the right of employees from certain religious backgrounds to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n**In other words, my employer \\- via their nondiscrimination policy \\- seems to be discriminating against employees whose religion requires them to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.**\n\n**So, is it the case that my company's nondiscrimination policy conflicts with the law?**\n\n(This situation doesn't impact me directly; I'm religious, but I'm emphatically *not* from a religion that requires discrimination.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The theory would be that because of federal law prohibiting employers from discriminating on the basis of religion, an employer would have to make a reasonable accommodation to the religious employee's requirements. Thus if your religion prohibits working on Friday, if it is reasonable to do so, the employer must allow you to work some other day. However, if store is only open on Friday, then it's not reasonable to employ a person who will never show up at work.\n\nNow suppose that a company prohibits employees from discriminating on the basis of family size. That would mean that a manager is not allowed to demote, fail to promote, *or* favorably promote an employee on the grounds that his family has fewer than members. (\"Discriminate\" means both favor and disfavor). It would be legal under current law to discriminate this way, and it is also legal for a company to prohibit such discrimination.\n\nEnter the employee with a putative religious obligation to actively discriminate against people with \"small\" families. The employee discovers that his cubicle\\-partner Bill has only 8 family members, and he starts loudly denouncing Bill \u2013 which disrupts the work environment. A reasonable accommodation might be to stick employee in a cubicle with a different co\\-worker (one who is religiously acceptable). But the specific circumstances matter, so if employee and Bill are the entire accounting department, this is not a reasonable accommodation. Nor is it reasonable to fire Bill. In that case, employee has to conduct himself politely while on the job. He is free to internally hate Bill, he just is not allowed to act on that hatred based on a claim that his religion requires him to act out.\n\nAt some point, the question could end up at the Supreme Court: can a policy against outrageous behavior be overruled (owing to anti\\-discrimination laws that require religious accommodation) because a person's religion is argued to require the outrageous behavior?

Companies can have nondiscrimination policies that go beyond what is legally required. However, they must also comply with laws protecting religious freedom. This typically means providing reasonable accommodations for employees' religious beliefs when possible, without causing undue hardship to the company or violating the rights of others. The company isn't required to allow discrimination, but they should try to find a middle ground that respects both their policy and the employee's beliefs, such as adjusting job duties or work arrangements when feasible.

One that I know of is that if someone files a lawsuit that is dismissed for lack of merit, the original defendant can countersue for legal fees. And, of course, \"loser pays\" applies to contracts where the contract says so. What are other circumstances in the U.S. where the loser of a litigation pays both sets of legal fees?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Each side paying for their own litigation costs is called the [American Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_rule_(attorney%27s_fees)). As you noted in your question, it contrasts the [English Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_rule_(attorney%27s_fees)) where the losing party pays the winning party's litigation costs.\n\nIn the United States, there are literally thousands of specific exceptions to the American Rule but they can be divided into these general categories:\n\n1. **Contracts** that say the losing party pays. This is one you pointed out in your question and is pretty common.\n2. **Common Fund Doctrine.** This is legal principle that courts have applied where it would be unfair for a plaintiff to pay their legal fees because it would be ultimately coming out of their pocket. Some classic examples are: A beneficiary suing a trustee for violating his fiduciary duties; shareholders suing the management of a company; and some types of class\\-action and antitrust cases where the efforts of the attorneys benefited the \"common good\".\n3. **Contempt** proceedings. *See [Toledo Scale Co. v. Computing Scale Co.](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/261/399/)*, 261 U.S. 399 (1923\\). This would only apply where one party is asking the Court to hold an opposing party in contempt, not where a judge initiates a contempt proceeding. Today, most states and the federal system have court rules that would likely apply here as well.\n4. **Bad Faith** litigation. As you noted in your question. This would be bad\\-faith/frivolous lawsuits and action in litigation that needlessly delay or increase the expenses of the opposing party.\n5. **Statutes**. This is by far the largest category. There are too many statutes to list but here is a sample of some broad categories:\n\n\t* Civil Rights Cases (Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, housing discrimination, Americans with Disabilities Act, Etc.)\n\t* Consumer Protection cases (Fair Credit Reporting Act, Fair Debt Collection Act, etc.)\n\t* Landlord\\-Tenant cases\n\t* Environmental Protection Cases\n\t* Open Records Law cases (Freedom of Information Act and similar state statutes)\n\nThe statutes that contain fee\\-shifting provisions are generally ones where litigation is thought to be in the \"public interest.\" The idea is that the legislature wants to encourage the private enforcement of certain laws. Allowing the recovery of attorney's fees provides financial incentives for lawyer to take cases where the ultimate damages award is small and might be less than their legal fees.\n\nThere is a good law review article in the American University Law Review called [The American Rule on Attorney Fee Allocation: The Injured Person's Access to Justice](http://www.aulawreview.org/pdfs/42/42-4/vargo.pdf) on this topic.

Landlord-tenant cases often fall under statutes that include fee-shifting provisions, which are exceptions to the American Rule. These statutes are designed to encourage private enforcement of certain laws and protect parties who might otherwise be unable to afford litigation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because in a routine contract dispute without a specific fee allocation clause, the American Rule would typically apply, with each party paying their own legal fees.\n\nOption C is incorrect because personal injury cases generally follow the American Rule, especially when both parties act in good faith.

When a customer purchases an integrated hardware/software product like an Apple computer, the ability to use the device is contingent upon agreeing to the software terms. If the customer decides not to agree to these terms, they cannot use the product as intended. In this situation, the most appropriate and legally supported action is to return the device for a refund.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Apple's hardware and software are integrated, and using the hardware without the proprietary software is not feasible or supported.\n\nOption B is not valid because Apple is not obligated to provide alternative software for their products. The integrated nature of their hardware and software is a key aspect of their business model.\n\nOption D is not the best course of action. While there might be an argument about the disclosure of terms, initiating a lawsuit would be an extreme and likely unsuccessful approach, especially when a simpler solution (returning the product) is available.\n\nThe principle of allowing returns in such cases is a common practice that balances consumer rights with the complexities of software licensing in modern technology products."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37060/is-consent-of-the-man-to-the-act-that-caused-a-pregnancy-necessary-to-establish", "docs_id": 37060, "title": "Is consent of the man to the act that caused a pregnancy necessary to establish legal parental obligations?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The question is a bit awkwardly phrased maybe, but what I'm wondering is this: if a woman gets pregnant without the consent of the man whose sperm it is (say by stealing it, or an accidental \"used the same bathwater\" kind of deal), is that enough to make the man legally responsible as a parent?

I found [this paper](https://lawpublications.barry.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=cflj) which has a lot more detail, but looking at some of the state Supreme Court cases it cites, the general opinion seems to be that even though the victim was a minor at the time and thus the sex was not legally consensual, because they felt personally that they were consenting they are still responsible for the consequences of the sex.

Cases like County of San Luis Obispo v. Nathaniel J. and State of Kansas, ex rel. v. Shane Seyer demonstrate that courts prioritize the child's right to support over the circumstances of conception.

Other provisions regulate evacuation, ventilation, heating, disabled access, etc.\n\nThere is no provision regarding when employees are permitted to use the restrooms. There can't be a single rule that works for every profession: some jobs don't let you leave your post whenever you like (e.g. machine operator, driver, guard, teacher, etc.).\n\nThe most common dispute regarding restroom use is whether employees should be paid during that time. Some employers want to count restroom use as unpaid pause time. Strictly speaking, that's legal: an employee who is in a restroom is not at the employer's disposal, therefore this doesn't count as work time. However enforcing this is often logistically difficult and wildly unpopular, so in practice it's only done in places where employees must clock out to reach a restroom.\n\nI could only find one case with actual jurisprudence. In 1995, an industrial butchering company (Bigard) decided to [limit restroom breaks to three fixed times a day](http://www.liberation.fr/economie/1995/08/09/greve-contre-le-pipi-a-heures-fixespause-pipi-a-8h05-11h20-et-14h05-c-est-le-reglement-chez-bigard_141877).

Your case is also slightly different in that the restrooms would only be inaccessible for an hour, which is shorter than in the Bigard case. So legally speaking, it isn't clear who will win. You'll have a better chance of success by banking on the unpopularity of the measure. Talk with your colleagues and your representatives and shop stewards.

It may not lawfully be used without the permission of the original copyright holder whoever that may be. Unless you can reliably determine who that is, and seek permission, you may not lawfully use that image, nor LaTeX code for it.\n\nOriginal SE Content\n-------------------\n\nWhen a user posts original contest to SE, it is automatically released under the CC\\-BY\\-SA (4\\.0\\) Creative Commons free license. That license allows anyone to reuse the content, and to create modified (derivative) versions of the content, but under some conditions. The most important of these are 1\\) that the content must be attributed properly to the copyright holder, and any copyright notice must be preserved. (That is the \"BY\" part.) And 2\\) the reused or modified work must be provided to others under exactly the same license. (That is the \"SA\" part.)\n\nThe first part can be done by listing the user name of the original SE poster, and providing a link to the post. The second part is potentially trickier. If the modified work is \"merged into\" a new work, the entire new work must be released under CC\\-BY\\-SA, which would hinder any commercial publication. If the re\\-used or modified work is kept separate, at the very least it needs to have a separate license statement, making it clear that anyone can re\\-use or further modify the work, and making it clear just what is included in that release. That should be associated with the credit or attribution statement mentioned above. That would apply both to an image, and to LaTex code for generating the image. If this is not done, reuse of any such content is an infringement of copyright, and could be the subject of a lawsuit.\n\nFair Use\n--------\n\nUse of the whole or the majority of an SE question or answer, or of the whole of an original image posted to SE, would probably not constitute fair use in the US, although that would depend on the rest of the facts.

According to the information provided, it is legal to include references and cite sources in an article, even if that article may generate income for the author. This is because facts, bibliographic information, and the act of referencing sources are not protected by copyright. The U.S. Copyright Law (17 USC 102(b)) explicitly states that copyright protection does not extend to ideas, facts, or discoveries.

Likewise under NJ law, except if authorized by state law, for medical marijuana production.\n\nUnder NJ's medical [marijuana law](ftp://www.njleg.state.nj.us/20082009/PL09/307_.HTM), \"alternative treatment centers\" grow and dispense medical marijuana, and there is no provision for mass\\-production growers (who don't distribute). Such a center is \"an organization approved by the department \\[of Health and Senior Services] to perform activities necessary to provide registered qualifying patients with usable marijuana and related paraphernalia in accordance with the provisions of this act\". The department accepts applications to operate such a center, and \"shall seek to ensure the availability of a sufficient number of alternative treatment centers throughout the State, pursuant to need, including at least two each in the northern, central, and southern regions of the State\" (they have to find a need for another center in a location, in order for one to get authorized; this is evaluated every 2 years).

According to [this article](http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/10/njs_5th_medical_marijuana_dispensary_to_open_thurs.html), there are a maximum of 6 centers to be opened, in Montclair, Egg Harbor Township, Woodbridge, Bellmawr, and Cranbury (existing), and Secaucus (under review).

It also says that the centers must be non\\-profit, though the law only requires the first two to be non\\-profit (though it could be a de facto requirement via the regulatory power of the Dept. of Health).

His property is divided into four equal shares (it would be five equal shares if B5 were alive or had any surviving descendants).\n\nThe first division consists of giving B1, B2, and B3 their share. That is, each one of them gets 1/4 of A' property. That accounts for 3/4 of A's property.\n\nThe remaining 1/4 of A's property cannot be given to B4 because B4 is dead. But it will be distributed among his children, which constitutes the second division, now B4 being called the Designated Ancestor.\n\nThe second division consists of dividing B4's share (which we may call \"B4's property\") into three equal shares because all B4's children are alive (C1 and C2\\) or have descendants (C3\\). Thus, C1 gets 1/3 of B4's property, and so does C2\\. C3's share (\"C3's property\") will be distributed among C3's descendants, which constitutes the third division with C3 as the Designated Ancestor.\n\nIn this third division, C3's share is divided into two (equal) halves.

According to the provided information, when an item is put up for auction without mentioning a reserve price, the sale is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion (usually by the fall of a hammer). In this case, the auctioneer accepted the bid and announced the sale as complete, forming a binding contract with Bidder X. The auction house's after-the-fact declaration of a reserve price has no bearing on the formation of the contract.

But that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be legal consequences.\n\nIt would be powerful evidence in a perjury prosecution (surely enough for a conviction even standing alone long after the trial is over but within the statute of limitations for perjury in the jurisdiction from the date of the sworn statement, if any), and would be a waiver of 5th Amendment rights against self\\-incrimination, generally, in the perjury case.\n\nIt might also be strong evidence (enough to convict standing alone) in a timely obstruction of justice prosecution. This statute of limitations could also run from the date of the sworn statement, or from the date of a false unsworn statement that caused a conviction to be reopened.\n\nIf the statement made in court was favorable to the prosecution, it might bring these charges after the conviction in the underlying case is final. But, the out of court statement would probably be grounds for the party benefitting from the original statement to seek a mistrial or to have a judgment set aside if the verdict or judgment is consistent with the sworn statement.\n\nIf the out of court statement was made before the trial was over, the witness could be recalled and the out of court statement could be used to impeach the in court statement.\n\nIt might constitute a probation or parole violation.\n\nIf the witness were testifying pursuant to a cooperation agreement, the out of court statement would probably breach the deal and deny the witness the benefit of the cooperation deal.\n\nThe out of court statement might constitute contempt of court if made while the proceeding in which the statement was made was still pending.\n\nDepending on the nature of the statement, the out of court statement might constitute defamation for which some one whose reputation was tarnished might sue for money damages. (There is immunity from civil liability for in court statements.)\n\nIt would violate the ethical rules of many professions. For example, an attorney would probably be disbarred for doing that. Arguably, in this situation, the statute of limitations could run from the later unsworn statement date rather than the date of the sworn statement.\n\nIf the witness is a state or federal government employee, this could lead to impeachment proceedings, in the state legislature, or Congress, respectively.\n\nThe aftermath of the Lewinsky Scandal (link below) involving Bill Clinton touches on many of these possibilities:\n\n> Further investigation led to charges of perjury and to the impeachment\n>  of President Clinton in 1998 by the U.S. House of Representatives.

Instead, the hard cases are the cases where there is strong evidence that the statement made in court, under oath was true. \n\nFor example, suppose Ted Cruz is asked in court: \"[Were you the Zodiac killer?](https://www.vox.com/2016/3/8/11179492/ted-cruz-zodiac-killer)\" (A crime ridiculously attributed to him despite the fact that it is something that happened when he was a small child who live many hundreds of miles away.) And he says, \"No\" in court, but then leaves the courtroom and says in a press conference on the court house steps: \"I am the Zodiac killer, I lied about that under oath in court today.\"\n\nSimilarly, suppose that a DNA test on [a certain blue dress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal) shows a perfect match to President Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton says under oath in court, that the substance tested came from him on a certain day, in a certain place, when a certain person was wearing it, in a certain way (also confirmed by a witness and surveillance video). Then, he leaves the courtroom and says in a press conference on the court house steps: \"Someone else was the source of that genetic material. I never met that person, and I was in Kenya on the day alleged and I've never set foot in the White House. I lied about all of this under oath in court today.\"\n\nIn these cases, there is no plausible way to make an obstruction of justice or perjury charge stick, or to upset a verdict or judgment consistent with the truthful sworn statement.\n\nContempt of court is still possible, as would professional ethics violations, but other consequences would be less obvious, because the act would come across more as absurd instead of something that genuinely confounds the truth. \n\nThe legal consequences associated with the conduct in the original post are mostly aimed at sanctioning genuinely fraudulent conduct.

It would indeed be absurd if the *legislative intent* (apropos of the subchapter's subtitle \"*Wildlife*\") sought to exclude domestic animals and protect wildlife only.\n\nThere might be additional, applicable statutes from that legislature.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A burglar breaks into a house and is confronted by the homeowner's large German Shepherd, which blocks the burglar's escape and begins to attack. The burglar shoots and kills the dog to escape. Under Michigan law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the burglar's legal liability for killing the dog?\n\nA) The burglar can claim self-defense against the dog and avoid criminal charges for its death.\nB) The burglar is only liable for property damage, as pets are considered personal property under the law.\nC) The burglar has committed an additional crime by killing the dog without just cause or the owner's consent.\nD) The burglar cannot be charged for killing the dog because Michigan animal protection laws only apply to wild animals, not domestic pets.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Michigan law (MCL 750.50b(2)(a)), it is prohibited to knowingly kill an animal without just cause. The act of committing burglary precludes the defendant from claiming just cause. Additionally, MCL 324.43103 states that a person shall not knowingly and willfully kill or injure any fur-bearing animal owned by another person without the owner's consent. The context of burglary clearly indicates lack of owner consent. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because self-defense cannot be claimed when the defendant is in the process of committing a crime. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while pets are often considered property, Michigan law specifically criminalizes the killing of animals owned by others without consent, beyond mere property damage.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because although some Michigan statutes define animals as \"wild birds and wild mammals,\" other sections (like MCL 324.43103) clearly intend to protect domestic animals as well."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81272/would-publicly-farting-on-a-picture-of-the-english-monarch-actually-qualify-as-t", "docs_id": 81272, "title": "Would publicly farting on a picture of the English monarch actually qualify as treason in 1798?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A famous political cartoon from 1798 by Richard Newton claims that farting on a picture of the British monarch would be prosecutable as \"TREASON!!!\" (caps and multiple exclamation marks in original).\n\n[![Image of Richard Newton's 1798 \"Treason\" political cartoon, in which Mr. Bull farts on a picture of the British king](https://i.stack.imgur.com/FZYgn.jpg)](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/P_1868-0808-6712)\n\nWould this act actually qualify as Treason under English law in 1798?\n\nAccording to the [Treason Act 1351](http://www.languageandlaw.org/TEXTS/STATS/TREASON.HTM), treason consists of:\n\n> ...when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our\n> lord the King, or of our lady his Queen or of their eldest son and heir; or if a\n> man do violate the King's companion,....or if a man do levy war against our\n> lord the King in his realm, or be adherent to the King's enemies in his realm,\n> giving to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere....\n\nFarting on someone's picture is not the same thing as compassing or imagining their death, violating their heirs or companion, or levying war against them.\n\nThe [Treason act 1702](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/AnnSt2/1/21/section/III) covers attempts to interfere with the royal line of succession, not disrespecting a picture.\n\nSo, is there any truth to this cartoon? To be clear, I'm not asking whether it was socially acceptable in England of the 1790's to publicly pass gas on someone's picture (nor whether it is acceptable to do so today), but whether it fit the legal definition of Treason under any statutory or common law offense that would have been in effect in 1798\\.\n\nMore specifically, either of the following scenarios seems plausible:\n\n* This was literally treason in 1798, and the cartoon's purpose is to point out the absurdity of treating toilet humor shenanigans as legally equivalent to murdering the king or waging grim war against him.\n* This was not actually treason, but the point of the cartoon was a warning against contemporary trends in expanding the scope of criminal offenses to cover unusual or non\\-obvious scenarios. In other words, this was an exaggeration to emphasize that criminal law was getting so ridiculously broad that farting on a picture might soon be prosecutable as a major offense if the cartoon's readers didn't start advocating for more narrow and sensible laws.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The cartoon may call back to events of 1795, where George III had stones thrown at him while he was on his way to the State Opening of Parliament. In response, the government \\- headed by Pitt the Younger, who is the man in the picture saying \"That is treason, Johnny\" \\- passed [\"An Act for the Safety and Preservation of His Majesty\u2019s Person and Government against Treasonable and Seditious Practices and Attempts\"](https://statutes.org.uk/site/the-statutes/eighteenth-century/1795-36-geo-3-c-7-treasonable-and-seditious-practices-act/), 36 Geo. 3 c.7\\. We now call it the Treason Act 1795\\. It was one of a series of Acts that suspended habeas corpus, banned political meetings, and so on, in the wake of the French Revolution.\n\nSection 1 deals with treason, at some length, but a fart probably doesn't count. The conditions are that somebody would:\n\n> within the Realm or without, compass, imagine, invent, devise, or intend Death or Destruction, or any bodily Harm tending to Death or Destruction, Maim or Wounding, Imprisonment or Restraint, of the Person of our same Sovereign Lord the King, his Heirs and Successors, or to deprive or depose him or them from the Style, Honour, or Kingly Name of the Imperial Crown of this Realm, or of any other of his Majesty\u2019s Dominions or Countries; or to levy War against his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, within his Realm, in order, by Force or Constraint, to compel him or them to change his or their Measures or Counsels, or in order to put any Force or Constraint upon, or to intimidate, or overawe, both Houses, or either House of Parliament; or to move or stir any Foreigner or Stranger with Force to invade this Realm, or any other of his Majesty\u2019s Dominions or Countries, under the Obeisance of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors; and such Compassings, Imaginations, Inventions, Devices, or Intentions, or any of them, shall express, utter, or declare, by publishing any Printing or Writing, or by any overt Act or Deed\n\nThe text is substantially preserved in the [Treason Felony Act 1848](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/11-12/12/contents), section 3\\. The 1795 Act also created a \"High Misdemeanour\" for anyone who\n\n> shall maliciously and advisedly, by Writing, Printing, Preaching, or other Speaking, express, publish, utter, or declare, any Words or Sentences to excite or stir up the People to hatred or Contempt of the Person of his Majesty, his Heirs or Successors, or the Government and Constitution of this Realm, as by Law established\n\nThis is closer to the fart; it is a l\u00e8se\\-majest\u00e9 provision aimed at general disrespect for the King. The provision was due to expire in 1798\\. I do not know the detailed timeline of its expiry and proposed renewal in relation to when the cartoon was published, but this is a plausible connection to why it was a live issue again.\n\nIn Scotland, but not England, there were common\\-law offences of sedition and \"leasing\\-making\" covering the same sort of idea. They were abolished [in 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2010/13/part/2/crossheading/abolition-of-offences-of-sedition-and-leasingmaking) but were long obsolete. Hume (*Commentaries on the Law of Scotland*, 1797\\) distinguishes between them by saying that leasing\\-making is solely verbal, a species of slander, whereas sedition is words or deeds \"for the purpose of producing public trouble or commotion, and moving His Majesty's subjects to the dislike, resistance, or subversion of the established government and laws, or settled frame and order of things.\"\n\nIn any event, the political cartoon is *satire* and does not necessarily represent a legal reality. It is mocking Pitt's heavy\\-handedness in the Act of 1795, and perhaps challenging the authorities to define this very cartoon as criminal. Newton's mentor, William Holland, had been imprisoned for seditious libel for publishing Thomas Paine's *Letter Addressed to the Addressers, on the Late Proclamation*. The proclamation in question was [the one of 1792 against seditious writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_Against_Seditious_Writings_and_Publications), also the work of Pitt, and aimed at Paine's *Rights of Man*, a work advocating for (among other things) freedom of the press and abolition of the monarchy.

The cartoon is most likely a satirical commentary on the broad and repressive nature of recent legislation, particularly the Treason Act 1795. This Act, while not explicitly making farting on the king's picture treasonous, did expand the definition of treasonable and seditious practices in response to political unrest. The cartoon exaggerates this expansion to the point of absurdity, suggesting that even such a trivial act could be construed as treason under the new laws.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Treason Act of 1351 did not cover such acts, focusing instead on more serious offenses against the monarch.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the Treason Act 1795 did broaden the definition of treason, it did not explicitly mention disrespecting the monarch's image in this manner.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because laws against l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 had not been abolished in England at this time.

In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification.\n\nThis is amplified by [Recital 57](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-57/) which says:\n\n> If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights.

They might be used in cross\\-examination to point out testimony that is inconsistent with what the parties have agreed and so cast doubt on the credibility of the witness.\n\nContested facts are, by definition, not agreed upon. Assuming the CCTV footage is admitted as evidence, it may be contested who the people in the images actually are or when the footage was actually shot or that the footage has been subsequently edited \\- such contested facts are perfectly legitimate matters to seek evidence on. \n\nThe lawyer doesn't know the facts \\- they only know what they have been told. It's likely that they have been told many conflicting things. Ask any group of 6 people what was decided in a meeting that concluded 20 minutes ago and you are likely to get 7 different answers. It's not that people are liars (although they sometimes are) is just that memory is not a hard drive, immutable and unchanging. Every time you access your memory you change it, overlaying the circumstances of each recollection onto it. Now imagine that there is some strong incentive on you for your memory of an event 18 months ago to be a certain way \\- say not going to jail or a lawsuit worth millions of dollars \\- this colors your memory. People remember things the way they wish they were rather than the way they actually were \\- this is not intentional (mostly).\n\nThe purpose of testimony is for these conflicting things to be tested \\- to be presented to the trier of fact so that they can decide which witnesses they believe and which they don't and draw their own conclusions as to what the facts (legally) are which may and often does differ materially from what each witness believes the facts are or even what the facts objectively are (presuming there is such a thing as an objective fact \\- law is not science; its a lot closer to history as an academic discipline).\n\nLegal Limitations\n-----------------\n\nIn addition, there are strict limits on what is and is not allowed in cross\\-examination and the opposition council is very aware of what they are and will be very pro\\-active in requesting the judge enforce them by making an objection. A cross\\-examiner cannot lead (\"At 8 pm that day, you were at the deli, correct?\"), ask compound questions (\u201cDid you determine the time of death by interviewing witnesses and by requesting the autopsy report written by the coroner?\u201d), ask for a narrative, be argumentative (\u201cDid you stop at the stop sign on 5th and Main?\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d, \u201cSo, to be clear, you ran the stop sign?\u201d) or be vague (\u201cWhen did you see it happen?\u201d). However, if opposing counsel doesn't object the witness must answer.\n\nTactical Limitations\n--------------------\n\nNobody likes a bully. Overly aggressive cross\\-examination can be counterproductive and endear the witness to the fact\\-finder and make you look like a d^\\&k.\n\nEthics\n------\n\nA lawers ethical duty is not to the facts or, heaven forbid some notion of \"truth\", it is to present their evidence and to test their opponent's evidence so that their client's narrative (a non\\-fiction narrative) prevails.\n\nIn a civil case, that means showing that your version of the events is more likely than your opponents (balance of probabilities). In a criminal case, it means that the prosecutor must demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that *all* elements of the charge were perpetrated for a defendant \\- for a criminal defense lawyer, it means demonstrating that there is reasonable doubt in at least one of those elements.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that only contested matters go to trial \\- settlement, mediation, arbitration and plea bargains are far more common \\- and only the contested facts are the subject of cross\\-examination. Particularly in a civil trial, an agreed statement of facts is prepared to identify what's agreed and what's contested and evidence is only sought about the contested matters.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the legal principles outlined, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding a lawyer's conduct during cross-examination?\n\nA) A lawyer should only ask questions based on absolute truth and avoid any questioning that might challenge CCTV evidence.\n\nB) A lawyer is ethically bound to present only facts that are favorable to their client and suppress any conflicting evidence.\n\nC) A lawyer can aggressively question witnesses without restriction, as long as it serves their client's interests.\n\nD) A lawyer's duty is to present their client's narrative and test the opposing evidence, while adhering to legal and tactical limitations in questioning.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The passage emphasizes that a lawyer's ethical duty is to present their client's narrative and test the opposing evidence, not to determine absolute truth. There are legal limitations on questioning (such as not leading or being argumentative) and tactical considerations (like avoiding appearing bullying).

The plea of res judicata applies, except in special cases, not only to points upon which the Court was actually required by the parties to form an opinion and pronounce a judgment, but to every point which properly belonged to the subject of litigation, and which the parties, exercising reasonable diligence, might have brought forward at the time.\n\nA more recent statement of the law appears in *Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd v Zodiac Seats UK Ltd* \\[2014] AC 160; [\\[2013] UKSC 46](https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2010-0013-judgment.pdf):\n\n> Res judicata is a portmanteau term which is used to describe a number of different legal principles with different juridical origins.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice under GDPR?\n\nA) This practice is always legal under GDPR as long as the user grants permission to access their contacts.\n\nB) This practice is illegal under GDPR regardless of any privacy policy or user consent.\n\nC) This practice may be legal under GDPR if the app's privacy policy clearly states that names may be shared with other users who have matching phone numbers, and if users have given consent for such distribution.\n\nD) This practice is legal under GDPR only if the app uses the exact names stored in the user's phone contacts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of this practice under GDPR depends on the app's privacy policy and user consent. If the privacy policy explicitly states that names may be shared with other users who have matching phone numbers, and if users have given informed consent for such distribution, the practice may be compliant with GDPR. The key factors are transparency in the privacy policy and obtaining proper user consent for the specific data processing and sharing activities.

If the state in question does not have a \"stop and identify\" law, am I required to provide identification if being detained on a university sidewalk?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have two questions going here. One is \"are sidewalks on (state) universities public property\", and the other is \"when do I have to provide identification in a state with no stop and identify law\". I will focus on the second question. As it happens, property ownership is not relevant to that determination. The universal fact is that only a peace officer (variously identified) can force you to identify yourself, no matter where you are. In [Ohio](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2921.29), which has such a law, the law requires you to give name, DOB and address if they suspect you and you are in a public place. Being in Kroger is being in a public place, even though Kroger is private property. [Alabama](http://law.justia.com/codes/alabama/2006/14214/15-5-30.html) likewise allows officers to stop and question a suspect in a public place. [Arizona](http://www.azleg.gov/FormatDocument.asp?inDoc=/ars/13/02412.htm&Title=13&DocType=ARS) doesn't even limit the requirement to \"public places\". In [Illinois](http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/opinions/AppellateCourt/2011/2ndDistrict/December/2100473.pdf), you will not be convicted of obstructing. That is because 725 ILCS 5/107\\-14 a peace officer \"may stop any person in a public place\" and \"may demand the name and address of the person and an explanation of his actions\". However, they forgot to include a part where the suspect has to answer in the statute. As far as I know, Washington state has no law allowing such questioning and again as far as I know you can refuse to respond. So: if you are a suspect, and the state has no stop and identify law, they cannot require you to identify yourself, and then in some states, you would even need to be in a public place.\n\nAnd then there is [Arkansas](http://law.justia.com/codes/arkansas/2010/title-5/subtitle-6/chapter-71/subchapter-2/5-71-213), where it looks like failure to identify can be taken as evidence of loitering (one would have to read the Arkansas case law to see if it's really that bad).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a state without a \"stop and identify\" law, a university police officer stops a student on a campus sidewalk and demands identification.

The ownership status of the property (public or private) is not relevant to this determination. The universal principle is that only a peace officer can force identification, and this is only in states with specific laws requiring it. Since the question specifies a state without such a law, the student would not be obligated to provide identification, regardless of their location on campus or suspicion of criminal activity. Options A, C, and D introduce factors (property ownership, suspicion of crime, and definition of \"public place\") that are not relevant in a state without a stop and identify law."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36822/i-have-doubts-about-the-github-licensing-issue", "docs_id": 36822, "title": "I have doubts about the Github licensing issue", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I will go straight to the point, I already read the terms I looked for some information on the issue of licenses I looked at sites but nothing, I did not understand anything is that I have a project that is totally done by me, but I want anyone who dares to share or do something to dump the credits on me, what license do I use for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Given the broadest interpretation of your question, the MIT License is the simplest license that would meet your stated requirements.

It's a simple, permissive license that allows others to use, modify, and distribute the project while still requiring attribution to the original creator. This aligns with the developer's desire for credit while allowing the project to be shared.\n\nOption A is too restrictive and doesn't allow for any sharing. Option C, while potentially meeting the developer's needs, is more complex and may discourage use. Option D provides no protection for attribution.
