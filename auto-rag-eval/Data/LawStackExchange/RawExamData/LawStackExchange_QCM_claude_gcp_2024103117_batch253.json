The charge is\n\n> The accused engaged in a course of conduct, giving offensive material to the victim or any other person or leaving it where it will be found by, given to or brought to the attention of, the victim or the other person to intentionally cause physical or mental harm to the victim, including self\\-harm or to arouse apprehension or fear in the victim for his or her own safety or that of any other person.\n\nThe \"offense\" has happened only one time.

According to the information provided, while stalking typically involves a \"course of conduct\" implying repeated behavior, the interpretation can vary based on the specific nature of the act. A single instance of certain behaviors (like following someone) could potentially be considered stalking if it's severe enough to cause fear or apprehension. The law allows for some flexibility in interpretation, and the impact on the victim is a crucial factor. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while multiple occurrences are common in stalking cases, it's not an absolute requirement in all instances. \n\nOption B is too absolute; not every single instance of following someone would necessarily constitute stalking.\n\nOption D is incorrect as stalking doesn't require physical harm; mental harm or arousing apprehension or fear is sufficient under the law.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuances in stalking laws and the importance of considering the specific circumstances of each case."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31131/can-a-good-lawyer-mitigate-a-failure-to-prevent-data-breaches", "docs_id": 31131, "title": "Can a good lawyer mitigate a failure to prevent data breaches?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was curious how important it is for a software startup to seek legal council during the fundraising/growth stages.

Auto\\-tune songs are often examples of these kinds of songs. If it is legal, is one allowed to credit the song partially to the celebrity?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A legal recording could be with consent or without, depending on the state you are in. If the person speaking is speaking publically, consent is irrelevant; if they are having a private conversation with you, then it depends on the state. In about 20% of states including California, all parties have to consent, otherwise just one party has to consent. Assume this happens in California, which has the most restrictive rules. So for the recording to be legal, the person must be informed that they are being recorded (if they continue to talk having been informed, that is implied consent). That is just about legality of recording.\n\nAdditionally, there is a property right (in California), \"personality rights\", which limits ability to exploit another persons image etc. [California Civil Code section 3344](http://codes.findlaw.com/ca/civil-code/civ-sect-3344.html) prohibits using name, the voice, signature, photograph, or likeness of another, either in a product or in advertising (but not \"news\" type purposes), without their prior consent, and violating that law could lead to a hefty damages award. Consent to record is not the same as consent to exploit, so if you ask Tom Cruise in a private conversation \"can I record you?\", that does not constitute consent to exploit his personality.\n\nThere is an open question as to whether a First Amendment argument can overcome. In [Nussenzweig v DiCorcia](http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2006/2006_50171.htm), a case in New York, the suit was over an analogous photographic exploitation. In that case, there was a debate over whether the use of the photograph constituted \"art\" or \"trade\", and the photographee lost on First Amendment grounds. In this case, a person's photograph was used (without consent) in an art collection which was sold, but the court held that the right to artistic expression trumps the requirement for consent. However, the court also recognized that states differ in art standards, citing \n[Comedy II Publications, Inc. v. Gary Saderup, Inc.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/copyright/cases/25_Cal4th_387.htm), 25 Cal 4th 387, a case in California. The crucial difference between New York and California is that in California, art is \"transformative\" and not just \"duplicative\" likeness. The court formulates\n\n> a balancing test between the First Amendment and the right of\n>  publicity based on whether the work in question adds significant\n>  creative elements so as to be transformed into something more than a\n>  mere celebrity likeness or imitation\n\nand states that\n\n> What the right of publicity holder possesses is not a right of\n>  censorship, but a right to prevent others from misappropriating the\n>  economic value generated by the celebrity's fame through the\n>  merchandising of the \"name, voice, signature, photograph or likeness\"\n>  of the celebrity.\n\nSo, potentially there is a First Amendment defense of such a use.\n\n\"Crediting\" the speaker might be seen as a false endorsement of a product, and one could run afoul of the Lanham Act, [15 USC 1051](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1051). The issue would be whether one could reasonably infer that the subject had in some form endorsed or given consent to such a usage, and a statement like \"We thank Tom Cruise for his voice snippets\" could easily give such an impression. A statement like \"Snippets of Tom Cruise's voice were obtained by recording at a public rally in Winnemucca\" is less likely to imply endorsement; if there are hundreds of such credit\\-attributions in the work, the impression of consented endorsement is lessened and the impression of \"harvesting\" is increased.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A musician records a conversation with a famous actor in California without informing them, then uses short snippets of the actor's voice in a song.

However, crediting the actor without permission could still be problematic.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because it accurately reflects the complexities of the situation:\n\n1. The recording is illegal in California without informing the actor, as California requires all-party consent for recordings.\n\n2. Using snippets in a song might be legal if the work is considered \"transformative\" enough under California law, which balances First Amendment rights with personality rights.\n\n3. Crediting the actor without permission could still be problematic, as it might imply endorsement and violate the Lanham Act.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the recording is illegal without consent in California.

M's actions appear to be prohibited discrimination under all of these statutes, even though A ultimately did not lose her job. M's actions are not merely an attempt at prohibited discrimination; they *are* prohibted discrimination. Whether M's actions and a connection to a \"prohibited ground of discrimination\" can be proven is a separate issue.\n\nFor example, under the Canadian Human Rights Act, it is a \"discriminatory practice\" to \"harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination\" \"in matters related to employment.\" Under the Ontario Human Rights Code, \"Every person who is an employee has a right to freedom from harassment in the workplace... because of ... disability.\"\n\nThe [Canadian Human Rights Tribunal](https://www.chrt-tcdp.gc.ca/resources/guide-to-understanding-the-chrt-en.html) says (and I've highlighted a couple of the remedies that seem particuarly relevant to your hypothetical):\n\n> If the Tribunal finds that a complaint of discrimination is eatablished, it can make an order against the person who engaged in the discriminatory practice.

Plaintiffs have alleged grossly negligent or reckless conduct, and defendants have not established that dismissal of these contentions is warranted as a matter of law. \\[...] It is certainly possible that defendants' conduct was at the very least grossly negligent\u2014possibly even fraudulent\u2014and that defendants could have prevented the Parettas from having a baby with cystic fibrosis. There is evidence that defendants may have known that the egg donor was a cystic fibrosis carrier; yet, they failed to inform the Parettas or test Mr. Paretta's sperm to assess whether he too was a carrier. Had the Parettas been informed of the potential for cystic fibrosis they themselves may have chosen to have Mr. Paretta tested or may have altogether opted on using a different egg donor.\n\nThis is the template of a negligence tort for the hypothetical that you present. I know you've asked about the U.K., but this specific area isn't well enough developed in either country.\n\nHere are two articles exploring this issue in depth:\n\n* Suriya E.P.

Sarah has decided to become an egg donor. Dr. Smith proceeds with the donation process without informing the egg recipient about Sarah's carrier status. The recipient later gives birth to a child with cystic fibrosis. Based on the case law and legal principles discussed, what is the most likely outcome if the recipient sues Dr. Smith?\n\nA) Dr. Smith cannot be held liable because doctor-patient confidentiality prevented him from disclosing Sarah's genetic information.\nB) Dr. Smith can only be held liable for compensatory damages, not punitive damages, as this was an unintentional oversight.\nC) Dr. Smith can potentially be held liable for both compensatory and punitive damages due to his failure to inform the recipient of the known genetic risk.\nD) Dr. Smith has no liability because genetic screening of egg donors is not a legal requirement in fertility treatments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Based on the case law presented in Paretta v. Medical Offices for Human Reproduction, Dr. Smith can potentially be held liable for both compensatory and punitive damages. The court in that case declined to dismiss claims for punitive damages, stating that the doctor's conduct could be considered \"grossly negligent or reckless.\" Dr. Smith's failure to inform the egg recipient about the known genetic risk (Sarah being a carrier of cystic fibrosis) is similar to the situation in the Paretta case. The court suggested that had the recipients been informed, they might have chosen a different donor or conducted additional testing. Therefore, Dr. Smith's actions could be seen as negligent or even fraudulent, potentially exposing him to both compensatory and punitive damages."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56027/how-to-do-court-admissible-dna-testing-when-both-parties-live-far-apart", "docs_id": 56027, "title": "How to do court admissible DNA testing when both parties live far apart?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose two people are located in the United States and they wish to prove they are related through DNA testing.\n\nThey want the test results to be admissible in court so they must use certified labs with chain of custody (rather than Ancestry.com or similar).\n\nAlso suppose the two people live 1500 miles apart, so it is not easy for them to both go to the same test facility.\n\nIs it common to gather the DNA samples at two separate test labs and have one of the labs either send the raw sample or the results to the other lab to generate the report? Or is there some other method commonly used that preserves chain of custody? In other words, how would a court normally specify this be done?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally, the courts don't care about who is genetically related to who, but establishing paternity is a special case. The specifics are governed by state law, here is what Washington does. Under the [Uniform Parentage Act](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.26A&full=true#26.26A.300), when there is a legal dispute as to parentage (\"is X a parent of Y?\")\nand X either volunteers for genetic testing, or is tested under order of the court or a child support agency, then the courts and the law gets involved in genetic testing. Testing cannot be used to challenge the parentage of an individual legally established to be a parent in other ways, or to establish the parentage of a donor. There are prerequisites to the court ordering a test,\nfor example a party may make a sworn statement that there is a reasonable possibility that X is the child's genetic parent, or swears that it's reasonable that the person is not a genetic parent.\n\nAssuming the court issues an order, then [RCW 26\\.26A.315](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.26A.315) governs the procedures for the testing. As for the qualifications of the lab and test, the requirement is that\n\n> (1\\) Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied on by experts\n> in the field of genetic testing and performed in a testing laboratory\n> accredited by: (a) The AABB, formerly known as the American\n> association of blood banks, or a successor to its functions; or (b) An\n> accrediting body designated by the secretary of the United States\n> department of health and human services.\n\nand the sample requirements are\n\n> (2\\) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of a sample or a\n> combination of samples of blood, buccal cells, bone, hair, or other\n> body tissue or fluid. The specimen used in the testing need not be of\n> the same kind for each individual undergoing genetic testing.\n\nThen there are procedures regarding resolution of disputes of ethnic parameters for computing the relationship index, including changing labs.\n\nNothing in the law itself states how the samples are to be processed: that is implicit in the accreditation requirements of AABB, and to be legally admissible, chain of custody protocols must be observed for collecting and processing. Chain of custody is a general requirement for evidence and there isn't anything special about genetic testing, [see here](https://projects.nfstc.org/property_crimes/module03/pro_m03_t17.htm) for an overview and [here](https://blog.specialcounsel.com/ediscovery/how-to-document-your-chain-of-custody-and-why-its-important/) for some nuances (e.g. the importance of having technically\\-competent and accurately\\-documented collection of samples).

I can't really do better to demonstrate than to cite a few articles on the subject.\n\n[According to Alex Buonassisi and Jennifer Marles of IP law firm Oyen Wiggs](https://patentable.com/can-stream-way-around-copyright-infringement-canada/):\n\n> \\[...] it is not entirely clear that receiving an unauthorized stream of a copyrighted work in Canada does not infringe copyright. At best, this activity could be said to fall within a grey zone.\n\n[According to Sandy Kang writing for law school blog IP Osgoode](https://www.iposgoode.ca/2015/04/notice-and-notice-and-video-streaming-are-you-breaking-bad/):\n\n> As for users of such websites, it is currently uncertain whether their act of streaming video would be found to infringe.\n\n[According to Michael Geist](http://www.michaelgeist.ca/2015/01/stream-canadian-law-views-online-streaming-video/), a University of Ottawa law professor specializing in IP:\n\n> The most controversial sources are unauthorized streaming websites that offer free content without permission of the rights holder. \\[...] Those accessing the streams are unlikely to be infringing copyright, however.\n\nAs you can see, there is a variety of expert opinions on whether streaming pirated movies is an infringement. The section under debate is [30\\.71](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-42/page-14.html#h-41) on temporary reproductions, especially subsection (b):\n\n> It is not an infringement of copyright to make a reproduction of a work or other subject\\-matter if\n> \n> \n> (a) the reproduction forms an essential part of a technological process;\n> \n> \n> (b) the reproduction\u2019s only purpose is to facilitate a use that is not an infringement of copyright; and\n> \n> \n> (c) the reproduction exists only for the duration of the technological process.\n\n---\n\nI don't want to duplicate what articles above have already stated, but I'd like to dive deeper into [Bishop v. Stevens, \\[1990] 2 S.C.R. 467](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1990/1990canlii75/1990canlii75.html), cited by the first two articles as a similar case ([reaffirmed in 2015](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2015/2015scc57/2015scc57.html?resultIndex=1) after a few rounds of statute amendments). In it the Supreme Court held that prerecorded \"ephemeral\" copies used to facilitate a broadcast was an infringement.\n\nThe key piece of reasoning is: \n\n> \\[... the broadcaster] has not established that, at the time of their enactment, the sections of the Act providing for the right to broadcast a performance must have been understood to include the right to prerecord. Even now it remains fully possible, and quite common, to broadcast live performances.\n\nTo me, there are two key differences why this logic might not directly transpose to the streaming pirated movies situation:\n\n1. \"Ephemeral\" prerecorded copies aren't necessarily \"temporary\" copies within the scope of section 30\\.71 above, particularly subsections (a) and (c) might not strictly be met.\n2. This case discusses the point of view of the *broadcaster* which is analogous to the *hoster*, not the end\\-user. While making ephemeral/temporary copies might not be strictly necessary for broadcasting, viewing online content necessarily creates at least a temporary copy on the end\\-user's computer.\n\n---\n\nTwo other random notes:\n\n1. None of the involved sections have a \"reasonableness\" or \"should have known\" clause whereas they are present in other parts of the Copyright Act. This means whether its legal should theoretically depend strictly on the facts (i.e. if it turns out to be illegal, pleading \"oh I didn't know it was pirated\" won't work).\n2.

The service provider is not legally required to waive early termination fees, but they have the option to do so. The child with Power of Attorney doesn't have the authority to unilaterally decide not to pay contractual fees.

For example, a Braile transcription is rather easily *in* that exception, as it is almost illegible for the vast majority of seeing people, and only needs to come in a box that has the needed stickers of the original copyright and that one may not copy or re\\-convert.\n\nAnother thing that this applies to is *phonorecords*. These are physical items that carry audio in a way that it can be reproduced by a machine. Typically in these days those are CDs, Cassettes, or Vinyl, but in the past, [Reel\\-to\\-Reel magnetic tape](https://youtu.be/5KHSz9Gi-II), [shellac](https://youtu.be/6YF1w77mbec?t=172) (there's a sound difference to Vinyl), [wax cylinders](https://youtu.be/4wtifAGsV3k) and even [Punchcards](https://youtu.be/399UPZVki1Q) have been used as phonorecords. It's unclear if a flash drive could be a phonorecord, but I tend towards \"no, unless it is a Read\\-Only\\-Memory\".\n\nAs you observed, that exception **only** provides for phonorecords and copies, not the actual audio or digital files. This might be an old remnant, but it requires that a copy for the disabled has a physical manifestation that may not be copied again and only is to be given to eligible people. A file on a computer does not satisfy these rules. The Radio program for the disabled uses a *different* exception.\n\nSo for a textbook with audio to comply, it has to come in a physical manner and with the files on a labeled phonorecord that contains the prescribed labeling for \"Do not copy\" and the original copyright.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: Under 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 121, which of the following would be considered a permissible reproduction for blind or other people with disabilities without infringing copyright?\n\nA) A digital audio file of a novel, distributed via email to visually impaired individuals\nB) A Braille transcription of a published book, distributed in physical form with appropriate copyright notices\nC) A commercial audiobook, shared on a website accessible only to registered blind users\nD) A text-to-speech version of a newspaper article, streamed online for hearing-impaired listeners\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is correct because it meets the requirements of 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 121. A Braille transcription is a physical copy of a previously published literary work, produced in an accessible format exclusively for use by eligible persons (blind individuals).

understanding\u201d because \u201cone room, two lawyers, three opinions\u201d.\nNevertheless, let me show you *a* legal opinion addressing some issues and demonstrating the mechanics of a criminal case.\n\nGerman law distinguishes between judgmental statements (\u201cYou\u2019re a fat pig!\u201d) and factual claims (\u201cBaker X uses cockroaches for her bread.\u201d).\nWith respect to MFW\u2019s original question, doing the latter toward third parties, like on a social media site, could qualify as defamation, a *separate* criminal offense.\nAt any rate (and considering the

activities ensuring the furtherance of the crime\u2019s success.\n\tOM does not operate Foobar or its webservers, but necessarily composed and initiated publication of the post.\n\tHowever, due to the website being accessible *globally* via the world wide web, it is not automatically established OM was in Germany during his/her actions.  \n\n\tNevertheless, much like a person throwing a rock across the border, applicability of German penal law is still indicated via \u00a7 3 StGB if the purpose of the crime in question is to protect *domestic* interests.\n\tIn the present case, \u00a7 185 intends to protect, among other things, the individual interest *honor* of people in Germany.\n\tSince DW regularly stays on German territory, her honor is at risk and must therefore be protected by the German state.\n\tHence applicability of German penal law is found, regardless where OM specifically was at the time of her/his actions.  \n\n\t(Further reading: BGHSt 46, 212\\)\n\t2. elements of

animal.\n\t\t\tAnimals are considered inferior to humans.\n\t\t\tIn particular, the choice \u201cpig\u201d is associated in many cultures as an \u201cunclean\u201d animal.\n\t\t\tFurthermore, the adjective \u201cfat\u201d implies a certain immobility, another bad quality.\n\t\t\tThus OM expressed contempt or disrespect of DW.  \n\n\t\t\tHowever, since OM wrote his/her post in English it could be the case DW did not understand any of that.\n\t\t\tAn insult \u201cthrough\u201d a translator or interpreter cannot be attributed to the perpetrator anymore.\n\t\t\tTherefore it is necessary, the addressed person has at least a basic understanding of the language and/or script used.\n\t\t\tIn the present case, DW has an MD obtained in Germany.\n\t\t\tShe is sufficiently capable of directly understanding the disrespectful contents at hand.\n\t\t\t3. factual attribution  \n\n\t\t\tMoreover, the act can be attributed toward OM.\n\t\t2. mental elements of the offense  \n\n\t\tUnless otherwise stated all crimes must be committed with intent, \u00a7 15 StGB.\n\t\tIntention is the wish to effect the physical elements of the offense knowing all circumstances of the crime.\n\t\tOM deliberately posted the insult, or at least was consciously accepting the risk to insult and therefore acted with criminal intent.\n\t\t3. intermediate conclusion  \n\n\t\tBy posting \u201cDoctor Who is a fat pig.\u201d on the social media website Foobar OM has committed the crime of an insult.\n\t3. unlawfulness  \n\n\tThe elements of the offense indicate unlawfulness, unless the offense was warranted.\n\t\t1. vindicatory consent  \n\n\t\tProtection of *honor* as a disposable interest can be relinquished, yet in the present case DW did not expressly agree to being insulted, and the Terms of Service of Foobar DW agreed to actually forbid hate speech in general.\n\t\t2. presumed vindicatory consent  \n\n\t\tWithout express consent and DW agreeing to Foobar\u2019s ToS, it could be the case DW\u2019s honor was no interest warranting protection.\n\t\tDW\u2019s post OM responded to might have been provocative or unethical, yet she did not give reason to believe that she did not care about her honor, e.\u202fg. by insulting someone else, and in particular not OM him\u2011/her\u2011self, \u00a7\u00a0199\u00a0StGB.\n\t\t3. protection of legitimate interests  \n\n\t\tOM\u2019s post could have been done to safeguard legitimate interests, \u00a7\u00a0193\u00a0StGB.\n\t\tCritical opinions about scientific, artistic or commercial achievements are allowed if an insult as a matter of form and content or the circumstances do not show the sole intent to insult.\n\t\tDW expressed an opinion in a public venue like Foobar certainly with the intent to initiate debate, yet OM\u2019s post primarily shows disrespect toward DW, without expressing criticism to her post.\n\t\tTherefore OM\u2019s post has not been done to safeguard legitimate interests.\n\t\t4. intermediate conclusion  \n\n\t\tOM\u2019s act was unlawful.\n\t4. guilt  \n\n\tAn unlawful act fulfilling all elements of the offense indicates guilt, thus OM is considered is guilty.\n\t5. sentence considerations  \n\n\tSince the insult happened through dissemination of materials, the permissible sentence is up to two years of imprisonment or a fine.\n\tThe court recognizes following considerations:\n\t\t* The brevity and ordinary nature of the insult.\n\t\t* OM\u2019s rap sheet, queried on 2022\u201102\u201126, is empty.\n\t\t* OM and DW are not related.\n\t\t* OM has not apologized to DW.\n\t6. conclusion  \n\n\tBy posting \u201cDoctor Who is a fat pig.\u201d on the social media site Foobar OM is guilty of unlawfully insulting DW.\n2. **criminal prosecution requirements**  \n\nProsecution of an insult is only possible if a criminal complaint was submitted, \u00a7\u00a0194\u00a0\u2160\u00a01\u00a0StGB.\nWhen DW reported the offense to the Police of Lower Saxony on 2022\u201101\u201110, she initiated a provisional criminal complaint.\nAs she is the subject of the insult, she is entitled to initiate such, \u00a7\u00a077\u00a0\u2160\u00a0StGB.\nThe 3\u2011month\\-submission deadline was met, \u00a7\u00a077b\u00a0StGB.\n3. **criminal prosecution obstacles**  \n\nThe statute of limitations grants a five\\-year limitation period, \u00a7\u00a078\u00a0StGB, so there are no obstacles.\n4. **conclusion**  \n\nOM is sentenced to a fine of thirty daily units.\nSince OM refused to disclose their economic situation, an estimated monthly net income of three thousand euros is presumed, thus a daily unit amounts to one hundred euros.  \n\nConsidering OM\u2019s guilt, \u00a7\u00a046\u00a0\u2160\u00a01\u00a0StGB, imprisonment, especially more than six months, \u00a7\u00a047\u00a0\u2160\u00a0StGB, was not indicated.\n\nafterthought\n------------\n\n* The \u201cdissemination through materials\u201d qualification is a recent addition, Federal Gazette 2021 \u2160 page 441, article 1, number 6\\.\nIt was meant to take effect on July 1, 2021 (article 10, subsection 1\\), but came into effect early on April 3, 2021, FG 2021 page 474\\.\nIf you insulted someone on or before April 2, 2021, the maximum sentence is one year imprisonment or a fine, \u00a7 2 \u2160 StGB.\n* Considering this, I should probably *double* the fine.\n30 daily units, give or take, *was* standard for a \u201cnormal\u201d insult before the change.\n* Maybe interesting, but the insulted does not need to \u201cfeel\u201d insulted.\nNevertheless, only the addressed person(s) can file a complaint, \u00a7\u00a077\u00a0\u2160\u00a0StGB.\n* Initiating a criminal complaint could be unnecessary if you are \u201cinsulting\u201d a public figure, \u00a7\u00a0188\u00a0StGB, if the DA thinks it\u2019s of public interest, \u00a7\u00a0194\u00a0\u2160\u00a03\u00a0StGB, or if the insult\u2019s content refers to persecution of people in the Third Reich or similar regimes,

Option C directly violates this law because the man is participating in a ceremony to enter into a marriage-like relationship with a second person while already being legally married. This falls under the clause that prohibits celebrating or being party to a rite or ceremony that sanctions a polygamous relationship, regardless of whether it's legally recognized.

I am generally familiar with the routes by which one enters each profession.\n\nIt isn't clear to me, however, how the lines are drawn between the two professions in the context of civil litigation.\n\nFor example, suppose that you have a medium sized business (e.g. 100 employees and several business locations with no in house counsel) with a regular outside solicitor or firm of solicitors that it employs.\n\nSuppose that business gets into a serious business dispute with another business, e.g. a joint venture gone bad with related accounting and trademark issues involving hundreds of thousands to million of pounds in controversy economically. (The example is from a case I handled in the U.S. allowing me to compare it, but any serious civil dispute could do. I limit the question to serious civil disputes because I understand that solicitors can handle civil litigation in some minor civil litigation.)\n\nAt what point in time is there a transition from a solicitor to a barrister? \n\nWhen would a client start with a barrister in the first place? \n\nWhat kind of legal professional (barrister or solicitor) would represent a client in an arbitration or mediation proceeding in which no court case has been opened?\n\nWould a medium sized business in the example above that gets into lawsuits once every year or two typically have a regular barrister (or firm of barristers) that they would use, or would this choice usually be made on a case by case basis?\n\nAlso, please feel to correct any of my assumptions if they are incorrect.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Barristers are advocates, and their other roles fall out of that core role. I think of it this way: your solicitor takes care of your legal risk; your barrister is the 'big gun' you bring in for specific important legal advice and to represent you in person.\n\nI'll give you my experience from the perspective of working in a large government agency. For us, 'barrister' often equates to 'Queen's Counsel' (now called 'Senior Counsel'), which is a particularly senior barrister. \n\nI am also speaking from Australia. We have the same split profession as the UK, but there are probably differences.\n\nYou generally don't stop using a solicitor and start using a barrister. Rather, you have a solicitor the whole way through and then you engage a barrister through your solicitor.\n\nYou can engage a barrister directly, e.g. if you have in\\-house counsel, but it is not common to do so. Even if you have in\\-house counsel, you will usually engage more specialised external solicitors to handle litigation.\n\nThe barrister's role is generally to (1\\) provide advice on specific issues (after the solicitors have sifted the evidence and provided a brief to the barrister) including advising on your prospects in particular litigation and (2\\) represent you in court i.e. write submissions and speak to the court.\n\nIt is not uncommon to have a barristers represent you in proceedings other than a trial (if you have the financial resources to afford a barrister). For example, a barrister may represent you in mediation or may accompany you to an examination by some regulatory authority. (Furthermore, a regulatory authority may even hire a barrister to question you, since barristers are often good at that based on their in\\-court role; or you and the party you are having a dispute with might appoint a barrister as the arbitrator or mediator.)\n\nYou may have a barrister you prefer to use; more likely, however, your solicitor would know barristers and would recommend an appropriate one. Barristers are specialised so you would use a different barrister for a tax dispute, contractual dispute, employee dispute, etc. An organisation large enough to sustain constant legal disputes would have a number of barristers that it would go to as and when they were needed, on the basis of their particular skills and availability.\n\nThere is no such thing as a firm of barristers. Each barrister is independent. A barrister's office will be in 'chambers', which is an organisation that leases office space and hires clerks to manage member barristers' business. But the barristers in a chambers are not in business together as members of a firm of solicitors are. Barristers are proud of their independence, and they all want to be appointed as judges so they have to appear impartial.\n\nTo further illustrate how you might use a barrister: sometimes you get legal advice from a barrister and you cannot read the advice. You can see the words but it's gibberish. Your solicitor will interpret it for you.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the English legal system, which of the following statements most accurately describes the relationship between solicitors and barristers in civil litigation?\n\nA) Solicitors handle all aspects of a case until it goes to trial, at which point a barrister takes over completely.\n\nB) Barristers are engaged directly by clients from the beginning of a dispute and work independently of solicitors.\n\nC) Solicitors manage the case throughout, engaging barristers for specific tasks such as providing specialized advice and representing clients in court.\n\nD) Barristers work in law firms alongside solicitors and share equal responsibilities throughout the litigation process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In the English legal system, solicitors typically manage a case from start to finish, including during litigation. They engage barristers for specific tasks, primarily for specialized advice on particular issues and for in-court representation. Barristers are not usually engaged directly by clients but through solicitors. They don't take over cases entirely from solicitors, nor do they work in law firms alongside solicitors. Each barrister is independent, often working from chambers, but not in a firm structure like solicitors do. This system allows for a division of labor where solicitors handle the overall case management and client relations, while barristers provide specialized advocacy and advice as needed."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16606/criminal-federal-laws-regarding-functions-of-civil-officers", "docs_id": 16606, "title": "Criminal federal laws regarding functions of civil officers", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Has Congress passed any laws that place criminal executive restrictions on federal employees in the executive branch?\n\nFor example, if Congress passed a law that said the FBI director wasn't allowed to send agents to Alaska or he would be imprisoned for 5 years. \n\nIf they haven't, is there a reason why they're not allowed to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If Congress wanted to do something like that there are a variety of ways that it could do it.\n\n* It could change the authority of the FBI in the federal bureaucracy to exclude Alaska. This would deprive it of the affirmative authority it needs to do its job there, for example, eliminating its authority to arrest people and present them to a federal court in that state.\n* It could pass a rider to an appropriations bill declaring that no federal funds be spent to conduct FBI activities in Alaska. It wouldn't be a crime to conduct FBI activities in Alaska per se, but because FBI agents are paid for their time, doing that would require an expenditure of funds not authorized by Congress.\n\nGenerally, the first line of defense would be for the Treasury Department or Office of Personnel Management to decline to issue payroll checks to the FBI agents involved since the appropriations for that expenditure were not authorized. \n\nIf that failed and the FBI somehow managed to pull the wool over the Treasury and OPM's eyes (which honestly would be easy as they don't have internal controls designed to catch something like that), then those involved might be guilty of a misappropriation of federal funds (basically an embezzlement crime) for doing so.\n\n* Of course, another step that could be taken is for the Inspector General of the Justice Department (or a senior executive in the AG's office such as the AG or a deputy AG, or assistant AG) to investigate and to suspend the people involved from their employment and fire them if necessary, or simply order them not to act (on threat of being fired for insubordination if they disobey) if the acts have not yet been committed.\n* Congress is allowed to use criminal sanctions, but generally speaking, the federal government has demonstrated that the crude instrument of criminal punishments is not necessary to keep their employees in line, and going around throwing your employees in prison for not following complicated high level legislative or executive directions is not good for employee moral, particularly when most of your employees are unionized and have civil service protections, so doing it the hard way is very, very hard.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Congress wants to restrict the FBI's activities in Alaska without directly criminalizing the FBI director's actions.

His parents *were* indicted as accessories (perhaps not the exact term) but never brought to trial. Many wonder why \\- is it possible that due to shielding laws, no evidence against Burke could be introduced (due to his age or the fact he was not being charged) and therefore there was very little that could be presented in court? Can an adult be an accessory to a 'non\\-crime' if Burke is completely shielded, and in essence no crime was ever committed in the first place?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, a guilty action also requires a mens rea, or guilty mind, in order to be guilty of a crime. A child who is too young to form an intent to commit a crime cannot be guilty of a crime. The toddler who finds a loaded gun and shoots someone isn't guilty of assault or murder because the toddler couldn't have formed the intent to commit the crime.\n\nUnder the more modern Model Penal Code definitions, Strict liability laws are applied regardless of intent, but negligent, reckless, knowing, and purposeful states of mind all require some level of intent, and again, a child is unable to form this intent.\n\nThe defense of infancy is a defense against the formation of a mens rea by a child's age. In English common law, under the age of 7, infancy was a complete defense. Age 7 to 14, infancy was a rebuttable presumption, and over 14 were presumed capable.

The defense of infancy in this case acts as an absolute bar to prosecution, not just a presumption that can be rebutted. The child's actions, no matter how serious, would not be considered a crime under the law due to their age.

Under Virginia law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the landlord's right to enter the apartment?\n\nA) The landlord's right to enter without notice expired after the initial inspection and temporary fix.\nB) The landlord has an indefinite right to enter without notice until the maintenance request is fully completed.\nC) The landlord's right to enter without notice expired after a \"reasonable\" time period, which is typically considered to be two weeks.\nD) The landlord must provide notice for any entry after the initial response, regardless of whether the maintenance request is completed.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Virginia law and the interpretation provided in the documentation, the landlord's right to enter without notice for a maintenance request likely extends until the request is fully completed. The law states that notice is not required when responding to a tenant's maintenance request, and there's no specified expiration for this right. The interpretation suggests that as long as work is continuing on the problem described in the original request, the landlord is probably within their rights to enter without additional notice. While there might be a point far in the future (e.g., a year or two) where this right could be questioned, in the scenario described (three weeks later), the landlord's actions are likely permissible under the law."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55512/can-an-adult-25-y-o-be-prosecuted-for-writing-pornography-with-a-minor-16-y-o", "docs_id": 55512, "title": "Can an adult (25 y/o) be prosecuted for writing pornography with a minor (16 y/o) in the UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If a 25 y/o adult in the UK writes and distributes sexually explicit material with/to a 16 y/o can they be prosecuted for Child Sexual Abuse?

Many of the bystanders were worried that Mr. Floyd was being seriously hurt, but it's hard to say if any of them *knew* that Mr. Floyd was in grave danger.

But we can address the general principles. The [Model Penal Code 3\\.04(2\\)(a)](http://individual.utoronto.ca/dubber/web/website/genjust/Model_Penal_Code.htm) sets out the general principles clearly. A person has the right to self\\-defense against unlawful force. But, the use of force is *not* justifiable to resist an arrest which the actor knows is being made by a peace officer, although the arrest is unlawful. But more specifically under (b)\n\n> The use of deadly force is not justifiable under this Section unless\n>  the actor believes that such force is necessary to protect himself\n>  against death, serious bodily harm, kidnapping or sexual intercourse\n>  compelled by force or threat\n\nHowever, there is a further condition that force is not justifiable if\n\n> the actor knows that he can avoid the necessity of using such force\n>  with complete safety by retreating or by surrendering possession of a\n>  thing to a person asserting a claim of right thereto or by complying\n>  with a demand that he abstain from any action which he has no duty to\n>  take\n\nThen finally, \u00a73\\.05 says that this goes for people using force in defense of others.\n\nThe short version is that the common law right to resist illegal arrest has been supplanted by a statutory requirement to submit to police authority, for example [in California](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&division=&title=3.&part=2.&chapter=5.&article=) and [New York](https://casetext.com/statute/consolidated-laws-of-new-york/chapter-penal/part-3-specific-offenses/title-l-offenses-against-public-administration/article-205-escape-and-other-offenses-relating-to-custody/section-20530-resisting-arrest). \n\nIn [Ewumi v. Georgia](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2507744/ewumi-v-state/), defendant was illegally arrested and physically defended himself, which resulted in a battery charge and conviction. The battery charge was overturned because the arrest was illegal *ab initio*. If one [resisting an authorized arrest](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/resisting-arrest-when-police-use-excessive-force.html), where an officer's force is likely to result in unjustifiable great bodily harm, the question is whether a reasonable person would find it necessary to resist in self\\-defense. It is unusual for the courts to find that to be the case.\n\n[Minnesota law](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.06) says that \n\n> reasonable force may be used upon or toward the person of another\n>  without the other's consent when the following circumstances exist or\n>  the actor reasonably believes them to exist:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) when used by a public officer or one assisting a public officer\n>  under the public officer's direction:\n> \n> \n> (a) in effecting a lawful arrest\n\nOther sections say that a person who is *not* a public officer may use force to effect an arrest, or, \"(3\\) when used by any person in resisting or aiding another to resist an offense against the person\".

Near where I live, it's easy to find abandoned buildings in the mountains or the National Park.\n\nI have an interest in [Urbex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_exploration). I admit some times when I go to the wild I'm actively looking for urban places and ruins to explore. I've been in some amazing places in my country, and I'm always looking for more. However, this is just an interest, not something I spend a lot of time thinking about.\n\n**Examples**\n\nHere's a few examples of places I've been (I don't own these photos):\n\n[![Abandoned arabic building](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ufq9m.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ufq9m.jpg)\n\nAbandoned arabic building\n\n[![Abandoned hotel](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yeiyG.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yeiyG.jpg)\n\nAbandoned hotel (since the 80s I think), in the islands\n\n[![Abandoned restaurant](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gaJG.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1gaJG.jpg)\n\nAbandoned panoramic restaurant (since the 80s), right next to the country's capital\n\n[![Abandoned thermal spa](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ohSqp.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ohSqp.jpg)\n\nAbandoned thermal spa, popular during the beginning of XX century\n\n**Problem**\n\nHow legal is it to enter these buildings? Can I explore with peace of mind knowing I'm doing nothing wrong or can this be considered trespassing, breaking \\& entering, burglary or even mischief, even if I'm doing nothing wrong?\n\nI only enter a building if there is an open door (or window, gate, even holes in the walls or fences) and I never break anything. I like to have the same approach as I have in the wild: leave no trace. In my opinion, this is still the wilderness and you can actually find good examples of local flora and fauna inside these buildings.\n\nAlso, if there is a sign stating \"Private property\" or \"No enter\", I respect the signs and move on. There's plenty more to explore out there.\n\nThe arabic building from the picture above, for example, is abandoned but belongs to a complex of buildings on the same area, which I suppose belong to the same owner. As far as I know, there are people who own this building and who are easily identifiable, so I did not go inside.\n\nI understand the laws will be different from country to country, but probably the principles will be the same? And how can I find the relevant laws and analyze them?\n\nThank you in advance, respect the world.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nTo clarify, the photos were taken in Portugal; but since I also travel around the world (mainly Europe), I would like to know the general principles behind these laws. The answers given so far are interesting on this matter.\n\nAlso, one final note just to point the obvious: trespassing, burglary and other offenses can be considered serious crimes in your area.

However, the answers given so far are all quite interesting and what I was looking for, so I will keep the question as is.\nThanks guys.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My **general belief** is that **in the United States** entering structures like the ones you've pictured would be considered trespassing regardless of if there is a sign in place or not. This is based on the fact that I'm almost certain that if you become injured while on the premises you could sue the land owner. I **believe** the trespassing signs are just there to give legal cover to the land owner in case someone does try to sue them.\n\nHere are two sources that essentially support my beliefs:\n\n[General definition](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/trespass):\n\n> Trespass is defined by the act of knowingly entering another person\u2019s property without permission.\n\n[More detailed legal definition](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/25/11.411):\n\n> \u00a7 11\\.411 Criminal trespass.\n> \n> \n> (a) A person commits an offense if, knowing that he or she is not licensed or privileged to do so, he or she enters or surreptitiously remains in any building or occupied structure. An offense under this subsection is a misdemeanor if it is committed in a dwelling at night. Otherwise it is a petty misdemeanor.\n\nAs you can see these buildings are clearly owned by someone, and you clearly haven't gotten permission to enter the building. Ergo, you're trespassing.\n\nNow if you were talking about ancient Mayan ruins, or an Old West ghost town then this would be more of a gray area, I believe, since those structures have been abandoned for 150\\+ years. The same goes for structures in National Parks, since a National Park is *public* land you could make a case that you thought you were allowed to go since you *weren't specifically told* you can't go (assuming you didn't cross a fence line/no trespassing sign). You should definitely contact a real lawyer though.\n\n---\n\nNow if you do enter then I think the probability that you will be caught and prosecuted would be fairly low.

The legal definition provided indicates that knowingly entering another person's property without permission constitutes trespassing. The answer emphasizes that these buildings are clearly owned by someone, and without explicit permission, entering them would be trespassing.

To that end, fair use boils down to several factors of your work, such as the nature of your use of the derivative work (who did you show it to and for what purposes), the damage to the original copyright (usually monetary damages, but reputation damages or brand damage as well), and the derivative nature of the work (how is the message of the original work changed by your addition).

For example, punitive damages are probably barred and other damages may be limited.\n\nThe primary statute relevant to a case like this one in Ohio is Ohio Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 2744\\.01\\-2744\\.11, a chapter which is entitled \"Political Subdivision Tort Liability\". ORS \u00a7 2744\\.02(B)(4\\) states (in the pertinent part) that:\n\n> \\[P]olitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to\n>  person or property that is caused by the negligence of their employees\n>  and that occurs within or on the grounds of, and is due to physical\n>  defects within or on the grounds of, buildings that are used in\n>  connection with the performance of a governmental function . . . .\n\nORS \u00a7 2744\\.03(A) provides for a variety of defenses, most of which involve rogue employees, but one of which, (A)(5\\), provides that:\n\n> The political subdivision is immune from liability if the injury,\n>  death, or loss to person or property resulted from the exercise of\n>  judgment or discretion in determining whether to acquire, or how to\n>  use, equipment, supplies, materials, personnel, facilities, and other\n>  resources unless the judgment or discretion was exercised with\n>  malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\n\nThere is an unusually strict form of two year statute of limitations set forth at ORS \u00a7 2744\\.04\\. The damages limitations are set forth at ORS \u00a7 2744\\.05\\. The liability and process for suits involving government employees is set forth at ORS \u00a7 2744\\.07\\. There are definitions at ORS \u00a7 2744\\.01 which mostly have the usual and ordinary meaning in the context of your fact pattern. Special procedures govern payment of judgments in cases like these if they are awarded. ORS \u00a7 2744\\.06\\.\n\nOf course, like any other civil action, once a suit is commenced in a timely fashion by a lawyer in the proper court, there is a good chance that it will be settled before going to trial.\n\nSubstantively, the main question before the trier of fact at trial (states vary on the right to a jury trial in suits against them and I don't know what the rule is in Ohio) are as follows:\n\n1. Did the school district (if the school district indeed owned the parking law) have a duty to use reasonable care to keep the parking lot free of ice?\n2. Was the school district negligent (i.e. did it breach its duty to use reasonable care through its actions)?\n3. Was this negligence the cause of the harm suffered?\n4. What dollar amount is necessary to compensate the victim for the harm caused by the negligence, subject to the applicable damages limitations?\n\nOther provisions govern how the public subdivisions are insured, and generally, in Ohio, the school district would be a separate entity with its own liability arrangements and insurance, and not under the town or municipality as @Cicero suggests in his answer.

An entire 200 concession lot. Lets call it Parcel A. At some point Parcel A was divided in half. Creating a new Parcel B being the south half of Parcel A leaving the balance of Parcel A as north half.\n\nDuring the severance of Parcel A it became subject to a right of way for the owners of Parcel B in, over along and upon a strip of land of a uniform perpendicular width of 25 feet being the easterly 25 feet of the north half Parcel A. The purpose was that the north half has a public road running through it which connects to the 25 foot right of way. Giving the owners of Parcel B a way to cross Parcel A and get to the public road.\n\nLater on Parcel B was then split in half. Making a new Parcel C as the north half of B. Leaving the balance (the south half Parcel B) I know that in 1\\.0\\.3 Division of Dominant Lands it says \"Upon the severance of a parcel of land, all existing easements appurtenant to the whole, benefit each severed portion.\" But how does Parcel B cross Parcel C when C is in the middle to get to the Right of way on Parcel A. Is it implied through law that B must have to cross C to get to A or has B now been landlocked? If its implied what law or wording in the law would support this?

What path would the owner of B be allowed to\n> take across C to get to the right of way on A?\n\nUnder common law rules in most U.S. states, an **easement by necessity** would be implied in law for the owner of Parcel B to access their property from the public road across Parcel C to get to Parcel A. In a court action to have this easement by necessity recognized (if necessary), any reasonable route chosen by the owner of Parcel B across Parcel C would probably be recognized by the court.\n\nUnder some circumstances (such as the existence of an established path from Parcel B across Parcel C established by historic use) an **easement implied in fact** could also arise in the place where access was historically present prior to subdivision.\n\nIf an access route was used post\\-subdivision for the requisite number of years without express permission to do so, and without legal action or a physical interruption of the access route, a **prescriptive easement** could arise (which is analogous to gaining title to land by adverse possession).\n\nYou could probably also sue the lawyer handling the subdivision for malpractice for forcing you to incur litigation costs, and delays causing other harm litigating an issue that should have been resolved with an express easement from Parcel B across Parcel C in the original transaction.\n\nUPDATE: Upon later getting a chance to view the video, it seems that Ontario law is implicated. Ontario has codified real estate law to a much greater extent than most U.S. states, so I don't know if the common law doctrines found in the U.S. would apply to supplement Ontario law in this case.\n\nIf they don't, it is likely that a **private condemnation action** would be available under Ontario law, which is analogous to an eminent domain petition by a government with condemnation power to involuntarily purchase someone else's land for a public purpose at fair market value, but brought by a private landlocked land owner for the limited purpose of buying an access easement.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Ontario, Parcel B has been landlocked after Parcel C was created between it and an existing right-of-way on Parcel A.

(Assume that the host country doesn't have any special laws that forbid foreigners from working remotely.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I've done it, I know a number of people who have done it. There's no general rule regarding employer\\-employee relations \u2013 if you have to physically clock in, then basically no, if you don't do job you can get fired and the employer might require you to be physically present in a certain location. Whether or not it is legal to \"work\" in another country depends on the laws of that country, but there is no recurring law to the effect that you cannot \"do work\" while in a foreign country without a work permit or the like. There *is* a general rule that you have to be permitted to reside in a country, if you intend to reside in a country, so a US citizen cannot generally pick an arbitrary country and decide that they want to live there for a couple of years, without asking permission from the host government.\n\nThere can be a complex relationship between the premise for getting a long\\-term visa to reside for a year in another country, and the rationale for that stay, for example a student coming to the US for the purpose of study cannot decide that instead they want to work as a car salesman. A scam whereby you claim to be a student in some local college when in fact you are working remotely for a call center would run afoul of immigration laws as well. The main consideration is whether you are present in the country under one pretense but in fact are doing something very different, which may then be illegal, but that depends on the country\\-particular laws.\n\nSince you are not employed in that country, you (probably) are not subject to taxation of your regular income (i.e. if I go to Norway for a year and receive my US salary, I will not have to also pay Norwegian income tax on the US salary).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An American employee of a US-based company decides to work remotely from Spain for 18 months without informing their employer.

The documentation states that there is \"no general rule regarding employer-employee relations\" that would make this illegal from a US perspective, assuming the employee can perform their job remotely. However, the employee must have the proper authorization to reside in Spain for an extended period, which may involve obtaining a specific type of visa. The employee's failure to inform their employer could potentially violate company policies but doesn't necessarily break US laws. Regarding taxation, the employee would likely still be subject to US taxes but wouldn't typically have to pay Spanish income tax on their US salary, contrary to option D.

Option C is misleading because becoming an archipelagic state is not simply a matter of UN Security Council approval, and several countries with veto power would likely oppose such a move by China."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28708/can-a-governments-open-data-license-include-a-provision-to-not-allow-use-that-d", "docs_id": 28708, "title": "Can a government&#39;s open data license include a provision to not allow use that damages the &quot;honor or reputation&quot; of their agency as a moral right?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Moral rights are protected under CC BY 4\\.0 license and some countries are unable to revoke these rights in a license even if they want to.\n\nHowever, the provision to not allow reuse in a way that dishonors the original data producer, misleads, etc. seems awfully vague. So vague, that a government could use such a clause to terminate somebody's right to use data simply because they do not agree with the way it was used.\n\nIs this a protected moral right that can be included in a government's open data license and still fully meet the open definition?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nOnly individuals have moral rights so a government or a company cannot claim to have them.\n\nThey can, of course, require the licence to respect individuals moral rights and, like any contract, could have a general [non\\-disparagement clause](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/non-disparagement-agreement.html).\n\nDerogatory treatment is defined in the relevant law, for example, [s 195AJ](http://www9.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s195aj.html) of the *Copyright Act 1968* (Cth):\n\n> \"derogatory treatment\" , in relation to a literary, dramatic or musical work, means:\n> \n> \n> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0 the doing, in relation to the work, of anything that results in a material distortion of, the mutilation of, or a material alteration to, the work that is prejudicial to the author's honour or reputation; or\n> \n> \n> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0 the doing of anything else in relation to the work that is prejudicial to the author's honour or reputation.\n\nAnd the courts know how to interpret this (see [Fernandez v Perez \\[2012] NSWSC 1242](http://www.mondaq.com/australia/x/265880/Copyright/Copyright+and+moral+rightsTake+it+personally)).\n\nIn any event, you only have a right to use the copyrighted work **in accordance with the licence**. There is no question of terminating your right, your right continues even when they are suing you for **your** breach of the licence.\n\nThat said, if the license is silent about moral rights *you still have to respect them*.

The government claims this violates the license terms. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The government can legally revoke the researcher's right to use the data based on this clause, as it's part of the license agreement.\n\nB) The clause is invalid because governments cannot claim moral rights, which only apply to individuals.\n\nC) The researcher has definitely violated the license terms and can be sued for copyright infringement.\n\nD) The clause may be enforceable, but the government would need to prove that the use was actually derogatory or misleading, not just critical.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because simply disagreeing with how data is used is not sufficient grounds to revoke a license. \nB is partially correct in that governments cannot claim moral rights, but they can include clauses in licenses to protect individual creators' moral rights or include non-disparagement clauses.\nC is incorrect because critical analysis alone does not necessarily constitute a violation of such clauses.\nD is correct because while such clauses can be included in licenses, they are typically interpreted narrowly. The government would need to demonstrate actual derogatory treatment or misleading use, not just disagreement with the conclusions. Courts have established precedents for interpreting what constitutes \"derogatory treatment\" in copyright law."}}
