On this example can you help me understand it better please?\n\nLet's say I would like to build the replica of the engine and sell it. It will be not working, just standing on the display. So in general \\- it will have shape, but not function of the original product.\n\nI know that I can not put any trademark on it. I know as well that it can not work, as it would be against patents. Would it be still legal to make one? \n\nWhat if my engine will have same moving parts as the original one, but still will be not able to work. If those moving parts are part of claims in the patent to use in engine patent, will it be illegal to mimic them in replica?\n\nCheers,\nFilip\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several forms of intellectual property:\n\n1. Utility patents protect the functional aspects of a product for a period of approximately 20 years. If it is out of patent, it is in the public domain and you can freely make one. I can't think of any case where a patent infringement case was successfully made against someone who made a non\\-functional version of the patented item and I have no idea how the case law would play out in that. Usually those suits aren't brought because the functionality isn't imitated and it isn't valuable.\n2. Design patents protect the design for about the same time period. Usually, a functional product like an engine wouldn't be subject to a design patent \\- more often, only the exterior of a vehicle design would be subject to a design patent.\n3. A copyright protects expressions of a design or derivations of a copyright, but will not generally protect a functional design where the design parameters are governed by the laws of physics. Copyrights last much longer than patents (up to about a century depending upon who owns it), and there was a major change in the scope of copyright protection in the 1970s. Earlier copyrights required an affirmative filing to protect and had to be renewed. Later copyrights arise automatically, although filing and claiming a copyright enhances the copyright owner's rights. I would seriously doubt that an engine design would enjoy copyright protection.\n4. Trade dress/trademark covers non\\-functional aspects of a good that are associated with a brand of good to sell a product and can arise even without a public filing at common law. For example, if the engine had a company logo embossed on it, this would have trademark protection.\n\nGenerally speaking, your project would be at low risk for intellectual property infringement, particularly if the engine were a classic one, rather than a modern one. It also helps, from a practical perspective, that few companies that own intellectual property rights associated with engines are actively pursuing possible infringements of their engine designs legally. They are in the business of selling parts for vehicles to make vehicles run; they are not in the business of selling their engine designs as art. They allocate scarce legal resources accordingly."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An automotive enthusiast wants to create a non-functional replica of a famous car engine for display purposes. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential intellectual property concerns?\n\nA) The replica would likely infringe on utility patents, as it mimics the shape and design of the original engine.\n\nB) Copyright laws would be the primary concern, as the engine's design is an artistic expression protected for up to a century.\n\nC) The replica would be at low risk for intellectual property infringement, especially if based on a classic engine design.\n\nD) Trade dress protections would prevent the creation of the replica, as the engine's appearance is closely associated with the brand.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation suggests that creating a non-functional replica of an engine, especially a classic one, would generally be at low risk for intellectual property infringement. Utility patents typically protect functional aspects and last about 20 years, so older engine designs may be in the public domain. Copyright is unlikely to apply to functional designs governed by physics. Design patents are more common for vehicle exteriors than engines. Trademark/trade dress mainly applies to non-functional, brand-associated elements. Additionally, engine manufacturers are less likely to pursue legal action against non-functional replicas as it doesn't impact their core business of selling functional parts and vehicles."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/57728/do-patent-royalties-date-from-the-date-of-filing", "docs_id": 57728, "title": "Do patent royalties date from the date of filing?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Alice invents a widget, files patent; it gets granted after a couple of years.

Or do they only apply forward from when the patent was granted?\n\nAnd have the rules for this been the same since the patent system started, or have they changed over the years?\n\nThe jurisdiction I'm concerned about is the US, if it makes a difference.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You mention an agreement between Bob and Alice. Since it is not court imposed it could have any provision that they both agreed to. But custom would not likely result in royalties from the day of filing.\n\nA more answerable version of the question is what is Alice entitled to under law?\n\nBack royalties would be from the date of grant plus possibly royalties on units that fall under something called provisional rights. These would be units sold after the application is published but before the patent was granted. Since 2000 U.S. applications are published by the patent office 18 months after the earliest filing date.\n\nAlice is only entitled to this if a claim in the published application is substantially the same as a claim that made it through the process to be in the granted patent.

It appears to me that the German bureaucracy is preventing multiple registrations on the same address, however I have yet to receive clear answers as to why and how.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I think I can easily find myself officially homeless even though I have a job, health insurance and pay taxes. \n\nWhat do people without a home do?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All residents in Germany need to have a registered address. The reasons for that are numerous:\n\n* no need for a separate voting registration,\n* it gives a place to deliver legal notices,\n* it helps enforcing tax regulation (though tax law has another definition of \"residence\"),\n* certain taxes are assigned to the municipality where you are registered,\n* no need to do a utility bill or credit report dance when trying to prove your address to third\\-parties,\n* it was always done like that.\n\nThe last is reason enough as far as bureaucracy is concerned.\n\nAs far as your question goes, there are a few wrong assumptions.\n\nFirst, nobody is trying to limit or deny registrations. Municipalities actually get money for every resident they have registered through tax allocation.\n\nSecond, if you (semi\\-)permanently live at some place you are not considered \"officially homeless\" but as someone has didn't properly register themselves (which could result in a fine).\n\nThird, multiple people can be registered at the same address. How else could people register themselves in huge apartment buildings? Or even a family living together? If there is a suspicious amount of people registered they might want to check whether other regulation (such as minimum space per person) is adhered to. \n\nFourth, to register somewhere you need proof that you actually live there. This is where you probably ran into problems. This proof is usually [a letter given by the person allowing you live at a place](http://www.berlin.de/formularserver/formular.php?402544). Note that this is not necessarily the owner of the place but literally the person allowing you to stay (the authorities can check with the owner though). Often subletters won't sign that piece of paper, either because they think they are not allowed to or they don't have permission by the owner to sublet the place to begin with. If that happens you are supposed to tell that to the authorities (\u00a7\u00a019 Abs.\u00a02 BMG) who then can choose to fine the one providing the place for refusing to sign the paper. (The need for proof was recently reintroduced after it was noticed that there was a huge amount of people who registered at an address where they didn't actually live.)\n\nFifth, if you never have been registered before you can't actually properly pay your taxes as you need a tax ID for that. This is automatically assigned when you \u2013 surprise \u2013 register for the first time. If you are not an EU/EEA/CH citizen you also need to register yourself before they can change anything about the residence permit within Germany.\n\nTo end with an answer to your question if taken literally: German citizens can register themselves as homeless (*ohne festen Wohnsitz*) if they really are. For foreigners this is a bit more complicated. EU citizens usually don't have freedom of movement rights if they can't properly support themselves, a living space is supposed to be part of that. Other foreigners likely violate their residence permit."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, what is the primary reason for the legal requirement to register one's address within 2 weeks of moving?\n\nA) To prevent multiple registrations at the same address\nB) To ensure proper tax allocation to municipalities\nC) To enforce minimum space per person regulations\nD) To automatically assign a tax ID to new residents\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The primary reason for address registration in Germany is to ensure proper tax allocation to municipalities. The documentation states that \"certain taxes are assigned to the municipality where you are registered.\" This system allows for efficient distribution of tax revenues based on where people actually reside.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that \"nobody is trying to limit or deny registrations\" and that multiple people can be registered at the same address.\n\nOption C, while mentioned as a potential check in cases of suspicious registrations, is not the primary reason for the registration requirement.\n\nOption D, while a consequence of registration for first-time registrants, is not the main purpose of the address registration system.\n\nThe correct answer, B, aligns with the statement that \"Municipalities actually get money for every resident they have registered through tax allocation,\" highlighting the fiscal importance of the registration system."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61607/why-do-governing-law-clauses-sometimes-specify-the-country", "docs_id": 61607, "title": "Why do governing law clauses sometimes specify the country?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Governing Law clauses, why do they sometimes specify the federal law as well as the state/provincial law?

By mentioning both the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada, the clause aims to clarify which laws apply for matters beyond the scope of Canadian provincial law. This is particularly important in international contracts where the other country's federal or equivalent laws might otherwise be assumed to apply in the absence of explicit mention of Canadian federal law.

And it's used quite often.\n\nFor example, take unreasonable searches and seizures. Generally, if the police want to search someone's home, they normally have to obtain a warrant. In Canada, this can often be obtained by a Justice of the Peace. For some background, the [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/Const/page-15.html) says this:\n\n> Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.\n\nSo what happens if someone was searched unreasonably?\n\nIn such cases, the court would throw out the evidence. If the police searched someones home, and found a firearm, but they didn't obtain a warrant (and they didn't provide justification for not having done so), the evidence would be thrown out of court. This is to make sure that the rights of the accused are kept, and that a fair trial is run.\n\nIn [*R v Feeney \\[1997] 2 SCR 13*](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1508/index.do), the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that searching a house without a warrant constitutes an unreasonable search:\n\n> The police, during a murder investigation in 1991, entered the accused\u2019s house (an equipment trailer) without permission. When they received no answer at the door, they entered, roused the accused, touched his leg, ordered him to get up and took him to the front of the trailer for better lighting. ...\n> \n> \n> Warrantless arrests in dwelling houses are in general prohibited. Prior to such an arrest, the police officer must obtain judicial authorization for the arrest by obtaining a warrant to enter the dwelling house for the purpose of arrest. Such a warrant will only be authorized if there are reasonable grounds for the arrest, and reasonable grounds to believe that the person will be found at the address named, thus providing individuals\u2019 privacy interests in an arrest situation with the protection this Court has required with respect to searches and seizures. Requiring a warrant prior to arrest avoids the ex post facto analysis of the reasonableness of an intrusion and invasive arrests without a basis of reasonable and probable grounds are prevented, rather than remedied after the fact.\n> \n> \n> The protection of privacy does not end with a warrant; before forcibly entering a dwelling house to make an arrest with a warrant for an indictable offence, proper announcement must be made.\n\nWhen a request to exclude evidence is made, a *voir dire* will often be held, with the jury absent, to determine if the evidence is admissible into court.\n\nTo respond to your second paragraph, \"targeting\" of individuals can happen, but the justice system normally has a lot of integrity. That's not a result of the justice system \\- it's more psychological and political if anything. Courts are impartial, and look at all aspects of the alleged crime that they are trying. I'm not aware of any charges that have been biased, at least here in Canada. **There are many steps to keep the justice system transparent and accountable**, so if any incident like that were to occur, it would be extremely rare and dealt with promptly. \n\nYou may have fun reading [Judge blasts Toronto police over 'Kafkaesque' traffic stop](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/01/13/judge-blasts-toronto-police-over-kafkaesque-traffic-stop.html):\n\n> A judge has acquitted a man of failing to provide a breath sample, rebuking Toronto police officers\u2019 \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cverbally abusive\u201d conduct following a simple traffic stop, which included telling the man he needed to exit his car because he had come to a \u201chigh drug\u201d area.\n> \n> \n> Calling the encounter, which was captured on the police\u2019s in\\-car camera system, \u201ctruly Kafkaesque,\u201d Ontario Court Justice Sandra Bacchus was also critical of the officers for turning off their microphones during \u201ckey seconds.\u201d\n> \n> \n> Those seconds were just before officers decided to ask the man for a breath sample after repeatedly demanding he exit his vehicle, despite there being no valid reason to do so."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In common law jurisdictions, what legal principle can be used to challenge evidence obtained through unfair or discriminatory law enforcement practices?\n\nA) The principle of double jeopardy\nB) The exclusionary rule\nC) The statute of limitations\nD) The principle of estoppel\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The exclusionary rule is the correct answer.

Not all businesses are entities and when a business is organized as a sole proprietorship rather than as an entity, registering a vehicle in your name and registering a vehicle in the business are the same thing in any case.\n\nIt is conceivable that Virginia has, or may have at some time in the future, different registration fees, for example, for vehicles owned for personal use and vehicles owned for business use, and that it might put a cap on the number of vehicles owned for personal use for that purpose (so far as I know, there is no such limit now, but I could imagine a state government doing something like that, much as they do for certain kinds of residential real estate property tax breaks).\n\nBut whether a vehicle is owned for personal use or for business use still wouldn't change the fact that a vehicle is owned by you individually.\n\nAs a matter of good business practices, registering a large number of vehicles used for business purposes in your personal name probably isn't wise (e.g. for liability and tax purposes), but that doesn't mean that it is illegal or prohibited.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that would be similar to the kind of limitation that you are worried about is that New York City has (and perhaps a few other jurisdictions have) a highly regulated taxi industry, and to operate a taxi you must have a taxi license. Taxi licenses in New York City are fixed in number and transferrable, and all of the licenses available have been issued, so the only way you can own a taxi and actually use it as a taxi is to buy a taxi license from someone who already has one and even in theory, you couldn't buy more than the total number of taxi licenses which are outstanding.\n\nIn many businesses where you need a license to operate (e.g. liquor stores and radio stations and TV stations) there are numerical limits on how many licenses any one person can own at one time in a particular territory.\n\nBut registering a car is not a discretionarily granted license in the same way that a taxi or radio license is, it is simply a way of formally registering ownership of a particular item of tangible personal property as owned by you (the registration laws were originally passed to discourage car theft)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Virginia, what is the primary limiting factor for the number of vehicles an individual or business can register?\n\nA) The DMV imposes a strict limit on vehicle registrations per person or business\nB) The individual's or business's financial capacity to afford vehicles\nC) The type of business entity (sole proprietorship vs. corporation)\nD) The intended use of the vehicles (personal vs. business)\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The primary limit on how many vehicles a person or business can register in Virginia is their financial ability to afford the vehicles. There is no legal restriction on the number of vehicles that can be registered. While factors like business structure or vehicle use may influence registration practices, they don't inherently limit the number of registrations.

Prosecutor tagged all the pictures into evidence to the certain person.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This question needs more detail. As a cybersecurity professional I can provide some technical context around what I believe to be the situation.\n\nWhile I do not know the legal precedence, technically, IP addresses cannot typically be attributed to an individual person. There are a number of reasons for this.\n\nIn a local network, IP addresses are not unique. Rather, they are distributed by the DHCP server, and are reassigned at intervals. Forensic attribution to an individual in most environments would require a DHCP log linking the IP to the machine\u2019s MAC address, with time stamps that correlate to the individual\u2019s logon to that machine at the same time.\n\nIf the IP correlation involves a VPN, it gets more difficult. I would need to know where the log/evidence was obtained to determine what the IPs in question actually correlate to. If the evidence was obtained in local area network of the suspect, the IP addresses are likely assigned by the DHCP server (see previous). If they are obtained after encryption in transit to decryption, then very little can be determined. If they were obtained at the VPN server log, these IPs likely belong to an ISP which in turn may or may not be able to show what machine initiated the conversation.\n\nDigital photos often contain EXIF data, which is metadata about the photo. This data can contain details like, device make and model, sometimes location, time and date... If the defendant owns a Nikon such and such and the photo was taken with a Nikon such and such, and was uploaded using a VPN the defendant has an account with, and the defendant was in that location at the time and place of the photo... there may be enough there... but I\u2019m not a lawyer.\n\nI believe the discovery should include any EXIF metadata and logs to be used as evidence.\n\nYou may need a special technical whiteness to educate the court on what can and cannot be determined (technically) given the evidence.

At which point does shooting the perpetrator becomes fair game because their actions constituted a legitimate threat?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The general rule is that using force in self\\-defense is justified if the person using the force reasonably believes it immediately is necessary to prevent the unlawful use of force against themselves or a third party. Deadly force is not generally justified except in response to a reasonable fear of deadly force, or to prevent certain violent crimes (like rape, kidnapping, robbery, etc.) Force is *not* justified in retaliation. In some states, if you're not at home (or maybe even then), you also have a duty to retreat before you can use deadly force in self\\-defense.\n\nSo, for your specific questions:\n\n* If they hit you once but aren't continuing to hit you, it's illegal to hit them back. You can only use force to defend yourself, not to get even.\n* If someone gets in your face without touching you, you *might* be allowed to use force, but it depends on the circumstances. You don't have to wait for someone to hit you, but you can't sucker\\-punch someone because you want more space in a mosh pit.\n* Your use of force needs to be something you reasonably believe to be necessary to stop/prevent their unlawful use of force. It also needs to be proportional to the force you're defending against; you can meet deadly force with deadly force, but shooting someone to stop them from slapping you is murder. Likewise, no one's going to believe that you really thought you *had* to beat the crap out of someone in order to stop them from slapping you, or that it's in any way proportionate to what they did.\n* Deadly force is not allowed in defense of a person unless you reasonably think *deadly* force is needed to prevent the unlawful use of deadly force, or to prevent one of a few crimes being committed against them.

In most U.S. jurisdictions, the use of force in self-defense is justified if the person reasonably believes it is immediately necessary to prevent unlawful use of force against themselves. In this scenario, while the stranger hadn't physically touched John, his aggressive behavior might be seen as threatening enough to justify some level of defensive force.

Normal industrial/commercial limits do not apply. This aims mostly at playgrounds, kindergartens, etc.\n\nThe noise of cars, stereos, etc. is not unlimited even before 22:00, but it is considerably harder to get the *police* to intervene during daytime. You might consult with a lawyer to find out if they are unreasonably noisy, you are unreasonably thin\\-skinned, or both. Similarly, the driving you describe *may* be violating traffic regulations, but proving that will be difficult.\n\nAs to actual damages to your premises, what happens depends on the age of the children *and* if they had proper supervision by their guardians. Proper supervision does not require the guardians to stand next to the children around the clock. If you have a specific case, and if the \"perpetrator\" was over 7 years old, you can ask for repayment and then sue if they refuse. This is most likely more hassle than the damage is worth, even if you do get a judgement against a minor, but it could change the tone of the relationship with your neighbours.

Massachusetts's statutes don't seem to expressly prohibit it\u2014and I didn't find any Massachusetts cases where the registered agent's age was at issue. But registered agents have some fiduciary duties, and the agent has to have the capacity to receive all forms of legal process.\n\nSome possible roadblocks are:\n\n1. \"minor\" is a broad term that courts don't seem to have interpreted in the context of registered agents, and\n2. each form of legal process sets its own requirements.\n\n**Background**\n\nFirst, the term \"minor\" encompasses extremes: a 1 year old doesn't have the capacity to receive and forward legal process to the intended party, but a 16 year old might. Some jurisdictions recognize a \"suitable age and discretion\" rule, though it hasn't been extended to the context of registered agents. *See, e.g.*, [Fed. R. of Civ. Proc. 4(e)(2\\)(B)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_4). Massachusetts isn't one of those jurisdictions. *See* [Mass. R. Civ. Pro. 4(d)(1\\)](https://www.mass.gov/rules-of-civil-procedure/civil-procedure-rule-4-process).\n\nIn the broader law of agency, minors do have the capacity to serve as \"agents\"\u2014though their ability to affect the legal relations of the principal is limited. For example, the enforceability of minors' contracts is an issue, and minors can't enter into durable powers of attorney or serve as trustees. See Restatement (Third) of Agency \u00a7 3\\.04\\. The problems associated with appointing a minor as an agent in Massachusetts are longstanding. In *Commonwealth v. O'Leary*, 143 Mass. 95 (1886\\), a mother had her minor daughter enter into a contract of sale for alcohol for the mother's use. While the court recognized the daughter as the mother's agent, it still characterized the transaction as an illegal sale \"to\" a minor.\n\nIn the case of a registered agent, the primary action Massachusetts expects of the agent is the receipt and forwarding of the principal's legal correspondence. Courts have found that this creates a fiduciary duty on the registered agent's part. *See* *Int'l Envtl. Mgmt. v. United Corporate Servs.*, [858 F.3d 1121](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170526144) (8th Cir. 2017\\). This makes sense because the service of process satisfies constitutional requirements embodied in the Due Process clause. So in predicting whether a court would extend the \"suitable age and discretion\" rule to registered agents (or even needs to), it would likely consider that the agent has fiduciary duties, albeit more limited than those of a typical trustee.\n\nSecond, [Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 156B \u00a7 49](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156B/Section49) governs corporations and requires that the agent be capable of receiving \"all lawful processes in any action or proceeding\". When the agent is an individual (as opposed to a company), that person must be a resident of Massachusetts and have a \"business address in the commonwealth\". [Mass. Gen. Laws 156C \u00a7 5](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156C/Section5) governs the process for LLCs, and [Mass Gen. Laws 156D \u00a7 15\\.07](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXXII/Chapter156D/Section15.07) details it for non\\-Massachusetts companies.\n\nMassachusetts's statutes don't expressly prohibit minors from serving as registered agents, but the agent must have the capacity to receive all forms of lawful process. Thus if some lawful process requires delivery to an adult, the minor wouldn't be capable of receiving it."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Massachusetts, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding a minor serving as a registered agent for a company?\n\nA) It is expressly prohibited by state statute for any minor to serve as a registered agent.\nB) A minor can serve as a registered agent without any potential legal complications.\nC) While not expressly prohibited, it presents significant legal risks and may not fulfill all statutory requirements.\nD) Only minors above the age of 16 can serve as registered agents due to the \"suitable age and discretion\" rule.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because Massachusetts statutes do not expressly prohibit minors from serving as registered agents. \nB is incorrect as there are several potential legal complications and risks associated with a minor serving as a registered agent.\nC is correct because while not explicitly forbidden, having a minor as a registered agent presents significant legal risks.

If the text is written by the textbook author and the textbook is still in copyright, then it is protected, and it would be infringement to post either the original text or a translation. [17 USC 102(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/102) states the basic rule regarding what is protected: \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression\", and [17 USC 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) states that the copyright owner has the sole right to authorize derivative works such as translations. Hyper\\-technically, you kinda violate the law when you do homework, which is an absurdity that just struck me. No language textbook author bothers to grant permission for students to do translation exercises. A reasonable person would assume that permission to translate is implicit in the fact of publishing a language textbook. Copyright is not about \"attribution\", it is about the property rights of authors: permission is required from the author.\n\nIf you opt to go ahead and get sued, one approach to defending yourself against a suit would be to plead [fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/7683/4501), so read that analysis. Applied to your case, a fair use analysis is IMO highly unlikely to succeed. In freely distributing the original texts, you would be undercutting a major portion of the market value of the textbook. In addition, in distributing translations (free answers), you would be seriously undermining the pedagogical utility of the exercises. Copying a short passage like *\u1f25\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9 \u1f35\u03bd\u03b1 \u039a\u03c5\u0342\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u025b\u03c5\u0301\u1fc3* (blatantly lifted from Chase \\& Phillips) for ullustrative purposes would not be substantial copying, but an entire text would be probably found to be too much.

Both excerpts read \"*No corporation \\[or] guarantor of an obligation of a corporation*\" rather than \"*no person*\". The prohibition restrains the corporation and its guarantor, not the \"*person dealing with the corporation or \\[the] person who who acquired rights from the corporation*\".\n\n> Why is it talking about people \"dealing with the corporation\" rather than just \"the corporation itself\"?\n\nThe purpose of this question is unclear, but maybe the previous clarification renders this one moot.\n\n> What if the \"by\\-laws\" and \"unanimous member agreement\" are in contradiction with each other as is the case I described at the beginning?\n\nIt depends on how or why the discrepancy hinders or reasonably could hinder the complainant's capacity and/or his rights. That issue is unclear from your description.\n\nIf the departure from by\\-laws does not harm (or implies no potential harm to) the complainant, the departure is immaterial and as such it does not disrupt the legal obligations the non\\-profit organization has. Accordingly, it is unlikely that a court \"*thinks fit*\" to order compliance with an item that seems ritualistic at least in relation to that complaint.\n\nIt is noteworthy, though, that requirement (b)(ii) in and of itself is rather unclear. The terms \"*advanced computing system*\" and \"*from time to time*\" are particularly vague. That vagueness foreseeably complicates the \\[judicial] ascertainment of compliance.\n\nLastly, the fact that the term \"*by\\-laws*\" is not explicitly mentioned in the statutory definition of \"*articles*\" is irrelevant. By\\-laws are for purposes of reorganization, arrangement, etc. of a corporation, and hence they fit the meaning of \"*articles*\".

If he returned it today, according to the agreement, he would owe $1500 (so he would need to pay $800 more since he once made a $200 payment, albeit late). But, he now refuses to pay more and refuses to return the car. I am pressing criminal charges, but want to focus here on just my potential in a civil suit. Also, I understand that I am unlikely to ever get paid even if I win the civil suit, but let's not discuss that.\n\nThen, what is the most I can reasonably sue for? My guess is that I can sue for the $6000 car (minus whatever value I can sell it for if I get it back) plus the $800 debt plus my court\\-related costs (maybe $500\\). Does California civil court have any punitive/double/treble recovery precedent? Is there a common practice in California civil courts which would allow me to sue beyond my true expenses?\n\nHe makes arrangements to pay or return the car but reneges on these actions. I could claim that he has caused me 40 extra hours of work to manage this but I don't believe I can expense my own time for a suit, so hoping instead for a more official California civil court punitive rule.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. You can repossess the car, with or without a court order to do so, so long as it is accomplished without a breach of the peace. If the car is never returned, you have $6,000 of damages for conversion of the car and probably punitive damages for theft of the car.\n2. You can sue for the money damages you experienced from breach of contract (which looks like $800\\), you would also get court costs if you prevailed ($500 per your question) but not attorneys' fees unless you had a contract that provided for them (you should have had an agreement in writing that said you get your attorneys' fees if you have to collect or take legal action to get the car back). You are correct that you can't sue for your own time (at least as a non\\-lawyer).\n3. You can add damages for the lost rental value of the car during the time that it was detained and the out of pocket costs you incurred repossessing the car, and for any damages to the car (e.g. cost of getting it cleaned, paint fixes from his actions, etc.) Find market quotations from low end car rental places as proof, or use the contract rate for the planned duration of the loan (probably better described as a short term lease).\n4. I am surprised that the prosecutor would pursue this criminally, because that would be unusual. If you wait for a conviction, the civil suit would be much cheaper and easier because the conviction proves liability (although not damages) in the civil suit. There also might be a restitution award in a criminal suit and if there was that wouldn't be dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n5. Intentional breach of contract is not fraud and hence usually doesn't give rise to punitive damages (which would be a thousand or two dollars at more) unless you could should an intent not to perform when the contract was entered into, and the fact that at least one payment of $200 was made really undermines that theory. But, detaining the car after the lease period expires could be a form of conversion or theft. In Colorado, we have a civil theft statute that allows for treble damages and attorneys' fees if you prevail, but I'm not sure that California has a comparable law, but some sort of exemplary damages are probably available if he stole the car in the end and never returned it.\n6. Don't worry too much about collection. Judgments remain valid for a long time. Even if he doesn't have money now, he may someday get a job from which you can garnish his wages, or a bank account that you can garnish, or buy real estate that can be subjected to a judgment lien, if he doesn't file for bankruptcy first (which lots of people don't). You can also refer the judgment to a collection agency which screws up his credit.\n\n> I'm more upset about this guy's lack of respect for agreements and\n>  people than about not being paid.

You sound like a one time occasional participant in this market, so this doesn't apply to you.\n\nInstead, your goal should be to optimize your monetary recovery from this one transaction and then to move on. Consider it a cheap lesson learned. Many people learn similar lessons at a much higher price.

Not sure if it matters but I live in Massachusetts and she lives in Georgia.\n\nBecause of her life situation she has not been able to afford car payments and I for this reason have allowed her to use one of the two cars that are in my name. In this case this means I make the monthly payments on these cars and I also pay for the car insurance for both of them.\n\nBoth of my cars are insured from the same company. On the insurance, she is listed as a driver for the car that she has with her in Georgia, and that car is also listed as garaged in Georgia.\n\nCan the car insurance company legally deny insuring the vehicle she is driving in this kind of case?\n\n**Update:** The reason for my question is that the car was in an accident where parts of the body (side front bumper, and side rear panel) got scratched. This happened when the car was parked outside a shopping center (someone tried to squeeze into a parking space next to it), meaning that she was not driving the car, or even inside it, at the time. A police report was made about this incident but it is not yet known if the driver of that other car had insurance, as they had left the scene after bumping into this car (some passerby got the tag\\# of that other car and gave it to my sister\\-in\\-law).\n\nWhen we asked the insurance company about this, we eventually received the reply that the insurance company \"is not going to insure the \\[car] that is garaged in Georgia, they are going to issue legal notice to cancel the insurance since \\[my sister\\-in\\-law's] residence is there.\"\n\nThe insurance policy has listed her as the driver on the car garaged in Georgia for 3 years. So if there was an issue with this setup, I would have thought that we had been informed about it.\n\nI am not particularly concerned about whether they are willing to cover the damage, as it is not major and the insurance in any case has a $500 deductible. The concern and question I have is about the \"legal notice\" from the insurance company, because that implies that this setup has been somehow illegal.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The insurer can absolutely deny paying any claims if they discover that you misrepresented something in obtaining your policy, or you failed to notify them of relevant changes in accordance with the policy's terms.\n\nIn fact, even changing the \"garage\" location *within a state* can affect your premium.\n\nYou should call your insurer and provide them an honest and complete description of the regular use of the car. It is up to their underwriters whether they will continue to provide insurance for that use, and whether they will change your premium accordingly.\n\n**Update** regarding the question update: The insurer could *not* legally deny a claim for any insured damage prior to notice of cancellation, so long as there was no misrepresentation and you had paid your premiums.\n\nAs to when an insurer can legally cancel a policy: This is first a contractual question, and their policy should include terms and conditions that address this. (E.g., they might reserve the right in the policy to cancel it for *any reason at any time*, in which case it's almost certainly legal.) Note that *all policy terms* must be approved by a state's insurance commission. I happen to remember that Massachusetts has some very unusual terms and restrictions for car insurance, so I wouldn't be surprised if the Massachusetts entity discovered that their policy on the out\\-of\\-state car was non\\-compliant and they *had* to cancel it.\n\nThe great thing about the tight regulation of auto insurance is that if a claim on a policy is denied, or if a policy is improperly cancelled, then you can file a complaint with the state regulator, and those tend to get resolved quickly and in the insured's favor. Therefore, you should simply review your policy terms and the cancellation notice. If anything seems out\\-of\\-order you can call both the insurer and your state regulator."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John owns two cars insured under the same policy with an insurance company in Massachusetts.

The insurance company can legally cancel the policy going forward, but they must cover any insured damage that occurred prior to the cancellation notice, as long as there was no misrepresentation and premiums were paid. The company likely discovered that their policy on the out-of-state car was non-compliant with state regulations, necessitating the cancellation. However, they cannot retroactively deny coverage for incidents that occurred while the policy was active. Options A and C are incorrect because the company can legally cancel the policy despite being aware of the arrangement, but they cannot deny claims retroactively.

While the system incorporates elements of gambling (chance in winner selection, consideration in the form of time spent watching content, and a prize of posting spots), the lack of real-world value for the currency and the closed nature of the system differentiate it from traditional gambling.

It means you'd need a \u201clegal basis\u201d, such as a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d. If there are just a couple of people in the background of a video, it's possible that their rights might weigh less important than your interest in shooting the video \u2013 but that would need a case by case analysis.

Most examples given in military manuals, or which have been the object of condemnations, have been cases where persons were actually taken to military objectives in order to shield those objectives from attacks.\n\nThere have recently been claims that the opposite can constitute a war crime, where the placing of weapons within cities has been interpreted as breech of this law. Examples include [this page](https://en.news-front.info/2022/02/26/ukraines-tactic-is-to-inflict-maximum-damage-on-the-population-in-order-to-blame-it-on-russia/) blaming Ukrainian forces for putting military equipment within residential areas of Kharkiv and [this page](https://www.fdd.org/analysis/2021/06/23/hold-hamas-accountable-for-human-shields-use-during-the-may-2021-gaza-war/) blaming Hamas for operating in built\\-up residential areas.\n\nUkraine:\n\n> Ukrainian Armed Forces place 122mm D\\-30 howitzers in residential areas\n\n> Soldiers from the 92nd brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces hiding behind the backs of Kharkiv civilians\n\nGaza:\n\n> Palestinian fighters are clearly operating in built\\-up residential areas and have positioned tunnels, rocket launchers and command and control infrastructure in close proximity to schools, mosques and homes.\n\nObviously these conflicts are vastly different, but they share features.

According to the information provided, the legal interpretation of \"human shields\" is narrower than often claimed. The example from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia defines human shields as physically securing or holding people against their will to protect military targets. This interpretation suggests that merely placing military equipment in urban areas, while potentially problematic, does not necessarily constitute the use of human shields under international law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's too broad and doesn't align with the narrower legal interpretation.

The creativity of the employee is why the employer pay them to create these inventions. Examples of service inventions include product designs for business purposes of the employer produced by a designer whose work contract includes \"producing graphics design and other visual components\" as one of their duties. The key factor in determining whether an invention is a service invention is its close connection to contractual responsibilities in the employment contract, rather than the location or timing of the invention's creation.\n\nIncidental inventions are inventions that are not created in exercise of a listed contractual duty, but are still closely connected with the employee's employment. In such cases, the employer can reserve the right to acquire the employee's incidental inventions for fair compensation. An invention is likely incidental to employment if it is created in connection with work resources or during work time. However, even if the invention is created during the employee's free time, it may still qualify as an incidental invention if it is closely related to the employee's employment generally, even if the work contract does not explicitly foresee it. For example, a salesperson at a clothing store designs a better coat hanger, whether during work time or not, may be subject to the incidental invention rules. The invention or design is owned by the employee. But if the work contract reserved the right of acquisition, the employee must notify the employer, who then have six months to declare its intention to abandon the right or acquire the invention for a fair compensation. Otherwise, the salesperson is free to do whatever they want with their invention, subject to their other obligations. For example, the salesperson cannot use their invention rights in detriment to their current employer (e.g. selling the design to a competitor) due to their duty of loyalty under employment (but once the employment ceases, the duty ceases).\n\n---\n\nThe situation where an employee has similar intellectual work for multiple employers is rare in Switzerland. If a conflict of interest arises because a work can be argued to be the result of contractual obligations of more than one employer, the employee is likely in violation of their duty of loyalty to the employers unless consent was given. In the case of a service invention created pursuant to the contractual responsibilities to one employer only, that employer is the owner of the invention from the beginning. The incidental case does not apply since the first employer only has the right of acquisition from the employee, not the other employer.\n\nIn the case of incidental inventions, I did not find any cases settled by court. If an incidental invention was produced on the premises of the other employer or used the resources of the other employer, the other employer probably has the priority claim, possible conflict of interests notwithstanding. If the invention is created during the employee's free time and can be reasonably seen as within the general missions within the framework of both employers, it would be difficult to decide and the whole circumstance would need to be taken into account.\n\nIf the invention is created during the employee's free time and can be reasonably seen as within the general missions within the framework of both employers, it would be much more difficult to decide and the whole circumstance would need to be taken into account.\n\n---\n\nJust as a sidenote, softwares as such are protected by the copyright law, and do not usually qualify as an invention or design. The employer has the exclusive usage right of softwares created in employement duties. Incidental creations of softwares on the otherhand are not regulated by law, but usually dealt with in employement contracts.\n\n1.

The main impediment is the practical one, since a vague order regarding victimless crimes may not be enforceable. POTUS has historically granted general amnesties, such as Lincoln's [Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction](https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/13/STATUTE-13-Pg737.pdf) which did not specify particular laws that were violated or individuals who violated the laws. Some degree of resistance to such an order (by prison officials and the judiciary) is to be expected, to the extent that the scope of an amnesty is ambiguous. The Lincoln proclamation is clear enough in its scope (it was triggered by taking an oath of allegiance and the persons to whom this remedy was not available are clearly\\-enough described).\n\nThere are on the order of 70,000 federal criminal convictions with sentencing every year, so probably over a million cases would be subject to review. She would need to sharpen the criteria, presumably by enumerating the applicable statutes. This may include or exclude convictions for perjury or lying to a federal officer. In an individual case, it could be argued that in this case, lying did not violate the rights of another person, but in that case it did \u2013 case by case review could be required. Violation of [18 USC 228 (Failure to pay legal child support obligations)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/228) might be considered to have a victim, or not, so just saying \"non\\-violent victimless crimes\" leaves open the question whether interstate refusal to pay child support is in the pardoned set.

While the President theoretically has the power to issue mass pardons, as demonstrated by historical precedents like Lincoln's Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, the effectiveness of a broad pardon for \"victimless crimes\" would face practical challenges. These include the need to clearly define what constitutes a victimless crime, potential resistance from prison officials and the judiciary, and the necessity for case-by-case review in ambiguous situations.

A second article would exist for all standing boards and committees (with a section for each).\n\nOne member of the committee raised the issue of definitions applying throughout an article and suggested that each officer and each board ought to have their own article.\n\nMy question boils down to this: What is the significance of having several closely\\-related topics under one article versus each of those topics having their own article?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When it makes more sense to do so\n---------------------------------\n\nRemember, the primary purpose of the document is to communicate; concisely and unambiguously \\- the drafting should be structured to best support that purpose.\n\nFor your problem\n----------------\n\nYou're both wrong. The constitution needs to deal with elected officials \\- it shouldn't concern itself with particular standing boards and subcommittees. \n\nSet up the rules for committees and allow *the* management committee (or whatever its called) to establish and dissolve subcommittees at its discretion. A \"annual fete\" committee might make sense now but in 15 years time when you no longer hold them its just silly to still have it in the constitution. Similarly, just because you have a committee of 8 now doesn't mean that that will always be the best number.\n\nBasically, don't lock in current practices \\- just because they work now doesn't mean they will always work and its way easier to change a practice by a committee resolution than by having to redraft the constitution ... *again*! As a foundational document it should only need to deal with high level issues like elections, dispute resolution, membership and management structure (rather than management practice).\n\nA few points to remember\n------------------------\n\n**Status of the constitution**\n\nYour constitution is a (quasi\\-)contract, not a constitution.\n\nThis means:\n\n1. That your church is subject to whatever state or national laws allow for your church to exist as an organisation. For example, in NSW, Australia the relevant law is the [ASSOCIATIONS INCORPORATION ACT 2009](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdb/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/aia2009307/). You should start with whatever legislation applies to you to make sure your constitution is in compliance with it. If it isn't then it isn't a valid constitution.\n2. Unlike a national constitution it can be externally enforced. That is, if the office bearers are breaking the rules someone can go to court to stop them. National constitutions must be internally enforced \\- a sufficiently powerful national office bearer can simply \"nope\" the court.\n\n**Reference that law, don't copy it**\n\nLaws change, if you have copied large swathes of it into your constitution then your constitution becomes invalid when they do.\n\nDon't redefine things the law deals with \\- if the law defines \"officers\" and \"committees\" don't come up with your own definitions for these things: adopt those (by reference).\n\n**Use a template**\n\nCheck the applicable legislation \\- it is not uncommon for it to incorporate a \"model constitution\", for [example](http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_reg/air2016398/sch1.html).

For example, if your constitution deals with disciplinary matters like expelling members, people are entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal.\n\n**Have a dictionary**\n\nFor terms with a definite meaning define these (by reference if appropriate) in one place at the start of the document \\- don't make people flick to the back just to work out what \"sub\\-committee\" means. Even better, put the document online as web pages with hyperlinks.\n\n**Don't prescribe**\n\nResist the temptation to be overly prescriptive or limiting on current or future office bearers/committees \\- trust them to act responsibly. You guys are reasonable people \\- why to you think your replacements won't be?\n\nFor example, don't set hard discretionary spending limits, set a rule which allows the management committee to set these at their discretion.

If the answer is the courts, what kind of remedies can they possibly provide?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The direct answer is simple \\-\\- the US Constitution (Article II, Section 1, Clause 2\\) provides that electors are appointed in the manner that state legislatures direct \\-\\- so the answer is the state legislature decides. But state legislatures don't exist in a vacuum, and the reality is not so simple.\n\nState legislatures direct the manner of choosing electors by passing state laws, which, in the case the state decides to choose electors by holding some sort of popular election, include laws for how and when ballots can be cast or received, and how recounts are to work, etc. Normally, state laws are interpreted by state courts, and state courts can strike down or modify state laws if they find that the state laws violate the state constitution. And more fundamentally, state legislatures derive their authority from state constitutions, so in principle, state legislatures should not be able to perform any act that does not conform to the state constitution (which is interpreted by the state courts).\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court decision in *Bush v. Gore* (2000\\) overturned the Florida state supreme court ruling on how to conduct recounts in the Florida election for presidential electors. Normally, federal courts do not get involved in state law issues, but the decision was mostly made on equal protection grounds, and the equal protection clause is part of the federal Constitution. So federal courts can get involved if there is an issue that relates to federal law or Constitution. In the Bush v. Gore case, there was an interesting concurring opinion that said the Florida supreme court had acted contrary to the Florida legislature, but this opinion was only joined by 3 justices, so it is not binding.\n\nRecently, the issue came up again when the US Supreme Court declined to stay a decision by the Pennsylvania state supreme court that said the Pennsylvania constitution required mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received up to 3 days after Election Day to be counted, even though the state law said they must be received by Election Day. Notably, although the US Supreme Court declined the stay, the order listed that 4 conservative justices dissented and said that they would have granted the stay. This was before Justice Barrett was confirmed, so, now that she is confirmed, depending on her legal position on this issue, there might now be a majority of 5 justices that would intervene against the state court if such an issue were to come up again.

While the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures the power to direct the manner of choosing electors, this power is not absolute. State courts can interpret and potentially strike down state laws based on state constitutions. Additionally, federal courts, particularly the U.S. Supreme Court, can become involved if there are issues related to federal law or the U.S. Constitution, as demonstrated in cases like Bush v.

Of these, based on the methodology you have described, I view fair comment as the more directly applicable defence, but it does really depend on what the content of the publication is.\n\n### Fair comment defence\n\nThe [test for fair comment is](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/5670/index.do):\n\n> (a) the comment must be on a matter of public interest;\n> \n> \n> (b) the comment must be based on fact;\n> \n> \n> (c) the comment, though it can include inferences of fact, must be recognisable as comment;\n> \n> \n> (d) the comment must satisfy the following objective test: could any \\[person] honestly express that opinion on the proved facts?\n> \n> \n> (e) even though the comment satisfies the objective test the defence can be defeated if the plaintiff proves that the defendant was \\[subjectively] actuated by express malice.\n\nFor a fair comment defence, the receivers of the impugned statement must be able to identify the underlying facts on which the statement is based. Therefore, it would not be enough for the hypothesis to be \"reasonably based on facts\"; those facts need to be also published to the listeners/readers and a reasonable listener/reader needs to be able to associate the impugned statement as being based on those.\n\nAnother component of the fair comment defence is that the statement must be one of opinion, not fact.

In your situation, this means that the owner occupying your space cannot bring a case in tort against you.\n\nWhile it is generally applied to harm to people, there is precedent (albeit in British case law) for the doctrine to be applied to vehicles, and specifically, to the situation you describe \\- see *[Arthur v Anker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_v_Anker#Judgment)* and *[Vine v London Borough of Waltham Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vine_v_London_Borough_of_Waltham_Forest)*.\n\nWhile cases from other jurisdictions are not binding, I have not been able to find any similar cases in the United States, and so it is possible that such cases will be persuasive.

However, this statement serves an important purpose in limiting the company's liability. By clearly stating that modifications and certain uses (like self-belaying) are prohibited, ClimbSafe is effectively warning customers of potential dangers and disclaiming responsibility for injuries resulting from such uses. This warning would likely protect the company from liability if a customer ignores these instructions and is subsequently injured. The customer has the right to modify their own property, but in doing so, they assume the risks associated with those modifications and uses that go against the manufacturer's instructions."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93128/where-would-i-find-information-about-sales-tax-in-new-jersey-about-tutoring", "docs_id": 93128, "title": "Where would I find information about Sales Tax in New Jersey about tutoring?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a document or New Jersey official page where I could find information about sales tax pertaining to conducting tutoring services in New Jersey?

Which of the following actions would be the MOST appropriate and efficient way for them to obtain definitive information about their specific situation?\n\nA) Rely solely on the Stripe Payment system's default settings for tax collection\nB) Conduct an extensive online search for general New Jersey tax laws\nC) Contact the New Jersey Division of Taxation directly via email or phone\nD) Wait for an audit to determine if they should have been collecting sales tax\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The document mentioned in the response specifically states that for definitive answers on tax obligations, businesses should contact the New Jersey Division of Taxation directly through email, phone, or office visit. This is the most appropriate and efficient way to get accurate information tailored to their specific situation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because relying on a third-party payment system's default settings without verifying tax obligations is risky and may not comply with state laws.\n\nOption B, while potentially helpful, may not provide the specific information needed for the tutoring service's unique circumstances and could lead to misinterpretation of complex tax laws.\n\nOption D is extremely inadvisable, as waiting for an audit could result in significant penalties and back taxes if the business has not been complying with tax laws.\n\nContacting the tax authority directly (Option C) ensures the business receives accurate, up-to-date information specific to their situation, helping them comply with all relevant tax laws and regulations."}}
