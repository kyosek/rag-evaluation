As the student is a minor (under 18), they cannot enter into legally binding contracts on their own. The parents, acting as legal guardians, have the authority to consent to monitoring on behalf of the minor. Since the parents signed an agreement allowing monitoring on the school-issued Chromebook, it is legal for the school to monitor all activities on that device, including the university course.

In this situation, the absence of an early termination clause in the contract means that the licensee is bound by the full term of the agreement. The agency's policy, while not explicitly stated in the contract, offers a solution that allows for early termination if the licensee finds a replacement tenant acceptable to the agency. This approach is consistent with contract law principles, as it requires mutual agreement to modify the existing contract terms.

I've learned something strange through the reply to a minor interpellation by parliament.\n\nOne would assume that a passport is a proof of citizenship of that country?\nIn Germany apparently it is less than proof. In Germany a German passport only counts as presumption of German citizenship.\n\nThey [wrote](https://www.landtag-bw.de/files/live/sites/LTBW/files/dokumente/WP16/Drucksachen/1000/16_1883_D.pdf), in German language, and translated by me to English (German original below):\n\nThe citizenship card is the only document with which the existence\nof German citizenship in all matters for which it is right \\-\nis significant and binding (\u00a7 30 StAG).\nThe German passport and identity card are no proof for the German\nCitizenship, they justify a presumption that the holder of the\nGerman nationality.\n\nMost Germans poses a German ID card and a lot posses a German passport.

But at the end of the day it is up to the country to decide whether to follow this established pattern or not. For example, Estonia [does not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estonian_alien%27s_passport).\n\nAnd, of course, it is up to the country to decide which documents prove citizenship of their own citizens inside.

Option A is incorrect because the German passport is explicitly stated to only create a presumption of citizenship, not definitive proof. Option B is wrong for the same reason as A - the identity card also only creates a presumption. Option D is incorrect because the passport and identity card are not equal to the citizenship card in legal standing. Option C is correct because the documentation clearly states that the Staatsangeh\u00f6rigkeitsausweis (citizenship card) is \"the only document with which the existence of German citizenship in all matters for which it is right - is significant and binding.\" This makes it the sole conclusive proof of German citizenship in all legal matters."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73638/is-refusing-service-to-unvaccinated-equal-to-a-vaccination-mandate", "docs_id": 73638, "title": "Is refusing service to unvaccinated equal to a vaccination mandate?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Yesterday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued Executive Order [GA\\-40](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/EO-GA-40_prohibiting_vaccine_mandates_legislative_action_IMAGE_10-11-2021.pdf) that says:\n\n> No entity in Texas can compel receipt of a COVID\\-19 vaccine by any\n> individual, including an employee or a consumer, who objects to such\n> vaccination for any reason of personal conscience, based on a religious\n> belief, or for medical reasons, including prior recovery from COVID\\-19\\.\n\nThe American Contract Bridge League is planning on hosting its national tournament in Austin next month.

We will notify attendees at a later date with details on how to verify their vaccination status to ensure the verification process is as seamless as possible.\n\nMany of the prospective attendees are wondering whether the EO prohibits ACBL from implementing this requirement. IANAL, but my opinion is that it doesn't. Denying service to an unvaccinated individual is not the same as *compelling* them to get vaccinated. As a precedent, I refer to the [Masterpiece Cakeshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_Cakeshop_v._Colorado_Civil_Rights_Commission) decision, which allowed a cake shop to refuse to sell a wedding cake to for a same\\-sex wedding; they weren't forcing the couple to stop being gay. And it's not a civil rights violation, as being unvaccinated is not a protected class.\n\nIs my interpretation reasonable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think that is not a \"reasonable\" interpretation of the order, but that's separate from the question of what will be enforced. Focusing on the word of the order,\n\n> No entity in Texas can compel receipt of a COVID\\-19 vaccine by any\n> individual, including an employee or a consumer\n\nWhat does it mean to \"compel\" a person to do something? A court can compel a person to stay in jail for some period of time, and can order the police to use force to enforce that requirement \u2013 that's the classical example of compulsion. Nobody *except* the police can compel a consumer to do anything. All of the words of the order have to be given meaning, and it is not reasonable to say that \"compel\" is limited to \"actions backed up by police action\". The government does not separately compel \"consumers\" and \"employees\" to do things.\n\nIn order to sensibly interpret \"compel\" and \"consumer\", this has to interpreted as including things other than \"pointing a gun at a person\". The only sensible interpretation is one that includes denying service to those who do not comply. In addition, the series of \"Whereas's\" clearly indicate a ban on \"no shots, no service\" conditions. It remains to be seen in court whether this is found to be enforceable (via the \"failure to comply\" clause, exactly analogous to other emergency powers allowing restrictions on gatherings etc. previously).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the interpretation provided in the answer, which of the following best describes the scope of Governor Abbott's Executive Order GA-40 regarding COVID-19 vaccine mandates in Texas?\n\nA) It only prohibits government entities from requiring vaccinations\nB) It allows businesses to deny service to unvaccinated individuals without violating the order\nC) It broadly prohibits any entity from imposing vaccination requirements, including denying service to unvaccinated consumers\nD) It only applies to employment situations, not consumer services\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer interprets the Executive Order broadly, stating that \"compel\" should be understood to include denying service to those who do not comply with vaccination requirements. The answer argues that this is the only sensible interpretation that gives meaning to all parts of the order, including its reference to both \"consumers\" and \"employees.\" The interpretation suggests that the order is intended to prohibit \"no shots, no service\" policies, which would include scenarios like the ACBL tournament requirements.

The fabricator fails to pay me in the stipulated 30 days. Can I sue the fabricator in Maine, or do I have to file suit in California?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Short Answer**\n\nIn the absence of additional jurisdiction establishing facts like a choice of forum clause in the contract or in person negotiations in Maine, the Maine seller would probably have to sue the California buyer in California.\n\nIf Maine does have jurisdiction to hear the case, for example, due to a choice of forum clause in the contract, the merits of the amount owed could be litigated to judgment in Maine. But, even then, if the buyer only had assets in California, the Maine judgment would have to be recognized in a California court (which is fairly quick, easy, and non\\-discretionary for the California court to do) and then the post\\-judgment collection activities would have to be conducted in courts located in California.\n\nIf the California purchaser went bankrupt, the bankruptcy case would also be in California in all likelihood.\n\n**Long Answer**\n\nYou can always sue where the defendant is located, which is also the place of performance of the contract. This has a 100% chance of succeeding as to jurisdiction and venue (and could be done in federal court if one feared being hometowned by local counsel my familiar with California law than your lead Maine counsel).\n\nIn a consumer contract, you must sue where the defendant is located pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and a contrary contractual term is void as contrary to the controlling federal law.\n\nIn a business to business contact, however, the parties may include a choice of forum and choice of law clause in the contract that would be controlling, and the Uniform Commercial Code \"battle of forms\" provisions permit the seller's form to be binding in some circumstances even if that term is not in a document signed by the other side. This would be upheld if the forum had any meaningful connection to either of the parties. (Also, for what it is worth, once there is part performance of the contract due to the delivery of goods, the Uniform Commercial Code's statute of frauds no longer bars enforcement of the contract.)\n\nIn the absence of a choice of forum term in the contract, the analysis in the case of a Maine forum would be to determine whether California company had sufficient minimum contacts with the state of Maine in this transaction to have \"purposefully availed itself\" of the laws of Maine by doing business in Maine. This is a fact rich inquiry in which almost any fact that you can imagine about the transaction could be relevant.\n\nIn this fact pattern, the personal jurisdiction issue is less open and shut, especially if no one affiliated with the buyer has ever been present in the seller's state. The odds of a Maine court determining that it doesn't have jurisdiction are not zero but I'd hesitate to put an exact percentage on it.\n\nThe most factually similar case that I could locate held that Maine courts did not have jurisdiction over a similarly situated purchaser, where a headnote to the case explains that:\n\n> Where only contact between purchaser of spiral staircase and\n> manufacturer\\-seller arose from purchase, there was no indication that\n> purchaser ever set foot in or conducted any business in state, and\n> only affiliating circumstances were that purchaser ordered staircase\n> from manufacturer\\-seller, and he communicated with seller by telephone\n> and mail with respect to that order, district court lacked personal\n> jurisdiction over purchaser in manufacturer\\-seller's action seeking\n> damages from purchaser for breach of contract and conversion after\n> purchaser stopped payment on check for staircase but retained\n> staircase.\n\n*Architectural Woodcraft Co. v. Read*, [464 A.2d 210](https://casetext.com/case/architectural-woodcraft-co-v-read) (Me. 1983\\).\n\nSo, to successfully sue in Maine, one would have to distinguish this binding precedent of Maine's highest court with additional facts showing that the purchaser had a greater connection to the State of Maine than this one did.\n\nAnother worthwhile point to consider is that any determination that Maine did not have jurisdiction would be made very early in the case, with the matter full briefed and ready to rule upon or to call for a hearing upon within perhaps two months of service of process on the defendant. The issue probably gets resolved with a hearing if necessary within six months or so. Litigating jurisdiction is much cheaper than litigating the entire case, and if you lose in Maine you just refile in California (probably with acceptance of service of process by the lawyers who appeared on behalf of the California firm in Maine). As long as you aren't close to the statute of limitations, that isn't a huge deal, even though it is a bump in the road.\n\nAs a practical matter, one reasons that a Maine company might want to sue in California is that it removes one step from the collection process. If the Maine company gets a judgment against the California company in a Maine court (possibly removed to federal court), the judgment entered would then have to be registered in California before it could be enforced if the debtor only has assets in California. California has to recognize the judgment if it was entered with valid personal and subject matter jurisdiction in Maine (under the U.S. Constitution's full faith and credit clause), but it still involves an extra step that requires time and money, and if the debtor only has assets in California, subsequent collection of the transferred California judgment, by garnishment of bank accounts, garnishment of amounts owed to the debtor, placing judgment liens on real property, and using a writ of execution to attach tangible personal property of the judgment debtor and having the seized property sold to pay the debt, as well as service of interrogatories on the debtor regarding where its assets are located, would all have to be done in the California court system or in the federal courts of California.\n\nIf the judgment in Maine was entered by default, the judgment debtor could collaterally attack jurisdiction in the California enforcement proceeding. If the judgment in Maine was entered after the defendant in California contested jurisdiction (which consists of personal jurisdiction authority, service of process, and subject matter jurisdiction of the court in question) in Maine (which is the only way it could contest the merits if the Maine court found that it had jurisdiction over the California firm), however, it could not collaterally attack the Maine Court's jurisdiction in California during the enforcement proceedings.\n\nIn real life, a lawyer and client have to assess the risks and benefits and costs of each approach and decide how to handle it, based in part upon how they think that the defendant will behave in litigation. If the merits are likely to be contested and the defendant is easily collectible, fighting in Maine is more desirable to push for even if it isn't a sure thing. If the merits are a foregone conclusion but collection may be more involved, starting in California may make sense.\n\nAlso, if the merits are undisputed, often the case will end up in a debtor forum bankruptcy case before the judgment obtained in either location can be used to collect that judgment in the California courts. This is because companies that don't pay undisputed debts are usually unable to pay many creditors and not just one in particular.\n\nFurthermore while in theory, this case would present distinct issues of state law and federal law, Maine, like most states, takes the position that its state courts have jurisdiction over essentially all cases over which the U.S. Constitution allows it to assert jurisdiction, so the ultimate analysis pretty much boils down to one under federal constitutional law.\n\nSo, while you look to state court precedents first, those precedents are driven by U.S. Supreme Court precedents that greatly narrow the range of discretion which state courts may exercise in deciding these cases. As a result, the outcome is likely to be reasonably similar in pretty much any combination of two U.S. states, even though it wouldn't be precisely uniform and the determinations are highly amenable to being distinguished factually from each other.\n\nThe substantive law of the case, as opposed to the jurisdictional law, would be governed almost entirely by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code which while it is enacted separately as state law in each state is almost identical in every U.S. state. There might be a difference in the statute of limitations, and there might be civil procedure differences, however (although the civil procedure differences would be muted by the power of either party to remove the case to federal court if the amount in controversy exceeded $75,000\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company in Maine sells $100,000 worth of steel plates to a fabricator in California.

So they can track your mouse clicks when the browser window has \"focus\", but not clicks you make when accessing something else.\n\nLike all software, the Javascript programs and the web browser \"interpreter\" that runs them can contain bugs.

The question of liability only arises when there is some harm done and the court either determines that you are responsible (liable), or not. Until there is harm, there is only a risk. In general, you would be held liable if a child came on to your property, got in the pool, and drown, even if you had signs saying \"Don't get in the pond\". The general rule comes from [R.R. Co. v. Stout](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/84/657/), 84 U.S. 657, that in dealing with hazards that would be attractive to a child of \"tender\" years, you have a duty to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the dangers of the attraction.\n\nWhat constitutes \"reasonable care\" is hard to define, except in the most tautological sense \"the care that a reasonable person would have\". Case law in your state may specifically address the question. As a general rule, you should get legal advice from lawyers, not from city engineers. The doctrine may be spelled out as more specific rule such as in Washington ([Schneider v. Seattle](https://casetext.com/case/schneider-v-seattle), 24 Wn. App. 251, the requirements are\n\n> that a condition or instrumentality existed which was dangerous in\n> itself and likely to or probably would cause injury to those coming\n> into contact with it;\n> \n> \n> that it was attractive or enticing to young children;\n> \n> \n> that plaintiff was incapable, by reason of his age, of comprehending\n> the danger involved;\n> \n> \n> that it was left unguarded and exposed at a place where children of\n> tender years were accustomed to resort, for play or amusement or\n> gratification of youthful curiosity; and\n> \n> \n> that it was reasonably practicable and feasible either to prevent\n> access by children or else to render it innocuous without obstructing\n> any reasonable purpose or use for which it was intended.\n\nThe record does not indicate the details of the injury, except that the area was in fact fenced with a cyclone fence.

The answer is \"yes\", you can lie on the census about race. You would do so by providing an answer that is insincere, which is to say, an answer that is not consistent with how you self\\-identify. If you believe yourself to be and identify as African\\-American, for example, but answer \"Alaska Native\" not because you identify as an Alaska Native, but because you want to screw with the census, then you have lied about race on the census.\n\nSimilar issues of sincerity have been addressed [by the U.S. Supreme Court](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/380/163/case.html) in the context of the much higher stakes issue of conscientious objector status for someone seeking to avoid the draft. A [2014 law review article](https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/questioning-sincerity-the-role-of-the-courts-after-hobby-lobby/) explores how courts test sincerity claims in practice.\n\nThe second is whether you can be prosecuted about lying on the census.\n\nThere is indeed a law that makes lying on a census form a crime.\n\nRefusing to answer either the short Census form or the longer American Community Survey form is a violation of federal law (Title 13, United States Code, Section 221\\). Refusing to answer is punishable by a fine of $100, while giving false answers carries a fine of up to $500\\. (As a practical matter, the Census says fines of up to $5,000 can be imposed under Title 18, Section 3571\\.)\n\nSo, again, the answer is \"yes\" you can be prosecuted for lying on the census, but due to the obligation of the census to maintain confidentiality, knowing that a crime was committed or proving that you lied would be hard unless you did something to waive that right to confidentiality.\n\nStill, the person about whom the confidential information is maintained by the census can waive this confidentiality. 13 USC 9(a)(3\\).\n\nIn practice, a prosecution for lying about race on the census would probably be most viable if, for example, you did a TV interview or posted a YouTube video in which you took video of yourself filling in the race item on your census form with an answer while stating that you didn't self\\-identify as this race but were just screwing with the government, and then showed yourself submitting that form.\n\nThus, while the prohibition against lying on the census about race is virtually toothless, it does have enough teeth to make it possible to prosecuted someone who openly and publicly defies the requirement to be truthful on the census and admits to doing so, which can still have some utility in discouraging some kinds of open revolts calculated at undermining the integrity of the census.\n\nAlso, even if you don't \"admit\" that you are insincere that isn't the end of the analysis. They can't dispute your self\\-identification with biological facts, but they can dispute that your answer is a sincere self\\-identification with either your own confession to the contrary or with circumstantial evidence that indicates you are lying (e.g. you fill out every other form before and after with a different answer and have a known animosity towards the census). If a jury believed beyond a reasonable doubt based upon circumstantial evidence that your answer was not sincere, it could find your testimony to be not credible and convict you anyway.\n\n> If there are no lies, what purpose is served by having such a\n> definition?\n\nThe vast majority of people, facing no negative consequences for telling the truth, if they have cooperated enough to fill out the form at all, will try to fill it out consistently with the instructions. And, a significant share of all census responses are provided by government employees whose duty and purpose is to try to provide a correct answer.\n\nAlso, most people comply with the laws even in the face of zero enforcement. For example, [it has been more than 40 years since the last person was prosecuted for not filling out a census form](http://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2014/jan/09/us-census-bureau/americans-must-answer-us-census-bureau-survey-law-/), even though it is crime not to do so, in part, because most people try to obey the law. And, compliance with the burden of filling out a census form is quite high.\n\n> What's the value (who benefits) in making what used to be a fuzzy but\n> more or less factual item about national and ethnic origins into a\n> belief\\-based one, in effect making race into a religion.\n\nMany countries (not the U.S.) have a religion question in their census as well, and this isn't problematic where it is done, or in surveys asking questions about religion, although being clear on definitions can be important (e.g. in the case of a religious v. ancestral or ethnic v. self\\-identified definition of who is a Jew).\n\nI strongly suspect that the differences in how people respond to the question arising from a national or ethnic origin definition, and a definition based upon self\\-identification, are negligible at the statistical level. A century or so from now, when census records are made public, it will be possible to confirm this definitively by examining how the same individual's race was reported on half a dozen or more successive census forms. In non\\-census contexts, this shift in the definition has not produced any statistically meaningful differences in how people respond.\n\nAlso, if anything, the new definition based on self\\-identification may be more useful to researchers who are trying to examine socially coherent communities, and it makes the race data slightly more comparable to data, for example, on religion and on sexual orientation (from non\\-census sources).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided, under what circumstances could someone potentially be prosecuted for lying about their race on the U.S. Census?\n\nA) If they choose a race that doesn't match their biological ancestry\nB) If they select a race different from what they chose on previous census forms\nC) If they publicly admit to intentionally providing false information on the census\nD) If they choose more than one racial category on the form\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The information states that while it's difficult to prosecute someone for lying about race on the census due to confidentiality rules, it could be possible if someone openly admits to providing false information. Specifically, the passage mentions that prosecution might be viable if someone \"did a TV interview or posted a YouTube video in which you took video of yourself filling in the race item on your census form with an answer while stating that you didn't self-identify as this race but were just screwing with the government.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the census explicitly states that race is based on self-identification, not biological definitions. \n\nOption B is not necessarily grounds for prosecution, as people's self-identification can change over time.\n\nOption D is explicitly allowed by the census, which states that \"People may choose to report more than one race to indicate their racial mixture.\"\n\nThe key factor for potential prosecution is the public admission of intentionally providing false information, not the specific race chosen or how it compares to previous answers or biological ancestry."}, "19": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1996/how-to-make-sure-my-website-complies-with-things-like-coppa", "docs_id": 1996, "title": "How to make sure my website complies with things like COPPA?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I want to start an online browser game following all laws.\n\nA few days ago I heard of [COPPA \\- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.coppa.org/).

During the case it's established that Alice violated the law first, causing Bob to take revenge (and also violating the law in the process). Logically the court would punish both of them, but Alice persists in litigating because she believes the law will be harsher on Bob than on her. However, during the case, Bob dies. Now the court cannot penalize Bob, so Alice is no longer interested and wants to withdraw the case.\n\nIs the court still obliged to rule against Alice, or do they dismiss the case?

If facts come out showing that Alice violated the law, the local prosecutor **could**, but need not, file a criminal case against Alice. If the prosecutor does not file such a case, Alice's worst possible outcome is to get no damages, with costs and fees awarded to Bob (or his estate).\n\nIf Bob dies and Alice wishes to drop the case, there is no obvious reason not to permit it, unless Bob or his estate has counter\\-sued. Bob (or his estate) might ask for costs and legal fees, and perhaps sanctions for a frivolous suit. The court might well asses whether to grand such a costs order before or as it dismisses the case. ;\n\nThe question seems to confuse the idea of a civil lawsuit and that of a criminal prosecution. In an Civil lawsuit, one person (or company) (the plaintiff) claims that another (or several others) (the defendant) have violated an agreement, or have in some other way caused legal injury. For example, if Alice claims that she had a contract with Bob and Bob violated the terms that would be a civil suit. Or if Alice claims that Bob infringed her copyright, or slandered her, or falsely advertised something or any of many other possible situations. The case would be *Alice C vs Bob D*.\n\nHowever, if Alice accuses Bob of having stolen from her, or punched her, or raped her, that woulds be a criminal accusation. The police would investigate, and if they found evidence to support the accusation, the local prosecutor could (but need not) file a case, which would be something like *State of Franklin vs Bob D* IN THE CRIMINAL COURT. Alice would be a witness, but not the plaintiff. If the investigation found that Alice committed a crime also, the prosecutor might file, *State of Franklin vs Alice C* Or the prosecutor might file both cases, or neither. The prosecutor has wide discretion whether or not to prosecute in any particular case, even when the evidence is clear. Neither Alice nor Bob could insist that either criminal case be dropped. Only the prosecutor, or the Judge, could do that.\n\nA criminal court is a different court from a civil court, and in many places a given judge hears only one or the other type of case.

The civil lawsuit and potential criminal actions are separate matters handled by different court systems. The civil court dealing with Alice's breach of contract claim against Bob cannot directly impose criminal penalties. Any criminal charges would need to be pursued separately by a prosecutor in criminal court, based on the evidence that emerged during the civil trial. If Bob dies and Alice wants to withdraw the lawsuit, the civil court can generally allow this (unless there are counter-claims), and is not obligated to rule on any potential criminal actions by Alice.

As to whether or not US citizens actually have these rights, Constitutional scholars can and will argue back and forth on that without making a real decision, partly due to the non\\-specific nature of the rights described in your quote.\n\nIt's important to note that the quote you provided is actually from the [US Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence), which declared that the 13 colonies were no longer going to be British colonies, but rather their own separate nation (keep in mind that from a British perspective, this was treason).\n\nThe actual rights that US citizens possess are granted primarily by the [US Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution) and its amendments (especially the first ten, also known as the Bill of Rights). This forms the basic foundation for our governmental system, on which all other parts of it are built. While many people feel that the wording of the Declaration of Independence should be used to help interpret the Constitution, there's nothing in the Constitution that formally states that. Historically, it's also important to recognize that the current Constitution is not the original one \\- the first document formalizing the federal government of the US was the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation), which was the law of the land for over a decade before being superseded.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about unalienable rights in the United States is most accurate?\n\nA) Unalienable rights are explicitly granted and defined in the U.S. Constitution.\nB) The Declaration of Independence is the primary legal document that ensures unalienable rights for U.S. citizens.\nC) The concept of unalienable rights, while mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, is not legally binding in U.S. law.\nD) The Articles of Confederation provide the strongest legal basis for unalienable rights in the United States.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The concept of unalienable rights, while famously mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, is not legally binding in U.S. law. The Declaration of Independence, which contains the phrase about unalienable rights, was a political document declaring independence from Britain, not a legal framework for the new nation. The actual rights of U.S. citizens are primarily defined by the Constitution and its amendments, especially the Bill of Rights. While the Declaration's principles may influence constitutional interpretation, there is no formal requirement to do so. The Articles of Confederation, which preceded the Constitution, also did not explicitly address these rights. Therefore, while the idea of unalienable rights is important in American political philosophy, it does not have direct legal force in the way that constitutional rights do."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64952/under-what-laws-did-israel-evict-palestinians-from-their-homes", "docs_id": 64952, "title": "Under what laws did Israel evict Palestinians from their homes?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to the BBC news last night, the latest violence in Israel / Palestine began after Palestinians were evicted from their homes in favour of Israelis.

He hires a good lawyer to defend him in criminal court, and so while charges are pressed by a number of his guests his case doesn't make it to trial. However, he's sued in civil court and found to owe medical fees and compensation equalling $50,000 per guest, for 40 guests, for total damages of $2 million. Bob earns roughly $45,000 per year, and so paying back these damages would take him 45 years, therefore he decides to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n\nIs he still required to pay back his $2 million in debts? What about the guests, do they simply not receive their compensation? What if they depend on this compensation to pay medical expenses?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a comprehensive overview of Chapter 7 bankruptcy at [http://www.uscourts.gov/services\\-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy\\-basics/chapter\\-7\\-bankruptcy\\-basics](http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-7-bankruptcy-basics).\n\nGenerally, Chapter 7 bankruptcy does *discharge* debts, so that they are no longer legally owed. (The word \"forgiven\" isn't usually used in this context, since it tends to refer to voluntary action by the creditor.) This happens *after* the debtor's assets (with certain exceptions) are liquidated by the bankruptcy trustee to pay the debts as much as possible, so in any case, the creditors would collect as much as those assets were worth.\n\nThere are several exceptions to discharging debts:\n\n> An individual receives a discharge for most of his or her debts in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. A creditor may no longer initiate or continue any legal or other action against the debtor to collect a discharged debt. But not all of an individual's debts are discharged in chapter 7\\. Debts not discharged include debts for alimony and child support, certain taxes, debts for certain educational benefit overpayments or loans made or guaranteed by a governmental unit, debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity, debts for death or personal injury caused by the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle while the debtor was intoxicated from alcohol or other substances, and debts for certain criminal restitution orders. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a). The debtor will continue to be liable for these types of debts to the extent that they are not paid in the chapter 7 case. Debts for money or property obtained by false pretenses, debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, and debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity will be discharged unless a creditor timely files and prevails in an action to have such debts declared nondischargeable.\n\nIn your example, if the guests can prove that Bob caused them \"willful and malicious injury\" then those debts will not be discharged, and Bob will continue to owe them whatever his assets didn't cover.\n\nIt might not help much. They might be able to [garnish Bob's wages](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/question-what-percentage-of-wages-can-28048.html) up to 25% of his disposable income. If we suppose Bob can show he needs half his income for basic living expenses, that leaves them $5625 per year, or $140 per guest per year. \n\nThere are other reasons why Bob might not be able to successfully file Chapter 7 at all. See the link above; for instance the rules on \"abusive\" filing.\n\nOtherwise, yes, the debts would be discharged. \n\n> What about the guests, do they simply not receive their compensation?\n\nRight, if the debt is discharged, they will get whatever Bob's assets can cover and then no more. But as we've seen, Bob's income is so small relative to his debts that they were never going to receive much anyway. A debtor can only pay what he has, court order or no.

According to the information provided, debts for \"willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity\" are not dischargeable in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. If Bob's guests can prove that he intentionally poisoned the pool water, causing them injury, the debt would likely not be discharged.

The contract clause is likely valid as it allocates risk for events outside the control of the contracting parties. As stated in the documentation, contracts can allocate risks related to third-party actions, and this does not necessarily make them insurance or gambling contracts. The clause doesn't resemble gambling (eliminating option A) as it's not primarily for wagering on an outcome. It's not automatically an unenforceable penalty clause (eliminating option B) if it covers actual or estimated costs rather than being punitive.

Instead, I inherited U.S. citizenship at the moment I became an LPR (Legal Permanent Resident), because I [both had a parent with citizenship and I was under the age of 18](https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/citizenship-through-parents).\n\nThere is no paperwork to file to inherit citizenship this way, it is completely automatic and as a result there are people in the U.S. that do not know they are citizens. In order to assert that I was now a U.S. citizen, I just had to apply for either a U.S. passport, or a Certificate of Citizenship. There is no deadline to do this, because I was a fully\\-fledged citizen from the day of approval of my Permanent Residence application.\n\nWhen I applied for my U.S. passport, I simply had to prove that I was a child at the time of receiving my Green Card, and that one parent was a U.S. citizen.\n\nThis is exactly what I had to provide the German consulate. I provided my own birth certificate, my I\\-485 form (with approval date) and my father's naturalisation certificate. Those were accepted without question.\n\nTo obtain a copy of my Form I\\-485, I had to file a FOIA request\\-\\-I used a Form G\\-639 to make it easier\\-\\-and I emailed it to [uscis.foia@uscis.dhs.gov](http://mailto:uscis.foia@uscis.dhs.gov).\n\nI did attempt to get a copy of my passport application, as I filed that while under 18, but I was told by the State Department that they did not have a copy of it *(curiously, several months later a full copy of my original passport application arrived by post from the State Department...)*. The response was not a surprise as when I applied for a passport at the age of 17, I was told by the official that they do not keep a record of my application, so I should also have a Passport Card in case my passport goes missing and I must prove citizenship.\n\nUnder German citizenship law, one loses citizenship when \"voluntarily\" obtaining another citizenship. The reason that I did not lose my citizenship when I became a U.S. citizen was because: I was a child, and it happened automatically. Therefore, it is not considered voluntary. Luckily, I did not have to explain this, since it was a consulate in the U.S. (Houston, TX) that I visited, they were well aware of the way in which I inherited U.S. citizenship. However, I had some trouble when dealing with the London embassy as they did not understand all of the U.S. citizenship qualifiers.\n\nI hope this helps anyone else that finds themselves in a similar situation!

Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969, art 2(a). As one can infer from that, **agreement** is a broader term (encompassing informal agreements, for instance). Of course, the fact that something is called an agreement does not mean it is not, technically, also a treaty.\n\n(Re \u00b6\u00b62\\&3\\) The consequences depend on the particular treaty and on what the parties have agreed on. The WTO, for instance, operates a sophisticated dispute resolution mechanism (see the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispute_settlement_in_the_World_Trade_Organization)). If a particular treaty contains no such stipulations, it us up to the parties to decide what course of action they intend to pursue if they believe that another party does not fulfill its treaty obligations. States are generally bound by art 2(3\\) of the UN Charter, which provides that \"all Members shall settle their international disputes by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security, and justice, are not endangered\". In resolving disputes, they must furthermore obey art 33(1\\): \"The parties to any dispute, the continuance of which is likely to endanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all, seek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, or other peaceful means of their own choice.\"\n\nJudicial means of dispute resolution are available, most notably in the form of arbitration courts/panels and the ICJ; however, this always requires that the two countries agree to bring their dispute before such a body. It is important to keep in mind that there is no \"World Court\". If country A believes that country B violates a treaty and B refuses to take action, then that's it.

It is more attractive in the U.S.\n\n### Long Answer\n\n**England and Wales v. U.S. Analysis Compared**\n\nThe big factor that distinguishes England and Wales (and most but not all other Commonwealth countries) from the U.S., is that England and Wales has a system of title registration, in which certificates of title (possibly virtual these days rather than on a dead tree, I don't know, New Zealand recently made that transition), while almost all U.S. land records are maintained in one of three thousand or so separate county race\\-notice recording statute systems (which differ in fine details from state to state). The U.S. system is more flexible but also more prone to cases of title defects. The title registration system virtually eliminates the need for title insurance in commercial real estate transactions (i.e. as opposed to donative transfers of real estate, not as opposed to residential real estate).\n\n**In England and Wales**\n\nIt is possible to achieve this goal and the approach suggested would rarely be the optimal solution.\n\nThe most straightforward way to do it would be to vest title not equally, but as an unequal tenancy in common with percentages stated on the face of the deed. But this might be a problem if the amount of contribution to the mortgage and capital improvements in the premises weren't known in advance when the parties took title.\n\nAnother solution which would achieve this end would be to vest title in an entity (including a possible general partnership or trust) which has provisions governing these matters. Entity ownership of some sort would also generally eliminate the partition rights of the co\\-owners, although a covenant to eliminate the right of partition could also be recorded in connection with the registered title without ending its 50\\-50 ownership character of record.\n\nIf the co\\-owners are married, title is a somewhat secondary matter and a premarital agreement (a.k.a. a [prenuptial agreement](https://www.netlawman.co.uk/dl/pre-nuptial-agreements)) could probably achieve this end, at least in cases involving divorce or inheritance, although the marital rights established by the prenuptial or postnuptial agreement might be inchoate rather than vested and currently in force as a present interest.\n\nWith unmarried co\\-owners you could have a co\\-tenancy agreement (also called a [tenants\\-in\\-common agreement](https://www.netlawman.co.uk/d/tenants-in-common-agreement) and closely related to a [joint ownership agreement](https://www.netlawman.co.uk/d/residential-property-joint-ownership-agreement)) (or a domestic partnership agreement (also called a [cohabitation agreement](https://www.netlawman.co.uk/d/cohabitation-agreement)) which typically has a broader scope), but if that agreement were contractual, rather than reflected in the land registration as a percentage tenancy in common or as a covenant (which would be problematic in this case where the deed and the covenant contradict each other), the remedies would probably be limited if not in the land registry. Vis\\-a\\-vis the world, for example, in eminent domain proceedings or a probate proceeding at the death of one of the two co\\-owners, the co\\-owners would be treated as 50\\-50 owners.\n\nA tenancy\\-in\\-common agreement included in the land registry would typically not dictate how the co\\-owners would manage the property, and instead would merely state their ownership rights. The other agreements would often contain management provisions for the co\\-owned property.\n\nThe contract would not create *in rem* rights in the property, unless it is recorded in the land registry (which a tenancy\\-in\\-common agreement often would be, effectively amending the 50\\-50 deed, but which the other forms of agreement generally would not be). But the parties would have a legal obligation to settle up between themselves following a liquidation event such as an eminent domain award or a sale of the property or a foreclosure, with *in personam* litigation between the co\\-owners, if necessary. In most circumstances, this would be equivalent, albeit a bit different procedurally. But, if a co\\-owner having an obligation under the contract to the other co\\-owner, were, for example, insolvent and there were other creditors of the insolvent co\\-owner with a higher priority for payment than the solvent co\\-owner of the property, the solvent co\\-owner of the property would lose out.\n\nAny such agreement would have to be in a signed writing and not oral, as it would concern an interest in property.\n\nI don't know how such a conflict between a 50\\-50 deed and a side contract would play out under the laws of England and Wales, for example, for purposes of taxes owed upon the sale of the property at a profit or a loss, or for purposes of determining someone's net worth for some financial accounting report in connection, for example, with a loan application in which the borrower is a limited liability entity and a co\\-owner is a guarantor of a loan.\n\n**In the U.S.**\n\nIn the U.S., any document signed and notarized by the owners of the property or the affected parties, that is recorded in the real estate records of the county where the real estate is located, that adequately describes the property in question with a legal description, is given legal effect as a vested property right superseding any previous recorded document. Even if it isn't notarized, the document could also be supported by an affidavit or acknowledgement separate from the primary recorded document itself.\n\nSo, if there was a 50\\-50 tenancy in common deed of record, and then the co\\-owners recorded a subsequent tenancy\\-in\\-common or domestic partnership or premarital agreement, the recorded agreement would as a matter of property rights, modify the original deed. And, in most jurisdictions which have a \"race\\-notice\" recording rule, even if the agreement were not recorded, it would be effective to create a property right and would not simply be a side contractual agreement that is *in personam* only, as to anyone who had actual notice of the existence and terms of the agreement. So, this kind of solution is more attractive in the U.S. than in England and Wales or most other commonwealth jurisdictions.\n\nOf course, an uneven tenancy\\-in\\-common deed, or an entity ownership would still be solutions that are available, and these options (possibly with a waiver of a right to partition) might be desirable in some circumstances.\n\nIn the U.S., some of the main downsides to entity ownership (all dependent upon both state and federal law) would be the loss of favorable capital gains tax rates, if the entity is a C corporation, the loss of the exclusion of gain on the sale of an owner occupied residence for capital gains tax purposes, the loss of a right to a homestead exemption from creditors, the loss of qualification for favorable mortgage program only available for owner occupied residences, the loss of favorable property tax treatment for owner occupied residences, and the loss of favorable treatment in determining eligibility for means tested government programs such as the Medicaid Long Term Care (i.e. nursing home) benefit.

Does\n>  it mean the consumer should pay the fee, and will somehow be\n>  reimbursed at some point?\n\nThe clause about the filing fee being submitted with the Demand is largely inconsequential.\n\nIf the filer pays out of pocket and prevails in the proceedings, he is entitled to reimbursement. Or it could also occur as you outline: The client could ask the business to pay upfront (although the latter may deny the request, leaving the client no option but to cover the filing fee if he wishes to initiate proceedings).\n\n> what is a frivolous claim or relief?\n\nThe term *frivolous claim* refers to accusations where the alleged \"misconduct\" does not merit the pursuit of proceedings (in this case, arbitration). An example of frivolous claim would be a client's complaint that the Uber driver's saying of the F\\-word hurt the client's feelings and caused him or her severe emotional distress.\n\nBy the same token, *frivolous relief* generally refers to the pursuit of compensation that is unreasonable or vastly disproportionate for the misconduct at issue. An example of frivolous relief would be a client's grievance that \"*the Uber driver was late and I missed my flight to Disneyland, so I want an indemnification of $400,000,000, and that the driver's license be revoked*\".\n\nAlthough common sense dictates that proceedings should be brought only for meritorious causes, some ignorant people and many lawyers boasting their so\\-called \"good standing\" are incredibly fond of making frivolous claims/allegations. Uber's clause is a gentle reminder to both sorts of individuals.\n\n> Could a dispute over a small amount be considered frivolous?\n\nIf the entire grievance is about a very small amount and nothing else, the dispute might be considered frivolous from the standpoint of the disproportionate waste of (quasi\\-)judicial resources needed to address it.\n\nThe context helps determining whether a small amount leads to the conclusion that a claim is frivolous. An Uber client's complaint that the change given to him was a nickel instead of a dime would be frivolous, whereas the nature of Uber's business makes it reasonable that grievances may stem from allegedly improper surcharges of \\-\\-say\\-\\- $20\\.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A consumer wants to file a demand for arbitration against Uber using the American Arbitration Association (AAA).

The applicable Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code has been adopted in every U.S. jurisdiction and is identical in this respect, although a few states would have consumer protection laws that impose special responsibilities in sales of used motor vehicles in particular that are not present under the Uniform Commercial Code that could apply in this case.\n\nThere might be common law liability for fraudulent concealment if the defect not disclosed is something that a seller in good conscience under accepted commercial practice in such sales would have been obligated to disclose (as determined by the judge and jury after the fact). The defect would also have to be a latent defect not visible upon casual inspection, to give rise to liability. Such a claim would also depend upon a determination of whether Bob actually relied on Alice's non\\-disclosure of the defect, and whether it was reasonable under the circumstances for him to do so in light of the fact that the car was already 20 years old. And, Bob would have to prove that Alice knew about the defect and its seriousness at the time of the sale, which would be hard to prove if she didn't affirmatively disclose this fact to him. These basic principles of liability are quite similar between U.S. states, although they aren't entirely uniform (in particular, some states would have a common law sale of used goods exclusion from fraudulent concealment liability).\n\nEven then, whether or not the fraud liability would extend to the reduced value of the car without the disclosure, or would also extend to the personal injuries and property damage caused by the non\\-disclosure, could be a close issue upon which the law in different U.S. states would not be uniform.\n\nIt isn't impossible that the fraud claim would prevail, but both in pretrial motion practice, and on the merits at trial, this would be an uphill battle for Bob that he would be much more likely to lose than to win, even if he managed to overcome the procedural hurdles prior to trial to get the case in front of a jury.\n\nFurthermore, most states would evaluate the case under a comparative fault regime, so some of the fault, and some of the damages, would be allocated to third\\-parties involved in the accident (if any) and to Bob's comparative fault in not being sufficiently careful by failing to have the car professionally inspected. In all likelihood, even if Bob won, he would not recover 100% of his damages.\n\nAlso, while Alice's insurance company would probably defend her in this lawsuit (on the theory that she was innocent of the claims), if Bob prevailed, Alice's insurance policies wouldn't pay anything that was owed on the claim. This is because the claim is based upon fraud, and since insurance is not allowed to cover successful claims that the insured made fraudulent statements as a matter of public policy under the law in every U.S. jurisdiction.

Additionally, local laws may vary in how they treat verbal agreements in tenancy situations.
