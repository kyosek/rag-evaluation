Both of us, and also our baby (2 months old) are the citizen of another (EU) country.\n\nRecently she became very crazy, and I don't know, what to do.\n\n1. She does not eat. The case is serious, she lost about ten kg in the last weeks.\n2. She is very agressive, (unfairly) critical about everything.\n3. She continously threats me by divorce, without specifying a reason.\n\nI think, she might have [post\\-natal depression](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/post-natal-depression/), caused by that she can not sleep more than 4 hours at once since months.

She might get self\\-harming or more bad.\n3. She might simply pack and go back to home.\n4. She can also file for divorce, either by Germany or by home (if she does it, she will probably first go home, and then file for divorce there).\n\nI am thinking on, that I could call some \"Jugendschutz\"\\-thing (state agency for youth protection).

The pediatrician in particular should have contacts to support groups, etc. The doctor may also decide that she needs to go on medication. \n\nIf she's breastfeeding, ask her to stop and go to formula. Either of you can prep the overnight bottles in the evening so it's faster. You take the middle of night feedings for a while. \n\nIf she doesn't want to stop, see if she can pump extra during the day so that you can bottle feed overnight. This is to try to allow her to sleep longer. I don't know if it will work. We used formula with our twins and it made things a lot easier for us. Did they have more illnesses? Maybe.

This is recommended before calling Jugendschutz or taking any drastic measures. The medical professionals can provide appropriate resources, support, and potentially prescribe medication if necessary.

The tenant's decision not to rent the apartment does not negate their responsibility to pay fees they agreed to during the application process.

Could it be challenged on constitutional grounds?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an open question in Colorado, where there's an ongoing challenge to the state's supermajority requirement in [*Kerr v. Hickenlooper*](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20170505a91). The state requires a supermajority for tax or spending increases, and several lawmakers challenged the law as violating the Guarantee Clause, which guarantees each state a republican form of government.\n\nThe case has been going on for a long time. It's about seven years old now, and they're still arguing about who has standing to bring the lawsuit. The latest development is that [no one had standing](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20170505a91), but that decision is currently being appealed in the Tenth Circuit. \n\nA bigger problem than standing, though, may be justiciability. In [*Huddleston v. Sawyer*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/or-supreme-court/1485393.html), the Supreme Court of Oregon, rejected a challenge to supermajority requirements for reducing citizen\\-approved sentences for crimes, and in [*Lefkovits v. State Board of Elections*](https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/400/1005/1367220/), the Northern District of Illinois did the same with respect to judicial retention votes. Both courts concluded that supermajority requirements were a political issue, not a legal one. \n\nThe justiciability concerns should be tempered by two considerations. First, there's an argument in Kerr that because taxes and spending are such core legislative functions, that it should be harder to uphold restrictions on the legislature's ability to vote on them. Second, there's U.S. Supreme Court precedent in [*New York v. U.S.*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-543.ZO.html) suggesting \\-\\- but not deciding \\-\\- that the questions about justiciability are overblown:\n\n> The view that the Guarantee Clause implicates only nonjusticiable\n>  political questions has its origin in *Luther v.

The passage indicates that the constitutionality of supermajority requirements for tax increases remains an open and unresolved question in U.S. law. The ongoing case of Kerr v. Hickenlooper in Colorado demonstrates that legal challenges to such requirements are still being pursued, with issues of standing and justiciability yet to be fully resolved. The passage also mentions that while some state courts have rejected challenges to supermajority requirements in other contexts, there are arguments that tax and spending votes might be treated differently.

The investor does not need to be a dishonest person to decide that you might need to be demoted from CEO at some point, for example. You may differ on the need for future investments or the need to both accept dilution to bring in the investment. If you are the CEO they could legitimately worry that you will spend their money in an wasteful manner. \n\nUsually an angel is a minority shareholder and they need to protect themselves from you diluting or otherwise screwing them. They would insist on a shareholder agreement that protected them, usually worked out with the help of their attorney and yours. If the angel has a good reputation in the local start\\-up community you may be able to find an attorney to work for the company who will get paid by the company after the investment comes in.\n\nA note \\- an investor has a duty to themselves to protect their money. If they become a board member they also have a fiduciary duty to the company but not to you personally. In their fiduciary duty to the company they could honestly think the best course of action is to bring in an investor or a new CEO in a way that is detrimental to you.

However, ten\\-pin bowling was not banned by any state. I don't see any difference in the two sports other than the number of pins and a few minor differences in the rules and equipment, so I think any reason applicable to one should be applicable. Why wasn't ten\\-pin bowling banned, for the same reasons as nine\\-pin bowling? If the reasons were no longer applicable after ten\\-pin bowling was invented, why didn't most states re\\-allow nine\\-pin bowling?\n\nMy reference is [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFPJf-wKTd0), and the part of it that applies to this question starts at 4:39 and ends at 4:59:\n\n> When the game made its way over to America, nine\\-pin bowling was banned because it promoted gambling. The legend goes that people cleverly came up with ten\\-pin bowling to get around the law. Whoa, totally different game. Today in the US, nine\\-pin bowling is only played in Texas because it was the one state that didn't ban it, instead charging it tax.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Moral panic\n-----------\n\n[Nine\\-pin bowling](https://www.bowlingoverhaul.com/9-pin-bowling-the-game-once-considered-illegal/) was the [violent video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_and_video_games) of its age \\- the people who were in power didn\u2019t like it, didn\u2019t like the type of people who played it, linked it with vice \\- like gambling and laziness \\- and, therefore, banned it.\n\nIt\u2019s a perennial that older people, who tend to be the ones in power, despair over the dissipation of youth and the disintegration of society that will inevitably result. Or rich people, who also are the ones in power, despairing over the recreational activities of working\\-class people.\n\nIt\u2019s probable that there was gambling involved \\- people will bet on anything, and this was a game of skill and chance, a perfect vehicle for gambling. The games and gambling would not have been regulated, so there would almost surely be some criminals who got involved. However, the biggest driver was taking this grain of truth and then blowing it out of all proportion.\n\nAs other answers have pointed out, the laws usually did not specify the number of pins. Eventually, the moral panic declined, and the laws were repealed. However, times had changed, and the 10\\-pin form of the game is what came back backed by larger commercial interests rather than the artisan style of 9\\-pins. 10\\-pin bowling uses much bigger alleys with gutters and is suitable for mechanisation. a 9\\-pin alley can fit in a relatively small room, and standing the pins back up again is not much more demanding than pulling pool balls out of pockets.\n\nIt's not unusual that after government suppression is lifted, things come back different to the way they were before the suppression started. For example, [prohibition](https://theconversation.com/how-prohibition-changed-the-way-americans-drink-100-years-ago-129854) fundamentally changed how Americans drank \\- before, men in saloons drank; after, it was an activity of all genders at home and in bars and restaurants.

This allowed ten-pin bowling to emerge as a legal alternative, exploiting a loophole in the existing laws. The text mentions that \"the laws usually did not specify the number of pins,\" implying that the bans were narrowly focused on nine-pin bowling. This allowed ten-pin bowling to develop without legal restrictions, even though it was very similar to the banned nine-pin version.

Under Wisconsin law, how does Alex's illegal possession of the firearm and his initial provocation affect his ability to claim self-defense?\n\nA) Alex cannot claim self-defense at all because he was illegally possessing a firearm.\n\nB) Alex can claim self-defense without any additional burden, as his attempt to flee negates his initial provocation.\n\nC) Alex can claim self-defense, but he must prove he exhausted every other reasonable means to escape before using deadly force.\n\nD) Alex cannot claim self-defense because his illegal possession of a firearm is considered intentional provocation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves several key aspects of Wisconsin's self-defense law:\n\n1. Alex's illegal possession of a firearm doesn't completely preclude a self-defense claim, but it does complicate matters.\n\n2. His initial brandishing of the weapon could be seen as \"unlawful conduct of a type likely to provoke others to attack,\" which falls under 939.48(2)(a).\n\n3. However, Alex's attempt to flee shows a good faith withdrawal from the fight, which can regain the privilege of self-defense under 939.48(2)(b).\n\n4. Even so, because Alex engaged in provocative unlawful conduct, he is held to a higher standard. He \"is not privileged to resort to the use of force intended or likely to cause death to the person's assailant unless the person reasonably believes he or she has exhausted every other reasonable means to escape from or otherwise avoid death or great bodily harm.\"\n\nTherefore, C is correct. Alex can claim self-defense, but he must prove he exhausted all other reasonable means of escape before resorting to deadly force. Options A and D are incorrect because illegal possession alone doesn't negate self-defense. B is incorrect because while fleeing helps Alex's case, it doesn't completely remove the additional burden created by his initial provocation."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26659/can-an-employer-pay-less-in-benefits-to-employees-on-a-family-healthcare-plan", "docs_id": 26659, "title": "Can an employer pay less in benefits to employees on a &#39;Family&#39; healthcare plan than employees on an &#39;Individual&#39; healthcare plan?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work at a community college in California.

While it may seem unfair that single employees receive greater benefits over time, the key factor is that all employees have the option to choose the 'Single' plan. This means there's no discrimination based on protected characteristics. The fact that some employees choose family coverage, despite potentially receiving less valuable benefits, is a personal decision based on their circumstances. Employment law generally allows for different benefit structures as long as they're not discriminatory and are applied consistently.

The name \"Advil\" is likely a registered trademark for pharmaceutical products. However, trademarks are typically registered for specific goods or services. Using the name for a completely different product (like a font) may be possible, but it could still lead to legal challenges.\n\nThe correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The pharmaceutical company could potentially claim trademark infringement or pursue a case of \"passing off\" if they believe the use of \"Advil\" for a font misrepresents their brand or could cause confusion in the marketplace.\n\n2. Even though fonts and pain relievers are very different products, the company might argue that the use of their well-known brand name could damage their reputation or dilute their trademark.\n\n3.

According to the documentation, it is not up to the victim (in this case, Sarah) to determine if charges are brought against the arrested person. This decision lies with the prosecutor. Even if Sarah doesn't \"press charges,\" the prosecutor may decide to continue with the case. If John is convicted, it will appear on his criminal record. However, New York State law does allow for sealing of records under certain circumstances, such as when cases are dismissed or the accused is found not guilty, but this requires a court order.

Therefore, the diplomatic mission's data processing activities related to its diplomatic functions are not subject to GDPR or UK data protection laws.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because diplomatic missions are not automatically considered data controllers under GDPR.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the exemption applies to both GDPR and UK data protection laws for activities falling under diplomatic functions.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the diplomatic mission's exemption is not based on the citizenship of the data subjects, but on the nature of its activities falling outside EU law scope."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7818/is-there-a-way-to-open-source-license-my-music", "docs_id": 7818, "title": "Is there a way to open source license my music?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I own all components of the songs\\- beat, samples, vocals.

Some laws are based on what some courts and legislatures think are moral obligations.\n\nWe think cannibals have a moral obligation not to eat people; cannibals think non\\-cannibals are fools for passing up a good BBQ.

High crimes or misdemeanor are *legal* definitions, not moral, and depend on previous cases of what a crime or misdemeanor is.\n\nInsobriety can be illegal; there are laws on the books concerning public drunkenness. But in the contest of POTUS (one who is hopefully not passed out on the sidewalk in front of the WH), it remains to be seen if insobriety is a high crime or misdemeanor. That would be up to the House Judiciary Committee and US House of Representatives, which by Constitutional powers handles impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe Twenty\\-fifth Amendment outlines who succeeds the president due to \"Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office,\" but it does not state who has the power to declare a President incapacitated.\n\nIt's possible that a POTUS who incapacitates himself with alcohol is guilty of a \"high crime or misdemeanor.\" But how drunk do you have to be to be incapacitated? Drunk enough to think a Game Boy is the nuclear football? Again, that's up to the House.\n\nSome past presidents have arguably been functional alcoholics (or functional recovered alcoholics.)

Bribery involves offering something of value to influence the actions of a person with a legal duty.

The action is not limited to New York state laws and is generally illegal across the US.

Molloy of Arizona wrote a book titled *The Fraternity: Lawyers and Judges in Collusion* that was published in 2004\\.\n\nAmong things alleged in that book are that lawyers, in part because of their detailed and extensive knowledge of the system, have ways of unofficially but effectively influencing the content of the law, and they have done so in ways that make lawyers richer.

That question has additional aspects that are not relevant to my question. Specifically, I am interested in faculty position at a university and not edge conditions like female sports players. For comparison, in Australia there have been [women\\-only faculty positions](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/19/university-of-melbourne-mathematics-school-advertises-women-only-positions).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, no: Sex is a protected characteristic and discriminating between applicants based on a protected characteristic is prohibited so an employer is not free to hire only men or women simply because they would prefer to. But there are exceptions, like \u201coccupational requirements\u201d (which is probably what your athlete example is getting at).\n\nAnd, looking at the example you provided, it might \\- with a caveat \\- fall under an exception called \u201cpositive action\u201d, as provided in section 158 and 159 of the Equality Act. However, the conditions under which this is allowed are tightly regulated and it would come down to the specifics (e.g. whether the number of women in that activity is \u201cdisproportionately low\u201d).\n\nThe caveat is that the Equality Act specifies that the protected characteristic (i.e. sex/gender in this case) can only be taken into account when choosing between two equally qualified candidates. I don't know whether this was ever tested in court but this would probably preclude advertising a position as \u201cwomen\\-only\u201d (as opposed to soliciting applications from both men and women and then selecting a woman with the explicit goal of increasing the number of women in your department).\n\nThe Government Equalities Office [guide on positive action](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/85014/positive-action-recruitment.pdf) also contains language strongly suggesting that limiting the search to women from the get go might not pass muster: \n\n> Positive action can be used at any time in the recruitment or promotion process. \n> \n> \n> \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> However, it is expected that, in the vast majority of cases, any use of positive action as a \u2018tie\\-breaker\u2019 between candidates who are of equal merit for a particular post will be at the end of the recruitment \n>  process, at the actual point of appointment.\n> \n> \n> \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> In order to use positive action provisions in a tie\\-breaker situation, the employer must first establish that the candidates are of equal merit.\n\nNote that there is no such \u201cequally qualified\u201d clause in section 158, which deals with everything else than recruitment and promotion. Thus, it is perfectly fine to create a training programme that would be only open to women, if the goal is to increase the proportion of women in an activity where it is disproportionately low (an example provided by the same guide is a development programme \u201cto help female staff compete for management positions\u201d).\n\nIncidentally, all this is allowed under EU law (articles 5 and 7 of [Directive 2000/78/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32000L0078))."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A prestigious university in the UK wants to increase gender diversity in its mathematics department, where women are significantly underrepresented. Which of the following actions would be most likely to comply with the Equality Act of 2010?\n\nA) Advertise a \"women-only\" faculty position in mathematics\nB) Create a mentorship program exclusively for female mathematics students to encourage them to pursue academic careers\nC) Conduct a standard hiring process for a new faculty position, but give preference to equally qualified female candidates\nD) Automatically reject all male applicants for new faculty positions in mathematics for the next five years\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The Equality Act of 2010 generally prohibits discrimination based on protected characteristics, including sex. However, it does allow for \"positive action\" under certain circumstances to address underrepresentation.\n\nOption A is likely not compliant because advertising a position as \"women-only\" from the outset goes beyond what is typically allowed under the Act. The law specifies that protected characteristics can only be considered when choosing between equally qualified candidates.\n\nOption B would likely be permissible under Section 158 of the Act, which allows for measures to encourage participation by underrepresented groups. However, this doesn't directly address faculty hiring, which is the focus of the question.\n\nOption C aligns most closely with the provisions of the Equality Act. It allows for consideration of gender only as a \"tie-breaker\" between equally qualified candidates, which is explicitly permitted under Section 159 of the Act as a form of positive action in recruitment.\n\nOption D would be a clear violation of the Equality Act, as it involves blanket discrimination against male applicants, which is not permitted even as a positive action measure.\n\nTherefore, option C represents the approach most likely to comply with the Equality Act while still working towards increasing gender diversity in faculty positions."}}
