Let's say I sign a contract with a relative that says upon my death, you get X amount of money if I have enough money to service that debt, but there's no interest rate and if I have less money than that you just get all of my money. How do I get a debt written in a contract recognized by financial institutions? Are those even considered debts legally speaking? You can assume that the country is the U.S.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's say you have an actual contract where you give A something of value in consideration of which B gives you something of value. That way, the exchange is legally enforceable and is not just a cancellable promise. This is all written up clearly, and you become a creditor. One thing to bear in mind is that you may have to wait in line so that others are paid first. For example, taxes have to be paid, also secured creditors have to be paid. Nearly at the end of the list, unsecured creditors such as you are paid, and finally heirs can receive shares of what is left.\n\nI don't know what you mean by \"recognizing\" a debt, but what a financial institution could do is treat a debt as an asset, for the purposes of a loan. For instance, a bank might lend you $10,000 where you pledge your home as a thing of value that they can take in case you default on repayment. You cannot force a bank to accept a particular asset as collateral, so the answer to the \"how\" question is \"by persuasion\". Since your asset has an indefinite value between $0 and let's say $10,000, you would have to persuade the bank that there is negligible risk to them. In the case of property used as collateral, when you default the creditor can use the courts to seize your property and sell it, but they can't seize the property of a third party who owes you something, they would have to wait possibly for years for the third party to die and see what's left. Investment instruments might be used as collateral, but only if they can be liquidated reasonably promptly.\nThe risk to the bank is extremely high, but if you are very persuasive, they might accept such a debt as collateral."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A person has signed a contract with a relative stating that upon their death, the relative will receive either a specified amount of money or all of the person's remaining assets, whichever is less.

This type of contract creates an unsecured debt. In the event of the person's death, this debt would be paid after taxes and secured creditors are satisfied. The relative would be considered an unsecured creditor and would be near the end of the list for payment, before only the heirs. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because financial institutions do not automatically recognize such agreements as secured debts. \n\nAnswer B is wrong because the relative would not be a priority creditor; they would be an unsecured creditor near the end of the payment line. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because financial institutions are not legally obligated to accept any particular asset or contract as collateral for loans.

Microsoft*, Microsoft was accused of abusing its monopoly power by bundling. A prerequisite for this type of Sherman Act Section 2 claim is that the company must have monopoly power to abuse.\n\nMarket share is one of the primary measures courts use to determine if a company has monopoly powers, and therefore can be punished for abusing them. At the time of the Microsoft case, its market share was over 80% of all PCs and over 95% of Intel PCs.\n\nIn *United States v.

He wrote that market share of more than 90% \"is enough to constitute a monopoly; it is doubtful whether sixty or sixty\\-four percent would be enough; and certainly thirty\\-three per cent is not.\"\n\nWorldwide, iOS has about 15% of the smartphone OS market.

The burden of proof is on the city, but for civil cases, it's based on a preponderance of evidence rather than beyond reasonable doubt.

The law also states that anyone driving with the owner's permission is considered an agent of the owner, so the owner can be held responsible even if they weren't personally driving.

I know accompanied children who are not legally allowed to enter the United States can be detained or deported if they are caught, but my question is: ***Are those children themselves determined to be committing an illegal act in the eyes of the law?***\n\nIn other words, are the children considered responsible for their illegal entry, or are they seen as being \"brought\" into the country illegally by their parents/family?\n\nThis question is in reference to a first\\-offense entry, not the crime of re\\-entry after deportation.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nAfter some more research, it looks like the way *[unlawful presence](http://www.usimmigrationlawyers.com/resources/immigration-law/deportation/can-a-minor-accrue-unlawful-presence-us)* is determined is different for children than adults, but I still haven't found any definitive answer to the question above, though it *seems* to be \"yes.\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Illegal\" and \"breaking the law\" are rhetorically powerful, but less impressive than they seem. There are lots of people who are \"violating the law\" and subject to consequences for doing so, despite having never committed a crime, never having committed a tort, never having interfered with or trespassed on someone else's property, and never having breached a contract.\n\nA minor present in the U.S. who is not a citizen and not subject to a valid visa and has no valid claim to asylum is \"deportable\" because the minor doesn't have legal authorization to be in the U.S. Being \"deportable\" authorizes a legal consequence as a result of one's legal status, but it doesn't mean that you personally did anything wrong.\n\nSomeone who is deportable can be detained in an immigration jail pending deportation for a limited period of time. But, this is civil detention and not based upon personal wrongful conduct, it is based upon your legal status. It is analogous legally, to being placed in a Japanese internment camp during WWII due to your Japanese descent even if you are lawfully present in the U.S., when war powers authorized the detention notwithstanding a lack of any personal or particularize fault of those detained.\n\nIn the same vein, being born causes you to acquire multiple forms of legal status. You are the child of at least one person, usually two people, and sometimes more. You acquire citizenship and nationality which has certain legal consequences. You currently reside somewhere and being a resident of a place often has legal consequences (e.g. frequently, government benefits and rights to use public property). You gain intestate inheritance rights from lots of people. Through no fault of your own you gained various legal statuses and that had legal consequences. When you legal status changes, the consequences of your status changes, and this can happen entirely without fault. Children in particular often have legal rights in an immigration context that is mostly derivative of the legal status of their parents.\n\nBut, this legal status of the minor doesn't have to arise from any affirmative law breaking act of the minor. For example, the minor could (and often did) enter the U.S. in the custody of a parent pursuant to a valid temporary visa or a valid permanent visa subject to revocation, that is then revoked due to an action of a parent (e.g. committing a deportable crime) or inaction of a parent (e.g. failing to leave the U.S. when the visa expires) that the minor did not participate in at all and had no personal legal duty or ability to address.\n\nSimilarly, criminal liability for an immigration offense (which is the exception and not the rule) requires a certain amount of *mens rea* (i.e. intent) which a young children who accompanied a parent into the U.S. could totally lack. The child may not even know what a national boundary is, which country he is currently in, or what citizenship or lawful presence means under the law. \n\nFurther, a child has to have the ability to not break the law to have criminal liability in most cases, but is subject to the custody and control of their parent or guardian and has no choice regarding where the child travels or where the child resides. This is particularly obvious in the case of an infant, but legally the concept applies to any minor who is not emancipated."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given immigration law information:\n\nQuestion: A 7-year-old child enters the United States with their parents on a temporary visa.

The child's status becomes deportable when the visa expires, but this is a matter of legal status rather than personal wrongdoing. The child is not committing a criminal offense (ruling out A) because they lack the necessary intent (mens rea) and ability to control their presence in the country. However, lacking mens rea doesn't prevent deportability (ruling out B), as deportation is a civil matter based on legal status, not criminal culpability.

Arranging for a third party to pick up the packages or coordinating with law enforcement for a \"civil assist\" allows the customer to retrieve their property while respecting the ban and avoiding potential legal issues. This approach balances the customer's rights under the contract with the store owner's right to ban individuals from their property.\n\nOption A is incorrect as it could escalate the situation and potentially lead to trespassing charges. Option B is premature and may not be necessary if other solutions are available. Option D is incorrect and could result in legal consequences for the customer, as the ban is likely enforceable regardless of the contract terms."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61868/setting-a-copyright-for-the-future", "docs_id": 61868, "title": "Setting a copyright for the future", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know nothing about copyright but I'm pretty sure this isn't allowed.\n\nI am aware of a website showcasing a portfolio of work.

A factory is knowingly discharging emissions of a controlled pollutant at a level over the legal limit. They (and the insurer's underwriters) know they probably won't get caught, but if they do, the policy makes the softens the blow of getting caught.\n\nAre there laws in place in the United States that forbid this type of insurance policy, either at the federal level or at the state/local level?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Insurance is regulated at the state rather than the federal level in the United States, and the terms of individual insurance contracts also matter.\n\nMost states prohibit insurance of intentional unlawful acts as a matter of public policy, either under common law doctrines or under express statutes or regulations. The public policy is that no one should be insulated from liability for their own intentional acts. And, in insurance policies for individuals who are not employers, this is typically accomplished with an intentional acts exclusion in the language of the policy.\n\n(Negligent acts are almost always insurable. The status of acts that constitute gross negligence, willful and wanton conduct, reckless conduct, or bad faith conduct, varies somewhat from state to state.)\n\nBut, the situation is muddier when the insured is an employer or an entity. It frequently is possible for an employer or entity to insure itself against unauthorized misconduct by employees or officers or directors who are breaching their duties to the employer or company, rather than carrying out the official policies of the company.\n\nFactories don't knowingly do anything. People in or connected to factories do things and know things. And, if a factory employee is cutting corners in violation of his job responsibilities and that hurts the company, that could be an insurable risk. But, if a factory employee is acting in accordance with the directions of the CEO and Board of Directors in causing the factory to emit waste violating the law, and if the people giving him orders known that this violates the law, then this is probably not an insurable loss of the company as a matter of public policy.\n\nAnother complication involves the question of who is insured. The Town of Greenfield may be able to legally buy insurance that compensates it for the costs of having to deal with intentional environmental law violations by factories undertaken as a matter of corporate policy in the town, even though the corporation couldn't buy this insurance. Indeed, the Town could even impose a tax on the corporation that requires it to pay the premium on the Town's insurance policy. But, this wouldn't relieve the corporation of liability or violate public policy because the insurance company would have a right of \"subrogation\" to sue to owner of the factory to reimburse it for the full amount of any claims that it had to pay to the Town. This is true even if the corporation and the responsible individuals in the corporation are, in fact, judgment proof or bankrupt, so that the subrogation right is actually meaningless in fact.\n\nIt is also probably legal for a company to \"self\\-insure\", i.e. to set aside reserves of its own money to pay for it violations of the law in the future without regard to intent, and to have administrators employed to process payment in those situations, because then it is not actually insulated from harm for its own wrongdoing. But, this is risky because a policy of condoning illegal conduct could subject the company to punitive damages and sanctions in addition to compensatory damages.\n\nIt also matters what kind of harm the insurance policy pays for. It would not be illegal, in almost any state, to issue an insurance policy that pays for a criminal defense lawyer for someone who is accused of a crime. But, it would be illegal in almost every state to issue an insurance policy that pays for fines and court costs and restitution imposed as punishment for committing a crime. Paying for a criminal defense lawyer, or a bail bond, at a time when you are presumed innocent, is not a form of punishment and hence is an insurable expense."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large corporation is considering purchasing an insurance policy to cover potential fines and penalties resulting from environmental violations.

Usually, a company is granted a monopoly over waste management for residences in a certain jurisdiction, the government vaguely indicates what the service is supposed to do (sometimes because the recipient of the waste is a government\\-run waste facility), then the service communicates to customers what their policies will be. The use of \"should\" in such communications does not imply \"legally and enforceably must\".\n\nThe waste management business has a contract with the individual to provide specified services, which may for example \"imply\" that you are not allowed to throw yard waste in regular trash. If your trash contains a leaf of grass, that might technically be contrary to their policy, but the possibilities of a consequence for the individual depends on what is in the contract.

There are occasions where people\u2019s circumstances change which results in them leaving Ireland, for example due to offers of employment or family circumstances. Under the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended, the Minister for Justice has the power to revoke a certificate of naturalisation where an individual has been ordinarily resident outside of the State for seven years unless they have registered their intention to retain their Irish citizenship. This is done by submitting a Form 5 (Form CTZ2\\) Declaration of Intention to retain Irish citizenship by a naturalised Irish citizen residing outside of Ireland. The [Form 5 (Form CTZ2\\) Declaration of Intention, Version 6 Jan 20](https://www.irishimmigration.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/form-CTZ2.pdf)\n> must be lodged with the INIS, or with the nearest Irish Embassy or Consular Office to a person\u2019s location. We strongly advise all naturalised Irish citizens to file the Form 5 if ordinary resident outside of Ireland to ensure that they retain their Irish citizenship.\n\nIt is about the \"intention to retain Irish citizenship\" if a naturalized person has resided abroad (outside Ireland) for 7 years. If they still want to keep their naturalized Irish status, they have to fill this form so that Ireland does not assume that they no longer wish to retain it.\n\nMost countries require residence beforehand. Some require it afterwards. The US used to require this, but that is no longer the case now. Germany does not. Ireland does, but here it **seems** that a naturalized person can anyway live abroad for periods longer than 7 years just by filling that form (that basically declares the intention to RETAIN citizenship).\n\nBased on Irish law, specifically the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, can I live abroad after naturalizing as an Irish citizen and retain my citizenship just by filling that form? Will Ireland revoke my citizenship on the basis that I left Ireland after I naturalized (while \"intention to live in Ireland\" was a requirement for naturalization)?

The [statute (as amended)](http://www.inis.gov.ie/en/INIS/INCA%20Dec2014.pdf/Files/INCA%20Dec2014.pdf) provides that this revocation is not possible when the citizen has \"registered annually in the prescribed manner his name and a declaration of his intention to retain Irish citizenship with an Irish diplomatic mission or consular office or with the Minister\":\n\n> Revocation of certificates of naturalisation.\n> \n> \n> 19\\.\u2014(1\\) The Minister may revoke a certificate of naturalisation if he is satisfied\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) that the issue of the certificate was procured by fraud, misrepresentation whether innocent or fraudulent, or concealment of material facts or circumstances, or\n> \n> \n> (b) that the person to whom it was granted has, by any overt act, shown himself to have failed in his duty of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, or\n> \n> \n> (c) that (except in the case of a certificate of naturalisation which is issued to a person of Irish descent or associations) the person to whom it is granted has been ordinarily resident outside the State or, in the case of an application for a certificate of naturalisation granted under section 15A, resident outside the island of Ireland (otherwise than in the public service) for a continuous period of seven years and without reasonable excuse has not during that period registered annually in the prescribed manner his name and a declaration of his intention to retain Irish citizenship with an Irish diplomatic mission or consular office or with the Minister, or\n> \n> \n> (d) that the person to whom it is granted is also, under the law of a country at war with the State, a citizen of that country, or\n> \n> \n> (e) that the person to whom it is granted has by any voluntary act, other than marriage or entry into a civil partnership, acquired another citizenship.\n\nTo be precise, filing this declaration does not protect the citizen from revocation of naturalization under another subsection of section 19(1\\). But if we assume that the annual declarations were all filed promptly (or that there is a reasonable excuse for any failure to file promptly), and that there is no dispute about this, then it is plain from the statutory text that the minister has no discretion to revoke the certificate of naturalization under 19(1\\)(c).\n\n> If it were a country like UK or New Zealand, it would straightaway revoke citizenship by claiming misrepresentation of the intention to reside.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. If there is a reason for the decision to leave, the naturalized citizen could seek to rebut any presumption that there had been misrepresentation.\n\nIn the case of Ireland, filing the annual declaration does not protect the naturalized citizen from denaturalization under 19(1\\)(a), so even if the declarations are filed, it could be necessary to show evidence that there was a genuine intention to reside in Ireland at the time of naturalization, and that the intention changed subsequently. If that intention did not in fact exist, then the minister could assert that the certificate had been obtained by fraud, and if the naturalized citizen is unable to rebut that assertion, the minister could revoke the certificate under 19(1\\)(a).\n\nAlso see Part IV of the statute for other ways in which Irish citizenship may be lost.\n\nIn practice, I don't think it is presently very common for countries that generally tolerate (or explicitly permit) multiple nationalities, such as Ireland, the UK, and New Zealand, to seek to denaturalize their naturalized citizens who move abroad. Denaturalization seems to be largely confined to politically sensational cases such as those of terrorists.\n\nSince Ireland is a party to the [Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Reduction_of_Statelessness), one way to protect your Irish citizenship may be to renounce your other citizenship(s), if that is possible.

If it's discovered that the person never actually intended to reside in Ireland when they claimed they did during naturalization, this could be grounds for revocation.

Copyright on the design of \"useful\" products is limited, and the exact limitations vary from country to country.\n\nHowever, it might be hard for the designer (or the company for which the designer works) to prove that the creation was original, and was not an actual leak. But if the designer or company has retained sufficient evidence to convince a court, then a suit could be successful. Such a possibility makes me doubt that Apple or a similar large company would do that. The risks are too great when a design of their own creation would probably be quite good enough for their purposes.

I know that running a DDOS attack on someone who is okay with it is legal, but this is using a public server to amplify the attack. The attack doesn't do any damage to the public server and only uses it as a middleman, but it doesn't use the server for what it's designed to do. \n\nTo be totally clear, this is for educational and not malicious purposes only. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Public\" DNS servers are public in the sense that they are available for the public to use by the adminstrator of each server. But each DNS server is run by either a government entity (or semi\\-government, such as a university or a government run corporation) or a private telecom company.

You should find the administrative domain and website of the DNS server you want to use from public\\-dns.info and read their TOS to determine their policies about access to their DNS services.\n\nBut there are many other factors involved in a DDOS attack test other than the one DNS service: you need to consider each ISP, each upstream provider, each network between the DNS service and the target server, in each country, as a DDOS attack \\- even a controlled stress test \\- creates huge amounts of traffic all across each network and as such costs time and money to each. And each services' TOS may very well forbid such use for a DDOS stress test.\n\nYou don't think a DDOS test will inflict \"damage.\" It will: \"damage\" outlined in a TOS will be defined as CPU and network loads that cause slowness and network latency to other customers, time spent by admins to mitigate the issues, and more.\n\nIt doesn't matter that you are educational and not malicious.\n\nDon't think that a DNS server administrator, the ISP, upstream providers, etc. can't track you down.\n\nIn the US at least, DDOS attacks are illegal: [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030\\#a\\_5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030#a_5)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A cybersecurity student wants to conduct an educational DDoS attack test using a public DNS server as an amplifier.

The test is likely illegal and unethical, even if intended for educational purposes. This is because:\n\n1. Public DNS servers, while accessible, are owned and operated by various entities with specific Terms of Service (ToS) that typically prohibit high-volume, repeated accesses such as those used in DDoS attacks.\n\n2. DDoS tests, even if controlled, create significant traffic across multiple networks, potentially causing slowdowns and latency issues for other users. This can be considered \"damage\" as defined in many ToS agreements.\n\n3. The test would likely violate the ToS of multiple parties involved, including the DNS server, ISPs, and upstream providers.\n\n4.

I might even have a reason to suspect that if I did not take the package from the truck, then the driver would leave it sitting out in the open where it would likely be stolen (or that the driver himself might steal it), in which case I'd actually be preventing a crime by taking it from the truck directly.\n\nI don't think this would be burglary either, since that would tend to require that I was breaking into a restricted area *with the intent to commit a crime.* Especially if the delivery truck had no doors or I acted while they'd been left open, then I wouldn't even be \"breaking and entering.\"\n\nI can't see this as being \"trespass\" if the truck was on a public street, unless trespass applies to the interior of vehicles.

In any way, it is not in your possession, while it is in the hands of the postal service!**\n\nThe *contents* of the package started fully owned by the sender and were entrusted to the postal service to deliver it. This entrustment is (contractually) defined as the time it is handed to the postal service, but the postal service does not gain any ownership. They do however have insurance on the parcel (to some degree), as they are liable for the loss of it. In many cases, the transfer of ownership happens upon delivery (for example, in the UK), so that you can't even be sure you own the contents while the box is still on the truck. At least in the eye of many postal services I know, it is the basic presumption, that they hold the item as entrusted. So to be on the safe side, it's best to presume that the package only becomes *your* package the moment you sign for the receipt of the package or it is dropped into your mailbox or at your dedicated dropoff point (you can specify that with many postal carriers btw). Otherwise, your actions might interfere with the contract of the mail service \\[to bring it to your door] and might incur liability upon them as their insurance presumes the parcel was lost and it has to be replaced. By the way, it is customary that any message of *the parcel is damaged* go to the sender, not the receiver so that in the case of commercial mail they can send/fund a replacement, as the sender needs to ensure that a non\\-defect item is delivered under their own contract with the recipient.\n\nCriminal lawsuits\n-----------------\n\nBut, you want to know which specific law you'd be sued under [18 USC \u00a71708 (2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1708) not only for taking the box, but also for taking the item from the box (emphasis mine)!\n\n> **Whoever** steals, **takes**, or abstracts, or by fraud or deception obtains, or attempts so to obtain, **from** or out of any mail, post office, or station thereof, letter box, mail receptacle, or **any mail route** or other authorized depository for mail matter, or from a letter or mail carrier, **any** letter, postal card, **package**, bag, or mail, or abstracts **or removes from any such** letter, **package**, bag, or mail, **any article or thing contained therein**, or secretes, embezzles, or destroys any such letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein \\[...] Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nThe act of *taking* is relevant. It is irrelevant that you would receive the parcel later. You take it from the car on the delivery route. You also do trespass under whatever jurisdiction applies where the car is parked. For example, Criminal Trespass on Indian country is defined under [25\\.CFR \u00a7 11\\.411 (b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/25/11.411). The rules in other jurisdictions are very similar: you are not allowed to enter the car, as it is clearly off\\-limits to the general public. The car is btw. supposed to be closed to prevent such, so you have to actually break property of the postal service (which is an extra charge to just the normal B\\&E).\n\n> (b) A person commits an offense if, knowing that he or she is not licensed or privileged to do so, he or she enters or remains in any place as to which notice against trespass is given by: (3\\) Fencing or other enclosure manifestly designed to exclude intruders.\n\nA car door, even if not locked and left ajar, is an enclosure manifestly designed to exclude intruders, and the inside of a car is \"any place\". So, in the correct jurisdiction, this statute of criminal trespass does apply. And as pointed out above, taking the mail without the driver knowing is illegal. In some fashion, taking your own mail is also a strange case of [obstructing the correspondence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1702), which specifically calls out that the parcel has to be given by the mailman to the recipient (emphasis mine).\n\n> **Whoever takes any** letter, postal card, or **package** out of any post office or any authorized depository for mail matter, or from any letter or mail carrier, or **which has been** in any post office or authorized depository, or **in the custody of any** letter or **mail carrier, before it has been delivered to the person to whom it was directed**, with design to obstruct the correspondence, or to pry into the business or secrets of another, or opens, secretes, embezzles, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nIf it is discovered by the driver while still on route, they will have to call the base and investigate the missing parcel, which takes time from the delivery, so might constitute [retarding the passage of mail](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1701). If you break the lock to the car, you'd be charged as [Injury to mail bags](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1706):\n\n> **Whoever** tears, cuts, or otherwise **injures any** mail bag, pouch, or other **thing used or designed for use in the conveyance of the mail**, or draws or breaks any staple or loosens any part of any lock, chain, or strap attached thereto, with intent to rob or steal any such mail, or to render the same insecure, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.\n\nA Postal car, especially with a lock on the door, is such a device. And if you somehow had the key to the car, you'd break [18 USC \u00a7\u202f1704](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1704) instead. Plus, your taking does possibly incur monetary damages to the postal carrier, so civil charges for that money and expenses in investigating would also accrue against the taking person.\n\ncivil lawsuits?\n---------------\n\nIf you'd take the parcel, you make the postal driver accountable for the loss of the parcel and the worth of the package, as the internal system of the postal service does recognize that they did not deliver the parcel, did not scan it out at the home base, but they did scan it onto their route. So unless they can point the finger at you or a known thief, they might need to admit that they did not lock the car or committed some other misconduct that allowed someone to steal the parcel. This can lead to the financial loss of the delivery driver or them being fired. Should the mail carrier or the postal service discover it was you, the mail carrier can now sue you for the injury the lost parcel meant to them as you interfered with their work contract. The tort is [Tortious interference](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/tortious_interference).\n\nThen, the mail service can sue you for intentionally interfering with the delivery contract the service had with the one ordering the delivery done: they were required to bring the parcel to the target and got paid for that. Only your action of taking did prevent this. Would you not have taken the parcel, they would have delivered, so you interfered with their contract.\n\n---\n\nLife Advice:\n------------\n\nApproach the driver, get out a photo\\-ID (Drivers license, passport, ID\\-card etc) and ask them something akin to this \"The website told me you might have a parcel for me. Can you look? I am this person, and this ID proves I live at the target address, as indicated on this ID.\" With those credentials in hand, the postal driver can check and give it to you but isn't technically obligated to. But as it often means they can save a few valuable minutes getting to your house, they might, especially if you know your mail carrier and are friendly.\n\nOn the other hand, it's extremely unlikely for letter mail to be given this way, as searching for a parcel on a truck is much easier than looking for the letter mails in the bags."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John sees a delivery truck parked on his street and knows it contains a package addressed to him.

This law applies regardless of ownership of the package contents. Additionally, entering the truck would constitute trespassing, and the action could potentially lead to other charges such as obstructing correspondence or interfering with mail delivery. The correct and legal approach would be to wait for the package to be delivered or to approach the driver with proper identification to request the package, though the driver is not obligated to hand it over before the scheduled delivery."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22058/can-a-founder-use-bylaws-to-prevent-being-fired-by-the-board", "docs_id": 22058, "title": "Can a founder use bylaws to prevent being fired by the board", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is it legal for a company founder to add to the bylaws that nobody has the power to fire him as ceo (law in Colorado, The United States of America)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sure.

In the \"NOTES\" section of the contract, I specified I wanted mowing to occur every other week rather than weekly. In addition, I stated the same in my e\\-mail when I sent in the scanned/signed copy of the contract. \n\n4 weeks later, I was informed that the owner of the mowing company did not read the contract until then and did not notice my request. He stated that he does not allow for anything other than weekly mowing services. His own contract even says that customers can skip mowing for a week whenever so long as they give him 2 days advance notice, but clearly he does not even abide by his own contract. I cancelled services with him and he sent me a bill for the full 4 weeks. \n\nI am thinking that his failure to read my requested terms and inform me that he could not meet my requested terms until 4 weeks after services began was his own negligence.\n\nLegally speaking, am I responsible for paying the full 4 weeks billed? Do I have the right to pay for just 2 weeks considering that he breached the terms requested in the contract? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: My take on this problem is that it is a classic tension between unjust enrichment and contract terms. You contracted for only 2 mows and he delivered 4 mows accidently. If you pay only for two mows, you got the benefit of two extra mows (the unjust enrichment), but are paying for something that you didn't ask for (the contract terms). If you pay for all 4, you are paying for a service you didn't want. In my opinion, you would probably end up winning in a small claims type of action because you specifically requested a less frequent mowing, and the lawn service accepted your terms. But this is far from a done deal, for instance if you knew about the extra mowings, but didn't stop them, (or they can paint that picture regardless of your real state of mind) it looks like you tried to get free mowings without paying for it, which might lower your chances of winning.\n\nPractically, I would concentrate on the negotiations rather than the legal stance because no amount of legal correctness will probably convince the business owner, and it probably isn't a worth his time to sue you to recover. You could send a check with a letter explaining that you had only requested two mowings, and that you are only willing to pay for 2\\. Write \"Paid in Full\" on the check in the memo area, and hope they cash it. If so, you are probably done because you had a legitimate dispute about the amount owed, and you offered to settle for the amount of the check. Cashing the check probably counts as acceptance of your offer. The other choice the business owner has is to send you to collections, where they will probably recover less than your 50% payment, so the dollar\\-wise move on their part is to just cash the check.\n\nYou can see more about \"paid in full\" checks here: [http://www.weisslawstl.com/2005/12/01/accord\\-satisfaction\\-how\\-notation\\-check\\-sometimes\\-unwittingly\\-resolve\\-payment\\-dispute](http://www.weisslawstl.com/2005/12/01/accord-satisfaction-how-notation-check-sometimes-unwittingly-resolve-payment-dispute)\n\nIt may vary according to the jurisdiction you live in.\n\nI had a similar dispute with an electrician. I had warned him before he came out that I had isolated the problem to a long line of buried cable that required special equipment to diagnose. I asked them to show up with the right equipment to diagnose, including boots and machetes to follow the run of cable. They showed up with neither, failed to diagnose the problem, then sent me a bill for the callout. I explained my position and that I was happy to either go to court if they wanted to sue, or go to court if they turned me over to collections, and that they should just walk away and I wouldn't complain about the time they wasted showing up unprepared to diagnose my problem. They did walk away after much huffing\\-and\\-puffing about it."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner hires a lawn mowing company and specifies in the contract's \"NOTES\" section and in an email that they want bi-weekly mowing instead of weekly.

It acknowledges the service provided (addressing potential unjust enrichment claims) while also adhering to the originally requested terms. Writing \"Paid in Full\" on the check creates a legal basis for considering the debt settled if the company cashes it.

But on what grounds could the federal government legalize abortions in all 50 states? Would they be forced to open federal \"abortion clinics\" to prevent state jurisdiction? Are there similar precedents of the Federal government legalizing something against the wishes of the states?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The federal government has the power to regulate interstate commerce, and the current definition is incredibly broad \\-\\- certainly broad enough to include the provision of abortions.\n\nIf it were challenged, the government would likely rely on [*Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005\\)](https://casetext.com/case/gonzales-v-raich). In *Gonzales*, two patients who used medical marijuana as authorized by state law challenged the federal government's laws prohibiting the use of medical marijuana. They argued that because they were growing their own marijuana, because it never left the state, and because it was for personal, noncommercial use, it was outside Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce. But the Supreme Court rejected their arguments, holding that Congress could use its Commerce Clause authority to enact health\\-care laws regulating access to marijuana and pre\\-empt contradictory state health\\-care laws.\n\nThe federal government's case for regulating abortions would be event stronger than its case in *Gonzales*: First, because obtaining an abortion is typically a commercial enterprise; it is likely covered by insurance, and even if it patient isn't charged, someone is likely paying the doctor money to perform it. Also, abortions more obviously implicate interstate commerce because patients frequently travel from state to another to obtain one, because clinics order supplies and services from outside the state, and because they rely on instrumentalities of interstate commerce (highways, telephone lines, the Internet) to do their job.\n\nIndeed, as far as I know, every court to consider the issue has concluded that regulating access to abortion is a straightforward application of the Commerce Clause. *See, e.g.*, [*Terry v. Reno*, 101 F.3d 1412, 1418 (D.C. Cir. 1996\\)](https://casetext.com/case/terry-v-reno) (\u201cViolent and obstructive activity outside abortion clinics adversely affects interstate commerce in reproductive health services. In enacting the Access Act, Congress did not exceed its Commerce Clause power.\u201d); [*Cheffer v. Reno*, 55 F.3d 1517, 1520\\-21 (11th Cir. 1995\\)](https://casetext.com/case/cheffer-v-reno) (\u201cCongress found that doctors and patients often travel across state lines to provide and receive services, id.; in other words, there is an interstate market both with respect to patients and doctors. In addition, the clinics receive supplies through interstate commerce. ... Congress' findings are plausible and provide a rational basis for concluding that the Access Act regulates activity which \"substantially affects\" interstate commerce. Thus, the Access Act is a constitutional exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.\u201d); [*U.S. v. Wilson*, 73 F.3d 675, 688 (7th Cir. 1995\\)](https://casetext.com/case/us-v-wilson-537) (\u201cthe Access Act may be viewed as a direct regulation of interstate commerce and confirms once again that the Act is well within Congress's power to legislate under the Commerce Clause.\u201d).\n\nReacting to *Dobbs*, then, Congress could write a law finding that existing state laws pose a threat to the interstate markets for providing and receiving reproductive services, and then rely on those findings to say that the only limits on abortion are X, Y, and Z, and that states may not impose any additional restrictions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under what constitutional authority could Congress most likely pass federal legislation to protect abortion rights across all 50 states, even if some states wish to restrict or ban abortions?\n\nA) The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment\nB) The Commerce Clause\nC) The Necessary and Proper Clause\nD) The Supremacy Clause\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe Commerce Clause is the most likely constitutional basis for Congress to pass federal legislation protecting abortion rights across all states. This is supported by several key points from the given information:\n\n1. The federal government has broad power to regulate interstate commerce, which has been interpreted to include healthcare services like abortion.\n\n2. The case of Gonzales v. Raich (2005) set a precedent for using the Commerce Clause to enact health-care laws that can pre-empt contradictory state laws.\n\n3. Abortions implicate interstate commerce because patients often travel between states to obtain them, clinics order supplies from out of state, and they use interstate commerce instrumentalities like highways and telecommunications.\n\n4. Multiple court cases (e.g., Terry v. Reno, Cheffer v. Reno, U.S. v. Wilson) have upheld the use of the Commerce Clause to regulate access to abortion services.\n\n5. Congress could argue that state restrictions on abortion pose a threat to interstate markets for reproductive services, justifying federal intervention under the Commerce Clause.\n\nWhile the other options (Equal Protection Clause, Necessary and Proper Clause, and Supremacy Clause) are important constitutional provisions, they are not as directly applicable or as strongly supported by precedent for this specific issue as the Commerce Clause."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15100/can-i-legally-sleep-in-the-street-in-france", "docs_id": 15100, "title": "Can I legally sleep in the street in France?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can I legally sleep in the street in France? \n\nAssume my location does not perturb traffic circulation, i.e. I am on the pavement, or the road is only used by pedestrians.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you sleep on the streets, you are considered a \"SDF\" (*Sans Domicile Fixe*), a tramp.\nLegality depends on where you sleep, and in which city.\n\nIt's not illegal to be a SDF (under some conditions), but until the early 1990s it was illegal to be a beggar (*mendiant/mendicit\u00e9* \\-\\- this reference, [Mendicit\u00e9](http://www.affaires-publiques.com/point/gp/mend.htm), is about begging)\n\nFor instance, sleeping in a car can be legal, except if you are located in a prohibited place where you could have a fine.\n\nSome cities have voted anti\\-SDF acts.\n\nSee for instance (in French):\n[Dormir dans sa voiture, est\\-ce l\u00e9gal?](http://dormirenvoiture.jimdo.com/que-dit-la-loi)\nand [Les pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents dispositifs anti\\-SDF qui ont fait pol\u00e9mique en France](http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2014/12/26/les-precedents-dispositifs-anti-sdf-qui-ont-fait-polemique-en-fr)\n\nSDF in law acts: [PERSONNE SANS DOMICILE FIXE (SDF)](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichSarde.do?reprise=true&page=1&idSarde=SARDOBJT000007115620)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In France, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of sleeping on the streets?\n\nA) Sleeping on the streets is universally legal throughout France, as long as it doesn't obstruct traffic.\nB) It is always illegal to sleep on the streets in France, regardless of location or circumstances.\nC) The legality of sleeping on the streets varies depending on the specific location and local regulations.\nD) Sleeping on the streets is only legal if done inside a vehicle, regardless of where the vehicle is parked.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The legality of sleeping on the streets in France is complex and depends on various factors.

Water and Sewage costs are separated because the county provides well water for free, but not sewage.\n\nA few days ago I received a bill from a sewage company \"[NWP](https://one.nwpresident.com/)\". The bill is a single charge with no details. Just \"Sewage Fee \".\n\nThe number seemed shockingly high for what I have paid for water plus sewage in the past, so I called the company and discovered that I am being billed for the usage of the entire \"community\" split based on the number of residents in the Townhouse (just my wife and I). The company also told me that it was impossible for them to even tell me how much my unit is using because there are no meters installed.\n\nSo my first question is whether or not this is even legal. I'm not sure if sewage is considered a utility like water and is subject to the legal protections, and I also don't know where I would find those protections (I just recently moved here from a different state). My gut tells me this shouldn't be allowed because it discourages conservation. I can't conserve usage because when the bill comes, I'll have no idea what I actually used. But this is just a gut feeling and I'd like to know section and paragraph if I'm going to do anything serious with this.\n\nMy second concern is that this isn't mentioned anywhere in my lease. The only time the lease ever mentions sewage at all is one time at the top with the line: \n\n> Tenant Pays For: TENANT PAYS FOR GAS AND ELECTRIC, AND SEWAGE\n\nThe \"Utilities\" section does not mention Sewage in any way and it is absent from the rest of the document.\n\nI was told during the tour and today at the office that I only pay for my own usage. Unfortunately this was verbal and is not in the lease. After I escalated at the office to the manager, the manager admitted that this is a lie, but since it's not in writing, I think they know they're safe.\n\nIf I had known that I was on the hook for my neighbor's heavy water usage, I would not have signed, and the lease completely hid this information from me. Do I have any case for breach of lease terms or something like that? I feel like socializing sewage costs is important enough to have been noted in the lease, and it would have affected my decision.\n\nIn summary:\n\n1.

There are no specified time limits for returning most types of property, nor are there automatic rights to compensation for damages incurred. While owners can request the return of property, the decision ultimately lies with the authorities based on the needs of the investigation. Special provisions exist for impounded vehicles, but for items like computers or phones, law enforcement is not required to quickly duplicate and return data.

Even further, if this person has\n> no family or work colleagues who will vouch for them, is it possible\n> that their identity is lost forever?\n\nGenerally, these can be replaced.\n\nFor example, I was robbed at gunpoint a couple of years ago and the robbers took (among other things) my driver's license and Social Security card, which were never recovered (I did recover one prescription slip from a dumpster about a mile away that was wrapped around a syringe, because the robbers were also injection drug users.)\n\nI went by myself without any ID to the DMV which had an online record of my driver's license containing my age, height, weight, sex, race, noted that I needed vision correction and also had my most recent driver's license photo and a fingerprint. I explained what happened without any corroboration, and they promptly issued me a new driver's license.\n\nThe same process would have applied had I had a state ID in lieu of a driver's license because I wasn't licensed to drive for some reason (e.g. if I was blind). The process in Texas would be very similar (I don't know if they have finger prints though).\n\nMy daughter had to do the same when she lost her driver's license while camping.\n\nWith the driver's license, I was able to go to the Social Security office and have them reissue a Social Security card.\n\nOne of my children's birth certificates was lost, and I could simply go to the Vital Statistics department with a name and date of birth and get a new one.\n\nThe replacement birth certificate and driver's license involved a modest fee (which would be pretty daunting for a homeless person), but the replacement Social Security card was free.\n\nIt's a pain in the neck to do this, and it took several hours to sort out (the time lost would not be a problem for a homeless person), but loss of my identity was not a serious possibility.\n\nIf you have (or had before you lost it) a photo ID such as a driver's license, or state ID, or student ID, or passport in a system, reconstructing your identity isn't that hard.\n\nIf you don't know who you are either.\n-------------------------------------\n\nIf you have amnesia, so you don't know the information needed to recover your records, it can be much harder to work out a lack of any ID. This happens something on the order of several times a year. Sometimes it is resolved promptly when the person regains their memory or is tied to a recent outstanding missing persons report, or is identified after a local TV broadcast seeking input from the public. But, if the person is not local, no one filed a missing persons report, and the memory loss turns out to be permanent, it can take months or years to get it sorted out.\n\nBut, you will generally be assumed to be legally present in the U.S. until proven otherwise if you speak fluent English. Also, you can't easily be deported if no one can determine your nationality (including you), even if you don't speak fluent English.\n\nFor example, if the only language you spoke fluently was an Amazonian tribal language and no one could figure out this fact, it would be hard to deport you without evidence of your country of origin, which by assumption, does not exist in this scenario. Officials sometimes try to crowdsource recordings of someone speaking or writing in these situations to determine their place of origins, which can take many months and isn't always successful.\n\nBut, if your first language was Klingon, you would be quickly identified and not deported, because that language is widely recognized and a Google search would reveal that it has only two native speakers, both of whom are children who were born in the United States (I know their father as a casual acquaintance).\n\nCitizenship, arrest and deportation\n-----------------------------------\n\n> Can a person lose their citizenship in this manner? Could they be\n> arrested or even deported?\n\nYou cannot lose your citizenship in this manner, although it can be harder to prove your citizenship, if you need to do so.\n\nYou shouldn't be arrested for simply not having ID (although it does happen) if you aren't driving a car without a license. Also, lots of people without ID are arrested all of the time for other charges, and then refuse to provide anything but a false alias to the police. But, they are usually not deported unless there is some reason to suspect that they are not U.S. citizens.\n\nA modest but significant number of people every year (on the order of dozens to a couple hundred) are arrested and deported in circumstances like these and the system can put someone in that situation in a very Catch\\-22 situation for which there a few if any legal remedies after the fact by way of compensation.\n\n*Deportations Of U.S. citizens with strong foreign ties*\n\nThe hard cases are usually those when you have someone who is a child who has never had a photo ID, or is an adult who never had a photo ID in the U.S., especially if that person is someone who has lived much of their life abroad despite being born in the U.S., or is most fluent in a non\\-English language because their parents spoke that language when they were growing up, or was born abroad and naturalized as a citizen later (often as a relative of the primary person who earned the right to citizenship by taking citizenship tests).\n\nEstablishing that you are the same person as the one in a birth certificate or naturalization certificate is not always easy. Naturalizations often aren't accurately cross\\-referenced with immigration records. And, the track record of ICE agents meaningfully following up on claims of citizenship is very poor.\n\n*Identity assumption cases*\n\nAnother much less common hard case that still happens sometimes, involves a situation where you are born in the U.S. or to a U.S. citizen, giving you U.S. citizenship, and you have a birth certificate, but you live abroad for a long time, and in the meantime, someone similar in age, sex and race to you has assumed your identity to claim citizenship status.\n\nThen, there is someone else with a long paper trail that supports your identity actually belonging to them including photo IDs and maybe even a passport, and you have only your birth certificate that someone else claims is theirs with doesn't have a lot of provable biometric features other than your parent's names, which may be hard to use to establish that you are the true person corresponding to the birth certificate if they are deceased, and may require DNA testing or testimony from them even if they are not deceased.\n\n*Persons declared dead*\n\nA third class of people who have a thorny time re\\-establishing their identities are people who went missing, were declared dead legally by a court as a result, and then resurface. This can pose a problem even after they undeniably establish their identity due to rules relating to the finality of court orders.\n\nA fictional example of this is the title character in the live action TV series the *Iron Fist* in the Marvel Comics Universe. But, there are also real life examples, such as a man in Ohio a number of years ago who was in a similar situation (except for the fact that he didn't have superpowers, was middle aged, and wasn't an heir to a billion dollar fortune).\n\nThese cases are very rare. There is probably less than one per year in the entire United States."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A homeless individual has lost all forms of identification and has no family or colleagues to vouch for their identity.

The passage indicates that while it is generally possible to replace lost identification documents such as birth certificates, social security cards, and driver's licenses, the process can be time-consuming and may involve fees. For a homeless person, these fees could be particularly challenging. The text mentions that replacing a driver's license and birth certificate involved \"a modest fee (which would be pretty daunting for a homeless person),\" and that the process \"took several hours to sort out.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states, \"You cannot lose your citizenship in this manner.\" \n\nOption B is overly optimistic. While some documents like Social Security cards can be replaced for free, others involve fees, and the process is described as taking several hours, not just a day.\n\nOption D is also incorrect.

These are needed so that these countries can comply with Article VII.5 of said treaty:\n\n> 5. Each Contracting Party shall, at the time when the present Treaty enters into force for it, inform the other Contracting Parties, and thereafter shall give them notice in advance, of\n> \t\n> \t\n> \t(a) all expeditions to and within Antarctica, on the part of its ships or nationals, and all expeditions to Antarctica organized in or proceeding from its territory; ...\n\nIn general, cruise ships that travel to Antarctica will take care of these permits for their passengers. However, if you are traveling by private vessel, you will need to apply for such a permit in the pertinent country or countries.\n* If, on the other hand, you are neither a citizen of, traveling on a vessel registered in, or departing from a country that is a signatory of the Antarctic Treaty, it is basically *terra nullius* for you. You can travel there without any permission whatsoever. It is, however, not recommended. Note also that most of the countries that are in any way \"close\" to Antartica are signatories to the treaty. I suppose you could leave from Madagascar or Namibia if you really wanted to avoid getting a permit.\n\n---\n\n**Edit:** The laws that govern actions in the Antarctic are individual to each country. This means that if you do something in the Antarctic that you shouldn't have done, and your expedition is for whatever reason governed by one of the AT signatories, it is up to the law enforcement officials of that country to prosecute you.\n\nAs an example, let's take Canada. As part of the ratification of the Antarctic Treaty system, Canada enacted the [Antarctic Environmental Protection Act.](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-11.44/page-1.html) The laws in this act require any Canadians or Canadian vessels visiting Antarctica to acquire a permit; prohibit mining; prohibit activities that harm or disturb native plants or animals; prohibit damaging historic sites; and regulate many other things as well. [Penalties for violating these laws](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-11.44/page-8.html#h-24) include fines up to 2,000,000 CAD for individuals and up to 12,000,000 CAD for corporations.

At the same time, the USA is still practicing the death penalty. For example, [28 people were executed in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_offenders_executed_in_the_United_States_in_2015). For each execution a lot of evidence can be potentially gathered (official documents, video footage, declarations of individuals, etc).\n\nSo could the people who have taken part in an execution be considered guilty of \"collective murder\"? Is it possible that they could be arrested as soon as they arrive in France?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I said this in a comment, but I'll put it in an answer. When France forcibly confines an American, the United States is entitled to ask France, \"what the *hell* do you think you're doing, trying to confine our citizen in your country?\" There are really just six basic answers that the United States will accept, and nothing in this scenario is specific to France or the US (it applies any time a foreign national is arrested by any country), and the six responses are the six basic principles of jurisdiction:\n\n1. Active nationality: \"He's our citizen too! What the hell do you think *you're* doing, questioning how we treat our own citizens?\" The US doesn't generally get to question how France treats French citizens, even if they're also American citizens. And France gets to require its citizens to obey French law anywhere in the world.\n2. Subjective territoriality: \"He broke our laws on our soil. We don't care that he's your citizen, he has to obey our laws while he's here.\" This and nationality are by far the most well\\-accepted answers.\n3. Protective: \"He threatened our state. We have the right to protect ourselves.\" This applies to things like attacking French government personnel or forging a French passport or similar: France isn't protecting its citizens, it's protecting France itself.\n4. Objective territoriality: \"He may have committed this crime outside France, but its effects happened inside France. We can punish him for causing those effects.\" For instance, if you're in the US but hack a computer in France, France has an argument that they get to punish you for that.\n5. Passive nationality: \"He may be American and have done this outside France, but he hurt our citizens. We have the right to protect our citizens.\" Again, a plausible argument. This is not necessarily a *strong* argument, but it can be made.\n6. Universality: \"This thing is a crime against all of humanity. It's something that needs to be stamped out by all countries working together, without worrying too much about whether or not the defendant actually affected the country prosecuting him in any way.\" This is *very* rare.\n\nMurder is not a crime of universal jurisdiction. It's limited to more severe crimes, as well as crimes of a fundamentally international nature. So piracy is on the list, as is plane hijacking, as is genocide. Killing an ambassador is on the list: you're a threat to international order. But normal murder? Not even close. It's not a crime with international implications, and it's not a crime which is so fundamentally horrific that it needs to be ended by any means necessary. The death penalty has never been considered to be that fundamentally horrific, and likely never will be, particularly when (as in the US) it is limited to people who have committed something that is an extremely serious crime in any country (i.e. murder). \n\nThe only way France could make a remotely plausible argument that it gets to punish American executioners is if they're dual citizens or if they executed a French citizen. Then France can't arrest the executioner because US is a sovereign state and gets to impose its own penal laws. But normally? France couldn't arrest them even if it wasn't for the fact that they're executing US government policy, because Americans in America don't generally have to obey French laws."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the principles of international jurisdiction, under which circumstance could France potentially have grounds to arrest and prosecute an American citizen involved in carrying out a legal execution in the United States?\n\nA) If the execution was filmed and the video was viewed in France\nB) If the executed person had dual French-American citizenship\nC) If the execution method was considered particularly cruel by French standards\nD) If the execution took place on a US military base located in France\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the principles of jurisdiction outlined in the documentation, France could potentially claim jurisdiction under the principle of active nationality if the executed person held French citizenship in addition to American citizenship. This falls under the first principle mentioned: \"Active nationality: 'He's our citizen too! What the hell do you think you're doing, questioning how we treat our own citizens?'\" France has the right to require its citizens to obey French law anywhere in the world.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely viewing a video in France does not establish jurisdiction under any of the principles mentioned.\n\nOption C is incorrect because differing standards of cruelty do not grant jurisdiction, especially for actions carried out legally in another sovereign nation.\n\nOption D is incorrect because US military bases, even when located in other countries, are typically considered US soil for legal purposes and would not fall under French jurisdiction.\n\nIt's important to note that even in the case of dual citizenship, the documentation suggests that France's ability to actually arrest and prosecute would be limited due to the fact that the execution was carried out as US government policy in the United States."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/50814/uk-tenancy-renewal-lockdown-and-the-law", "docs_id": 50814, "title": "UK Tenancy Renewal, Lockdown and the Law", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Our fixed term tenancy will finish on 31st July; with a two month notice period.

For instance, if payment is due to a company that trades 24 hours a day including the day payment was due, then payment up until midnight may be found acceptable.\n\nHowever, if it is not known to the person making the payment that the business has such extended hours, and *especially* if it is known that the business has normal hours, then payment after close of business would likely *not* be reasonable.\n\nTo your question, and having reviewed some Canadian residential rent legislation, although none define *due on* specifically \\- and I would not expect them to do so \\- most have clauses which provide for termination, and they only refer to serving notice either a certain number of days *after* rent falls due, or *the day after* rent falls due.\n\nThis would tend to support my assertion that rent is payable *on or before* the specified date, *unless the contract says otherwise*, in line with the above considerations.\n\nNB: While rent is usually payable *in advance*, this simply means that you are paying for the occupancy during that follows, or substantially follows, rather than the period that has elapsed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A rental agreement states that \"rent is due on the 1st of each month.\" The landlord's office is open Monday to Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM. If the 1st falls on a Saturday, when is the latest time the tenant can pay rent without being considered late?\n\nA) 11:59 PM on Friday (the day before the 1st)\nB) 5:00 PM on Friday (the day before the 1st)\nC) 11:59 PM on Saturday (the 1st)\nD) 5:00 PM on Monday (the first business day after the 1st)\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe phrase \"due on\" typically means that payment is required on or before the specified date. In this case, the rent is due on the 1st, which falls on a Saturday. Since the contract doesn't specify a time, and there's no indication of after-hours payment options, the tenant would have until the end of the day on the 1st (Saturday) to make the payment without being late. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it's before the due date. \nOption B is also incorrect for the same reason as A.\nOption C is correct because it allows payment until the end of the specified due date.\nOption D is incorrect because it extends beyond the due date, even though it's the next business day. Without specific language in the contract allowing for this, payment on Monday would be considered late.\n\nThis question tests understanding of contract language, reasonable interpretation of payment terms, and consideration of business hours in relation to due dates."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/74684/are-there-statistics-on-how-often-mistrial-with-prejudice-happens-in-the-us", "docs_id": 74684, "title": "Are there statistics on how often Mistrial with Prejudice happens in the US?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: During the Rittenhouse trial I was surprised to learn there's a legal concept called [Mistrial with Prejudice](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2021/nov/18/explainer-whats-behind-rittenhouse-mistrial-reques/). Are there any statistics on how often this happens in Federal and State courts in the US for criminal law trials?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are not comprehensive statistics that are maintained on this at either the federal level, or in any U.S. state.\n\nIt would not be possible to determine this from PACER records in federal court, or from state court online filing system records in many state courts, because both of those systems are geared towards tracking document filings in the court system. But a motion for mistrial in a criminal case, while it can be filed in document form, would frequently be made orally, in open court, instead. Sometimes an oral motion and its resolution would be reflected in written court minutes or a minute order, but often it would not.\n\nIn criminal cases, more generally, the proportion of motion practice that is conducted orally in open court, rather than through filed written documents is great. Also, even in civil cases, during trials, motions are frequently made orally, rather than in writing.\n\nOral motions are part of the court record on appeal, and can be found in a transcript, but even if you had lots of transcripts for cases (something that no trial court system in the U.S. routinely makes available to non\\-parties), you would have to pour over the entire undifferentiated transcript to find instances in which motions are made, which in a multi\\-day trial is a daunting task. And, it typically takes weeks after a trial from which there is an appeal, for an official transcript to be prepared. Written transcripts are frequently never prepared at all in cases that are not appealed. Instead, there are an audio recording and the court reporter's shorthand notes that are stored until a transcript is ordered or the time during which a transcript could be needed has expired.\n\nThere are probably law review or social science academic journal articles in which this issue has been studied in a small number of courts and statistics were gathered from a modest sized sample to look at the issue. But there probably aren't many, and many of the articles are probably fairly old.\n\nIt would be easier to study the number of appellate opinions in which a denial of a motion for mistrial with prejudice was appealed. But, if it is granted, no appeal is possible, so this would be a biased sample (and would not include cases where no appeal was filed from a conviction after such a motion was made and denied). Another difficulty is that only a small share of all criminal appeal decisions are published, and even if you could get all of the unpublished decisions, many unpublished decisions assume a familiarity with the case that non\\-parties would not have and are skimpy on factual recitations as a result, making them difficult to analyze.\n\nThere are good statistics on the number of acquittals and mistrials granted in criminal cases. Even though there are probably not official statistics, it may even be probably possible to find decent research articles on the share of acquittals and mistrials that are due to motion practice, rather than a jury verdict of acquittal or a sua sponte ruling of a judge. A significant subset of these cases would involve mistrial with prejudice motions (although there are other grounds upon which someone can be acquitted in motion practice in criminal trials, and there are other grounds upon which a mistrial could be granted in a criminal trial).\n\nSo, in short, there is some data out there from which one could cobble together some educated guesses and estimates, but the kind of data your question is looking for does not exist and would be very difficult to compile comprehensively or even for a large sample.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this is a percentage which even if you knew it in one state or in the federal court system, is likely to be quite different in a different court system.\n\nIn the same vein, for example, there are almost no grand jury \"no bills\" in which a grand jury refuses to indict a defendant in the federal court system, but the percentages are in the mid\\-double digit percentages in some Southern U.S. counties. Local practice norms and customs and differences in the relevant criminal court rules, influence these numbers a great deal.\n\nAnother key difference would involve the character and length of the trials involved. There are going to be more mistrial motions in murder cases that last many days, than there are in half day long traffic offense jury trials. If you can't break down the numbers by case type, data from numerous but trivial trials will drown out the data on what is typical in the kind of cases you are really interested in knowing about.\n\nAs a practical matter, asking an experienced practitioner in criminal cases for a general impression of how common something is and a vague guess of its order of magnitude frequency would probably be a more reliable way to get good information. I'm certainly not such a person."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the availability of comprehensive statistics on mistrials with prejudice in U.S. criminal courts?\n\nA) Comprehensive statistics are readily available through PACER for federal courts and state online filing systems.\nB) Law review articles and social science journals provide extensive, up-to-date statistics on mistrials with prejudice across all U.S. courts.\nC) Comprehensive statistics are not maintained at either the federal or state level, primarily due to the prevalence of oral motions and limitations in court record systems.\nD) Appellate court opinions provide a complete and unbiased sample of all instances of mistrials with prejudice in criminal cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage clearly states that comprehensive statistics on mistrials with prejudice are not maintained at either the federal or state level in the U.S. This is largely due to the fact that many motions for mistrial are made orally in court rather than through written filings, and court record systems like PACER are not designed to capture this information comprehensively.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that it would not be possible to determine this information from PACER or state court online filing systems.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the passage mentions that there may be some law review or social science articles studying this issue, it indicates that these would likely be limited in scope and possibly outdated, not providing extensive, up-to-date statistics across all U.S. courts.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage points out that appellate opinions would provide a biased sample, as they would not include cases where mistrials with prejudice were granted (since no appeal would be possible in those cases) or cases where no appeal was filed after such a motion was denied."}}
