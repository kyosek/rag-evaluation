[The document](https://support.avast.com/en-ph/article/170/#idt_055) states:\n\n> Each time you run a Network Inspector scan, you are prompted to select if the network you are currently connected to is Home or Public. Network Inspector scans for different issues and offers different solutions depending on the network type, so it is important to select the correct option:\n> \n> \n> * Home: Scan a private network that you own (such as your home network).\n> * Public: Scan a network that you do not own. This may be a public Wi\\-Fi network, or a work or school network that is managed by a separate network administrator.\n\nThe document does not detail what scans are different on a \"Home\" network, but it might well be that scans which would constitute unauthorized invasions are not run on \"public\" networks.\n\nCFAA\n----\n\nIn the US, anti\\-hacking l;aw is largely included in the [The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act), which has been codified at [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1030](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030)The CFAA has been amended several times since 1984, each time broadening its reach.\n\nSection 1030 prohibits unauthorized access to a \"protected computer\" under any of several conditions, and also prohibits unauthorized obtaining of information from a \"protected computer\".\n\nProtected Computer\n------------------\n\nSection 1030 (e)(2\\) defines \"protected computer:\n\n> (e) (2\\) the term \u201cprotected computer\u201d means a computer\u2014  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (A) exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, used by or for a financial institution or the United States Government and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use by or for the financial institution or the Government;\n> \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (B) which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States; or\n> \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) that\u2014  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (i) is part of a voting system; and  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii)  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii) (I) is used for the management, support, or administration of a Federal election; or  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii) (II) has moved in or otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce;\n\nOriginally only subsection (e)(2\\)(A) was part of the CFAA, and the act onloy applied to computers owned or used by the US Federal government, or by banks and simialr financial institutions. The addition of subsections (e)(2\\)(B) and (e)(2\\)(C) has broadened the scope of the CFAA significantly. The development of the internet, so that almost all data on the internet has traveled or is likely to travel across state lines, means that almost every computer with an internet connection can be regarded as a \"protected computer\" under the CFAA, including most cell phones. The CFAA has thus become a general anti\\-hacking act.\n\nOffenses\n--------\n\nSection 1030 defies several offenses, which I summarize here: unauthorized disclosure of information obtained from a protected computer (subsection (a)(1\\)); obtaining information from a protected computer without proper authorization (subsection (a)(2\\)); unauthorized access to certain protected computers (subsection (a)(3\\)); fraud, that is using unauthorized access to commit fraud, further any fraudulent scheme, or fraudulently obtain any benefit or thing of value (subsection (a)(4\\)); transmitting malware (subsection (a)(5\\)(A)); causing damage, whether recklessly or not (subsections (a)(5\\)(B) \\& (a)(5\\)(C)); selling passwords and access codes (subsection (a)(6\\)); transmitting ransomware or threats to damage a protested computer or interfere with its operation (subsection (a)(7\\)).\n\nEach of these subsections has limiting language, and applies only when \\[*emphasis added*]:\n\n* > \\[(a)(1\\)] having **knowingly accessed** a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access and and by means of such conduct having obtained information that has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive order or statute to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or foreign relations, or any restricted data, as defined in paragraph y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, **with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States**, or to the advantage of any foreign nation\n\nIt seems unlikely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute \"knowing access\" or will result in obtaining such protected or restricted data, but if it does, one can avoid criminal liability under (a)(1\\) simply by nt disclosing any such data to any third party.\n\n* > \\[(a)(2\\)] **Intentionally** accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains\u2014\n> (A) **information contained in a financial record of a financial institution, or of a card issuer** as defined in section 1602(n)\u202f\\[1] of title 15, or **contained in a file of a consumer reporting agency** on a consumer, as such terms are defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.\n\nIt seems even less likely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute \"intentional access\" or will result in obtaining such financial data. Note that data must be obtained by a perso0n con constitute a violation of (a)(2\\).\n\nHowever (a)(2\\)(C) also prohibits obtaining:\n\n> information from any protected computer;\n\nThis is the potentially broadest subsection. It contains no intent element, and no restriction on which computers it applies to. Even so, it applies only if information is in fact obtained (or under a later subsection there is an attempt to obtain information).\n\n* > \\[(a)(3\\)] **intentionally**, without authorization to access any nonpublic computer **of a department or agency of the United States**, accesses such a computer of that department or agency that is exclusively for the use of the Government of the United States or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, **is used by or for the Government of the United States** and such conduct **affects that use** by or for the Government of the United States; ...\n\nAgain, It seems unlikely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute **intentionally** accessing a computer owned or used by the US Federal Government\n\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)] **knowingly** and with **intent to defraud**, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct **furthers the intended fraud** and obtains anything of value,\n\nIt is very hard to see how merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute acting with **intent to defraud**, nor how it will allow the person connecting the device to obtain anything of value fraudulently.\n\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(A)] **knowingly** causes the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, **intentionally causes damage without authorization**, to a protected computer;\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(B)] **intentionally** accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, **recklessly causes damage**;\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(C)] **intentionally** accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, **causes damage and loss**.\n\nAside from subsection (a)(2\\)(C), all the listed offenses require \"knowing\" or \"intentional\" action. Even (a)(2\\)(C) requires proof that the accused intentionally accessed a protected computer without authorization.

So if they pay dividends to shareholders of your class (it is possible to establish multiple classes of shareholders) then you will receive 35% of the dividends paid.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's rights to the company's profits?\n\nA) John is automatically entitled to receive 35% of the company's profits, regardless of whether dividends are declared.\n\nB) John will receive 35% of any dividends declared, but the company is not obligated to declare dividends.\n\nC) John's resignation terminates his right to receive any profits or dividends from the company.\n\nD) John must receive a K-1 form annually, detailing his share of the company's profits, which he can then claim on his personal tax return.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. As a shareholder, John is entitled to receive dividends proportional to his ownership (35%) if and when the company declares dividends. However, the company is not obligated to declare dividends or distribute profits to shareholders. This is especially true for C-Corporations, which the company is likely to be given that John has not received a K-1 form.\n\nOption A is incorrect because shareholders are not automatically entitled to a company's profits; profits are only distributed through dividends when declared by the company.\n\nOption C is incorrect because John's resignation from his position in the company does not affect his rights as a shareholder. He still owns 35% of the shares and retains the rights associated with that ownership.\n\nOption D is incorrect because K-1 forms are typically associated with S-Corporations or partnerships, not C-Corporations. If this were an S-Corporation, John would indeed receive a K-1, but the question implies it's likely a C-Corporation."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23092/how-copyright-laws-apply-for-commonly-public-things", "docs_id": 23092, "title": "How copyright laws apply for commonly public things?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm developing a website that displays quotes, similar to [brainyquote.com](http://brainyquote.com)\n\nAll the quotes (around 10,000\\) are also displayed on different websites.\n\nSo how do copyright laws affect me in this situation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on the nature of the quote. Quotes from Buddha, Aristotle and Lincoln are out of copyright. Otherwise, the two basic questions are: who put that quote in fixed form, and is copying it \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info)\"? If for example you happen to be at a political rally where a politician makes a noteworthy extemporaneous quote, you could be the copyright holder, because copyright law protects the person who first puts the work into fixed form.

The legality depends on the source of the quote (e.g., whether it's from a copyrighted work or a public figure), the length of the quote, and how it's being used.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it's too absolute.

Alabama's abortion law criminalizes the performance of abortions within the state's jurisdiction, not abortions performed in other states where the practice is legal. Dr. Smith, while licensed in Alabama, performed the abortion in California where it is legal. Alabama law does not have jurisdiction over medical procedures performed legally in other states.

The company was called `X Pvt.Ltd.` (this is the company that is registered). They were later called `Y` and now they are named `Z`. \n\nThey are funded by a reputed company named `G`, and `G`'s website shows that they are funding company `Y`. My offer letter mentions the company name as `Z (*)` and at the bottom of the letter, is the explanation of the asterisk, which goes like `X Pvt.Ltd. d/b/a Z`. The d/b/a, I understand is \"Doing Business As\". I also verified the registrations on [this website](http://www.register.com/whois.rcmx). \n\nThe bottom of the offer letter mentions the CEO's name and the letter (pdf format) has been emailed to me by the tech VP via the company `Z`'s email domain name.

While John didn't have a formal contract with Sarah, factors such as the exact wording of his permission, whether Sarah provided something of value in exchange, and the extent to which Sarah relied on John's promise all play a role in determining whether John can revoke permission and pursue legal action.

Requiring someone to friend a Facebook page, while unusual, is not illegal and could be considered part of the contract's consideration.\n2.

However, one of the reasons we signed that contract was because of that verbal agreement (can it be called like that?).\n\nIn British law, is there somehow a possibility that that conversation can be used to defend us? Or as it is not written is as if it didn't happened?\n\nWould this mean that a landlord could actually tell a lots of lies about a contract (for example to someone that has limited reading capabilities, or like me, someone that is not used to English law \"slang\" as its not their mother tongue) and \"cheat\" the tenant to sign?\n\nI guess one possible (and likely) answer to this is \"its the tenant responsibility to understand the contract, and the only things that apply are the ones in the contract\".\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not looking for real legal advice, just curious on how far the law extends here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is the tenant's responsibility to understand the written contract. Oral statements about the contract do have to be consistent with the written contract (that is, in the context where you ask the landlord what a particular clause means before signing \\-\\- not in the case where you are modifying an existing contract). If I were renting a room and the contract says \"Du m\u00e5 betale $1000 hver dag\", which I don't understand because my Norwegian is terrible, I would ask about this, and the landlord might say that it means \"You must pay $1000 every month\", which could be a decent deal. Actually, the clause says \"You must pay $1000 every day\". When the reality of the situation becomes clear, then it is obvious that we didn't have an agreement in the first place. Perhaps he mis\\-spoke, or his English is as bad as my Norwegian, but I would not be held to rate in the written contract, assuming that I could back up my claim that he gave me that interpretation: the lease would probably be voided, as not an actual agreement. The underlying principle is that there has to be a \"meeting of the minds\" where the parties understand what they will get and what they must give, and there was a demonstrable failure of understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, if I sign a contract without really reading it carefully, and there is a clause in English (which I speak) saying that I have to pay $1000 a day, but I didn't really think about the clause so that in a sense I didn't understand what I had agreed to, well, I may still be on the hook. (On the third hand, a court would probably say that's a ridiculous rent and void the contract on policy grounds). In general, \"not my first language\" is not a get\\-out\\-of\\-contract card, though attempts to trick people into signing documents in languages that they really have no understanding of won't be successful. Virtually nobody but a lawyer actually understands contractual language, yet contracts are enforced all the time.\n\nA contract can be explicitly modified by verbal agreement, or can be entirely verbal, but oral agreements face evidence problems, namely, what *exactly* did A and B say? It's scientifically well established that parties can be morally certain that the conversation went \"A\" (for one person) and \"Not A\" (for the other person). Using \"could\" rather than \"would\" in speech makes a huge difference in interpretation. There is a rule, the [parol evidence rule](http://articles.rollingsons.co.uk/2012/04/the-parol-evidence-rule.html), which essentially says that unless there is a good reason to not do so, the contract as written is what is enforced.\n\nEven if the conversation had been written into the contract, there's no basis in the contract for objectively determining whether a thing is old and \"just broke\". So even as an additional clause in the contract, it doesn't afford you a clear escape hatch.

It *is* illegal to possess or receive certain kinds of pornography, namely child porn, under [18 USC 2252](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252) and [18 USC 2252a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2252A) (there is a subtle legal difference between \"[child pornography](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2256#8)\" and \"visual depiction (which) involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\"). In order to view anything on the internet, you have to first receive it, so there is potential criminal liability. These sections allows one affirmative defense, if one\n\n> knowingly possesses, or knowingly accesses with intent to view, any\n>  book, magazine, periodical, film, videotape, computer disk, or any\n>  other material that contains an image of child pornography that has\n>  been mailed, or shipped or transported using any means or facility of\n>  interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or\n>  foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or that was\n>  produced using materials that have been mailed, or shipped or\n>  transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any\n>  means, including by computer;\n\nbut also\n\n> (1\\) possessed less than three images of child pornography; and\n> \n> \n> (2\\) promptly and in good faith, and without retaining or allowing any\n>  person, other than a law enforcement agency, to access any image or\n>  copy thereof\u2014\n> \n> \n> (A) took reasonable steps to destroy each such image; or\n> \n> \n> (B) reported the matter to a law enforcement agency and afforded that\n>  agency access to each such image.\n\nA person's belief that the website was moderated is not a defense.\n\nThere are also state statutes, typically stronger, which outlaw possession of child porn. [Crabtree v. Kentucky](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-court-of-appeals/1609602.html) is an example of such a (successful) conviction. The court addresses the question of whether \"merely viewing\" can constitute actual possession: the court found that it did:\n\n> Crabtree urges us to consider that his merely viewing child\n>  pornography images before deleting them should not be deemed to\n>  constitute actual possession. After reviewing the facts of this case,\n>  we are not persuaded that this is a valid argument in light of the\n>  Ninth Circuit's definition of possession in Romm, supra: that the act\n>  of seeking out child pornography and exercising control over it\n>  constitutes criminal possession\u2014regardless of whether it is\n>  downloaded. Crabtree admitted to seeking out the material and to\n>  having it on his computer.\n\nIt would be impractical to try to review 50 states' worth of child porn laws plus the federal statute, but there is also a \u201cTemporary innocent possession\u201d defense, which is conceivably applicable to the situation where you click a link and surprise! In the above case, defendant had to click a link that indicated the nature of the contents, and had to confirm file\\-saving of a file whose name was indicative of its content. Such circumstances overrule the presumption of temporary innocent possession.\n\nA question raised in the comments is whether a porn\\-ambush could lead to a conviction. Suppose that a web page has a number of embedded child\\-porn images which are saved to a user's computer without his knowledge. As pointed out in [this report](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/news/congressional-testimony-and-reports/sex-offense-topics/201212-federal-child-pornography-offenses/Chapter_02.pdf) of the US Sentencing Commission,\n\n> A conviction for receipt, however, requires proof beyond a reasonable\n>  doubt that a defendant *knowingly* came into possession of child\n>  pornography at the time that the image or video was received\n\nwith case law citations. The case of [US v. Kuchinski](https://openjurist.org/469/f3d/853/united-states-v-kuchinski), 469 F. 3d 853 is instructive, because defendant did knowingly seek out and download a number of child porn images, and was convicted. In 94 of those cases, he knew he was receiving child pornography; in over 10,000 other cases, such images were found in his system cache (this is relevant to sentencing). The court found that it matters that \"Kuchinski had no knowledge of the images that were simply in the cache files\", and the court concluded, in K's favor, that\n\n> Where a defendant lacks knowledge about the cache files, and\n>  concomitantly lacks access to and control over those files, it is not\n>  proper to charge him with possession and control of the child\n>  pornography images located in those files, without some other\n>  indication of dominion and control over the images.

An individual or company involved in virtual currency transactions would be considered a money transmitter if (1\\) it acts as an \"exchanger\" or \"administrator\" in the transactions; (2\\) the virtual currency involved is a \"convertible virtual currency\" (CVC); and (3\\) the company facilitates the movement of funds between different persons or locations.\n\nPertaining to exchanging/issuing:\n\n> Importantly for app and game developers, an administrator is an entity that (1\\) issues a virtual currency and (2\\) has the authority to redeem the virtual currency. \"Issuing\" means putting a virtual currency into circulation, for example, by providing users virtual currency for free, in exchange for real currency, or as a promotion. Redeeming means withdrawing the virtual currency from circulation, whether in exchange for in\\-game/in\\-app items or features, real\\-world goods or services, or real currency, or otherwise.\n\nAnd more specifically, \n\n> An administrator would be a money transmitter, however, only if the virtual currency it issues and redeems is a CVC.

This is typical of how capricious this field is, and how \"laws as written\" provide little practical guidance.*\n\nWith in\\-game virtual currencies, game platform developers want USD to turn into those currencies, and not become USD again. This solves the \"money transmitter\" problem.

Other details you describe reflect that the company has been \\-\\-or is being\\-\\- malicious or grossly negligent. If so, strictly speaking, the company's conduct (1\\) ought to weaken its position or merits in trying to force you out, and (2\\) tends to contravene the *contract law* covenant of *good faith and fair dealing* (see below).\n\nIf your lease mentions any statutes regarding *rent\\-controlled* units, you may want to search for case law at [leagle.com](http://www.leagle.com/leaglesearch?crt=Louisiana) to see how the statutes are applied.\n\nWithout knowing the terms of your lease, I think your priority should at all times be the rent itself so as to avoid eviction.\n\n> Does the \"billing every two months\" in the lease have any hold on this\n>  issue if they breached their own lease?\n\nMaybe not. The repeated, yet sole, failure to send you the bimonthly billings falls short of landlord's *breach of contract*.\n\nFor your argument on *breach of contract* to prevail, you would have to prove that the landlord knowingly/deliberately let the water bills pile up *prior to* demanding you to pay everything at once. That would prove that the landlord is not meeting the *covenant of good faith and fair dealing* that is prerequisite in contract law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in a rent-controlled unit has been back-billed for 4.5 years of water utilities by their landlord, despite the lease stating bills should be sent every two months.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The landlord's actions are illegal because they violate the statute of limitations for breach of contract claims in Louisiana.\n\nB) The tenant has no obligation to pay the back-billed utilities because the landlord breached the lease by not sending bills every two months.\n\nC) The landlord can legally back-bill for the utilities, but their actions may violate the covenant of good faith and fair dealing if done maliciously.\n\nD) The tenant can refuse to pay the utilities without risk of eviction because the unit is rent-controlled.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the landlord can legally back-bill for utilities within the statute of limitations (which is 10 years in Louisiana for breach of contract claims), their actions may violate the covenant of good faith and fair dealing if done maliciously to force the tenant out. Option A is incorrect because the back-billing does not violate the statute of limitations. Option B is incorrect because the failure to send bimonthly bills alone doesn't constitute a breach of contract that would negate the tenant's obligation to pay.

This would be based on your friend being the actual father, and the non\\-mother not having adopted the child (extinguishing the obligations of the father). Many states, but not Michigan, have adopted the Uniform Parentage Act which covers assisted reproduction, but even in those states, this does not constitute assisted reproduction. The \"agreement\" is legally invalid (surrogate parentage contracts are [unenforceable](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(az2hzlgpudqfozvvzec0a2n3))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectName=mcl-act-199-of-1988)), and that, folks, is why you should hire an attorney rather than devising a legal theory on your own.\n\n[This article](https://www.icle.org/modules/books/chapter.aspx?chapter=13&book=2020553510&lib=family&partdisplayed=2&from=store) summarizes the various paternity laws of Michigan. Under the [Paternity Act](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(fhfblzdrgwa0cpysgkxqlykp))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-722-711), this may be a child born out of wedlock, if the child is\n\n> a child begotten and born to a woman who was not married from the\n> conception to the date of birth of the child, or a child that the\n> court has determined to be a child born or conceived during a marriage\n> but not\n> *the issue of that marriage*\n\nwhere the meaning of the last expression would have to be determined by the court. Probably the court would say \"this child is not the 'issue' of the marriage\", given legislative intent. Under the [Acknowledgment of Parentage Act](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(oj2s2t0izrcixpt0y53jirgj))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-305-of-1996), unmarried parent can by signing a statement \"define\" the parentage of a child, but the statute is specifically limited to a man acknowledging paternity, and cannot apply to a lesbian couple.\n\nThe clearest statement of the law of parentage for lesbian couples in Michigan is [Lefever v. Matthews](https://www.courts.michigan.gov/siteassets/case-documents/uploads/OPINIONS/FINAL/COA/20210401_C353106_49_353106.OPN.PDF) where (just one year ago) the court held that both of two women were parents \u2013 but in that case, the eggs came from one of the women and they were implanted into the other woman. An important distinguishing feature is that in this case, the woman at a statutory disadvantage sought parental rights, whereas your question is about a legal parent seeking to avoid a legal obligation to the child. Courts generally do everything possible to protect a child's right to support by the parents. The prospects that an actual father could avoid that obligation are slim.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of a private sperm donation arrangement between a man and a lesbian couple in Michigan, where an informal agreement was made for the man to give up parental rights and not pay child support, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The informal agreement is legally binding and the man cannot be required to pay child support.\n\nB) The man can be held responsible for child support, but only from the date when the couple requested it, not for any back payments.\n\nC) The man can likely be held responsible for child support, including back payments, despite the informal agreement.\n\nD) The informal agreement is valid as long as it was witnessed and signed by all parties involved.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, informal agreements to give up parental rights and avoid child support obligations are not legally binding in Michigan. The document created without legal counsel is likely to be considered invalid. Courts generally prioritize the child's right to support from both parents. The Paternity Act in Michigan could classify this as a child born out of wedlock, and the actual biological father can be held responsible for child support. The court is unlikely to allow a biological parent to avoid financial responsibility for their child, regardless of prior informal agreements. Additionally, child support is typically considered a right of the child, not the parents, so it cannot be waived by parental agreement. Therefore, the man could potentially be held responsible for child support, including back payments, despite the informal agreement made with the lesbian couple."}, "31": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4062/proving-relationship-to-deceased", "docs_id": 4062, "title": "Proving relationship to deceased", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My brother in law died recently, we had very little interaction with him in the past 4 year.

In mass gunfight scenarios, the primary challenge for prosecutors is often the difficulty in proving intent beyond a reasonable doubt. This is due to several factors:\n\n1. In situations where multiple parties claim self-defense, it becomes extremely challenging to prove that any single individual acted with criminal intent rather than in self-defense.\n\n2. The chaotic nature of such events makes it difficult to establish a clear sequence of events or to determine who initiated the conflict.\n\n3.

The certificate of the officer or affidavit of the person that he or she has sent the copy in pursuance of this Section is evidence that he or she has done so.\n\nThe key is that the service of process be *completed*. Legally, this implies that the server will file an affidavit that describes the circumstances of the legal completion of service. For example, [here](http://12.218.239.52/Forms/pdf_files/CCG0074.pdf) is a sample affidavit.\n\nLike any other trade, process servers have an association that offers training, publishes a [policy manual](http://napps.org/members-policy.aspx), and abides by certain [best practices](http://napps.org/best_practices.asp). \n\nAll that said, the best practices don't specify any specific verbiage.

The server is required to file an affidavit detailing how the service was completed. While there are best practices and guidelines, there's no universal requirement for specific phrases like \"You've been served.\" State laws, such as the Illinois statute cited, focus on the methods of delivery rather than mandating particular wording.

This includes the right to present arguments or reasons supporting various ideas, even controversial ones. Justifying communal violence, while morally questionable, falls under this protected speech. However, there is a distinction between justification and incitement. The Constitution allows for reasonable restrictions on speech that incites violence or threatens public order, state security, or national integrity. Therefore, while justifying past violence might be protected, actively encouraging or inciting new violence could potentially be restricted by law.

They work on revenue share. If there is not enough revenue to where their share would be greater than or equal to minimum wage, is the company required to cover the difference? What if this is a full\\-time employee, opposed to a contractor?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anyone who is an employee as defined in the federal [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf) (FLSA), 29 USC 201 et seq.(or parallel state minimum wage laws) and is not within the scope of an exemption to the minimum wage law, must be paid minimum wage.\n\nThe relevant question is whether or not the person is an employee who is not exempt from the minimum wage requirement as defined in the FLSA. The question is a mixed issue of fact and law in which the characterization given to the relationship by the company and the person doing the work is one factor, but not the only or the controlling factor, in determining employee status.\n\nThe exact nature of the work governs whether the FLSA's minimum wage requirement applies or not. For example, \"employee\" is defined for puroses of the FLSA at 29 USC 203(e) to exclude \"any individual employed by an employer engaged in agriculture if such individual is the parent, spouse, child, or other member of the employer\u2019s immediate family\" and certain kinds of volunteers. Piecework pay is allows under certain limited circumstances by 29 USC 207(g) when the usual result is that reasonable workers earn the minimum wage. Tipped employees (which is a form of revenue sharing) also receive special treatment. Most of the exemptions are found at 29 USC 213\\. Most relevant to your question is 29 USC 213(a)(1\\) which includes an exception for an \"outside saleman\" who is paid on a straight commission basis, and 29 USC 213(a)(5\\) and (a)(6\\) which contain exclusions for certain farming and fishing occupations.\n\nStraight commission compensation without regard to the minimum wage is generally not permitted with regard to an employee who is an \"inside salesman\" (e.g. someone who works at a retail store in a mall or at a phone bank for a telemarketing company), or for anyone other than an outside saleman in non\\-agricultural jobs.\n\nIndependent contractor status generally depends upon the degree of control that the company has over the manner in which the work is performed, the assignability of the contract to do the work, and the extent to which the worker does work for many different companies on a contract basis while complying with employment related laws for the contactor's own employees (e.g. worker's compensation). The working for many different companies on a contract basis prong of the test is frequently controlling in practice. Six of the main factors considered by the Labor Department in determining independent contractor status are discussed in [Fact Sheet \\#13](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs13.htm).\n\nA true independent contractor may be paid on a revenue sharing basis without regard to minimum wage, although in practice, if this results in the independent contractor earning less than minimum wage, there will be strict scrutiny of the practice. Typical independent contractor arrangements that would be allowed would include an attorney working on a contingent fee basis, or an independent broker or realtor working on a straight commission bais. More often than not, a true independent contractor is someone you couldn't even imagine being an employee subject to minimum wage laws of the company in light of the overall relationship and often this will involve a business to business contract, rather than a business to a non\\-professional individual contract with only personal services involved.\n\nThere are some safe harbor provisions that if met can insure independent contract status, but it is very common for someone who legally is an employee to be misclassified as an independent contractor in an attempt (often futile if the matter is pressed by regulatory or tax officials) to avoid compliance with laws incident to the employment relationship.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup hires several individuals to work on a new app development project. The company classifies these workers as independent contractors and pays them on a revenue-sharing basis tied to app downloads. After three months, it's discovered that some workers' earnings fall below minimum wage due to low download numbers. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the company's obligations?\n\nA) The company has no obligation to pay minimum wage, as revenue-sharing agreements are always exempt from such requirements.\n\nB) The company must immediately reclassify all workers as employees and pay back wages to meet minimum wage standards.\n\nC) The company should carefully reassess the workers' status, considering factors like control over work methods and exclusivity, to determine if they are misclassified employees entitled to minimum wage.\n\nD) As long as the workers signed contracts agreeing to the revenue-sharing model, the company is protected from any minimum wage claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The key issue here is whether the workers are truly independent contractors or misclassified employees. The classification can't be determined solely by the company's label or the existence of a contract. Factors such as the degree of control over work methods, exclusivity of the relationship, and the nature of the work must be considered. If the workers are found to be employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), they would be entitled to minimum wage regardless of the revenue-sharing agreement. The company should carefully evaluate the working relationship using the criteria outlined by the Department of Labor (such as those in Fact Sheet #13) to determine the correct classification and any resulting obligations. Simply having a revenue-sharing agreement doesn't automatically exempt the company from minimum wage laws if the workers are, in fact, employees."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/90182/are-you-allowed-to-solve-an-exercise-from-a-book-more-than-seven-times", "docs_id": 90182, "title": "Are you allowed to solve an exercise from a book more than seven times?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Germany, apparently, you are allowed to make a \"Privatkopie\" at most seven times.

Like if you burn your mom a CD. Or gift your girlfriend a mix tape. Or copy a page of the book and hand out the excercise to your two study buddies.\n\nSo there was a [court decision](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie#Anzahl_der_Kopien) that \"more than seven\" was more than what you would normally consider a private copy covered by this fee. If you make more than seven copies of a cassette for example, it would be okay to assume that you no longer did that \"for a close friend\".\n\nObviously, copying something from a book as you describe, by writing it down with a pencil on a notepad, is in no way \"a lossless copy\". Even if you type it into an app, manually copying something into another medium is not lossless. Ever. It is also for your very personal use, you don't give it to anyone, not even close friends.\n\nSo yes, you can make as many copies as you like, for yourself. If one breaks, and you make another, that is fine. If one breaks every day and you need 700 over the course of two years? Fine.

The limit of 7 copies originated from concerns about high-quality reproductions made with copying devices. This number was established as a guideline for what constitutes reasonable personal use versus potential copyright infringement when using copying machines or similar technologies. Manually copying exercises, either by writing them down or typing them into a note-taking app, falls under personal use and is not subject to this limitation.

However, Article 2.12 defines peace officers as including only those who hold a permanent peace officer license issued under Chapter 1701, Occupations Code. Without this specific license, the retired officer does not fall under the legal definition of a peace officer and thus does not have the same reporting obligations.

That would be a great exaggeration of the barrier to release and incorrectly reverses the burden. Instead, the Review Board must find evidence that there is a significant continuing risk to the public, at the time of the hearing, in order to keep the person in custody. **There is no burden on the accused or on anyone to rule out future occurrences with any certainty**.\n\n[Latimer and Lawrence explain](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/jsp-sjp/rr06_1/p1.html#sec11):\n\n> The Supreme Court of Canada further clarified in *[R. v.

But when using Google Analytics configured in the way explained in my other post, the visitor is not tracked. At least not in a way which violates the GDPR.\n\nYou worry about the cookies. I also found [this article](https://www.humix.be/blog/configure-google-analytics-for-gdpr/) which also does and suggests to either:\n\n* change the `_ga` cookie to a session cookie, so it will be removed when the browser is closed. To do this, set the Cookie Expiration variable in your Google Analytics Settings to 0\\.\n* completely disable cookies. (GA does not require cookies). To do this, set the `storage` field to `none`:\n\n```\nga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', {\n  'storage': 'none'\n});\n\n```\n\nIf you do not disable cookies, cookies can be used for tracking, which is more general defined in the GDPR as profiling. Profiling is defined in [Art. 4 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) as:\n\n> \u2018profiling\u2019 means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;\n\n[Art. 22(1\\) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/) disallows profiling. Therefore in the settings menu from Google Analytics you have to disable data sharing and data collection.\n\nSo data will only be used for the analytics function. But because you have configured to Anonymize your visitors IP Address, the part of the IP address used for this, is no longer considered personal data. This is because approx. 250 other users share the same part of the ip address which is stored, so data is not distinguishable between those 250 users. \n\nThe anonymisation used by google is currently considered good enough. At least by the Dutch DPA. This might change if someone proves it is not good enough anonymized. \n\nNote that I am not a lawyer either, but I have read from multiple experts that analytics can be a \"legitimate interest\", the same way marketing can be a legitimate interest. This way configured the privacy impact is considered very low.\n\nIt is also very important to note that a [DPA](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-6/) consideres GA Google Analytics compliant. Even if a court would not agree in the future, you are acting in good faith if you follow those instructions, so you will probably not be fined. The DPA does currently not suggest to change the `_ga` cookie to a session cookie, or disable cookies completely.\n\nNote that the GDPR does not require doing anything to make it **technical** impossible to track someone. If a website has access to the data to track someone, but \"promises\" not to do that, that is fine. And rules regarding the usage of cookies in general, is not part of the GDPR, but (currently) part of the [ePrivacy Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002). Only the way to ask for consent for storing cookies is defined in the GDPR.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to GDPR regulations and expert interpretations, which of the following configurations would most likely allow a website to use Google Analytics without explicit user consent under the \"legitimate interest\" justification?\n\nA) Using Google Analytics with default settings, including full IP address storage and long-term cookies\n\nB) Using Google Analytics with anonymized IP addresses, but keeping the default 2-year expiration for the _ga cookie\n\nC) Using Google Analytics with anonymized IP addresses, disabling data sharing and collection for purposes other than analytics, and either setting the _ga cookie to expire at the end of the session or disabling cookies entirely\n\nD) Not using Google Analytics at all and relying solely on server-side log analysis\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C represents the most GDPR-compliant configuration for using Google Analytics without explicit consent. This approach minimizes privacy impact by anonymizing IP addresses, limiting data use to analytics only, and either shortening cookie lifespans or eliminating them. While not using analytics at all (option D) would avoid GDPR concerns, it doesn't address the question of using GA under legitimate interest. Options A and B maintain practices that could be considered tracking under GDPR, potentially requiring explicit consent.

The original recording is not made\n> available to the public but transcripts are. When, where, and why is\n> this done?\n\nIn Colorado this is done in all limited jurisdiction court proceedings (i.e. the courts where misdemeanors and smaller money claims and evictions involving premises with fairly low rents are tried), and in most general jurisdiction court proceedings unless the parties pay for live transcription at their own expense. Transcripts are made when there is a sound recording only upon a request submitted to the court that then outsources the request to independent contractor transcriptionists.\n\nThis is a fairly recent development and there may be live stenographers (also known as court reporters) in some general jurisdiction courts still today in Colorado, but it is profoundly less expensive to tape record a hearing or trial and just transcribe them upon request at the expense of a party, than it is to have a live stenographer make a verbatim record of every hearing or trial. In limited jurisdiction courts typically only about one in a hundred cases is appealed, and in general jurisdiction courts typically about one in ten cases are appealed. The marginal cost of an audio recording that isn't transcribed, once the courtrooms are wired for sound, is negligible (perhaps $10 per day (or less) for storage media). The marginal costs of a live stenographer or transcriptionist per day is on the order of $240\\+, which adds up over the course of a year. In the limited jurisdiction court, live court reporting would cost about $24,000 per day of trial *in cases that are actually appealed* (since only about 1% of cases are appealed and those cases would have to bear the entire cost of the transcription system). In general jurisdiction courts, live court reporting would cost about $2,400 per day of trial *in cases that are actually appealed* (since only about 10% of cases are appealed and those cases would have to bear the entire cost of the transcription system).\n\nIn contrast, with sound recordings, the cost per day of trial actually appealed in limited jurisdiction courts would cost $1,240, and in general jurisdiction courts it would cost $340\\. These are judicial branch expenses small enough to be financed with court filing fees.\n\nDepositions prior to a trial are often handled by a live stenographer and sometimes handled by a videographer as well, but almost never conducted with sound only recordings in the absence of extreme circumstances like a blizzard that makes it impossible to secure the court reporter's attendance (in part because there is almost always a desire to have a transcript made and because the stenographer can confirm spellings and ambiguous sounding words with the deponents and counsel during breaks avoiding errors in the final product).\n\n> Are court proceedings ever filmed or otherwise visually recorded?\n\nDepositions and court proceedings are sometimes filmed. A video of a deposition can be presented to a judge or jury in lieu of testimony when the witness is not available or to impeach the testimony of the witness.\n\nIt is unusual in Colorado for court proceedings to be visually recorded. But, in Alaska, there is a state constitutional right to participate in most kinds of court proceedings and legislative hearings by video conference (because geographically, Alaska is about a third the size of the continental U.S. and thinly populated with large roadless areas), so I presume that in Alaska, court proceedings are routinely videotaped.\n\nSome courts in the U.S. do initial appearances and arraignments in many criminal cases by closed circuit television from the jail, before a judge in the court house, in order to reduce the need to transport prisoners from the jail to the court house for a perfunctory five minute hearing which is not evidentiary, and there may be video recordings of those proceedings as well.\n\nMany federal courts and some state courts do status conferences and similar minor procedural hearings by telephone conference call and those are usually audio recorded without a live court reporter.\n\nIn Colorado, all oral arguments in appeals (except those rare cases that are secret such as juvenile cases and rare cases involving the details of trade secrets) are live streamed and podcast over the Internet. Many other appellate courts (but not the U.S. Supreme Court) do this as well. But, transcripts of oral arguments at the appellate level are rarely considered in further appeals. The video (or in the case of U.S. Supreme Court hearings, previously transcripts only and now audio as well) are released for PR reasons and for public transparency, reflecting appellate court's role as law making institutions, not for the litigants themselves.\n\n> It seems that facial expression, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc.\n> are part of the body of evidence on which a judge or jury decides a\n> case. So is this type of record ever made available, and if so, when?\n\nA deposition or other videotape provided as evidence in a case at trial is part of the record on appeal that an appellate court may consider. And, a judge or jury may consider things like facial expressions, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc. in those cases.\n\nBut, video of the court proceeding itself is simply a basis for preparing a transcript that will become part of the court record. Appellate courts in common law systems are forbidden from considering things like facial expressions, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc. of witnesses testifying in a trial. This is part of the credibility evaluation function that is reserved entirely to the judge or jury who is the trier of fact in a case.\n\nThe only time a video of a trial court proceeding itself would be considered would be as evidence in a different trial arising out of events that took place in the courtroom itself.\n\nFor example, suppose that a court bailiff goes berserk and starts shooting jurors for no reason in the middle of a trial that was being videotaped. That videotape could be considered in a criminal trial of the court bailiff for assault with a deadly weapon or murder, or in a civil case brought by the jurors or their surviving next of kin, for battery or wrongful death. The appellate court of the criminal or civil trial of the bailiff could consider the videotape, but an appellate court considering an appeal of the proceeding that was being videotaped could not.\n\nThis is basically just a historical artifact. If videotape had been in existence at the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 CE, appellate courts in common law countries would no doubt have the right to review questions of both fact and law, rather than merely law as they do today.\n\nIn civil law countries, such as those of continental Europe, judges take notes regarding evidence, but there is no verbatim record of the proceedings and any assertion that the judge was mistaken about the facts is resolved by retrying the disputed facts over again in a second instance court proceeding, a process reflecting even more rudimentary court resources than those existing prior to tape and video recording were invented.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Colorado's court system, which of the following statements is true regarding the use of sound recordings versus live stenographers?\n\nA) All courts in Colorado use live stenographers for every proceeding.\nB) Sound recordings are used in all limited jurisdiction courts and most general jurisdiction courts, with transcripts made upon request.\nC) Video recordings have completely replaced both stenographers and audio recordings in all Colorado courts.\nD) Parties are required to pay for live transcription in all general jurisdiction court proceedings.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, Colorado uses sound recordings in all limited jurisdiction court proceedings (such as those for misdemeanors and smaller money claims) and in most general jurisdiction court proceedings. Transcripts are made from these recordings only when requested, typically for appeals. This approach is more cost-effective than using live stenographers for every proceeding, especially considering that only a small percentage of cases are appealed (about 1% in limited jurisdiction courts and 10% in general jurisdiction courts). \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because not all courts use live stenographers; in fact, many have switched to sound recordings. \n\nAnswer C is false because video recordings have not completely replaced other methods; sound recordings are the primary method mentioned for most courts. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because parties are not required to pay for live transcription in all general jurisdiction court proceedings. The text states that live transcription is available in general jurisdiction courts only if parties pay for it at their own expense, implying it's optional, not required."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/89755/what-does-abetment-mean-within-the-context-of-prevention-of-corruption-act-201", "docs_id": 89755, "title": "what does &quot;abetment&quot; mean within the context of Prevention of corruption act 2018 (India)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Section 12 of the Act only states that abetment of any offence in the act is also an offence and is punisbable. Bribing is a separate crime within the act but then what does abetment mean in the context of this law then ? can encouraging someone to take or give bribes be considered abetment ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Abetment is to [abet](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/abetment)\n\n> To encourage or incite another to commit a crime. This word is usually applied to aiding in the commission of a crime. To abet another to commit a murder is to command, procure, counsel, encourage, induce, or assist. To facilitate the commission of a crime, promote its accomplishment, or help in advancing or bringing it about.\n\nSo encouraging someone to give or take bribes is abetment, and so would, say, conveying the bribe itself so they don't have to meet in circumstances where it would be noticed.\n\nPer the legal dictionary of the Free Dictionary.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of anti-bribery laws, which of the following scenarios would NOT typically be considered abetment of bribery?\n\nA) Advising a colleague on how to discreetly offer a bribe to a government official\nB) Acting as an intermediary to deliver a bribe from one party to another\nC) Witnessing a bribe being offered but remaining silent and not reporting it\nD) Actively encouraging a business partner to accept a bribe to secure a contract\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation:\nA) Advising on how to offer a bribe is a clear example of abetment, as it involves counseling and encouraging the commission of the crime.\n\nB) Acting as an intermediary to deliver a bribe is facilitating the crime and helping to bring it about, which falls under the definition of abetment.\n\nC) While witnessing a bribe and not reporting it may be ethically questionable, it does not typically meet the legal threshold for abetment. Abetment requires active encouragement, assistance, or facilitation of the crime.\n\nD) Actively encouraging someone to accept a bribe is a direct form of abetment, as it involves inducing or encouraging the commission of the crime.\n\nThe correct answer is C because it's the only scenario that doesn't involve active participation in encouraging, facilitating, or assisting in the act of bribery."}}
