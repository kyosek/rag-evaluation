When is a soldier taking \"active part\" in the hostilities?\n\nAre they considered to take an active part when they are sleeping? Awake but eating dinner? Does it matter if they are armed at the time, or merely \"in uniform\"?

Simply being asleep, out of uniform, or unarmed does not qualify a soldier as hors de combat. As a member of the armed forces who is not in any of these situations, the soldier is still considered to be taking an active part in hostilities, even while sleeping or not actively engaged in combat. The fact that the soldier is not expressing intention to surrender is crucial, as this would be required for them to be considered hors de combat in this situation."

While the show shares this basic premise with a comic book series, many character personalities and plot details differ significantly from the source material. If the producers changed all character names except Lucifer's, which of the following statements would most accurately describe the show's copyright status in relation to the original comic series?\n\nA) The show would be completely free from copyright concerns, as character names are the primary basis for copyright infringement.\n\nB) The show would still likely be considered a derivative work and require licensing, due to the shared core concept and storyline.\n\nC) Changing character names would protect the show from copyright issues, as long as Lucifer's name remains unchanged.\n\nD) The show would be considered an entirely original work, with no connection to the comic series for copyright purposes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Even if character names were changed, the show would still likely be considered a derivative work of the original comic series. This is because copyright protection extends beyond just character names to include core concepts, storylines, and overall creative expression. The shared premise of Lucifer leaving Hell to run a nightclub on Earth is a significant element that links the show to the source material. While changes to character personalities and plot details demonstrate creative license, they do not negate the underlying similarities in the basic concept. In copyright law, derivative works are those that are based on or derived from one or more preexisting works. Therefore, despite significant changes, the show would still likely require licensing from the copyright holder (DC Comics in this case) to avoid infringement, as it builds upon the fundamental ideas and narrative framework established in the comic series."

If you are not the intended recipient, or have received this communication in error, please notify the sender immediately by reply e\\-mail or by telephone and delete all copies of the communication, including attachments, without reading them or saving them to disk. If you are the intended recipient, you must secure the contents in accordance with all applicable state or federal requirements related to the privacy and confidentiality of information, including the FERPA and HIPAA Privacy guidelines.\n> \n> \n> Under Florida law, e\\-mail addresses, and all forms of communications,\n> including e\\-mail communications, made or received in connection with\n> the transaction of School Board business are public records, which\n> must be retained as required by law and must be disclosed upon receipt\n> of a public records request, except as may be excluded by federal or\n> state laws. If you do not want your e\\-mail address released in\n> response to a public records request, do not send electronic mail to\n> this entity. Instead, contact this office by phone.\n\nMy question regards the tail ends of both paragraphs. In both cases is appears that I'd be subject to binding by law or reductions in my privacy due to an email I may never have requested. In particular the first paragraph suggests that a public entity could contact me(provided they intended to) and I can then become responsible for securing the contents of an email I may never have requested or anticipated.\n\nThe second paragraph seems to suggest that my email address could become public record if I responded to a message sent in error(it lacks the clause about intended recipient). It seems backwards to make my information public based on interacting *at all* with the sender of an email I received.\n\nThe precise question is this: Can this school cause me to come under the authority of Florida public records law or make me subject to disclosure agreement regarding the information simply by sending it to me? Is there any requirement for at least implied consent?\n\n(In case it matters, I don't have any great need to do so, I'm just curious at the presumptive language used in the notice).\n\nEdit: The linked answer provides information for one of the clauses and suggests a possible answer for the rest, but doesn't provide for the disclosure clause regarding my own email. I've edited the question to try to twine them together more clearly. The whole concern is the ability of another entity to essentially opt me into an agreement, wherein the only real consent is opening a communication I received to see what it might be.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The second paragraph actually says that your e\\-mail address *will* become public record if you send an e\\-mail message to them. That's because there's a Florida law that requires this. If you want to communicate with the school without your e\\-mail address appearing in the public record, you can call on the telephone, send postal mail, or visit in person.\n\nThe notice is precisely there to inform you of the fact that sending e\\-mail to the school will have this effect, and it helpfully mentions one of the ways you can avoid that outcome:\n\n> If you do not want your e\\-mail address released in response to a public records request, do not send electronic mail to this entity. Instead, contact this office by phone.\n\nIf you think about the nature and purpose of public records laws, you will perhaps understand why the Florida law does not speak of consent or allow those corresponding with affected entities to opt out. If that were possible, then people who were conducting improper business with the public entities would withhold consent or otherwise opt out, making the public records law useless in the service of its goal of increasing transparency in government.",

This occurs automatically when you send an email to such an entity, regardless of your consent or desire for privacy. The law does not provide an opt-out option, as this would undermine its purpose of ensuring transparency in government communications. The notice in the email signature is intended to inform correspondents of this fact and suggest alternative methods of communication (like phone calls) if they wish to avoid having their email address become part of the public record."

Besides a burning sensation on my hands after work and coughing because of inhaling small amount of the chemical a few different incidents I have no noticeable injury. Am I eligible for workers compensation or a personal injury claim?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably yes. In general, if you are an employee, and you get hurt doing your job (as it seems you did), your employer is liable.\n\nIn most states, employers are required to carry workers compensation policies that pay your injury claim. But even if your employer doesn't have workers' comp, they are still liable, and they still have to pay. \n\nThe theory here is that when do what your employer says, they become responsible for keeping you safe. If they fail to do so, then in the eyes of the law, they may be liable to you. That doesn't necessarily mean they did anything evil or obviously irresponsible. It just means they failed in their duty to protect you.\n\nIf you were an independent contractor (and not an employee), you may not be eligible for workers' comp. But if you were doing what your boss told you to do (in legalese, if you were acting as their \"agent\"), you probably still have a claim.\n\nYou can always file a claim yourself, but many people in your situation choose to hire a lawyer to help them through the process. Hiring a lawyer can help you avoid certain mistakes, and can help ensure you get the best settlement possible.

The employee experiences minor symptoms but no noticeable injury. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the employee's legal options?\n\nA) The employee has no legal recourse since there is no significant injury.\nB) The employee can only file a personal injury lawsuit against the employer.\nC) The employee is likely eligible for workers' compensation, regardless of the employer's insurance status.\nD) The employee can only pursue legal action if they were an independent contractor.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, an employee who is injured or exposed to harmful conditions while performing their job duties is likely eligible for workers' compensation. This is true even if the employer failed to provide proper training or safety equipment. The key points supporting this answer are:\n\n1. Employers are generally liable for injuries sustained by employees during work activities.\n2. Most states require employers to carry workers' compensation insurance, but even without it, the employer remains liable.\n3. The lack of a significant injury does not necessarily preclude a claim, as exposure to toxic chemicals can have long-term effects.\n4. The employee's status as an employee (rather than an independent contractor) strengthens their eligibility for workers' compensation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the absence of a noticeable injury doesn't negate the potential for a valid claim. Option B is too limiting, as workers' compensation is typically the primary recourse for work-related injuries. Option D is incorrect because employees, not independent contractors, are generally covered by workers' compensation."

ABCGym has substituted an inferior\\-to\\-me option.\n\nMy question has two parts. The first is more of legality and definition. The second is more around what could they do.\n\nCan it be construed as libel, solicitation or something else I probably should be aware of? Though it might tarnish the image, assuming those statements are true I believe the criteria for libel would not be met. \n\nTo solicitation, they have a broad and basic anti\\-solicitation policy, including \"Any solicitation within any club is absolutely forbidden.\" While provocative, I don't see that this can be defined as soliciting. Even if I were to list competitors, without me benefitting from any sales that still seems at worst a gray area. Am I misinterpreting soliciting?\n\nAs to recourse, sure they can ask me not to wear it. Were I to refuse to remove the shirt, could they bar me from using the membership without refund for doing something that is legal and within dress code, but deemed naughty in their sight? \n\n**Edit: Background**\n\nI joined XYZ 22 years ago. ABC bought XYZ four years ago. At the time of ABC buying the XYZ, my membership was specifically to location A. It remained so after the purchase and we continued under essentially that agreement (I now pay annual dues to ABC in return for membership to location A). \n\nIn late September, ABC accepted annual payment, then announced about five weeks later they were closing \"my\" gym (location A). It is, IMO, a bit disingenuous at this point to accept payment on an agreement they likely knew they were going to alter. On Nov. 30, they closed location A and transferred me to location B.\n\nAs to why it's bothersome, admittedly part of the issue is annoyance with just being told, in effect, \"We broke the agreement, and you'll take what we substitute.\" But more materially it's a matter of:\n\n1. adding 9\\-15 minutes travel to every workout;\n2. being more crowded;\n3. more tightly spacing equipment;\n4. less of the equipment I use;\n5. worse condition of the equipment;\n6. fewer \"spare\" weights; and\n7. smaller open training area.\n\n**Two have asked:**\n\nPrior to reaching this point, I attempted...\n\n* a request over their website without response;\n* speaking to a person in the cancellation department. I was directed to the talk to a manager in club;\n* speaking to manager I was forwarded to the GM/Operations Manager;\n* emailing with the GM/OM cited due to the type and history of the account, no refund was possible;\n* a second request over the website without response;\n* calling the membership department. After time on hold the representative relayed the supervisor's statement it wasn't possible because they have another location within 25 miles;\n* Still awaiting a call from said supervisor that was supposed to occur 12/26\\.\n\n**Resolution**\nBefore it came to the shirt, inquiry with BBB led ABCGym contacting me and refunding the remainder of my contract. I expect the Yelp review that has been marked as helpful and 1\\-on\\-1 discussions with a number of people, they've lost far more in business than the $131 they finally refunded.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statement \n\n> ABCGym refuses to refund payment it accepted for membership to a gym ABCGym closed. ABCGym has substituted an inferior\\-to\\-me option.\n\ncould certainly be considered as defamatory. However, in the US and many other countries, truth would be a valid defense, if the person making the statement could prove that the statement is true.\n\nI don't see how it could be construed as solicitation.\n\nIf worn on a shirt into ABC, the management could surely ask the wearer to remove it. If that request is refused, they could ask the wearer to leave. If the wearer has a valid membership, then it would depend on the exact terms of the membership contract, and provisions of local law, whether ABC could insist that the wearer leave, or have the wearer arrested for trespass should the wearer refuse. Any regulations incorporated by reference into the contract would also matter.\n\nAt least in the US. walking back and forth on a public sidewalk just outside ABC's door, wearing such a shirt or carrying a classic picket sign with such a message would be pretty clearly legal, provided that others are not unduly obstructed, and no valid local ordinance is violated.\n\nIn the wear\\-the\\-shirt\\-inside case, if the wearer refuses to remove the shirt or leave, the management would probably call law enforcement. LE will not want to decide whether wearer has the legal right to remain in the club wearing the shirt. They will probably ask the wearer to leave. If the wearer protests that s/he has a valid membership and thus a contractual right to stay, who knows what they would do. If they still ask the wearer to leave, the wearer would be wise to comply and perhaps take legal action to enforce his or her membership rights, which will depend on the contract details as mentioned above. A lawyer would probably be very helpful if the wearer wants to take that route.\n\nThe wearer would be wise to remain polite and appear calm, not yelling or using epithets.",

The documentation clearly states that a tenant cannot give a \"notice to quit\" to a landlord, as this is something a landlord gives to a tenant. Instead, the tenant should follow the notice requirements specified in their lease agreement to properly end the tenancy. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the live stream could potentially be used as evidence, the documentation suggests this level of precaution is unnecessarily elaborate for a routine process like ending a tenancy.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because \"notice to quit\" is not the proper term for a tenant ending a tenancy; it's a term used when landlords end a tenancy under specific legal provisions.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the documentation indicates that disputes over service of notice are rare, and such elaborate precautions are usually unnecessary for a standard tenancy termination.\n\nThe question tests understanding of proper tenancy termination procedures and the distinction between landlord and tenant notifications, as well as the appropriateness of extreme measures in routine situations."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live in the state of Maryland. Several years ago I went to the ER to have an injury treated. I presented my insurance at the time of the injury. About a month ago (several years after the ER visit) I was contacted by Phoenix Financial Services, a debt collection agency saying I owed a significant amount of money for the physician portion of the services (the hospital was paid separately). \n\nRecently, I found out from my insurance that the physician's billing services never billed them. My insurer notified me that per the insurer's contract with this physician group, the physician group may not bill the patient until they have submitted a claim. So, not only should this group have never sent this bill to a debt collector, they shouldn't have sent me a bill in the first place.\n\nI called the physician group today and they agreed they will write the bill off after confirming that I am eligible for my insurance.\n\nI have Googled around and learned briefly about the concept of debt validation. Here is what I don't understand. Per the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, it appears that a debt collector can demand payment (with the threat of harming your credit score) until you request a debt validation. Is it true that a debt collector has no responsibility to validate the debt (e.g. make sure it's legit) until **after** you ask them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is correct, per [15 USC 1692g](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1692g), that the collector can wait until the consumer files notifies the collector of the debt, before sending verification. The law does not state what form that verification must take, and it would suffice if the collector provided evidence that services were rendered and not paid for. The verification can't just be a restatement that \"you owe $10,000\", but it does not have to be in the form of a court's judgment that the consumer owes money. Taking all of the provisions of the act together, the debt\\-holder's ultimate recourse is to take you to court, so that you will be ordered to pay the debt. One of your options is to tell the debt collector to not contact you, which forces the debt\\-holder to sue you. Demanding verification of the debt is an option, potentially useful in case of a mistake, especially in overcoming the assumption that the collector can otherwise make, that the debt is valid. At some point, one might need to prove in court that the debt is *not* valid (and it didn't come to that in your case). In this case, the debt *is* valid (you did receive the services), the problem is something else.\n\nThere is no statutory requirement that an ER must submit claims to a person's insurance company. They may be required to do so as part of their contract with Acme Insurance, if they have a contract with Acme. That is a matter between Acme and the ER, and you cannot sue the ER for failing to follow the terms of their contract with Acme. You might sue Acme if they fail to perform a contractual obligation with you, but they have no obligation to sue an ER to keep you happy. Suing your insurance company would be pointless, because Acme didn't fail to do what they were supposed to do. Suing the ER would also be pointless, because (or, *assuming*) they didn't promise to bill your insurance first. You would need to look carefully at the terms of your contract with the ER Physicians Group (not the hospital). It is likely that they have some kind of liability disclaimer stating that they are not liable for damage arising from insurance screw\\-ups. And finally, suing the debt collector would be also pointless because from your report of the facts, they didn't violate the law and you don't have a contractual relationship with the collector.\n\nOne can always get a free initial consultation with an attorney to see if he thinks there is a case.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of debt collection practices in the United States, which of the following statements is correct regarding debt validation under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)?\n\nA) Debt collectors must automatically provide debt validation to consumers before attempting to collect a debt.\n\nB) Consumers have no right to request debt validation once a debt collector has initiated contact.\n\nC) Debt collectors are only required to validate a debt after receiving a request from the consumer.\n\nD) Debt validation must always be in the form of a court judgment confirming the debt's validity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), specifically 15 USC 1692g, debt collectors are only required to provide debt validation after receiving a request from the consumer. They can continue collection efforts until such a request is made. The law does not mandate automatic validation before collection attempts begin. While debt validation is an important consumer right, it is not initiated by the collector but must be requested by the consumer. Additionally, the validation does not need to be in the form of a court judgment; it can be evidence that services were rendered and not paid for, as long as it's more than just a restatement of the debt amount. This correct answer (C) accurately reflects the FDCPA's provisions regarding debt validation procedures."

Second, the prescription will most likely only be valid for pharmacies in the doctors country; often only valid for one local pharmacy, and most definitely not for pharmacies outside the country. \n\nSo you have to convince the doctor to issue a prescription, to send it to you in a foreign country, and then you have to convince your pharmacy to hand over the medication to you.

Cross-border prescribing through online consultations faces numerous challenges:\n\n1. Legal issues: Prescriptions are typically only valid in the country where the doctor is licensed.\n2. Practical barriers: Pharmacies in one country are unlikely to accept prescriptions from foreign doctors.\n3. Payment and validity concerns: The doctor may not prescribe without payment, and the prescription may only be valid for specific local pharmacies.\n4. Safety risks: If medication is shipped internationally, there's no guarantee of the doctor's credentials or the medication's authenticity.\n\nOption A is incorrect because prescriptions from Country B are unlikely to be valid in Country A. Option B is partially true but oversimplifies the issue. Option C is incorrect and potentially dangerous, as it ignores legal restrictions and safety concerns associated with international medication shipping."

Some websites, such as [Docracy](https://www.docracy.com/14/terms-of-service-of-docracy-com-tos), explicitly say that you're allowed to use their contracts. I'm wondering, if you were to come across some random contract with a specific wording you really like for some common clause \\- like a severalbility clause \\- can you copy it or would that be infringing?\n\nFor example, say I already have my own contract. Can I see the no waiver clause on [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/help/useragreement/) and say, hey I like that, I'm adding it to mine!\n\n> If we do not enforce any right or provision in this user agreement,\n>  that is not to be deemed a waiver of our right to do so in the future.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anything written that included a minimum of creativity is copyrighted unless someone explicitely put it in the public domain, or if the author has died many years ago. Contracts are protected by copyright, just like anything written. The waiver you quoted would involve creativity. Something like \"I, Joe Smith, sell my car for $10,000 to James Miller\" might be judged to involve no creativity (Ok, me writing this was creative. Writing it if your name is Joe Smith and you are selling your car for $10,000 to James Miller doesn't involve creativity). \n\nObviously if you and someone else both sign a contract, you are both bound by the terms of the contract. If you committed copyright infringement using the contract has nothing to do with legality of the contract. The lawyer whose copyright you are infringing can sue you for copyright infringement, but the contract is still valid. \n\nFun fact: The GPL, which is used by millions to allow software to be copied within some framework, is itself copyrighted, and that copyright will be strictly enforced if you make any changes to the text of the license. The obvious reason is that the authors don't want anyone to be tricked into accepting a license that they *think* is the GPL but is critically modified.",

According to the documentation, written content that involves creativity, including contract clauses, is protected by copyright unless explicitly placed in the public domain or the copyright has expired. Even common legal clauses often involve some level of creativity in their specific wording. Therefore, the safest and most legally sound approach is to seek permission from the original author before using their clause. Options A and D are incorrect because they assume contract language is not copyrighted, which is generally not true. Option B is a common misconception; there is no \"50% rule\" in copyright law that allows use of copyrighted material if it's modified by a certain percentage."

They are not linked to any user (there are no users in the system actually). Just the phone number in a hashed form (same things as storing a hashed password).\n\nFrom what I understand if the data is anonymised there is no problem, but I am still not sure, because if you have the salt you can still create hashes of phone numbers and compare them to the hashes that exists in the database. But this gives you nothing even if you succeed, except that the phone exists there.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: But that a phone number exists in your collection *is* interesting information. Since phone numbers are identifying and so short that they are guessable, hashing does not provide anonymization. Hashing could still be an appropriate safety measure or pseudonymization technique. Note that the salt is typically stored as part of the hash value, and should not be considered to be a secret key.\n\nIf the information had been anonymized it wouldn't be personal information and the GDPR wouldn't apply. However, since the phone numbers are personal information (even hashed, they relate to an indirectly identifiable person), you should apply standard GDPR compliance processes to determine whether storing these phone numbers is legal:\n\n1. What is the purpose of processing?\n\t* Some purposes like national security or purely personal and household purposes are exempt from the GDPR\n2. What is the legal basis for this purpose?\n\t* E.g. consent, legitimate interest, legal obligations, \u2026\n3. What is the minimum data necessary to fulfill the purpose?\n\t* If pseudonymized data is sufficient, pseudonymization is mandatory.\n4. What safety measures do you think are appropriate?\n\t* This could shift a legitimate interest balancing test in your favor.\n5. What compliance measures are you obliged to take?\n\t* E.g. information per Art 13\u201314, preparation for data subject requests, engaging data processors, further safety measures.\n\nWhile your purposes are probably benign, it can be useful to recall that the presence of identifiers in data sets can be a matter of life and death. When accounts were leaked in the Ashley Madison data breach, that drove some users to suicide. In some countries, the existence of a Grindr account can be a death sentence. Those are examples involving special categories of data per GDPR Art 9, so likely far more sensitive than the context of this question. However, in the AM breach it would not have helped much to hash identifiers like emails: third parties would still be able to check whether the email of someone they know was part of the breach.",

In other words, one can observe different behaviors for equal/similar cases.\n\nAfter an inquiry I was told that the main point behind this law was for the student to focus on his studies and the important bit was that the student made progress in his studies.\n\nMy question now is, assuming the study process doesn't get harmed, would there be any consequences if one exceeded this limit? For instance if you surpass it to 130\\-full\\-days, what could happen?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The DAAD has published a summary of the legal constraints when working as a foreign student in Germany. While the document is only available in German, it is complete and rather authoritative. I summarize the main points here.\n\nOn a student visa, you are eligible for 120 full days or 240 half days in accordance with \u00a716b (3\\) AufenthG. This is a legal constraint. It is not up to interpretation. Only mandatory internships constitute a right to further work.\n\nIn individual cases, the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde (foreign registration office) can grant authorization for additional work. The authorization will only be granted if the extra work will not jeopardize the purpose of your stay in Germany, which is studying full\\-time. In particular, work in a study\\-related job such as a student assistant will generally be eligible for an extension. This is up to the judgement of the office. Thus, there can be differences between different cities.\n\nIf you intend to surpass the 120/240 day limit, you must get prior authorization. You are otherwise violating the conditions of your visa, which can result in fines and deportation. Additionally, no upstanding employer wants to provide illegal work as they would be subject to penalties themselves.\n\nLinks:\n\n* DAAD guidance on working in Germany (German): [https://static.daad.de/media/daad\\_de/pdfs\\_nicht\\_barrierefrei/in\\-deutschland\\-studieren\\-forschen\\-lehren/daad\\-infoblatt\\_erwerbstaetigkeit.pdf](https://static.daad.de/media/daad_de/pdfs_nicht_barrierefrei/in-deutschland-studieren-forschen-lehren/daad-infoblatt_erwerbstaetigkeit.pdf)\n* \u00a716b AufenthG (English): [https://www.gesetze\\-im\\-internet.de/englisch\\_aufenthg/englisch\\_aufenthg.html\\#p0275](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_aufenthg/englisch_aufenthg.html#p0275)",

According to the information provided, foreign students in Germany are limited to 120 full days or 240 half days of work per year on a student visa. In this case, the additional 3-week (approximately 15 working days) internship would exceed the 120-day limit. However, the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde can grant authorization for additional work in individual cases, especially if the work is study-related. Since this internship is related to the student's field of study, they may be eligible for an extension, but they must seek prior authorization from the Ausl\u00e4nderbeh\u00f6rde before accepting the internship to avoid violating their visa conditions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't account for the fact that the internship would exceed the 120-day limit. Option B is too restrictive, as there are possibilities for exceptions with proper authorization. Option C is partially correct but incomplete, as mandatory internships are automatically allowed, but this question doesn't specify if the internship is mandatory."

There is no requirement to register with the place of residence in the United States. People who are not citizens of the United States need to comply with immigration law in order for their presence in the United States to be lawful, and there is indeed federal alien registration, but that takes place automatically at the consulate as part of a visa application and at the border when the person's entry into the US is recorded.\n\n> But what about tax returns or taxes in general?\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Are tax returns based on incomes or are they based upon wealth as well?\n\nThe US taxes incomes. Local jurisdictions generally tax real property. New York City is no exception. There will therefore be property taxes on the apartment.\n\nIncome taxes cover unearned income, so if the money \"in the bank\" generates interest income (or capital gains if it isn't literally in the bank but invested in some asset) then that income will be taxed.\n\nA tax resident of the US is liable for taxation on income from sources outside the US, so leaving some of the money invested outside the US will not relieve the person from liability for taxation on income from those assets.\n\nAnyone thinking of doing this should retain a tax lawyer for specific individualized advice.",

The question tests understanding of several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. There is no requirement to register residence in the U.S., contrary to option A.\n2. The U.S. taxes income, not wealth directly, so there's no wealth tax on the entire $300 million.\n3. Local property taxes will apply to the New York City house.\n4. Income taxes apply to both earned and unearned income, including interest and investment gains.\n5. U.S. tax residents are liable for taxation on worldwide income, even from foreign sources.\n6. Simply not working doesn't exempt a resident from all tax obligations, ruling out option B.\n7. The location of bank accounts doesn't determine tax liability, making option D incorrect.\n\nThis question requires synthesizing multiple pieces of information from the documentation to arrive at the correct conclusion about the individual's tax situation."

An invalid provision of a contract is unenforceable. Likewise, and unenforceable provision of a contract is invalid. Here are the definitions of the two from Black's Law Dictionary. (10th. ed. 2014\\) defines them as follows: \n\n> **Unenforceable Contract** \\- An otherwise valid contract that,\n>  because of some technical defect, cannot be fully enforced; a contract\n>  that has some legal consequences but that may not be enforced in an\n>  action for damages or specific performance in the face of certain\n>  defenses, such as the statute of frauds.\n> \n> \n> \u00a0**Invalid Contract** \\- An agreement that is either void or voidable.\n\nAlso, be aware that invalid and unenforceable are *different* than void and voidable contracts. These terms often get confused.\n\nAgain, looking to Black's Law dictionary, \n\n> **Void Contract** 1\\. A contract that is of no legal effect, so that there is really no contract in existence at all. \u2022 A contract may be\n>  void because it is technically defective, contrary to public policy,\n>  or illegal. \u2014 Also termed void agreement. Cf. illegal contract;\n>  unenforceable contract; voidable contract.\n\nStrictly speaking, a \"void contract\" is a contradiction in terms. Void contract describes a situation where despite the intention of the parties, no contract has been made. \n\n> **Voidable Contract** \\- A contract that can be affirmed or rejected at the option of one of the parties; a contract that is void as to the\n>  wrongdoer but not void as to the party wronged, unless that party\n>  elects to treat it as void. \u2014 Also termed voidable agreement.\n> \n> \n> \n> > \u201cA voidable contract is a contract which, in its inception, is\n> >  valid and capable of producing the results of a valid contract, but\n> >  which may be \u2018avoided,\u2019 i.e. rendered void at the option of one (or\n> >  even, though rarely, of both) of the parties.\u201d P.S.

These terms are essentially synonymous in this context, as an invalid provision is unenforceable and vice versa. The clause violates state law, making it invalid and thus unenforceable. \n\nThe severability clause allows the rest of the contract to remain in force even if one part is found to be invalid or unenforceable. While the question notes that using both \"invalid\" and \"unenforceable\" is redundant, this redundancy doesn't affect the clause's function.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a usurious clause would typically be considered void (invalid and unenforceable), not voidable. Option B is incorrect because the severability clause specifically allows the rest of the contract to remain in force. Option D is incorrect because, although \"invalid\" and \"unenforceable\" are redundant in this context, this doesn't make the severability clause itself redundant or ineffective."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Github is usually used to share code. There is a feature called fork. This is described here: [github fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart/fork-a-repo). What happens if a user forks a repository that contains illegally uploaded material like ebooks?\n\nI think the first thing is a takedown as a consequence of a dmca takedown request. What can happen afterwards? I have several questions:\n\n1. Can a person that forks such a repository be sued?\n2. There might be dozens or hundred of people worldwide who forked this repository as a way to bookmark it. How is this handled in practise? Does the content owner identify every user and sues them in their homecountry? Or is only the initial uploader sued?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By \"illegally uploaded material like ebooks\" I presume is meant content uploaded without permission from the copyright owner or any authorized agent, and not under any license which permits such uploading and use.\n\nForking a repository means making copies of the files it contains. If the files were uploaded without a proper license or permission from the copyright holder that would be an act of infringement.\n\nGithub's documentation about forking (linked in the question) says:\n\n> A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.\n> \n> \n> Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository.\n\nHowever, GitHub requires that users upload only content that the user owns or has the right to upload and license. (This means that any user who uploads unauthorized files is violating the Github terms.) Thus a forking user may be relying on that assurance from the uploading user. If the forking user is aware that the files are unauthorized (perhaps pirated) then forking is an act of knowing infringement. If the forking user is not aware, and has no reason to think that the files are unauthorized, then any act of infringement is not knowing, much less willful.\n\nUnder [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") law, infringement is actionable even if it was not knowing. See [17 USC 501](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#501), which says:\n\n> Anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections 106 through 122 or of the author as provided in section 106A(a), or who imports copies or phonorecords into the United States in violation of section 602, is an infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case may be.\n\nBut under [17 USC 504](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html#504) if the infringer proves that the infringement was \"innocent\" meaning:\n\n> ... that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright\n\nThen statutory damages may be as low as $200 per work infringed.\n\nOn the other hand US statutory damages can be as high as $30,000 or up to $150,000 if willful infringement is proved. The plaintiff has the option to instead get actual damages, plus any profits made by the infringer. In some cases legal fees and costs may be added to the amount of a judgement.\n\nThe details of copyright laws will be different in different countries, but the general principles will be similar.\n\nThus the copyright holder **could** sue any user who forks a repo containing unauthorized content.\n\nAs a practical matter, a holder is not likely to sue a user who merely forked a repo with no good reason to know that the content was unauthorized. The costs of bringing such a suit would probably exceed the damages. However, if any reasonable forking user would have known or suspected that the files were unauthorized, the situation would be different, and a suit might be more likely. A takedown notice might well be served in either case. Such a notice might cause Github to delete or lock the repository.",

The user who forked the repository can be sued regardless of whether they knew the content was unauthorized. However, the level of damages can vary significantly based on the user's awareness and intent. If the user can prove they were unaware and had no reason to believe their actions constituted infringement (\"innocent infringement\"), statutory damages could be as low as $200 per work.

The correct approach is to first attempt to obtain available secondary evidence, and only if that's not possible or insufficient, consider DNA testing or affidavits.

This also could directly affect crumple zones required by motor vehicle safety standards that are meant to absorb energy during a collision.\n3. Steering and suspension \\- Common upgrade that increases stability, durability, and safety. Usually changed or modified to accommodate other upgrades, and can significantly change the characteristics of the vehicle and increase payload.\n4. Roof\\-top tent \\- A tent usually mounted to the roof of the vehicle, or on a rack mounted above the bed of a pickup truck, made of either hard plastic or vinyl. This could directly affect the stability of the vehicle and raise the center of gravity, therefore possibly exceeding motor vehicle safety standards.\n\nSome states have passed laws that make it a crime to operate a motor vehicle that is \"in violation of state or federal motor vehicle safety standards.\"\n\nFor the purpose of federal safety standards\n\nIf an individual purchased a new vehicle, and outfitted it with aftermarket parts that are not certified under any motor vehicle safety standard, would their vehicle be in violation of U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Standards?\n\nWould the driver be subject to criminal charges under state statute?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Washington, there is no criminal sanction for installing an \"aftermarket\" product on your vehicle. If we are speaking of non\\-commercial vehicles, the penalties for violating the various safety regulations is a ticket.\n\nThe federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards can be consulted [here](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V). The criminal penalty provisions are [here](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-578), as authorized by [49 USC 30170](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/30170) \u2013 basically, lying in a report to the government will get you in trouble. You would have to track down all of the provisions in the regulations, but [here](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/49/32506) is the bumper prohibition. The rule prohibits manufacture or importation of a car or a part that doesn't meet the standard. Subsection (b) addresses the \"then added later\" question, generally saying that there is little prohibition against you tweaking your car. First, if you \"had no reason to know, by exercising reasonable care, that the vehicle or equipment does not comply with the standard\", you are not subject to penalty. Usually, people have absolutely no reason to know that some part is unsafe, which is not the same as non\\-compliant, but you might pick up a really cheap bumper having been told that it is cheap because it totally ignores the applicable standards: then you would have reason to know. Used cars and parts are not subject to any federal scrutiny.\n\nThe concept of a \"vehicle in violation\" is a legal misconception. Certain acts violate, objects do not violate. The chokepoint that controls car parts is the \"manufacture or sell\" part of the law, which prevents Auto Zone from selling you a bumper made of clay (it does not prevent you from installing such a bumper \u2013 unless your state has a specific law to that effect). The shop is in violation, not the customer.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John purchases a new SUV and decides to modify it with aftermarket parts. He installs a custom steel bumper, a roof-top tent, and a roll cage. These modifications potentially affect the vehicle's crumple zones and center of gravity. Under federal law, which statement is most accurate regarding John's modified vehicle?\n\nA) John's vehicle is in direct violation of U.S. Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and he could face federal criminal charges for operating it on public roads.\n\nB) The vehicle itself is not in violation of federal standards, but John could be held criminally liable if he sells the modified vehicle to someone else.\n\nC) John's modifications are legal under federal law, but he may be subject to state-specific regulations or ticketing for safety violations.\n\nD) The aftermarket parts manufacturers are solely responsible for any violations, and John faces no legal consequences for installing or using these parts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards primarily regulate manufacturers and importers, not individual vehicle owners. There is no federal criminal sanction for installing aftermarket parts on a personal vehicle. However, state laws may vary, and John could potentially receive a ticket for safety violations depending on local regulations. The concept of a \"vehicle in violation\" is a misconception; it's specific acts that violate laws, not objects themselves. While the modifications might not comply with safety standards, the federal focus is on preventing the manufacture and sale of non-compliant parts, not on penalizing individual vehicle owners for installations."

I was moving into a turn lane, and someone revved their engine, sped up, and cut me off before I was able to move into it. If I hadn't been watching carefully, it could have been a crash.\n\nI think normally the one who is at fault in these situations is the person who's changing lanes, but the special circumstance confuses me.\n\nI am glad that nothing else happened. However, if we had crashed, who would've been legally at fault? Would it have mattered if I could've provided evidence that they sped up, or that I had my turn\\-signal on? What other factors may be considered?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The person who is changing lanes has the responsibility to make sure that they have space to move into. Suppose there was a person in front of you in the destination lane who hit the brakes suddenly \\- if you change lanes and rear\\-end them, that's your fault, because you failed to leave enough distance. I don't see how it's any different in this case, where the person is behind you and accelerates suddenly. A turn signal doesn't give you the right to change lanes at will, you are responsible for making the maneuver safely. It's poor driving etiquette for the other guy to cut you off like that, but it's up to you to ensure there's space as you move over.\n\nFrom your description of the incident, it sounds like your actions initiated the sequence of events, and it was also your actions that prevented the accident. From that, it seems highly likely you'd be found at fault if the accident had happened \\- in that scenario, your actions would have created the situation, and you also would have failed to take action to avoid the accident.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Minnesota, a driver is changing lanes into a turn lane when another vehicle suddenly accelerates to occupy the space. If a collision occurs, who is most likely to be held legally responsible?\n\nA) The driver changing lanes, as they have the primary responsibility to ensure the maneuver is safe\nB) The driver who accelerated, as their action was aggressive and unexpected\nC) Both drivers would share equal fault due to the complex nature of the situation\nD) The fault would be determined solely by whether the lane-changing driver had their turn signal on\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. According to traffic laws, the driver changing lanes bears the primary responsibility for ensuring the maneuver can be completed safely. Even if the other driver's behavior was unexpected or aggressive, the lane-changing driver is expected to verify that there is sufficient space before moving over. The use of a turn signal, while important, does not give a driver the right to change lanes at will. The lane-changing driver's action initiates the sequence of events, and they are responsible for avoiding accidents during the maneuver. Options B and C are incorrect because they shift blame away from the lane-changing driver or distribute it equally, which is not consistent with traffic laws. Option D is incorrect because while using a turn signal is important, it alone does not determine fault in this situation."

This wasn't an Internet/email thing; she knew this guy in real life (before COVID\\-19\\). The guy led her to believe that he was registered financial advisor (though I didn't find anything to that effect in her contract or their message history). Then she had some bad luck: lost her job, wrecked her car, etc. So she wanted to dip into her savings. She contacted the guy, who agreed to start disbursements from her investments (which he claimed to have a value of several times the principal at that point; he gave an approximate dollar figure). He paid out a couple thousand, then started delaying, temporizing, and making excuses. After a while of this, she started asking for all of her funds to be returned. She continued regularly asking him for her money over the next number of months and this behaviour continued.\n\nNo doubt about it: my friend's trust in this guy was unwise. But that's not the point here. The point here is that buried in their message history, after several months of requests from her for money and excuses from him, he asked for another $2,000 to cover \"fees\" and expedite the process of returning her money. (She didn't pay.) From my viewpoint, this appears to jump from some sort of confidence fraud straight into 419 scam territory. Is this a felony?\n\nBoth parties here live in the US state of Washington.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Fraud may be a crime, or a tort (civil wrong): only criminal fraud can be a \"felony\". The Washington criminal laws about fraud are [here](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.45&full=true), and they are all fairly specific, such as selling or destroying encumbered property (which is a misdemeanor anyhow), or conducting a mock auction. Most frauds are misdemeanors, though forgeries are in the felony category. It also includes identity thefts, again the emphasis being on false documents. Based on your description, this is not a crime, it is a civil wrong, meaning that she will have to sue the guy to get her money back. The Attorney General's office will not get involved unless there is a widespread state interest (for example, very many Washington residents being victimized), and then the involvement would be suing on behalf of the victims.\n\nThat said, if the swindle was carried out by phone, then that is potentially a violation of a federal felony law, [18 USC 1343](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1343). It would not matter if the parties are in the same state, because phone service counts as \"interstate commerce\". So the details of phone involvement matter. Saying that you \"have to\" charge for processing a refund is not per se fraudulent and texting someone that \"I'll have to charge an extra $2,000\" doesn't make this wire fraud. But there is some potential for a federal wire fraud angle.",

John Wiley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtsaeng_v._John_Wiley_%26_Sons,_Inc.), I'm pretty sure this has no legal meaning in the US any more, but I have some questions:\n\n* What was the historical basis for this notice?\n* Is this notice indeed legally void in the United States under *Kirtsaeng* (assuming the book was lawfully acquired in the UK or its territories)? In other works, could I legally sell such a book in the US?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When an author writes a book, it is frequently licensed to one company in the United States and another company in the U.K.\n\nIf the publishing company Bathroom Books gets permission to print and sell the books pursuant to a license from the author in the U.S., that contract will usually include a non\\-compete clause that prohibits Bathroom Books from selling books it prints to retail customers in the U.K. or to wholesale customer that intend to sell the books at retail in the U.K., where the permission to print and sell the books pursuant to a license from the author has been granted to WC Books (and vice versa).\n\nThe clauses are about enforcing the peace between distributors given different territories, because different publishers have better sales networks in different places.\n\nThe first sale doctrine, clarified for purposes of U.S. copyright law in *Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley*, makes the \"not for sale in the U.S.\" language inapplicable under U.S. law to a consumer who purchases the book in the U.S. and then resells it used to someone in the U.S.\n\nWhether it bars someone who purchased the books on a wholesale basis in the U.K. from reselling the books in the U.S. depends to some extent on the nature of the contract between the wholesaler and the publisher. For example, if the wholesaler is selling the books on a consignment basis for the publisher and has a right to return the unsold books without payment to the publisher and doesn't have to pay for the books sold until they are sold at retail, the first sale doctrine likewise does not apply.\n\nIt also isn't entirely obvious that the \"first sale doctrine\" makes it illegal to count U.S. sales towards the amount due to the U.S. publisher rather than the U.K. publisher, even if they are sold by WB Books instead of Bathroom Books.

An American tourist purchases one of these books in London and brings it back to the United States. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status of this book in the US?\n\nA) The book cannot be legally sold in the US due to the copyright notice on its cover.\nB) The book can be legally sold in the US, but only if the copyright notice is removed first.\nC) The book can be legally sold in the US under the first sale doctrine, as clarified by Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley.\nD) The book can only be legally sold in the US if permission is obtained from both the UK and US publishers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley case, the first sale doctrine applies to copyrighted works lawfully made abroad. This means that once a copyrighted item is lawfully sold or given away, the copyright holder's interest in controlling the distribution of that particular copy is exhausted. In this scenario, the American tourist legally purchased the book in London, so they would have the right to resell it in the US, regardless of the notice on the cover. The notice reflects historical licensing agreements between publishers but does not override the first sale doctrine as interpreted by the US Supreme Court in the Kirtsaeng case."

Copyright protection is automatic and does not require active enforcement by the copyright holder to remain valid.

The business owner's unauthorized use of a copyrighted image as a logo is still considered infringement, even after years of use without objection.

Besides, IP addresses are widely considered as personal data.

Perhaps the most discussed at the moment of GDRP introduction is consent, because of the wave of consent\\-seeking. But there are a number of other grounds. \"Necessary for contract execution\" is a trivial one, to deliver a pizza you'll need an address.\n\nThe relevant ground for sanctions lists is also pretty obvious in hindsight, you may process PII in order to comply with legal obligations. Note that this is still an integral part of the GDPR, not an exception to the GDPR. That means you need to apply all the basic GDPR rules. You need to explicitly store where you got the PII from, for which purpose, and you need to document how you're using it. \n\nNote that this might be hard \\- why do you need to **store** this data? Why can't you just check the list as the moment it's relevant? The GDPR for a large part depends on you justifying your actions, not just in hindsight but already up front.",

Which of the following approaches would best align with GDPR requirements?\n\nA) Store all sanctions list data locally and encrypt it at rest, updating it monthly.\n\nB) Only access the official sanctions lists when needed for a specific check, without storing any list data locally.\n\nC) Store sanctions list data locally, but only keep it for 30 days before deleting and refreshing.\n\nD) Create a database of all sanctioned individuals' information for quick reference, updated annually.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The GDPR principle of data minimization is best served by option B. This approach avoids unnecessary storage of personal data, only accessing it when required for a specific purpose. It also ensures the most up-to-date information is used.\n\nOption A involves storing more data than necessary and risks using outdated information. Option C still involves storing data unnecessarily, even if for a shorter period. Option D creates a large database of personal information without a clear ongoing need, potentially violating GDPR principles.\n\nThe correct approach (B) aligns with the advice that companies should justify why they need to store data and consider whether they can simply check the list at the moment it's relevant, rather than storing it unnecessarily."

The tenant now wishes to terminate the lease. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's legal position?\n\nA) The 3-month statutory notice period always prevails, regardless of what's written in the contract.\n\nB) The 5-month notice period in the contract is automatically void and unenforceable.\n\nC) The 5-month notice period is likely enforceable, but the tenant may challenge it in court as unreasonable.\n\nD) The 5-month notice period is binding, but can be shortened if both parties mutually agree.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D. In many jurisdictions, including Germany (which is referenced in the example), parties can agree to terms that differ from statutory minimums in residential leases, as long as they don't unfairly disadvantage the tenant. Therefore, the 5-month notice period in the contract is likely enforceable, even though it's longer than the statutory 3 months. \n\nHowever, as stated in the original answer, regardless of what's in the contract, both parties can mutually agree to terminate the lease earlier. This flexibility allows for situations such as the tenant finding a new tenant acceptable to the landlord.\n\nOption A is incorrect because contractual terms can often supersede statutory minimums if they're not deemed unfair or illegal. \n\nOption B is wrong because merely having a longer notice period doesn't automatically void the clause.\n\nOption C, while partially correct about enforceability, is not the most accurate answer. Challenging the clause in court as unreasonable would likely be unnecessary and isn't mentioned as a primary option in the original answer."

This means that while statutes (laws) can be made by a legislature, the courts can \"make law\" by deciding cases. For example, some States in the United States and England and Wales only recently (within the past 30 years) adopted an actual law that made murder illegal? Prior to that murder was illegal under Common Law Murder that had been based on precedence from bazillion cases before that said it's illegal. Nobody bothered to write it down in an actual law.\n\nThere are several other big differences such as Inquisitorial vs. Adversarial nature of courts, how and when punishments are decided (The famous \"Just following Orders\" Defense was given in part because of this difference and a lack of understanding over it.), who is the trier of fact vs. who is the trier of law, but as far as what is \"Law\" this is a good single summation of the difference in a single sentence.

Civil Law systems primarily rely on codified statutes created by legislative bodies, with courts applying these written laws to cases. In contrast, Common Law systems place significant emphasis on judicial precedents and interpretations, allowing courts to \"discover\" or develop law through case decisions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the systems. While Civil Law does rely heavily on legislative statutes, it's not solely based on them. Similarly, Common Law does use statutes but also significantly relies on judicial precedents.\n\nOption C is incorrect as it reverses the roles. In Civil Law, judges typically don't create new laws but apply existing statutes. Common Law judges can, through their decisions, effectively create new legal principles or \"laws.\"\n\nOption D is clearly incorrect as the documentation explicitly outlines differences between the two systems.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the fundamental differences between Civil and Common Law systems, requiring students to discern the nuanced distinctions in how each system approaches the creation and application of law."

The order of payment typically prioritizes secured creditors, followed by unsecured creditors.

His main defense seems to be that he had no idea he was breaking Iraqi laws.\n\nI know very little about archaeology, and less about laws around the world, but I would expect most if not all countries to prohibit the removal of antiquities without specific permission. I am also aware that one of the most important types of antiquity are pottery fragments, in terms of what we have learnt about history. I would expect a geologist with an interest in international archaeology to know more about laws regarding this than me.\n\nWhat are the \"usual\" laws about taking such items out of a country? Any relevant jurisdiction would be interesting, but the best answer would compare multiple jurisdictions to give any idea of what someone who was familiar with this field might justifiably expect the law to be.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Here are examples from [Tanzania](http://lands.go.tz/uploads/documents/en/1456413218-The%20Antiquities%20Act_%201964%20Cap%20333.pdf), [Kenya](http://kenyalaw.org:8181/exist/kenyalex/actview.xql?actid=No.%206%20of%202006), [Norway](https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/15961ce78df042b7953656f6aecc635a/220816_en-regulations-on-the-import-and-export-of-cultural-objects.pdf), [Canada](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-51/page-1.html), and [Iraq](https://iraqheritage.org/pdf/antiquities.pdf).

The general situation is that there is no general situation, and it is necessary to read the law of the country, contemplating for all objects whether their export is allowed or forbidden. Many expressions are used to refer to restricted items, such as \"cultural object\", \"monument\", \"antiquity\". It turns out that paintings, boats and their parts that are older that 50 years old are on the list for Norway, but not Iraq. Tanzanian law is a bit flexible, in that \"ethnographic objects\" are on the list requiring a permit, defined as a think made by humans \"for use in any social or cultural activity whether or not it is still being used by any community in Tanzania\", regardless of age, \"but does not include any object made, shaped, painted, carved, inscribed or otherwise produced or modified by human agency in Tanzania *for sale as a curio*\" (because sale of tourist trinkets is big business in Tanzania). At times, an \"informal export permit\" can be required for goods of questionable provenance (for example, carved doors).\n\nMost often, the definition of restricted items is framed in terms of kind of item and age, for example ethnographic object in an African or Asian style from before 1940 (Tanzania), the aforementioned Norwegian items either \"before 1950\" or \"more than 50 years old\". Ignorance of the law is no excuse, nor is inability to guess what will be considered to have \"cultural significance\".",

There is no uniform standard, and definitions of restricted items, age thresholds, and permit requirements differ significantly from one nation to another.

Another driver merged into the lane I was in aggressively and made contact with my car, but between me honking, yelling(as most probably would in this situation), focusing on turning to avoid, and music I did not hear or feel any contact being made.\n\nShortly after, at the stoplight. The Driver got out of his car and took a picture of my plate. Did not attempt to wave me down or get my attention to pull over. I saw this as a threatening road rage move(why would someone take a picture of my plate and not notify me?)\n\nThen as we continued travel, he followed me and flashed his beams at me, again I only saw this as threatening/taunting. In no way did I get the sense of there being 'trouble' in the sense of an accident.\n\nSomehow he was able to flag a travelling officer and pulled me over to the side. At this point I still did not know any contact was made and was pulling me over for speeding or something minor like that, but I was thankful for that because I would tell the officer about the threatening other driver.\n\nIt wasn't until the officer told me (first thing, before I could say what I wanted to), that there was an accident and I ran. I got out of my car and to my surprise there was minor scratches on my quarter panel. So I received a citation for hit and run, but the other driver was at fault. (this was explained to me to be the case)\n\nSo, in short, I received a hit and run without any knowledge of there being a hit. I have not received a court date yet(this all happened yesterday morning), but I am very anxious and frankly, scared. What can I do now?\n\nextra info: I am in the state of Florida and both vehicles are insured.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: So I found information from a [law firm in Florida](http://www.husseinandwebber.com/crimes/traffic-crimes/leaving-the-scene-of-an-accident/) about Hit and Run Cases. You definitely want a lawyer as it is a $500 fine and/or 60 days in jail for your case (property damage, no injury or loss of life).\n\nThe good news is that if you can argue the case correctly, it's very easy to get a Not Guilty verdict. Under Florida Law, a Hit and Run must meet the following criteria to legally find someone guilty:\n\n> 1. Disputes as to the identity of the driver;\n> 2. Lack of knowledge that a crash occurred;\n> 3. Lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property;\n> 4. The failure to stop was not willful, but was dictated by circumstances;\n> 5. The defendant stopped as close as possible to the site of the accident;\n> 6. The other driver refused to receive identifying information\n> 7. The other driver became belligerent, necessitating that the defendant leave the scene to call police;\n> 8. The assistance rendered was \u2018reasonable\u2019 within the meaning of the statute.\n\nGiven that you had no lack of knowledge that a crash occurred (2\\) AND lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property (3\\.) AND you would have stopped but for the circumstances of the event prevented you from recieiving knowledge of that the crash had occured (4\\) you already fail to meet 3 of the 8 criteria. This should be easy to argue in and of itself, but where you need a lawyer to assist is in criteria 7\\. While you were never fearing the other driver to such a degree that you needed to call the police, his behavior was interpreted by you as \"road rage\" and you had a reasonable fear to not wish to engage him. It's not rules as written, but it could be that the rules allow for leaving the scene because of the plaintiff's behavior and could be valid in other forms. I'll admit, this will vary wildly on the judge's own interpretation of that rule, BUT it's worth a try.\n\nKeep in mind with all of these, the Prosecution will be required to prove all 8 facts against you, while you only have to disprove one, to some level of doubt. As an armchair jury, I have no facts to support your story, but I have no facts to doubt it either. And when doubt happens, you must assume innocence.\n\nIt would help if you had any hint of the officers attitude at the time. Was he friendly? Dismissive? Distracted? What was the guy who hit you's attitude towards the situation? Was he constantly yelling at you and the officer? Was he quiet and separated?\n\nEither way, get a lawyer because 60 days of jail time and a $500 fine is not something you want to fight by yourself. Make calls (the ticketing officer should have a work number or other contact information on the ticket.). Notify the insurance company of the fact that it was cited as hit and run but not proven... it could make the difference of who's company is to pay (It will be his if there was no Hit and Run).",

According to the information provided, to be found guilty of hit-and-run in Florida, all 8 criteria must be met. Option C directly addresses three key points that would make it difficult to prove guilt:\n\n1. Lack of knowledge that a crash occurred\n2. Lack of knowledge that an impact occurred with persons or property\n3. The failure to stop was not willful, but was dictated by circumstances (in this case, interpreting the other driver's actions as threatening road rage)\n\nThese factors align closely with the specific situation described in the original post, where the driver was unaware of the collision and perceived the other driver's actions as threatening. This combination of factors provides the strongest basis for a not guilty verdict, as it challenges multiple required criteria for a hit-and-run conviction in Florida."

Specifically, **are there things that postnuptial agreement cannot have that prenuptial can**, *(aside from things related to marriage annulment, presumably, since you can't annul a marriage that's already valid)*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't think of anything regarding the marriage contract that is illegal to agree to within a marriage but that is legal to agree to prior to a marriage.\n\nHowever, I can think of plenty of stipulations that *it would be hard to imagine a reasonable person accepting* once they're in a marriage, but that they would reasonably agree to in order to enter a marriage.\n\nE.g., supposing that \"if *x* then I forfeit my marital right to *y*\" is a legal nuptial agreement. For any such *x* and *y* I can imagine that clause occurring in a *pre*nuptial agreement. And it would be enforceable under [contract law](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/contract-law/info) because I suspect that *marriage* is a form of *consideration*.\n\nBut after the marriage has been established, why would anyone unilaterally forfeit a right? I can only think of twothree reasons:\n\n1. The forfeit is mutual: I.e., both spouses agree to an identical clause. *Or*, the spouses agree to substantially equal clauses. (E.g., one spouse forfeits *y* if *x*, and the other forfeits *b* if *a*; where a\u00b7b \u2248 x\u00b7y.)\n2. One spouse requires the contract as a condition of continuing the marriage. However, **I am dubious that this scenario is enforceable**. I.e., if I one day say to my spouse, \"I'm divorcing you unless you agree to give up your marital right to *y*,\" I have a suspicion that such an \"agreement\" might not withstand an artful legal challenge for several reasons: The *consideration* I'm offering is something I already pledged. This is like demanding a contract renegotiation once a counterparty has undertaken work. It *seems* like something that would be ripe for estoppel.\n3. (Thanks to @ohwilleke for noting this one:) The spouse forfeiting a right stands to gain something in exchange. E.g., in order for one spouse to receive an inheritance, the other must disclaim any right to it should the marriage later be dissolved. The spouse is not forfeiting a right already enjoyed, and in consideration of the postnuptial agreement will (potentially) enjoy extra wealth within the marriage.",

Both prenuptial and postnuptial agreements can generally cover the same topics related to marital rights and property division. However, postnuptial agreements may face more scrutiny in court because they are made after the marriage has already taken place. This can raise questions about fairness and consideration, especially if one spouse appears to be giving up rights without clear benefit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because postnuptial agreements do not necessarily cover a wider range of topics than prenuptial agreements.\n\nOption B is partially true but not the most accurate answer. While prenuptial agreements signed under duress can also be challenged, postnuptial agreements where one spouse pressures the other to sign or face divorce might be more vulnerable to legal challenges due to issues of consideration and potential coercion.\n\nOption C is incorrect because both types of agreements can include clauses about forfeiting marital rights, though such clauses in postnuptial agreements might be more closely scrutinized for fairness."

Could a military court take the same act (in the example murder, but possibly also noncapital crimes) and try you for the *same or different* charge to further increase the punishment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Double Jeopardy does obviously not apply to being tried by the state and the federal court system, where you can be convicted for drug smuggling by both the Federal and the State court as you broke both laws with the same act.\n\nThis is true, and the answer to your question comes in the *reason* this is true. The exception to double jeopardy you're referring to applies to charges from separate sovereigns. When considering whether two entities can both charge someone, you trace back each of them to the sovereign power that gives them their authority. States are considered sovereign, as are Indian tribes with respect to crimes committed by Indians (although for certain serious crimes like murder, Congress arguably stripped tribal courts of jurisdiction with the Major Crimes Act). The United States is of course sovereign.\n\nThe military is *not* sovereign. Military charges are based on the sovereignty of the United States, so double jeopardy applies between military and civilian federal courts. Likewise, US territories (and DC) are not sovereign and have criminal jurisdiction based on the sovereignty of the United States, so territorial (and DC) charges are subject to double jeopardy with each other, with military charges, and with civilian federal charges. That said, double jeopardy only applies if the charges represent the same offense. The UCMJ has offenses with no civilian analog. If you're charged with murder in civilian federal court and mutiny under the UCMJ, those are two different crimes.",

Military courts derive their authority from the sovereignty of the United States, as do federal courts and courts in Washington, D.C. (which is not a state). Therefore, double jeopardy applies between these courts. The sailor could be tried by either a military court or a federal court for the murder, but not both, as this would violate double jeopardy protections. A D.C. court prosecution would be considered part of the federal prosecution system for double jeopardy purposes, as D.C. is not a separate sovereign entity. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest multiple prosecutions that would violate double jeopardy. Option C is incorrect because it overstates the protection of double jeopardy, ignoring that different offenses (e.g., murder and a military-specific charge like dereliction of duty) could potentially be tried separately."

While the right to a jury trial is generally waivable only with the consent of both the court and the prosecution, some courts have allowed bench trials without prosecutorial consent in exceptional circumstances.

I was not a party to the original negotiation, and there was no paperwork signed, but I was under the impression that the deal was \"for free, indefinitely\", until I have the resources to move my property out and store it myself. Since then, the friend who owns the company has been dealing with me directly in regards to this matter, without a middleman.\n\nRecently, the owner has contacted me, unilaterally deciding that I have a month to remove my belongings from his unit, or he will remove and dispose of them himself, in addition to suggesting that he will begin to bill me during this time period as well. I'm pretty sure that he cannot suddenly start charging me (unless it were a month\\-to\\-month\\-type arrangement, in which case I would have the option to continue paying the increased rent to remain, but that's not an option here as he wants my stuff out, period).\n\nGiven that there was no formal contract for this arrangement, what are the expectations as to how it legally should work, and what responsibilities/liabilities does/will his company have given that it's in possession of my property?\n\nJurisdiction is New York City, if relevant.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> what responsibilities/liabilities does/will his company have given that it's in possession of my property?\n\nNone. There is no contract (implicit or otherwise) between the owner and you. The owner receives no consideration from you in exchange for storing your goods, and an essential element of contracts is an *exchange of considerations*. Thus, he has no obligation to continue storing your goods. \n\nAnother essential element in contract law is that the agreement \\-\\-meaning the conditions thereof\\-\\- be entered knowingly and willfully. Since the time of making the arrangement and up to now, you were reasonably unaware of the likelihood of an obligation to pay the owner. This preempts the owner's right to start billing you.\n\nIf anything, you would need to prove special circumstances to avail yourself of a viable claim of *promissory estoppel*. See [*Havens v. C \\& D Plastics, Inc.*, 124 Wn.2d 158, 171\\-172 (1994\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/1994282124wn2d1581274):\n\n> To obtain recovery in promissory estoppel, plaintiff must establish\n> \n> \n> (1\\) \\[a] promise which (2\\) the promisor should reasonably expect to\n>  cause the promisee to change his position and (3\\) which does cause the\n>  promisee to change his position (4\\) justifiably relying upon the\n>  promise, in such a manner that (5\\) injustice can be avoided only by\n>  enforcement of the promise.\n\nHowever, the viability and duration of any relief pursuant to promissory estoppel seems very unlikely in the situation you describe.\n\nThe hardship you are undergoing \\-\\-and which prompted you to store your goods there\\-\\- is unfortunate.

For example, in Canada and the United States, registering a copyright creates presumptive proof that the copyright exists and is owned by the registrant. In Canada, breathalyzer results are conclusive proof of the blood alcohol concentration if certain conditions are met.\n\nSome of these regimes are not subject to challenge: they are legal facts even if they are not objectively true (e.g. the breathalyser results). Others create presumptions that can be overcome by contrary evidence (e.g. copyright ownership).\n\n### The default: present relevant evidence, including testimonial evidence\n\nBut outside of special regimes, **you prove a fact by introducing evidence**. The default is that **all relevant evidence that bears on a material fact is admissible**. Evidence is relevant when, if is were to be accepted, it would make the fact in issue more or less likely to be true. Evidence comes in many forms: testimony of the parties or witnesses, documentary evidence, physical evidence, expert opinion evidence.\n\nIf you are wondering, \"How do I prove X?\" Ask yourself, why do you believe X? Or, how do you know X? Or, how has the event X left its mark on the world? Whatever has led you to believe X probably is the evidence that you would want to introduce to the court to help prove X.

I will only present a few categories, some very general and some more specific:\n\n* hearsay (unless it falls within an exception to the hearsay exclusion),\n* privileged material (unless it is a case\\-by\\-case privilege or a discretionary privilege and the person seeking to admit the evidence demonstrates to the judge that it should be admitted),\n* sexual history evidence of a sexual assault complainant when it will be used to support an inference that the complainant is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject\\-matter of the charge or is less worthy of belief (this is because it has been recognized as *not* relevant for this purpose),\n* material that was obtained in contravention of the *Charter* and where the court has decided that the remedy for the *Charter* violation is exclusion of the evidence (in the United States, there is stricter, exclusionary rule),\n* there are many more.\n\nThere are also some meta\\-rules about the evidence that may be used to impugn a witness's credibility, themselves at trial to provide evidence, but for now I am leaving those out of this fairly summary answer.\n\n### Weighing the evidence\n\nThe trier of fact (the judge or a jury) then is to weigh all the admissible evidence, including by weighing the witness and party testimony according to its [credibility and reliability](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/85118/46948) after testing through cross\\-examination, to come to a conclusion on the ultimate question(s) at issue.",

The events are basically the same, but the intent of the person breaking in is different.\n\nJohn sees a car in a parking lot and wants to steal it. He checks every door on the vehicle, and they are all locked. (He did this because breaking into a car decreases its value, not because he was trying to follow any laws.) He then breaks into the car with the intent of stealing it. He uses the minimum amount of force necessary to enter, but again, this is to preserve the car's value, not to comply with the law. After breaking in, however, he sees that the driver had left a child in the car. The weather is hot, and being left in the car would be dangerous for the child. John gets the child out, calls 911, and does not steal the car.

The fact that he later abandoned his plan and performed a heroic act does not negate the crimes he had already committed. His good deed may be considered during sentencing or by prosecutors deciding whether to press charges, but it does not legally excuse his earlier criminal actions and intent. The law generally considers the state of mind and actions at the time the crime was initiated, not subsequent changes of heart or good deeds."

There is no government\\-mandated standard legal agreement, so it is absolutely critical that you read the proposed agreements in detail, several times, and have someone else such as a professional relocation agent, solicitor or a colleague with experience in renting in Hong Kong review the agreement as well before you even think of signing.\n\nI'm quoting the [University of Hong Kong's Community Legal Information Centre's template](http://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/DIY_Residential_Tenancy_Agreement/all.shtml) merely as persuasive (not binding!) authority. \n\n> \\[4\\.] e.

This means that even if the property changes hands due to foreclosure or repossession, the tenant's rights under the original lease are generally protected and continue to be in effect with the new owner or mortgagee in possession. This principle helps ensure stability for tenants and prevents them from being suddenly displaced due to the landlord's financial issues. The other options (A, B, and C) would leave the tenant in a more vulnerable position, which is not typically the case in common law jurisdictions."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: We purchased a spa from a local dealer and had it delivered approximately one year ago. We immediately reported that over 50% of the jets were not working or working poorly, and were also not adjustable. Since then we've gone back and forth with the seller, with them insisting that they will only replace the jets if we pay several hundred dollars for a warranty trip fee, plus the cost of the jets and labor if they deem the problem not their fault.\n\nI'm unwilling to agree to the above because I don't believe the warranty trip fee is valid, as they have breached the initial contract by not delivering the spa in working order. So this is a contracts issue before a warranty issue (even if I accepted that a \"warranty trip fee\" is anything other than criminally unethical). Further, I'm unwilling to put the determination of whether they are at fault or not solely in their hands, as that gives them complete freedom to avoid responsibility. In any case, both they and the manufacturer are no longer responding to me.\n\nNormally in a case like this I'd look for the next closest authorized servicer, pay them to come out and do the repair, then sue the seller for the cost of said repairs. However, the next closest servicer is 82 miles away and won't go outside their area. And even if we could get the seller to respond, they will not come out unless we agree to the conditions noted above, which I won't agree to as I believe that would constitute a settlement and negate my right to sue for the charges back. So we're now in the position of owning a $6k spa that doesn't work right, and that cannot be serviced (because the seller will no longer respond).\n\nIn this case I'm unsure how to quantify the damages, as no amount of money will allow us to get a spa in working order as agreed upon in the original contract. Do we sue under breach of contract and demand the return of 100% of our money and for them to come take the spa? Is there some legal value placed upon a warranty that we can sue for? Do we hire a non\\-authorized servicer and sue for their cost plus the cost of any future issues caused by them being non\\-authorized? Do we sue under some theory of 'emotional suffering'?\n\nWhat is the appropriate way to quantify this case for submission to small claims, given that the courts cannot technically compel the seller to service our spa?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a number of issues here. One is whether they can charge a warranty trip fee: that would depend on what the contract says \u2013 such fees are possible (but may be prohibited by state law). Such a charge could be motivated by the manufacturer not compensating a dealer for warranty repair travel (also by granting a low number of hours of compensation for a warranty job). The second is whether you are at fault, the dealer is at fault, or the manufacturer is at fault: and, what evidence is there for that conclusion. A standard approach is to get an independent expert to look at the problem and determine what the probable cause of failure is \u2013 that may however be impossible. In that case, you are pretty much at the mercy of the dealer's employees, who hopefully will write up an accurate assessment of the problem. Especially if the manufacturer and seller are not responding, you can't count on ordinary business goodwill to ease the process.\n\nIf the seller can legally charge a warranty trip fee, then you can't legally force them to perform service without paying the fee. If they *can't* legally charge that fee, then you have a different problem, because they should have come and repaired the unit. They are not, however, obligated to replace the defective stuff or give a refund (without court order), assuming that your state does not have a spa lemon law (I've never heard of such a thing: lemon laws are about new vehicles).\n\nIf the dealer and manufacturer simply refuse to service your unit, the basic scheme would be to get it repaired by someone else (at whatever cost) and sue after the fact for damages \u2013 that's not at all a risk\\-free proposition. Alternatively, you could sue one or both for specific performance, i.e. get the court to force them to fix the problem, but as you know that is beyond the reach of small claims court. Or, you sue for a refund of the sale price (up to the state limit). The sale price should be easy to establish; dealer and seller refusal should be easy to establish (but be sure that you don't extrapolate from \"refuse to do in a way I want\" to \"refuse\"). Having the evidence in hand is mandatory. Evidence of non\\-functioning shouldn't be too hard, and you would also need to show that you are not the cause of the spa not functioning. If they have some fact in their possession that constitutes evidence that you are to blame, you have a right to see that evidence (through discovery), and they can do likewise to you.\n\nIf their refusal is based on your insistence that they drop the trip fee but they will do the work if you pay the fee, then you could do that, and if the fee is not legal, then you can sue to recover that amount. \n\nThere is nothing special about suing for a refund vs. suing for the cost of repair, in terms of what small claims court does.",

If the customer wants to pursue legal action through small claims court, which of the following approaches is likely to be the most appropriate and effective?\n\nA) Sue for emotional suffering due to the stress caused by the non-functioning spa\nB) Demand a full refund of the purchase price and request the seller to remove the spa\nC) Hire a non-authorized servicer to repair the spa and sue for those costs plus potential future issues\nD) Sue for the cost of the warranty trip fee after paying it and having the spa repaired\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most appropriate approach for small claims court in this situation. Suing for a refund of the sale price (up to the state limit) is within the scope of small claims court and doesn't require proving complex damages. It's a straightforward claim based on breach of contract, as the spa was not delivered in working order. \n\nOption A (emotional suffering) is typically not considered in small claims court and is difficult to quantify. \n\nOption C involves speculative future damages and could potentially void the warranty, complicating the case. \n\nOption D might be viable if the fee is indeed illegal, but it doesn't address the larger issue of the non-functioning spa and might limit the total recoverable amount.\n\nDemanding a full refund addresses the core issue of the breach of contract and provides a clear, quantifiable amount for the court to consider, making it the most appropriate approach for small claims court in this scenario."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An insurance policy contains exclusions for vehicles used as \"public or livery conveyance\" but exempts \"share-the-expense car pools\" from this exclusion. A policyholder regularly uses the Waze Carpool app to find riders to share commuting costs. If an accident occurs during one of these Waze Carpool trips, how would the insurance company likely view the coverage?\n\nA) The trip would definitely be covered as a \"share-the-expense car pool\"\nB) The trip would definitely be excluded as a \"public or livery conveyance\"\nC) The coverage would depend on how the insurance company interprets Waze Carpool in relation to traditional carpooling\nD) The policy would automatically cover any trip arranged through a carpooling app\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the coverage would depend on how the insurance company interprets Waze Carpool in relation to traditional carpooling. While Waze Carpool emphasizes cost-sharing, which aligns with the concept of a \"share-the-expense car pool,\" there hasn't been definitive confirmation that insurance companies universally accept app-based carpooling services under this exemption. The question highlights that this specific scenario hasn't been legally tested, and opinions vary. Therefore, the insurance company's interpretation would be crucial in determining coverage. Answer A is too definitive given the lack of clear precedent, B contradicts the policy's exemption for cost-sharing arrangements, and D overgeneralizes coverage for all app-based carpooling without considering individual policy terms or insurer interpretations."

Since I am not familiar with this stuff here in the U.S., may I ask anybody here in this forum for advise on how to handle this? Should I just ignore it and leave the country (which is scheduled for next week)? How much is the fine (the officer said it depends on various aspects and I should negotiate this with the court)?

This may prevent you from getting a visa or participation in the visa\\-waiver program as applicable. Even if you do get in, if you come to the attention of the police, the warrant will flash up on their computer and you will be arrested, jailed and extradited to Arizona all at your expense.\n\nBasically, if you ever want to return to the US, pay the fine.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I, being a non\\-expert in any country's/state's law, was somewhat surprised when it was said that propensity evidence isn't, in Wisconsin, legal evidence; see between 5\\.57 \\- 8\\.15 in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxoYNpBMaCg&ab_channel=LegalEagle) about the Rittenhouse trial.\n\nI thought that propensity evidence could be seen as circumstantial evidence. This is not the case in Wisconsin (at least not usually). So my question is, are there any states/countries you know of where propensity evidence is allowed, whether generally or in exceptional cases?\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nThe following is in response to @ohwilleke's answer.\n\n> (2\\) Permitted Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\n\nThe item *(...) such as proving motive (...)* catches my eye. If I understand correctly, the propensity evidence must suggest motive without invoking an argument reliant on character. Let me explain my (mis)understanding with an example:\n\n> The defendant is on trial for theft. They have a criminal history of theft. The prosecutors say that due to the propensity evidence, the defendant has a thieving character (or more extremely, has kleptomania), and thus, has motives for theft.\n\nIn the above example, the propensity evidence is inadmissible, because it argues **via** character, despite ultimately making a claim about motive.\n\nAn allowed example would then be:\n\n> The defendant is on trial for the theft of ancient Egyptian relics. The defendant has a criminal history of stealing ancient Egyptian relics. The prosecutors use this propensity evidence to suggest the defendant has a collection of Egyptian relics, and/or a fascination/obsession of/over ancient Egyptian relics.\n\nThe first suggestion is not a matter of character, but simply a claim about the defendant possessing a collection. The second suggestion is more borderline, as whether one is to view \"a fascination/obsession of/over ancient Egyptian relics\" as a part of their character, or as merely a non\\-physical possession/quirk is hard to say for me.\n\nSo, is my understanding correct?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The short answer is that propensity evidence can only be circumstantial evidence and that it is generally inadmissible.\n\nBut we should start by clarifying what \"circumstantial evidence\" means. It is not the opposite of legal evidence, but more like the opposite of direct evidence. Direct evidence is evidence that independently establishes a fact in question, while circumstantial evidence is evidence that gives rise to an inference that a fact in question is true. There is a misconception that circumstantial evidence is somehow inadmissible or inferior to direct evidence, but the truth is that the vast majority of evidence is circumstantial.\n\nSo if you are on trial for murder, direct evidence would include your confession, an eyewitness account of the murder, and surveillance video of you killing the victim. Circumstantial evidence would include things like the victim's blood on your clothes, a taxi driver's testimony that he dropped you off at the victim's apartment just before the murder happened, or surveillance video of you exiting the cab and entering the apartment.\n\nPropensity evidence is evidence that a person is likely to have acted one way in this case because they have acted that same way in the past. It is therefore never going to be direct evidence and always going to be circumstantial evidence, because it never explicitly says \"the defendant did it,\" but rather says \"the defendant did it before, so maybe he did it again.\"\n\nThe general rule is that propensity evidence is inadmissible. [Fed.R.Evid. 404(b)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404). It sometimes comes in anyway, though, for various reasons. If a defendant is facing trespass charges, for instance, a prosecutor would want to introduce evidence that the defendant has previously been convicted of trespassing. The defense will object that it's propensity evidence, but the prosecutor will respond that it's admissible if he's using it to establish something *other than* the likelihood that the defendant did the same thing again. If the prosecutor needs to prove that the defendant knew he was not allowed on the property, the trespass conviction is very strong evidence on that point.\n\nAnother common exception is in sexual\\-assault cases, where some jurisdictions allow this type of evidence. Indeed, Wisconsin is among the states that explicitly permit evidence of the defendant's previous convictions for certain sex crimes to demonstrate that he committed a sex crime again in the current case. [WI Stat \u00a7 904\\.04(2\\)(b)](https://law.justia.com/codes/wisconsin/2012/chapter-904/section-904.04).\n\nLouisiana likewise allows propensity evidence to establish that the defendant has a history of \"sexually assaultive behavior\" or a \"lustful disposition toward children.\" [C.E. 412\\.2\\.](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2009/ce/ce412.2.html) Likewise, the defendant may be able to introduce evidence that the victim previously consented to sex and is therefore likely to have consented to sex in the current case. [C.E. 412](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2009/ce/ce412.html).\n\n**EDIT:**\nTo address your examples, then, I would say that that the first would probably not survive a Rule 404(b) objection, and the second one would stand a better chance. On the second one, the defense should argue that the court should allow evidence of the defendant's interest in Egyptology, but not evidence of the convictions, as that would allow the jury to consider his motive without being diverted into propensity territory. The prosecution should probably counter that the defendant's convictions show more than just the *existence* of a motive, but also the *strength* of that motive, as well as perhaps that the defendant had the prior knowledge and skill that would be necessary to pull off a museum heist. The judge could go probably rule either way without being reversed.\n\nI would clarify one point on how to analyze and characterize this evidence: Rule 404 deals with propensity evidence, i.e., evidence that is meant to demonstrate that a person acted in conformity with his character. Subsection (a) deals with establishing propensity through \"character evidence,\" which is evidence that the defendant's character or character traits are consistent with the conduct in question at trial; while subsection (b) deals with establishing propensity through \"other acts\" evidence, which is evidence that the defendant previously engaged in conduct that is consistent with the conduct at question of trial.\n\nBoth types of evidence \\-\\- character evidence and other\\-acts evidence \\-\\- are inadmissible to establish propensity, but they may be admissible to establish motive, plan, preparation, etc. So when your defendant's previous convictions are offered to prove motive to expand his Egyptology collection and not to establish propensity, the court could allow them into evidence not because they are *admissible* propensity evidence, but rather because they are not propensity evidence at all.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is on trial for stealing a rare ancient Egyptian artifact from a museum. The prosecution wants to introduce evidence of the defendant's prior convictions for similar thefts of Egyptian artifacts. Which of the following is the strongest argument for admitting this evidence under Rule 404(b)?\n\nA) The evidence demonstrates the defendant's propensity to steal Egyptian artifacts, making it more likely they committed this crime.\n\nB) The evidence establishes the defendant's character as a thief, which is relevant to the current charges.\n\nC) The evidence proves the defendant's motive of expanding their personal collection of Egyptian artifacts, as well as their specialized knowledge and skills needed for such a theft.\n\nD) The evidence shows the defendant's lustful disposition toward Egyptian artifacts, which is always admissible in such cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the strongest argument for admitting the evidence under Rule 404(b). This option avoids using the evidence to prove propensity or character (which would generally be inadmissible) and instead focuses on permissible uses under 404(b) such as proving motive, knowledge, and preparation. The evidence of prior similar thefts could demonstrate the defendant's specific interest in Egyptian artifacts (motive) and their specialized skills and knowledge necessary for such a theft (preparation and knowledge).\n\nOption A is incorrect because it explicitly argues for propensity, which is generally inadmissible. Option B is also incorrect as it focuses on character evidence, which is typically not allowed under 404(a). Option D is incorrect because while some jurisdictions have exceptions for \"lustful disposition\" in sexual assault cases, this doesn't apply to artifact theft and is not a general exception to the propensity evidence rule."

Furthermore, let's say that the employer has booked hotel rooms for a conference stay, and that that hotel offers a senior discount in the final booking price. In this case, it's straightforward to see that the company made a smart economic choice to get the most bang for the buck. These savings are the company's.\n\nBut what if, unbeknownst to the company, the hotel offers freebies of economic value to all senior citizens. Something like a day at the spa, or a gift certificate for a future stay. The company's choice was not motivated by the free gift, and so the company received full value for its money.\n\nIn the above case:\n\n* the employee would not have received the freebie without the company's money\n* but neither would the employee have qualified for the freebie without the employee's non\\-work\\-related status (i.e. age).\n\nSo they've both contributed something.

It is well\\-established that the employer owns FF miles. IANAL so my opinion is on shaky ground, but I see some daylight between the above and FF miles. FF miles are given to anyone who has an account, and are part of standard carriage for all travelers. Anyone can sign up for an FF program.
