Some licences (like CC0\\) allow legitimate licence holders to grant licences also.\n\nTo be *certain* that you have a legitimate licence **you** must trace the work to the original copyright holder. For a photograph, the original copyright owner is the photographer or their employer if they were producing [work for hire](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire). Find them and follow the licence trail from them to you.\n\nThis is, of course, problematical. Anyone can *say* they own the copyright, indeed they may genuinely believe they do, however, they may be wrong. All you can do is make reasonable enquiries.\n\nIf you do this or legitimately try and fail to do this, and you\u2019re wrong, then you have committed [innocent infringement](https://legalvision.com.au/innocent-copyright-infringement/).

I also messaged the ex\\-landlord \"you still have my desk, if you agree I can keep the glove I'll consider this resolved\". He replied with a lie saying the desk is his. \n\nSo what should I do with the oven glove? I can return it by leaving it in the mailbox.

Should I bring up the desk and say something like \"you need to agree to return my desk if I return the oven glove\"?

Option B, while it involves returning the glove, doesn't address the uncertainty of which glove belongs to the ex-landlord and misses the opportunity for direct communication.

Sometimes this is done to inform judges regarding the original intent of constitutional provisions in that era by providing non\\-binding but persuasive context for the language in the constitution.\n\nSometimes, it is part of a common law legal tradition of precedents that was not displaced by the American Revolution.\n\nAlso, state and local legislation can and often does displace pre\\-Revolutionary era English common law precedent. Indeed, this is much more common than Congressionally enacted laws doing so, because most subjects for which there is English common law precedent are matters of state law and not matters of federal law.\n\n> Otherwise how do you end up with the scotus citing the right of\n> eminent domain etc?\n\nEminent domain is expressly provided for in the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution. Precedents in place in 1791, when it was enacted, merely provide context for what was meant when the 5th Amendment was adopted.\n\n> What is the basis for this continuation of English common law and how\n> did it come to be?\n\nEnglish common law was the law in force at the time of the American Revolution and was not displaced. The status quo was merely continued. And, in the 18th century, the prevailing legal theory saw common law as largely a form of natural law that was \"discovered\" in much the way that a scientific law might be, rather than being a policy choice made by a judge. This legal theory of the common law, however is no longer current.\n\nThese days, many states have statutes that expressly make the common law of England in the year 1776 (or some other year established by law) the default rule of law in circumstances where there is no other legal guidance.\n\nFor example, Section 2\\-4\\-211 of the Colorado Revised Statutes states that:\n\n> The common law of England so far as the same is applicable and of a\n> general nature, and all acts and statutes of the British parliament,\n> made in aid of or to supply the defects of the common law prior to the\n> fourth year of [James the First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_VI_and_I) \\[i.e. 1607 CE], excepting the second section of the\n> sixth chapter of forty\\-third Elizabeth, the eighth chapter of\n> thirteenth Elizabeth, and the ninth chapter of thirty\\-seventh Henry\n> the Eighth, and which are of a general nature, and not local to that\n> kingdom, shall be the rule of decision, and shall be considered as of\n> full force until repealed by legislative authority.\n\nIn practice, however, as U.S. common law courts have developed a large body of common law precedents, resort to English common law cases as a binding rule of decision is almost non\\-existent. I doubt that even one in a hundred appellate court decisions in the U.S. refer to it as binding law, perhaps one in a thousand cases is closer to the mark.\n\nInstead, the most common modern practice, when a particular state encounters a question upon which the state's appellate law has no relevant precedents on a question reserved for the common law is to look to the most recent \"Restatement\" of the law, a series of non\\-binding code\\-like summaries of various common law legal subjects that is a mishmash of majority rules and \"better rules\" when there is more than one rule used in state courts, prepared by eminent legal scholars called \"reporters\" in a process supervised by the American Bar Association, or to look at the precedents adopted by courts making common law rules of decisions in other states presented with the same issue.\n\n> What parts of the English jurisprudential and legislative mechanisms\n> were done away with and which were kept? Why?\n\nWhile Congress and state legislatures were informed by English legislative mechanisms in devising their own laws, English legislative mechanisms were immediately dispensed with at the time of the American Revolution in 1776\\.\n\nEnglish jurisprudence continued in continuity in substantive common law everywhere but Louisiana (which had a French civil law tradition that persists with modification to this day) and Puerto Rico (which has a Spanish civil law tradition that continues to this day with modification), since it was the status quo. But it developed largely independently of English law since then, as American precedents were developed. As a result, there are now very few areas (all obscure) where American precedents are not on point to provide a rule of decision, making resort to English jurisprudence unnecessary.\n\nStill, when a concept, doctrine, or legal term originates in English common law, it isn't unheard of for American courts to elucidate the English origins of the idea as part of the process of explaining the modern meaning of the legal idea or term in question, as much for \"color commentary\" as for a source of binding law.\n\nIn some areas, like property law, parts of the United States that were formerly part of Mexico likewise continue Mexican private law traditions and jurisprudence.

Copyright does not preclude others from using the ideas or information revealed by the author\u2019s work. It pertains to the literary, musical, graphic, or artistic form in which the author expressed intellectual concepts. Section 102(b) makes clear that copyright protection does not extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work. Some concern has been expressed lest copyright in computer programs should extend protection to the methodology or processes adopted by the programmer, rather than merely to the \u201cwriting\u201d expressing his ideas. Section 102(b) is intended, among other things, to make clear that **the expression adopted by the programmer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and that the actual processes or methods embodied in the program are not within the scope of the copyright law**. Section 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the scope of copyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to restate, in the context of the new single Federal system of copyright, that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.\n\nThe corollary here is that the copyrightable element in the standard is the arrangement of the information and the listed reasoning, but not the data itself.\n\nIn [Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Svc. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 (1991\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/) the US Supreme Court held that \"the fundamental axiom of copyright law is that no one may copyright facts or ideas.\" stating:\n\n> A compilation is not copyrightable per se, but is copyrightable only if its facts have been \"selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.\" \u00a7 101 (emphasis added). Thus, the statute envisions that some ways of selecting, coordinating, and arranging data are not sufficiently original to trigger copyright protection. **Even a compilation that is copyrightable receives only limited protection, for the copyright does not extend to facts contained in the compilation. \u00a7 103(b).**\n\nIn *Feist*, the Court held that the raw data in Rural's white pages was not copyrightable, however, Rural would have a copyright in the work as a whole because of information outside the raw facts.\n\nAs for standards like Building Codes, Plumbing Codes, Electrical Codes, they are protected by copyright.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether this changes in the future considering the recent [Georgia v.

The correct answer is B because it accurately reflects the principles established in copyright law and reinforced by cases like Feist v. Rural Telephone Service.\n\nRaw scientific data, such as the mechanical properties of steel alloys, are considered facts and cannot be copyrighted.

The explicitness of your prior leases overrides the statutory variations that might exist among jurisdictions in this regard.

See [893\\.43](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/893/IV/43). *Statute of limitations* means the lapse of time upon which claims of certain type are no longer actionable.\n\nThus, you would only be able to recover the fees of the latest 6 years except for this year's lease, since your current lease no longer specifies that the landlord will cover that cost.\n\nFor more information on small claims courts, see [chapter 799](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/799) of the Wisconsin statutory law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant discovers that for the past 7 years, they have been paying utility bills that their lease explicitly stated were the landlord's responsibility.

The total amount in dispute (approximately $50 per month for several years) falls within the typical jurisdiction of small claims courts. Additionally, this is a straightforward breach of contract issue, which is well-suited for small claims proceedings.\n\nThe maximum period for which the tenant can potentially recover costs is limited to the most recent 6 years. This is due to the statute of limitations for breach of contract in Wisconsin, which is six years. The statute of limitations sets a time limit on how far back a plaintiff can claim damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this case does not require federal court involvement and fraud would be more difficult to prove than breach of contract. The 7-year recovery period is also inaccurate due to the statute of limitations.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while housing authorities can mediate some landlord-tenant disputes, they typically don't have the authority to order financial compensation in this type of situation. The 7-year recovery period is also inaccurate.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while negotiation is always an option, it's not the most appropriate legal recourse if the landlord is uncooperative.

To be safe, you should either obtain a license, or restrict yourself to public domain material, or create similar\\-sounding snippets your self.\n\nWithin the limits of copyright law, only the copyright holder has the right to decide over public performances or reproductions of their work. Copyright does have limits, so there are some exceptions. For example, limited reproductions for educational purposes are typically fine. However, this does not imply a general permission to use a work just because your use is non\\-commercial or just because you gave attribution.\n\nSpecifically in the US, the *fair use doctrine* provides a broad copyright exception, though fair use should be understood more as a possible defense when accused of infringement than as a clear right. A fair use analysis must consider four factors:\n\n* purpose and character of the use, for example whether the use is commercial or nonprofit educational\n* nature of the work\n* amount of the work used\n* effect of the use on the potential market of the copyrighted work\n\nIt will probably not be fair use just because the use is non\\-commercial. However, other factors might help with the fair use defense.\nA highly transformative use (remixing the audio snippets)\nfor noncommercial purposes,\nusing only short audio snippets that are unlikely to have any effect on the value of the original work (your performance doesn't compete with the original TED talk)\nmight indeed make it possible to rely on a fair use defense.\n\nIndeed, music sampling is a common phenomenon, and there is a [long history of debate on the question whether sampling is fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Music_sampling). However, most (but not all) instances of sampling will require a license.\n\nNote that other countries have completely different copyright exceptions. Fair use is an US\\-specific phenomenon. For example, Germany's copyright law has explicit protections for limited educational use or for highly transformative use, but all without the flexibility that fair use allows \u2013 and in particular without recognition of non\\-commercial use as a factor.

While the use is non-commercial, which is favorable for a fair use argument, this alone does not guarantee fair use. The fair use doctrine in the US considers four main factors: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the potential market for the original work.\n\nIn this case, the use of short snippets in a transformative way (remixing with original music) for a non-commercial purpose could potentially support a fair use defense. However, it's not a clear-cut case, and fair use is more of a defense against infringement claims rather than a guaranteed right.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because non-commercial use alone doesn't automatically qualify as fair use. Answer B is too strict, as licenses may not be necessary if the use is determined to be fair use.

As Wikipedia explains:\n\n> Private defence of property\n> \n> \n> This defence is available when a person uses force to defend an\n>  interest in property: for example,\n> \n> \n> * to prevent a would\\-be thief or robber from taking his own property, or that of another;\n> * to prevent someone from damaging or destroying his own or another\u2019s property; or\n> * to prevent an intruder from entering his own or another\u2019s property.

In *S v Mogohlwane*,\n>  Mogohlwane had been robbed by the deceased, who had been armed with a\n>  tomahawk, of a bag containing his clothing, shoes and food. Mogohlwane\n>  then went to his home, nearby, fetched a knife and returned to recover\n>  his property. When Mogohlwane tried to take back his bag, the deceased\n>  resisted and again threatened him with the tomahawk. Mogohlwane then\n>  stabbed him with the knife, causing his death. Mogohlwane was charged\n>  with murder.

The State had not proved that there was a less dangerous\n>  and more effective means or method reasonably available to the accused\n>  to defend himself against the act of robbery, so it was decided that\n>  Mogohlwane had acted in private defence and therefore lawfully.\n\nThere is no real question in this case that justification for some private defense of property was present, and in both the scenarios presented, it is directed at the attacker.\n\nSo, the question under South African law would be whether the force was \"necessary to avert the danger\" and whether it was \"a reasonable response to the attack.\"\n\nGenerally speaking \"deadly force\" is not going to be justified to protect property in a smash and grab, although in the first scenario when someone is in the car, there may be an implied threat to a person that would justify a greater level of force than would be the case otherwise.\n\nThere is, however, no easy answer. It is a judgment call that must be evaluated for necessity and reasonableness on a case by case basis, and probably has to be evaluated in light of other alternative options. If your 300 pound muscled bouncer friend could just grab him instead, it was probably not necessary to smash his legs or use a taser. In other circumstances that might be the best available option.\n\nSimilarly, under *Mogohlwane* it would be appropriate to consider if the victim had insurance and how much of an economic impact this would have on the victim and what the property being stolen was.

Under South African law, private defense of property requires that the defense be necessary to avert the danger and a reasonable response to the attack. The court would consider factors such as the necessity of the action, the reasonableness of the response, and the value of the property being protected. In this case, the laptop's importance to the woman's livelihood (similar to the Mogohlwane case) could be a factor in determining if the response was justified.

This morning, while my back was turned to write on the board, one of my students (age 17\\) slipped a pill into my coffee mug. This is a thermos\\-style mug that has a screw\\-on lid with a small opening; it was obviously a deliberate act). \n\nAbout 30 minutes later, when the bell rang to change classes, another student stayed behind to tell me NOT to drink anymore coffee \"because \\[student name] put a white pill in it\".

I had no idea what had happened and continued drinking my coffee as usual until the 2nd student warned me to stop. \n\nI quickly went to be checked out by the school nurse who checked my vitals and found an irregular, rapid heartbeat and high blood pressure (both unusual for me). I was sent to the urgent care / occupational med clinic and underwent 3 hours of testing (x\\-rays, ekg, drug screening, etc). Luckily, no residual problems. \n\nWhile I was gone, the student was searched and \"Herbal Viagra\" was found. She admitted to putting it into my coffee. She was suspended for 5 days. I told the school resource officer that I wanted to file charges against her and he said all she'll get is a \"citation\" because it isn't actually \"criminal\". Maybe it's because it wasn't a controlled substance. I can't believe that it's NOT A CRIME to drug someone without their knowledge or consent. Herbal supplements can interact with other meds wreaking havoc on a body. She doesn't know what meds I already take or what allergies I have.

However, if I could deep fake his real face into the short scene where he's alive, people would instantly recognize him, and have an \"oh shit\" moment when he bites the dust.\n\nObviously, this is ethically questionable.

Is it better if he just \"disappears\"?\n\nAlso, deep faking is a new tech, and I'm not sure how many laws have even been put into place about it yet. If a law were to be put into place down the road that outlaws this type of portrayal, would I be grandfathered into the system and not prosecuted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you make clear that this is fiction, it isn't really a true \"deepfake\" which in the primary sense of the word is a depiction that intends to mislead the viewer about whether something actually happened. It is merely special effects.\n\nIf you do so without someone's consent there are several potential theories of liability.\n\n* Individuals have a right of publicity. Generally, their likeness cannot be used to make a profit without their consent, and if it is not, they are entitled to fair compensation relative to what they would have been paid if they had agreed in a typical arms length negotiation. The exact scope of this right varies from state to state.\n* It is conceivable, although unlikely, that this could be construed as intentional infliction of emotional distress/outrageous conduct, if it was calculated to cause distress and emotional harm to the person faked or someone who knows the person faked. The fact that this is fiction greatly reduces this risk and it would take some quite exceptional facts (e.g. secret knowledge that the person had a deep phobia of dying in a particular way) for this claim to be legally supported.\n* Depending upon the nature of the film, this could be deemed an implied threat, similar to burning someone's image in effigy, which could provide a basis for the issuance of a protection order and to criminal prosecution for threatening someone's life. The context of the film and its making would have to support the theory that this was intended to be a threat to the person depicted (or someone close to them). A [recent Pennsylvania Supreme Court case](https://www.mcall.com/news/police/mc-nws-anthony-elonis-cyberstalking-20210802-egcejopnu5d2bhx7azpndt5wxe-story.html) (of a man who was subject to a previous U.S. Supreme Court case on a similar topic) addressed the issues associated with this kind of charge.\n* There could be a defamation claim, related to, for example, the reason that the person is killed in the movie, if politician can credibly claim that the film, while itself fictional, is impliedly making a statement about a presently existing real world material fact about the politician that damages the politician's reputation, which is not true and is made with actual malice to destroy the politician's reputation. This might happen, for example, if the overall plot is so close to reality (or a very close allegory to reality) that calling it fiction is really inaccurate, and it is really just a smear job disguised as a fictional story.\n\nNotable, all of these claims depend upon the intent of the party making the film, and the purpose of the scene, and the larger context. You can't determine if a \"deepfake\" will give rise to legal consequences in a vacuum.\n\nUsually, fictional films contain prominent disclaimers that \"any similarity to real events is purely coincidental\" in an effort to rebut these theories of liability.\n\n> If a law were to be put into place down the road that outlaws this\n> type of portrayal, would I be grandfathered into the system and not\n> prosecuted?\n\nThe particular method is new, but the legal considerations are the same. People have been making snuff films falsely depicting someone's death for more than a century, and some of them have been convincing.\n\nA new statute cannot have *ex post facto* effect to acts taken prior to its enactment, but there are existing statutes and common law rules that may well provide legal consequences in appropriate circumstances as noted above.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A filmmaker creates a fictional movie depicting the assassination of a well-known politician using deepfake technology to portray the politician's likeness without their consent.

The. cause of death is [SIDS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By definition, when a death is diagnosed as an instance of SIDS, the actual cause of death is not known. (If the cause is known or is determined by autopsy, the diagnosis is not SIDS.) Thus there can be no proof that the bassinet was the cause, or even a contributing factor, in the death, and therefore the seller of the bassinet should have no liability.\n\nIf there was some other cause of death that was due to the condition of the bassinet, there could possibly be liability. For example, say the bassinet broke suddenly, causing the baby to fall and death resulted. But here I think ther could be liability only if the seller knew (or suspected) that the bassinet was in an unsafe condition, or if a reasonable person in the seller's position would have known or suspected this, or possibly if the seller made knowingly false statements about the condition which made the bassinet seem safer than it in fact was. None of these matches the situation described in the question.\n\nHowever, in many jurisdictions there are laws specifically forbidding the sale of used mattresses, adult or infant, regardless of their detailed condition or how they are described. In such a jurisdiction the seller could not lawfully include the mattress as part of the sale.

In a SIDS case, by definition, the cause of death is unknown, so the bassinet itself cannot be proven to be the cause. The seller wouldn't automatically be liable just for selling a used item (A is incorrect). There could be circumstances where liability might arise, so C is too absolute.

Even though discovering and disclosing vulnerabilities can be legal activities, demanding payment to withhold information that could harm the company crosses into extortion territory.

Everybody having the citizenship of the municipality has the swiss citizenship as well. In theory, the canton and the state also have something to say, but that's irrelevant for most applications. \n\nThis has historic reasons, but going into the details is beyond the scope of this question. \n\nFact is, that every municipality has its own rules, about when and how applications are handled. This has been unified a bit in recent years, but some things still differ. That is for instance, how many years you need to have lived there or who decides your application. There were municipalities (actually most) where the final decision was made using a public vote. This practice was declared illegal by the federal court some years ago, because becoming a citizen is a formal governmental act, and as such a reason needs to be given for turning an application down. This is inherently impossible with a vote. \n\nSince that law decision, most municipalities have shifted the responsibility to a committee for citizenship applications. The public can still bring in arguments, but they need to be justified (ie. if somebody knows about the applicant being a wanted criminal somewhere). \n\nConsequently, you can now call for a court to check whether the given reasoning is correct and just, if you are turned down.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: In the Swiss naturalization process, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the current state of affairs?\n\nA) The final decision on citizenship applications is always made by a public vote in the municipality.\n\nB) Cantonal governments have the primary authority in granting citizenship, with municipalities playing a minor role.\n\nC) Applicants must first apply at the municipal level, but decisions can be appealed to higher levels of government.\n\nD) The federal government directly oversees and approves all citizenship applications across Switzerland.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In Switzerland, the naturalization process begins at the municipal level, where applicants must first apply. However, decisions made at this level can be appealed or transferred to higher levels of government, such as the cantonal government, for review or overruling.

In this case, Party C, as B's procurer and likely heir, inherits B's contractual obligations. The notice period remains valid as it was agreed upon before B's death.

It needs to be evaluated incident and sub\\-incident act by sub\\-incident act.\n\n1. The use of force is legally permitted to prevent harm to others and to the property of others under some circumstances.\n2. Citizens arrests are permitted under some circumstances, but generally, the person making the arrest must have personal knowledge of the crime while it is in the process of being committed.\n3. Some laws prohibit wearing masks under some circumstances, but usually not in all circumstances.\n4. Your client's \"business model\" is not consistent with being able to testify in court, so the criminal justice system will only be able to convict someone whom your client delivers to police if they can do so without your testimony.\n5. As a general rule, the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule does not apply to evidence collected by private parties or to statements obtained by private parties that are not made under duress that are not Mirandized. But, if your client is effectively \"deputized\" or becomes a \"de facto\" agent of the state who is called up to be a member of a posse for the police, for example, by using an agreed symbol such as shining a light with a symbol on it on some clouds, at that point, with respect to that matter, the 4th Amendment exclusionary rule and Miranda probably do apply to evidence that your client obtains, and exclusion of that kind of evidence could make prosecution much more difficult, unless the prosecution can successfully make an argument that the other evidence that the illegally obtained evidence leads them to is not \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" because it would have inevitably been discovered in due course using only the legally obtained evidence.\n6. Even if your client does violate the law, law enforcement is not obligated to investigate his alleged crimes even if the victims complain, and prosecutors are not obligated to prosecute those crimes, even if they have overwhelming evidence of guilt which they could use to secure a conviction. Prosecutorial discretion is basically absolute.\n7. Your client might be sued civilly for operating a corrupt enterprise under RICO, for various intentional torts, and for negligence, by people who think that they have been harmed by his conduct, but someone can only sue your client if they can figure out who he is and serve him with civil process.\n8. If you are helping your client conduct on ongoing criminal enterprise, whether or not the crimes are prosecuted by the criminal justice system, the attorney\\-client privilege you have with your client is probably forfeit should you be placed under a subpoena and your may be violating other ethical rules.

The legality of the vigilante's actions depends on various factors and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. While some use of force may be permitted to prevent harm, and citizen's arrests are allowed under certain circumstances, the vigilante's methods may not always be legal. Additionally, the admissibility of evidence collected by the vigilante can be complex, especially if they are considered a de facto agent of the state. The vigilante may also face civil lawsuits, though anonymity provides some protection. Prosecutorial discretion plays a role in whether the vigilante's own potentially illegal actions are pursued.

And what \"Intellectual Property\" stands for?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Stallman is simply wrong: that's like saying that stealing a car and stealing a motorcycle are \"totally different things\" because there is some difference. They are all examples of the concept \"intellectual property\", though they differ under the law in particular ways. Copyright of books and copyright of computer programs is likewise covered by somewhat different law, but they have something in common. The essential thing that all forms of intellectual property law have in common is that they protect a person's intangible intellectual creations: they are treated like property, just as the fruits of an individual's labor is property.\n\nAs far as \"how much of the actual code\" is the same, you would have to look at the legal code of a particular country. In the US, trademark law is gathered together in [Title 15 under Chapter 22](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-22); patent law is in [Title 35](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/35); copyright law is [Title 17](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17). Patents and copyrights are similar in being a constitutionally enumerated power of Congress (Art. I, Sect. 8, Cl. 8\\), the power \"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries\". Patents and trademarks are similar in that they are both controlled by the [Patent and Trademark Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Patent_and_Trademark_Office). All three have in common that they are the based in the common law, and were until the [Trademark Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-Mark_Cases) held to be covered by the Copyright Clause.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, understanding the intellectual and historical underpinnings of copyright, trademark and patent is probably not useful in understanding software licensing. Instead, it is most useful to understand copyright law and contract law, and perhaps patent law just in case some piece of software is patented (see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patents_under_United_States_patent_law) for an overview in the US, and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patents_under_United_Kingdom_patent_law) for the UK).

They share the fundamental principle of protecting a person's intangible intellectual creations, treating them as a form of property. Although they differ in specific applications and are governed by separate statutes, they have historical and conceptual connections. For instance, patents and copyrights are both mentioned in the U.S. Constitution under the same clause, and all three were originally based in common law.

The fluctuation of the number of exposures (and impliedly the opt\\-outs) in a group policy can be of interest to a prospective insurer for purposes of rate making of the plan being assessed.

Juries at that time fear that they will go to hell if they convict an innocent man. So the rule is made that the jury must conclude that the defendant is guilty beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nOf course, the purpose and the meaning is no longer there. The purpose of beyond reasonable doubt cases is now a way to protect defendants.\n\nThat's because, of course, values have changed.\n\nUS have become secular countries. Yada yada.\n\nStatutory rapes laws also evolved.\n\n[https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer\\=https://law.stackexchange.com/\\&httpsredir\\=1\\&article\\=1080\\&context\\=fac\\_pub](https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://law.stackexchange.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1080&context=fac_pub)\n\nIt says that statutory rapes laws are there to protect **virginity of young girls.**\n\nThat would make a lot of sense.\n\nVirginity was very important at that time.\n\nVirginity of boys are \"worthless\" and hence not worth protecting. So a hot beautiful young teacher having sex with young boy would be \"nice\".\n\nHowever, as times go buy, we have men and women treated equally.\n\nAlso marital age have gone up and virginity is not important anymore.\n\nSo now, statutory rapes would actually protect a 15 years old boy that **rape** an 21 years old girl. That 21 years old girl will have strong incentive not to report the rape due to statutory rapes law.\n\n> When an adult is raped by a juvenile, the offense of statutory rape\n>  imposes criminal liability on the adult for the same intercourse by\n>  which the adult is a victim of rape.

Before paternity tests, adultery means paternity frauds. Men with power and wealth will end up inheriting his wealth to someone else' child if his wife commit adultery.\n\nTimes changed.\n\nWe can just use paternity tests to know who the father of the child is. So adultery laws become meaningless. In most states it's legal. Being legal, getting married no longer protect men from paternity fraud. If anything, getting married expose men to more liability of paternity fraud.\n\nAre these \"evolving idea\", or phenomena, where a rule makes a lot of sense a long time ago, but somehow have been very different now have a name? So the laws were there for a reasonable purpose. And now the law is there for totally different purpose.\n\nWhat are these called?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes \\- any general law book will deal with this\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nIn common law systems, judges apply the law to the particular facts of the case. The law means the statutes passed by the legislature, regulations properly made by the executive and precedent set by other judges in higher courts in the particular appellate chain.\n\nWithin the constraint of those laws the judge may need to create or alter a law to fit the specific case, including the changed society that the case exists in. Now, lower courts are bound by precedent, even if that precedent was set in the 1700s \\- indeed there are plenty of judgments where the judge says \"I don't agree with agree with it but Lord Farquart said in Some Guy v Some Other Guy \\[1856] ...\". These judgments often get appealed up to a court that is not bound by the precedent who can then set a new precedent. Alternatively, these sorts of cases can serve as notice to the legislature who may enact a law that overturns the old law.\n\nFor example, in Obergefell v.

Judges apply existing laws and precedents to new cases, but they also consider current societal context when interpreting those laws. They can create or alter laws to fit specific cases within the constraints of existing statutes and higher court precedents. While lower courts are bound by precedent, higher courts can set new precedents that reflect societal changes. Additionally, legislatures can pass new laws in response to outdated precedents. This process allows the legal system to adapt gradually to societal changes while maintaining stability and respect for established law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't allow for any adaptation to societal changes. Option B is incorrect because lower courts don't have the authority to overturn higher court precedents. Option C is incorrect because it ignores the important role courts play in interpreting and applying laws in light of societal changes."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41545/can-my-neighbor-post-signs-on-my-side-of-the-fence", "docs_id": 41545, "title": "Can my neighbor post signs on my side of the fence?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This is about a friend and not myself.

According to the documentation, it is not legally considered reaching into a person's property if you post a sign on your own property that can be seen from the neighbor's property. As long as the fence is entirely on the property owner's land and the sign is attached to their side of the fence, it is within their legal rights to post such a sign, even if it's visible to the neighbor. Options A and B are incorrect because visibility from the neighbor's property does not constitute trespassing or give the neighbor the right to remove the sign.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Jake's legal right to do this in the United States?\n\nA) Jake needs explicit permission from the baseball league to comment on games and display scores.\nB) Jake can provide commentary but cannot display any graphics related to the game, including scores.\nC) Jake is free to provide commentary and display scores, as long as he doesn't rebroadcast video footage from the games.\nD) Jake can only comment on games if he attends them in person, not if he watches them on TV.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In the United States, individuals have a protected right to comment on and report events, including sports games, without needing special permission. This includes providing real-time commentary and displaying factual information like scores.
