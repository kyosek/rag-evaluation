The supplier fails to deliver on time, causing the homeowner to incur additional costs for labor and equipment rental. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the homeowner's ability to recover these costs?\n\nA) The homeowner is automatically entitled to full compensation for all additional costs incurred due to the late delivery.\n\nB) The homeowner can only recover the cost of delivery, as offered by the supplier.\n\nC) The homeowner's ability to recover costs depends on the specific terms of the contract with the supplier.\n\nD) The homeowner has no legal recourse and must absorb all additional costs resulting from the late delivery.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the homeowner's ability to recover costs depends on the specific terms of the contract with the supplier. The documentation emphasizes that the outcome would depend on the agreement between the parties. If the contract included penalties for late delivery or specified that the supplier would be responsible for additional costs, then the homeowner might have a stronger case for recovering expenses. However, if the contract only promised delivery without specific consequences for delays, the homeowner's options for recovery may be limited. The suggestion to potentially file a claim in small-claims court also indicates that the legal right to compensation is not automatic and would need to be determined based on the contract and applicable laws."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11432/why-might-title-18-section-793-be-unconstitutional", "docs_id": 11432, "title": "Why might Title 18 Section 793 be unconstitutional?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: During the House hearing today (July 7, 2016\\) Director Comey implied that section 793 of Title 18 might be unconstitutional as to applying the \"gross negligence\" standard to Hillary Clinton.

According to the information provided, the Soviet Union began entering into copyright treaties with the western world in 1973. However, even for works produced after 1973, they would need to be specifically registered for copyright in the United States to claim protection there.

In my own state of Colorado, covenant violations and small debt collections can be brought in a court of limited jurisdiction called a county court that also handles evictions and money claims up to $15,000 and temporary restraining orders, while other disputes are brought in a court of general jurisdiction called a district court.\n\nI have seen charts of organization for court systems in England, Scotland and New Zealand in the past, as well as all U.S. jurisdictions, and don't recall any courts specifically devoted to condominium disputes in any of them. \n\nEven in civil law countries, specialized courts with jurisdiction over condominium disputes are quite uncommon as I have seen organizational charts for many of those. I seem to recall one or two in the Benelux countries, however.\n\n**Alternative Dispute Resolution Programs For Condominium Owners**\n\nSome condominium associations, however, do have an arbitration agreement included in them that requires that such disputes be referred to a private arbitrator, although binding arbitration provisions aren't very common in condominiums in most parts of the U.S.\n\nFlorida recently adopted [mandatory non\\-binding arbitration](http://www.stevenmasonpa.com/jurisdiction-in-condominium-disputes/) of condominium disputes which is a pre\\-requisite to taking a condominium case to court.\n\n[Connecticut](http://www.ctcondonews.com/2015/04/21/legislation-to-establish-a-pilot-program-to-mediate-condominium-disputes/) has or is contemplating a pilot condominium dispute mediation program as part of the services provided by its probate court, but rejected adding jurisdiction over these cases to its general purpose small claims or limited jurisdiction court as Colorado does. Mediation is a form of non\\-binding settlement discussion which is facilitated by a third party mediator.\n\n**Housing Courts**\n\nI also review below several housing courts in the U.S., none of which appear to clearly have condominium dispute jurisdiction.\n\n*Stand Alone Housing and Land Courts*\n\n[Massachusetts](http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/trial-court/hc/) has a stand alone court whose jurisdiction over condominium matters is at best not well advertised and at worst absent or unclear. Massachusetts also has a [Land Court](http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/trial-court/lc/lc-faqs-gen.html), but that also doesn't seem to have jurisdiction (it handles foreclosures, partition actions, and zoning cases). It is the only state of which I am aware that has a stand alone housing court as opposed to a specialized division of another more general purpose court.\n\nThe [City of Providence](https://www.municode.com/library/ri/providence/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_CH8CO_ARTIIHOCO), Rhode Island has a housing court on the Massachusetts housing court model with similarly vague jurisdiction, established as part of its authority to create municipal courts, rather than as part of a state court system as in Massachusetts, but not as a mere division of a municipal court either. Again, it probably lacks condominium dispute jurisdiction.\n\n*Housing Courts As Divisions Of General Purpose Courts*\n\nNew York City has [a division of the limited jurisdiction city court](https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/) for New York City handles such cases (up to $25,000 in controversy) but I don't know if it has jurisdiction over condominium disputes or just landlord\\-tenant and housing code violations. [Cleveland](http://clevelandhousingcourt.org/) similarly has a division of its municipal court called housing court with similar jurisdiction that also doesn't appear to have jurisdiction over condominium disputes, just housing code violations and landlord\\-tenant disputes. There is a [housing court division](http://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/civil/realproperty/housing-court) in Superior Courts in San Francisco, California (which also seems to lack condominium dispute jurisdiction although it isn't entirely clear).\n\n*Housing Courts In Name Only*\n\nThe [City of Baltimore](http://www.baltimorehousing.org/), Maryland appears to use the term \"housing court\" more figuratively to reference to the docket of cases brought by city officials in the housing department, rather than as a true administratively distinct court.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding specialized courts for condominium disputes in English-speaking countries?\n\nA) Most English-speaking countries have dedicated condominium courts to handle disputes between co-owners.\n\nB) The United States has a federal condominium court system that handles all such disputes nationwide.\n\nC) While specialized condominium courts are rare, some jurisdictions have alternative dispute resolution programs for condominium-related issues.\n\nD) Housing courts in English-speaking countries typically have clear jurisdiction over condominium disputes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The passage indicates that specialized courts for condominium disputes are generally not present in English-speaking countries. However, it mentions that some jurisdictions have implemented alternative dispute resolution programs for condominium-related issues.

While housing courts exist in some areas, they typically do not have clear jurisdiction over condominium disputes, instead focusing on landlord-tenant issues or housing code violations.

In such cases, the finder (the store owner) has a duty to keep the item for a reasonable time, allowing the true owner (the customer) to return and claim it. Only if the true owner does not return within a reasonable time does the property become that of the premises owner (the store).

Based on events leading to his conviction under the Espionage Act, he was held in violation of the 14th amendment clause in question, and was denied his seat.\n\nBerger (and others) [appealed this conviction to SCOTUS](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/78/), who overturned it in 1921, holding the judge had an impermissible appearance of bias against the defendants. Berger then went on to win three consecutive House elections from 1922\\-1926\\. The curious bit here is that no one seemed to have any problem with his taking the seat at this point, and no vote was ever held to remove the disability the 1919 Congress had asserted (as per the 14th amendment), nor any to deny him the seat yet again.\n\nThis creates a problematic precedent for anyone looking to deny a seat already won. First is that the enforcement of the 14th amendment provision was done by Congress itself, creating the question of whether that is the only Constitutional way to remove an elected congressperson under this clause. Second is that Congress created an implicit connection between a valid criminal conviction and a 14th amendment disqualification, by simply ignoring his prior disqualification after his conviction's overturning. This is a bit tenuous, but nevertheless a potential obstacle, as [the Congressional records for the House proceedings on Berger](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6/html/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6-10.htm), a rather fascinating read, are explicit in declaring that they are operating independently of the actual criminal case and judgements.\n\nNo court has had opportunity to decide these for certain, but they provide a convenient defense for the accused. As such it is handy if you have alternative and additional paths to pursue your case under, so as to differentiate it. In Marjorie Taylor Greene's case, for example, there are explicit state laws for challenging if a candidate meets all valid legal and constitutional requirements. No such process was used, or perhaps available (I haven't tried to check this), in Berger's case. This creates a substantial legal difference, at least in principle, as it concerns disqualifying a candidate from future seats rather than denying a set to an already\\-sitting (or at least, already\\-elected, which SCOTUS has held is much the same thing) congressperson, and is utilizing a non\\-Congressional legal channel. MTG herself is challenging this law's constitutionality, I presume under the argument that in fact only Congress can effect and judge a candidate's compliance with the 14th amendment. The counter defense, presumably, would be that the case is not attempting to interfere with her currently held seat, which may conceivably be solely under Congress's control, but with potential future seats.\n\nTime constraints\n----------------\n\nFinally, as a practical matter, the few court cases we've had on denying someone a seat in Congress have all taken about the entire duration of a given Congress (2 years) to resolve. This means the case could become moot before a decision is ever finalized, and even if not the practical result would be a very small loss in the total time the accused Congressperson remains a valid and voting member. So it makes more sense to target all future candidacies instead of the presently held seat, as that will never be formally mooted short of Congressional action pursuant to the 14th amendment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the historical precedent of Victor Berger's case and its implications for modern applications of the 14th Amendment, Article 3, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding attempts to disqualify sitting members of Congress accused of participating in or supporting insurrection?\n\nA) Courts have clearly established that only Congress has the authority to remove sitting members under the 14th Amendment, Article 3.\n\nB) State laws challenging a candidate's eligibility for future elections are likely to be more successful than attempts to remove currently sitting members.\n\nC) The 14th Amendment, Article 3 can be easily applied to remove sitting members of Congress without any legal or procedural obstacles.\n\nD) Historical precedent suggests that criminal conviction is a prerequisite for invoking the 14th Amendment, Article 3 against a member of Congress.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. The case of Victor Berger created a problematic precedent for removing sitting members of Congress under the 14th Amendment, Article 3. The enforcement was done by Congress itself, raising questions about whether this is the only constitutional method. Additionally, the time required to resolve such cases often spans the duration of a congressional term, making it impractical to remove sitting members.\n\nIn contrast, state laws challenging a candidate's eligibility for future elections, as in the case of Marjorie Taylor Greene, provide an alternative legal channel that doesn't interfere with currently held seats.

The popular understanding of \"law\" is the statute, which involves Congress (at the federal level) or the legislature (and the state level). That is the kind of law that we say is \"passed\". At the federal level, some number of representatives or senators will introduce a bill into the House or Senate, and it is discussed in a relevant committee; if it is approved, it moves to debate by the whole House / Senate and if it passes it moves to the other house. Once it has passed both the House and Senate, it goes to the President where it may be signed, rejected, or ignored. If signed, it becomes \"a law\", if rejected (vetoed) it can become law anyhow if it gains a 2/3 majority vote in both houses. If the President ignores it (\"pocket veto\"), it becomes law in 10 days (Sunday is not a day), unless Congress is not in session. Oh, and, that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAt the state level, there is a similar process, with the further option of referenda and initiatives. In the former case, a particular law will have been passed by the legislature and then it is put to a popular vote for affirmation / overturning, and in the latter case a new law is proposed by the people (generally through a petitioning process) and then voted on by the populace. There is a [fair amount of variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiatives_and_referendums_in_the_United_States) on how this works and what can be done, by state.\n\nA law can be repealed (withdrawn) by passing a law that repeals a given part of the existing law, and it can be re\\-written. The Supreme Court of the jurisdiction can also withdraw a (part of a) law if it is found to be unconstitutional. No foreign body can override US law, although if the US is bound by treaty (which necessarily involves another country) then we might have to do whatever that treaty says, because we approved the treaty. One limit on what we can be forced into by treaties is that a treaty cannot violate the constitution.\n\nThe largest source of law in the US is actually not statutory, it is regulatory law, where a regulatory agency writes rules with the force of law (so really, it *is* law). In that case, there has to be a statutory basis, where at the federal level a law is passed empowering an agency to write rules, where the scope of the regulation is supposed to be related to the empowering statute in some manner. In that case, there is a vetting process, but basically no voting, just an announcement, some discussion, and eventually the rules are set. Analogous processes exist at the state level.\n\nWe also have various county and city governmental bodies, where e.g. the city council can vote to create a law; or, they can empower an agency to write regulations. \n\nYet another source of law is the Executive Order, where the president can decree that such and such will be the case (as long as it has something to do with what the executive branch does). These are somewhat limited in scope, but every president seems to like to test what that limit is.

The Connecticut law overturned in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) was Section 53-32 of the 1958 revised statutes.

Per ePD Art 6, traffic data may be used (1\\) for the purpose of the transmission/service or when the data has been anonymized, (2\\) for billing purposes, or (3\\) for marketing or value added services, when the user has given their consent. Information about the processing is only required under ePrivacy for cases (2\\) and (3\\), but not for processing that is strictly necessary.\n\nNow the tricky question is under what circumstances you can log (failed) log\\-in attempts or use tools like fail2ban. One argument is that such measures are strictly necessary to ensure the security of the communication, but these measures are evidently not necessary for performing the transmission in the sense of ePD. There are a few ways to resolve this:\n\n* necessity has to be interpreted more broadly, and security measures are indeed necessary. For example, ePD Art 6(5\\) mentions fraud detection, without authorizing it explicitly.\n* an IP address is effectively anonymized in the sense of the ePD since you do not realistically have means for linking the IP address to any particular person.\n\nThis is a fairly weak argument, but could be supported by GDPR Recital 26 which defines anonymous data.\nCounterpoint: IP addresses are online identifiers\nwhich are explicitly included in the definition of personal data in GDPR Art 4(1\\).\n* an IP address is not just traffic data that falls under the ePD,\nbut also personal data that falls under the GDPR.\nWhen the IP address is merely used to make a transmission,\nit is not processed as personal data and only ePD concerns apply.\nBut when we process it to ban the IP,\nit is processed as personal data under a legitimate interest.\nThis processing does not fall under any of the categories from ePD Art 6,\nso that only GDPR concerns apply.\nThese include a requirement to inform the data subject about the processing at the time in accordance with GDPR Art 13,\nwhich could be satisfied by displaying a link to a privacy policy in the course of the login process.\n\nFor a legitimate interest argument,\nit also depends on the expectations of the typical data subject.\nSince some security measures such as security logs are normal and should be expected, a legitimate interest argument is likely to be strong.\n\nI think this is the correct conclusion, even though the \u201cit's not traffic data, or at least doesn't fall under the ePD\u201d argument is quite weak. It hinges on the assumption that security measures are not \u201cvalue added services\u201d. This fits the intent of the ePD, but not the actual definition of value added services.\n\nIn any case, you do not need to ask for *consent* unless you're required to obtain consent e.g. under ePD Art 6(3\\) or because your processing of personal data relies on consent as the legal basis per GDPR Art 6\\.\n\nIt also has to be noted that ePD has no immediate effect, but has to be implemented by each EU member state in national law.

The ePrivacy Directive (ePD) allows for processing of traffic data, including IP addresses, when strictly necessary for providing the requested service without requiring user notification. However, when processing goes beyond basic transmission needs (e.g., for security measures like fail2ban), it may fall under GDPR jurisdiction. In this case, while explicit consent isn't required, informing users via a privacy policy could be advisable to comply with GDPR Article 13. The company can likely rely on legitimate interest for security measures, but should consider user expectations and the specific processing activities involved.

Neither approach is likely to succeed.\n\n### Because going without a mask is not recognized as \"expressive conduct,\" it is not protected by the Free Speech Clause\n\nA free\\-speech challenge would likely also fail for two reasons. As you correctly suggested, the First Amendment protects more than just speech, also protecting \"expressive conduct,\" such as flag burning, dancing, and wearing armbands. Of course, literally any conduct could have some secret expressive meaning in the mind of the person carrying out \\-\\- \"I shot him in the face to say I didn't like him\" \\-\\- so we have a question of where to draw the line between what expressive conduct does and does not receive the strong protection the First Amendment affords to speech.\n\nThe Supreme Court detailed that test in [*Texas v. Johnson*, 491 U.S. 397 (1989\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/491/397/), and it's now generally formulated as asking two questions:\n\n1. Did the speaker actually intend to convey a particularized message through his conduct?\n2. Are the people who see the conduct likely to understand that message?\n\nAt the Sturgis rally, or at the statehouse protests over COVID restrictions, or some similar event that is explicitly opposed to masks, refusing to wear a mask goes a long ways in communicating an opposition to the mask requirements.\n\nBut in the vast majority of cases, no one you run into in the normal course of daily life is likely to recognize that you are not wearing a mask because you are trying to communicate a message, let alone decipher what that message is. Do you believe that mask mandates are tyranny? That COVID\\-19 is a hoax? That life is meaningless and we should all welcome the hastening of human extinction?\n\nNone of that is clear to the average viewer, which is who the courts are going to be concerned with. Because refusing to wear a mask is generally insufficient to convey a specific message, I'd argue that it is not expressive conduct.\n\n### Because mask requirements are neutral as to religion and generally applicable, they do not violate the Free Exercise Clause.\n\nA religious challenge (\"My religion prohibits wearing masks\") is likely to fail because \"the right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a 'valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).'\" [*Employment Div. v. Smith*, 494 U.S. 872, 879 (1990\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/494/872).\n\nThis means that if the mask ban generally applies to everyone and you just happen to belong to a religion that forbids mask\\-wearing, you can't use that affiliation to escape the law's requirements. (The outcome may be different when you run the problem through the [Religious Freedom Restoration Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000bb) or state\\-level analogues, which impose more stringent tests for infringements on religious liberty.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A local government enacts a mask mandate during a pandemic.

Not wearing a mask is generally not recognized as expressive conduct protected by the Free Speech Clause. For conduct to be considered expressive, it must both intend to convey a particularized message and be likely to be understood by viewers. In most cases, not wearing a mask fails this test.\n2. A religious challenge under the Free Exercise Clause would likely fail because mask mandates are typically neutral laws of general applicability, not specifically targeting any religion.\n3.

There are three legal concerns. First, was the evidence obtained illegally? If so, it might not be admissible given the \"exclusionary rule\". The second is whether the evidence is authentic; the third is whether it is hearsay. \n\nI mainly address the legality issue, since it is the most complex. Two things could make obtaining such evidence illegal (which is possibly relevant to whether the evidence is admissible). One would be if it was obtained by gaining unauthorized access to a computer (in violation of the [Stored Communications Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-121)). Since the computers were not personal property of the employees and the accounts were not hacked into, there seems to be no violation of that law. The other way is that it might constitute \u201cillegal recording\u201d i.e. wiretapping. I will mostly cite [Texas wiretapping laws](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.16.htm#16.02), which are quite similar to federal laws.\n\nThe basic prohibition (16\\.02(b)) states\n\n> A person commits an offense if the person:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) intentionally *intercepts*, endeavors to intercept, or procures\n>  another person to intercept or endeavor to intercept a *wire, oral, or\n>  electronic communication*;\n\nThe word \u201cintercept\u201d is defined to mean\n\n> the aural or *other acquisition* of the contents of a wire, oral, or\n>  *electronic communication* through the use of an electronic, mechanical, or other device.\n\nTaking a screen shot of a message is acquisition of the content of a communication; it uses a device (a computer). So the message was intercepted, under a plain reading of the statute. (I will leave open the question of whether the \u201cinterception\u201d has to be contemporaneous with the act of communicating: there is case law about this issue alluded to in [United States v. Smith](http://openjurist.org/155/f3d/1051/united-states-v-smith), 155 F.3d 1051, but TMI).\n\nThe nature of the communication is important. A Skype text (but not a Skype voice transmission) is an electronic communication, defined as\n\n> a transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, sounds, data, or\n>  intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire,\n>  radio, electromagnetic, photoelectronic, or photo\\-optical system\n\nA Skype text is not an oral communication. This distinction is important, because the definition of \u201coral communication\u201d includes an escape clause that may allow recording. An \u201coral communication\u201d is defined as:\n\n> an oral communication uttered by a person exhibiting an expectation\n>  that the communication is not subject to interception under\n>  circumstances justifying that expectation. The term does not include\n>  an electronic communication.\n\n(where in the second instance i.e. the start of the block quote, \u201coral communication\u201d has its plain meaning). So even though the law generally forbids intercepting communication, in the case of *oral* communications, and *only* oral communications, the communication has to be made under circumstances where you would reasonably expect the communication to be private. By contrast, there is no such limit on what constitutes an electronic communication (nor a wire communication).\n\nAs noted in [this article](http://www.emilymiskel.com/blog/illegal-evidence-wiretapping-hacking-and-data-interception-laws), \u201cWire communications are protected against interception *regardless of the speaker\u2019s expectation of privacy*\u201d, citing [Briggs v. American Air Filter](http://openjurist.org/630/f2d/414/briggs-v-american-air-filter-co-inc-f-c-roby), 630 F.2d 414\\. That court reasoned that\n\n> Wire communications, unlike oral communications, are protected against\n>  interception by electronic, mechanical, and other devices regardless\n>  of the speaker's expectation of privacy. Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1\\)\n>  with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(2\\)\n\nIt is important to notice what [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510(1\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2510) actually says:\n\n> \u201cwire communication\u201d means any aural transfer made in whole or in part\n>  through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications\n>  by the aid of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point\n>  of origin and the point of reception (including the use of such\n>  connection in a switching station) furnished or operated by any person\n>  engaged in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission\n>  of interstate or foreign communications or communications affecting\n>  interstate or foreign commerce.\n\nThe court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cwire communications, unlike oral communications, are protected against interception\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that there is an *express* statement within the law saying effectively \u201ceven if you don\u2019t have a reasonable expectation of privacy, it\u2019s still not okay to intercept\u201d. Rather, that conclusion follows from the fact that there is a general prohibition against interception, plus there is no \u201cexpectation of privacy\u201d escape attached to the definition of wire communication, as there is in the case of oral communication. \n\nSo there is some merit to the argument that the message was illegally intercepted. But now we come to the \u201cso what\u201d part. There is an \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d, that evidence obtained illegally can\u2019t be used as evidence, but (quoting the article *supra*) \u201cnormal Texas law only prohibits the introduction of illegally\\-obtained evidence in criminal trials\u201d: per [Texas Code Crim. Proc. art. 38\\.23](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CR/htm/CR.38.htm).\n\n> (a) No evidence obtained by an officer or other person in violation\n>  of any provisions of the Constitution or laws of the State of Texas,\n>  or of the Constitution or laws of the United States of America, shall\n>  be admitted in evidence against the accused on the trial *of any\n>  criminal case*.\n\nYou can use illegally\\-obtained evidence in civil trials ([Baxter v. Tex. Dept. of Human Resources](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2437193/baxter-v-tex-dept-of-human-resources/), 678 S.W.2d 265, 267\\):\n\n> The exclusionary rule codified in Tex.Code Cr.P. art. 38\\.23\n>  (Supp.1984\\) is inapplicable to the present case because the Code of\n>  Criminal Procedure applies only to criminal actions, and this is a\n>  civil action arising under the Texas Family Code. Tex. Code Cr.P.Ann.\n>  art. 1\\.02 (1977\\)\n\nAlthough illegally\\-obtained evidence might admissible in a Texas civil trial, there is also an overriding exception at the federal level, whereby illegal evidence is excluded from *all* proceedings comes from the Wiretap Act, per [18 USC 2515](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2515). This states that intercepted wire or oral communications are broadly excluded:\n\n> Whenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part\n>  of the contents of such communication and no evidence derived\n>  therefrom may be received in evidence in any trial, hearing, or other\n>  proceeding in or before any court, grand jury, department, officer,\n>  agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other authority of\n>  the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof if the\n>  disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\n\nIf an oral or wire communication is intercepted, it cannot be used in a civil case (or in any other official action). But this provision does not apply to electronic communications. The reason for the omission of electronic communication from this law is that [this particular section was enacted](http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=82&page=216) in 1968, when there was no such thing as electronic communication, but \u00a72511 was amended subsequently.\n\nSo, the bottom line is, the evidence is probably admissible, if it doesn't fail on authenticity or hearsay grounds.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a civil lawsuit in Texas, a company wants to introduce as evidence screenshots of Skype text conversations between former employees discussing starting a competing business.

It does not mean that any ordinary transaction has to take place in legal tender or only within the amount denominated by the legislation.

According to the Royal Mint's Legal Tender Guidelines, commemorative coins, including \u00a320 silver coins, have legal tender status. However, to comply with the strict rules of legal tender in settling a debt in court, the debtor must offer the exact amount due, as no change can be demanded.

What laws do I break if I dismantle it? Does the owner have any civil claim against me? Assume the scooter can be reassembled.\n\nAlso assume that I have no contract with Bird. I\u2019ve never even been on their website. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What laws do I break if I dismantle it?\n\nThat is an interesting question. As far as I can see, legally the scooter would be considered **lost property**. The owner (the company Bird Rides, Inc) presumably did not put it there (some user did), and they still want it back (so it is not abandoned property).\n\nExact rules vary, but usually you must make a **reasonable effort to return the item to the owner**.\n\n---\n\nWhat exactly that means will depend on local laws. Sometimes there is an official *Lost and found* office where you can deposit or report lost property, which absolves you of further responsibility. Sometimes you may even have to make a reasonable effort to find the owner yourself.\n\nIn Minnesota specifically, probably you would have to notify the owner. Not doing so *may* constitute theft under [article 609\\.515 of the Minnesota Statutes](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.52):\n\n> 609\\.52 THEFT\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> Subd. 2\\.Acts constituting theft.\n> \n> \n> (a) Whoever does any of the following commits theft and may be sentenced as provided in subdivision 3: \n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (6\\) finds lost property and, knowing or having reasonable means of \n>  ascertaining the true owner, appropriates it to the finder's own use\n>  or to that of another not entitled thereto without first having made \n>  reasonable effort to find the owner and offer and surrender the property\n>  to the owner; or\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n\nSo you are not allowed to \"appropriate\" the scooter, without trying to contact the onwer. Just disassembling it and storing it is probably ok (but I'm not a laywer etc.).\n\nIt's not clear whether you are required to contact the owner if you don't \"appropriate\" the scooter. However, the [official recommendation of the Minneapolis Police Department](http://www.minneapolismn.gov/police/about/evidence/police_about_lost-stolen) is to do so:\n\n> Lost, Stolen and Found Property Check\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> For other found items, please take the item to the nearest Minneapolis\n>  Police Precinct and turn it in to the desk officer.\n\nSo to be on the safe side, you should probably report the scooter either to Bird Rides, Inc directly, or to your local police station.\n\n> Does the owner have any civil claim against me? Assume the scooter can be reassembled\n\nIf you do not damage the scooter in any way, then probably not. The only damage they could claim would be the cost of reassembly \\- however, a) this might be too trivial to be worth it for them, and b) you could claim you needed to disassemble it because otherwise you would not have had space to store it.\n\nAgain, to be on the safe side you should probably notify Bird Rides, Inc and ask them to collect the scooter within a certain timeframe. If you also notify them that you will disassemble the scooter if it is not collected until a certain time, I don't think they will have a claim against you later.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A Bird scooter is left on your property without your consent.

Notify them that you will disassemble it for storage if not collected by that time.\n\nC) Take the disassembled scooter parts to a local pawn shop and sell them.\n\nD) Leave the scooter where it is and ignore it, as it's not your responsibility.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B is the best course of action because it addresses several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. It recognizes the scooter as lost property and makes a reasonable effort to return it to the owner (Bird Rides, Inc.).\n2. It avoids potential theft charges by not appropriating the property without attempting to contact the owner.\n3. It provides a clear communication to the owner about your intentions to disassemble the scooter for storage, which could protect you from potential civil claims.\n4. It follows the spirit of the official recommendations to report found items.\n\nOption A could be seen as appropriating the property without making efforts to contact the owner, which could be considered theft. Option C is clearly illegal as it involves selling property that doesn't belong to you. Option D doesn't address the issue and could potentially lead to problems if the scooter causes damage or inconvenience on your property."}, "54": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42644/how-do-one-countrys-sanctions-on-another-apply-to-third-parties", "docs_id": 42644, "title": "How do one country&#39;s sanctions on another apply to third parties?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Having just read that Britain has seized a ship sailing under the flag of Panama carrying oil from Iran to Syria, I wonder what the legal basis for this is.\n\nEU sanctions forbid oil exports to Syria.

The key factor here is that the ship entered EU territorial waters (specifically UK waters), which made it subject to EU and UK laws, including the sanctions against oil exports to Syria. Even though the ship was flying a Panamanian flag and had no direct ties to the EU, its presence in EU territory gave the UK the legal authority to enforce its laws and EU sanctions. This illustrates the principle that a nation's laws apply within its territorial waters, regardless of a ship's country of origin or registration.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the ship isn't EU-registered, it became subject to EU law by entering EU waters. Option B is wrong because EU sanctions don't automatically apply in international waters. Option D is incorrect because there's no mention of Panama agreeing to enforce EU sanctions, and this wouldn't be necessary for the UK to act within its own waters."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/8472/can-my-employer-take-money-from-my-wages", "docs_id": 8472, "title": "Can my employer take money from my wages?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live and work in Ireland.

Then, it's management's decision to toss it.\n\nI imagine that the twelfth time that management has to evaluate whether a used condom is personal property or trash, they will revise their ill\\-advised little letter.\n\nAdditionally, how does the guest know for certain that an item was actually left in room, and how does management know that a particular staff was the only one who could have encountered it? They'd have to implement key card logging or video cameras. i.e. the staff could simply deny that any items were found in the room, or perhaps they could demand that a manager must clear a room of possible guest property before entering.\n\nPut simply, how to prove a particular person had access to the room and exercised that access, AND that they encountered the wayward guest item?", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the hotel's memo, which of the following actions would be the correct procedure for a hotel employee to follow when encountering a potentially valuable item left behind by a guest, but not placed in a trash bin?\n\nA) Immediately dispose of the item in the recycling bin\nB) Leave the item in the room for the next guest\nC) Take the item home for safekeeping\nD) Report the item to a supervisor and log it as lost property\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The memo clearly states that \"all items left behind by a guest which are not in the rubbish bins are checked thoroughly to ensure that they are not items of lost property.\" It further instructs that if an employee is unclear whether an item is rubbish or not, they should \"check with your supervisor or Manager, before disposal, to ensure that it doesn't contain any guest belonging or lost property.\" Additionally, the memo emphasizes that \"any lost property found is reported and logged correctly with lost property.\" Therefore, the correct procedure is to report the item to a supervisor and log it as lost property."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4822/is-there-a-legal-requirement-for-my-hosting-service-to-provide-me-with-a-copy-ba", "docs_id": 4822, "title": "Is there a legal requirement for my hosting service to provide me with a copy/backup of my content?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I have a provider hosting a forum service, and I want a copy of my forum database (actually to move to another service) is there a requirement that they must be able to provide me with my content back to me?\n\nOr if not, if the content is mine, do I have the right to scrape that forum for my data?\n\n(no, the forum isn't Stack Exchange, btw, and it's not even for me \\- the question came up in chat and we weren't sure of the answer)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It all comes down to the ToS you agreed to when you signed up with the host, or any changes made later.\n\nIf it was in your ToS it is likely that they would have a fee for the time it takes.\n\nIf it isn't mentioned then they would either refuse or request a fee as it does cost to have staff carryout work.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A small business owner, Sarah, has been using a third-party forum hosting service for her company's customer support for the past three years.
