I did so, and all was fine for 2 years. Then after a bad breakup, she stopped making payments.\n\nThe bank sent out a notice of voluntary surrender to both her and myself to be signed and sent back. I personally did not sign the form as one of the lines in the paper said \"If the property does not sell for the total amount owed, I will be responsible for the unpaid amount.\" As I took this to mean that I alone would have to pay this back. (Nowhere in the letter did it state that there were cosigners or two parties involved) She, on the other hand, did sign the paper that was sent to her and return it to the bank.\n\nSeveral months later I have received word that I, as well as her, are being sued for the rest of the amount owed on the vehicle after the sale, which comes to a total of $4800\\. As I have not signed the release and she did, is she responsible for the amount owed?

Since it seems the creditors are pursuing you both, that beats the alternative that you have to sue her to get anything.\n\nSince there is no question that money is owed, the point of the trial is to decide who pays it: it will be one or both of you, and it won't be that the bank has to take a loss. Your attorney's job is to argue that it should not be you (her attorney's job is to argue that it should be you).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As a cosigner, the individual is equally responsible for the loan, regardless of whether they signed the voluntary surrender form. The documentation states, \"When you are a loan co-signer, that means the creditor can go after you and you alone to get the money.\"\n\n2. The voluntary surrender form's signing or non-signing does not absolve either party of their responsibility to repay the loan. It merely authorizes the return of the vehicle.\n\n3. The creditor has the right to pursue both parties for repayment, as evidenced by the lawsuit against both the cosigner and the primary borrower.\n\n4. The FTC information cited in the answer indicates that cosigners are fully liable: \"The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the cosigner's liability isn't dependent on signing the surrender form. Option B is incorrect because signing the surrender form doesn't transfer full liability to the primary borrower.

The standard employment contract states that all intellectual property (IP) created during employment belongs to TechCorp. Before signing, Alice emails the HR manager expressing concern about her personal coding projects. The HR manager replies, \"Don't worry, personal projects done outside work hours won't be affected.\" Alice then signs the original contract, which includes an integration clause. Six months later, TechCorp claims ownership of a valuable app Alice developed on weekends.

The correct answer is B because the signed contract, especially with an integration clause, supersedes any prior agreements or assurances. The integration clause typically means that the written contract is the complete and final agreement between the parties, excluding any prior or contemporaneous oral or written agreements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, despite the HR manager's email, the signed contract takes precedence. The email exchange, being prior to the signing, would likely be considered parol evidence and excluded under the integration clause.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the contract likely doesn't distinguish between work done during or outside office hours. The broad IP clause would typically cover all work created during the period of employment.\n\nOption D is tempting but incorrect. While courts may sometimes consider external evidence in cases of fraud or mistake, the presence of an integration clause makes it unlikely that the court would incorporate the email exchange into the contract interpretation, especially given that Alice had the opportunity to request changes to the contract before signing.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts (contract interpretation, integration clauses, IP rights in employment) and their application to a realistic scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31855/ignorantia-juris-non-excusat-vs-defence-for-the-accused-to-prove-that-he-did", "docs_id": 31855, "title": "&quot;Ignorantia juris non excusat&quot; vs &quot;defence for the accused to prove that he did not know?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I thought that <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorantia_juris_non_excusat> is one of the core principles of the law and how it is structured.\n\nHere is a snippet from the UK law: <https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1989/41/section/97>\n\n> In any proceedings for an offence under this section it shall be a defence for the accused to prove that he did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that the published material was intended, or likely, to identify the child.\n\nThe Court order itself:\n\n> The names of the children set out in the heading of this Order and the names of the persons set out in paragraph 1 are not to be disclosed in public without the permission of the Court.\n\nMy understanding is that I cannot disclose my name, because that would identify the children.\n\nI am not talking about the Court using my legal name, I am talking about the Court using the fictitious name \"Michael Freeman\".\n\nBut if for some reason they go back and match the fictitious with my legal name then I can use the defence that I did not know? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The legal principle refers to ignorance of what the law is.

Are the two approaches applied much outside of the U.S. in other contexts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is generally held that Textualism is a kind of Originalism, which is a set of theories: these theories have something in common, which sets them apart from Minimalism or Living Constitiutionalism. The problem is that it is very difficult to establish a defining canon for Originalism, whereas Textualism is a newer development prominently associated with Scalia. There are three related theories: Original Intent, Textualism, and Original Public Understanding, subsumed under the umbrella of Originalism. The textual difficulty is finding a (somewhat) contemporary advocate of Original Intent or Public Understanding who maintains that theory in the face of Textualism, so that we can see the essential principles that distinguish the theories.\n\nSmith ([\"Why originalism won\u2019t die\u2026\"](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/djclpp/vol2/iss1/3/) says that\n\n> Originalism is the view, embraced by Antonin Scalia, Robert Bork,\n>  Clarence Thomas and many academic legal theorists, that the meaning of\n>  the Constitution should be settled by reference to the original\n>  understanding of those who enacted its provisions\n\nAs characterized by [R.G. Natelson](https://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2012/05/21/original-intent-original-understanding-original-meaning/), \n\n> The *original meaning* (or *original public meaning*) is how a\n>  reasonably intelligent, involved member of the public would have\n>  interpreted a provision. Primary evidence of original meaning is how\n>  words were used in common discourse and the definitions in\n>  contemporaneous dictionaries and legal sources. Circumstantial\n>  evidence includes the drafting and ratification conventions, public\n>  debates, and so forth.\n\nThe public meaning theory seems to have not gotten much traction, though it might be subsumed under an attempt within Original Intent theory to find evidence for that original intent. Scalia (the arch\\-Textualist) characterizes his \"opponent\" originalism (not textualists) saying \n\n> \"Originalists believe that the Constitution should be interpreted to\n>  mean exactly what it meant when it was adopted by the American\n>  people.\" (quote from Scalia AUSTIN AM.\\-STATESMAN, May 6, 2005, copied from\n>  Smith)\n\nBork (*The tempting of America*) says that under the Original Intent view, \"a judge is to apply the Constitution according to the principles *intended* by those who ratified the document\" (emphasis added)\n\nA variant sub\\-theory is strict constructionism, and in *Common\\-Law Courts in a\nCivil\\-Law System*, \nScalia cites the case of [Smith v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/508/223/), 508 U.S. 223 \nto illustrate the difference between strict construction and textualism. In this case, \ncase where defendant was said to have \nused a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking \ncrime when he offered it in exchange for cocaine.

The correct answer, C, best represents the textualist approach as described by Justice Scalia.\n\nTextualism, according to the documentation, focuses on the original public meaning of the constitutional text, rather than the intent of the framers or how the text has been interpreted over time. Scalia emphasized interpreting words \"fairly\" and reasonably, based on how they would have been understood by the public at the time of adoption.\n\nOption A represents the original intent approach, which Scalia explicitly rejected. It focuses on the personal intentions of the framers rather than the public meaning of the text.\n\nOption B aligns more closely with the \"Living Constitutionalism\" approach, which adapts interpretations to modern contexts, contrary to textualist principles.\n\nOption D represents strict constructionism, which Scalia distinguished from textualism. He argued for reasonable, not strict, interpretation of text.\n\nOption C, however, aligns with Scalia's textualist approach by examining contemporary sources to understand the public meaning of constitutional language at the time it was adopted. This method seeks to interpret the Constitution based on how a \"reasonably intelligent, involved member of the public would have interpreted a provision\" at the time, using evidence such as common discourse and contemporaneous dictionaries.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of complex concepts, integrating multiple ideas from the documentation, and distinguishing between similar but distinct approaches to constitutional interpretation."}, "5": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70381/is-it-possible-for-someone-with-juvenile-felony-charge-not-conviction-to-join", "docs_id": 70381, "title": "Is it possible for someone with juvenile felony charge (not conviction) to join the military?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If someone were charged with a felony in the US (e.g. sexual assault, harassment, or murder) as a juvenile, but they're not convicted (their case or the charges were dropped), can they join the military after they turn 18?

That means the minor or their guardian can at any time void the contract (in other words, the contract doesn't exist anymore); until that happens, the contract is perfectly valid. \n\nYour friend, assuming he or she is an adult, cannot void the contract. The contract is valid until you or your guardian changes their mind about it. For your friend, the contract is binding. For you, it's not binding as soon as you decide that you don't want the contract. \n\nAs Dale said, minors or their guardians can void a contract until the minor isn't a minor anymore (and for a reasonable short time afterwards). \n\nSo if *you* are a minor, that shouldn't stop you from entering the contract. Of course you should make sure that you fully understand the contract; you get protection by the law because the law assumes that you might not fully understand the consequences of the contract and get ripped off as an unexperienced person. \n\nIf your friend is a minor, you need to determine how much you trust your friend, how much he behaves like an adult, and what's the worst that can happen. For example if you inherited $50,000 and invest it all in the business, the worst that can happen could be that you lose it all. On the other hand, if you only invest your hard work to get the business up and running, worst case is that you lose the work that you invested. \n\nOf course if it is a person that cannot be trusted, then it doesn't matter how old they are, because they cannot be trusted.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: Two 16-year-old friends, Alex and Sam, are starting a tech company together.

The correct answer is B because having parents co-sign the agreement as legal guardians provides the strongest legal protection for both parties.\n\nThe documentation states that contracts signed by minors are voidable, not invalid. This means that either minor or their guardian can void the contract at any time until the minor comes of age (and for a short time after). By having parents co-sign as legal guardians, the agreement becomes binding for the adults involved, reducing the risk of the contract being voided on a whim by either minor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a clause preventing voiding until age 18 would likely not be enforceable, as it goes against the legal protections afforded to minors.\n\nOption C, while potentially valid, doesn't provide immediate protection for their current work and could leave their interests vulnerable in the interim.\n\nOption D is incorrect because verbal agreements do not provide stronger protection than written ones, especially for complex business arrangements.\n\nThis question tests the application of legal concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking about the best way to protect both parties' interests while working within the constraints of contract law as it applies to minors."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/73955/is-it-legal-to-run-console-nintendo-games-on-an-emulator-if-one-has-an-origina", "docs_id": 73955, "title": "Is it legal to run console (Nintendo) games on an emulator if one has an original copy of these games?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: It is often believed (and spread) that:\n\n* Emulators of video game consoles are not illegal;\n* Downloading proprietary games for such consoles and/or running them on emulators is illegal, except\n\t+ if one already has original copies (cadridges, nintendo game cards, etc) of all games one wishes to download and/or run on an emulator\n\t\t- in which case one doesn't even need to have the console on which the game was intended to run.\n\nHowever:\n\nMany fan sites of Nintendo games ban discussion about emulators at all.

If I have two database tables, both encrypted.\n\nOne table is globally available and contains user sessions. For the sake of conversation assume that globally means it's physically hosted in countries that EU might now deem equivalent in terms of protection. It holds no PII, just session status and expiry time. It also holds a user UUID that's been randomly generated but is tied to the lifespan of the user i.e. once assigned to a user it does not change.\n\nThe other table is physically hosted in EU, and holds a UUID to email mapping.\n\nIf a breach results in the first table being leaked the data is anonymous, it is only when joined with the second that that the user session can be tied to PII (email address).\n\nDoes this mean that both tables fall under GDPR and thus must be placed in EU (or equivalent), or is it sufficient that only the table containing PII is located there?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The way you describe this UUID, it is **pseudonymous** data (see [GDPR Art 4(5\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) and Recitals [28](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-28/)\u2013[29](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-29/)). That is, it is not directly identifying, but you have a mapping between pseudonyms and identifiers that can be used to re\\-identify this data. Effective pseudonymisation requires not only that the data is logically separate, but that there are effective organisational and technical measures preventing re\\-combination by unauthorized persons. Alongside with encryption, pseudonymisation is one of the safety measures that the GDPR explicitly requires whenever appropriate (see Art 25, Art 32\\).\n\nPseudonymous data is still personal data, because you can easily re\\-identify the data. The PII concept is US\\-specific and is misleading in a GDPR context, where it is not the inherently identifying characteristics of the information that matters, but the realistic ability of the data controller to single out data subjects to whom this data relates (compare Art 4(1\\) and Recital 26\\).\n\nHowever, were you to irrevocably erase the UUID\u2013email mapping, things are more tricky. There is no longer any connection with directly identifying data, so this data might be anonymous. On the other hand, such a persistent UUID still allows you to recognize/distinguish persons, so it might still be personal data. This might be the case especially when the UUID is used in long\\-lived cookies of website visitors, thus matching the GDPR's concept of an \u201conline identifier\u201d. This conclusion could be avoided by limiting reuse of UUIDs, e.g. creating a new UUID after some context\\-dependent appropriate duration.\n\nThe GDPR does not require all data to be stored in the EU, but requires international transfers of personal data to have sufficient protections. If you're processing these data in countries without adequate legal protections (like the United States), additional safeguards have to be used. Pseudonymisation could be part of such safeguards, and has been suggested by some data protection authorities in the wake of the Schrems II ruling. However, pseudonymisation alone does not make the international transfer legal, it is more of a strategy to reduce remaining risks.\n\nI think that your systems has a good chance of being OK, but not neccessarily so. If in doubt, perform a DPIA and possibly consult your data protection authority under GDPR Art 36\\. If feasible, storing/processing data only in the EEA or in countries with an [adequacy decision](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_enk) will simplify compliance.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. As the top answer states, \"The fact that you have been laid off is both your company's information, and your personal information. You are allowed to tell your own personal information.\" This suggests that disclosing the termination itself is not necessarily a breach of confidentiality.\n\n2. However, the answer also notes, \"As long as you are still employed your employment contract will probably say that you mustn't do anything to damage the company.\" This implies that while still employed, the developer may have violated their employment contract by disclosing information about the merger and the company's plans to move development to an external partner.\n\n3. Option A is too severe, as the disclosure of personal job status is generally allowed, and the legal consequences would depend on specific contract terms and the extent of the disclosure.\n\n4. Option C is incorrect because shareholders do not have unlimited rights to disclose company information, especially sensitive information about mergers or strategic decisions.\n\n5.

But to have equations, explanations, replica of figures, and discussion, would basically be a copy of the paper, and I imagine that would be copyright infringement. Where exactly can a line be drawn?\n\nNote: There are questions on stack exchange which ask similar questions, but often in context of building up on previous research. Since the point of such a journal is just to replicate, it would seems that the aim is to build a freely available copy of the existing (perhaps paywalled, copyrighted) material, that can be freely accessed, and this is different intent than regular articles.\n\nAlso, answers regarding plagiarism aren't much help in this case as the point is to do \"explicit plagiarism\" with proper attribution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright protection exists for the (typeset) image of an equation, so you have to recreate the equation (the final output could be indistinguishable from the original when the object is created automatically by a program and you happen to use the same program). Figures may enjoy a more protection, since they involve both the facts reported and the means of expression (rows and columns, order, subgroup, labels). Explanations and discussion (I don't know what distinction you're getting at there) are text from the original article,and those are indeed protected by copyright, which is moderated by the \"fair use\" exception. There are various claims out there about how much you can quote with the confines of fair use, but nobody really know in the academic context (as far as I know, there is no case law in the US that tests how much quoting you can do in an academic journal).

But, they can be successfully sued for enforcing immigration laws when they do not have the legal authority to do so, and usually, state and local government officials do not have the legal authority to enforce federal immigration laws. (State and local governments are also generally prohibited from enacting state or local laws pertaining to someone's immigration status.)\n\nIn general, the only people with the authority to detain someone for violating immigration laws are immigration officers employed by the federal government. They have absolute discretion in how they enforce federal immigration laws and are free to systematically or on a case by case basis choose not to enforce those laws, as are the executive branch politicians to whom they report. \n\nOne of the main reasons that state and local officials cannot enforce immigration laws is that this would interfere with this exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government over immigration and with the absolute discretion of federal officials to decline to enforce the immigration laws or to enforce immigration laws merely on a selective basis.\n\nState and local officials have authority in this regard only if they are expressly authorized to do so by law, and then, only if the state or local government chooses to cooperate by allowing their officials to be used for that purpose. \n\nGenerally speaking, the federal government authorizes state and local jail administrators to detain someone pursuant to an immigration hold if the state and local government authorizes the jail to do so. But, usually state and local officials do not have the authority to arrest someone solely for being in the U.S. without having a valid and current immigration status. This authority is largely reserved to Homeland Security officials, although FBI agents in the Justice Department probably also have this authority.\n\nIn contrast, generally speaking, someone detained by a state and local law enforcement officer who enforces a federal immigration law, despite not having the legal authority to do so, could prevail in a lawsuit against the state or local law enforcement officer for violating the civil rights of a person detained by someone who had no legal authority to do so. Such suits have prevailed repeatedly in Phoenix, Arizona where a rogue sheriff attempted to enforce federal immigration laws despite not having the legal authority to do so.\n\nThus, the assumption that the kind of actions involved, for example, in \"sanctuary city\" policies are intentional violations of immigration law is ill\\-founded (violating a mere \"policy\" that is not actually a law is by definition never illegal). Generally speaking, there are no immigration laws violated. \n\nA \"coyote\" is intentionally violating an immigration law as is someone sneaking over the border when not legally authorized to do so. Someone who doesn't participate in the act of illegal entry, and who does not violate federal employment laws related to immigration (basically requiring an I\\-9 to be filled out and filed with the federal government), is violating no law.\n\nAs a matter of constitutional law, the federal government does not have have the constitutional authority to compel state and local government officials to enforce federal law (although it can authorize and \"bribe\" state and local governments to do so). Subject to applicable state law, for example, a city government has every right to declare itself a \"sanctuary city\" and refrain from actively assisting the federal government's enforcement of federal immigration laws.\n\nAlso, politicians and state and local prosecutors are absolutely immune from legal liability in connection with performance of their official duties, and law enforcement officers have qualified immunity for their acts. \n\nIn particular, law enforcement and prosecutors have essentially absolute discretion to refrain from choosing to enforce any law, and their politician bosses have broad authority to direct how they will exercise this discretion. For example, in general, even if a prosecutor and law enforcement know to an absolute certainty that someone is a serial killer, and can effortlessly arrest that person without any risk of harm to anyone and at minimal expense, they have no enforceable legal duty under U.S. law to try to arrest that person or prosecute that person for any crime. Failing to enforce a known violation of the law is not a crime (unless the failure to enforce is caused by a bribe).\n\nMany millions of people who reside in the United States are deportable but have not committed any crime, so rendering assistance to someone is deportable is not *per se* assisting someone in the commission of a crime, even after the fact, and indeed, many public officials have a legal duty to aid all \"persons\" in protecting their legal rights, including people who are deportable.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A city council member in a \"sanctuary city\" is advocating for a new local ordinance that would require law enforcement to actively assist federal immigration officers in identifying and detaining undocumented immigrants.

I am particularly interested in whether Disney/Marvel, Nintendo and Studio Ghibli accept this. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You can freely make any patterns of your own invention: I assume you are asking if you can distribute patterns that are based on other people's products, such as Disney. For example one could crochet potholders with the image of a Little Einstein character. This is generally not possible without the permission of the design's creator (or whoever owns the copyright). There is a widespread belief that non\\-commercial exploitation is allowed, under a \"[fair use](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info)\" analysis: this is only true to a miniscule degree. If you copy without permission, you may be sued, and your attorney could try to raise a fair use defense. One of the factors allowing exploitation is the commercial nature of the use (where a non\\-commercial exploitation would be more consistent with \"fair use\"). Another factor is the \"transformative\" nature of an exploitation, meaning that the more you change the original, the better off you are. Probably working against you would be \"effect on market\", since offering something for free is likely to negatively affect the rights\\-holder's market share. Even if a rights holder does not currently sell a particular version of a product, such as a PDF version of a book, they might potentially wish to exploit a market. Even if there is no current Little Einstein crocheted potholder, your product would clearly have a huge impact on that potential market. Also working against you would be the amount and substantiality of the copying. In text copying, you can usually copy a short paragraph from a book, whereas the designs you are likely to put out there would be pretty much the whole thing.\n\nCounting on a fair use defense is pretty risky, unless it is based on one of the two fairly clearly established types of use (text copying of short illustrative quotes to prove / exemplify a point, and private\\-use copying of 40 pages or less of a publication). As far as I know, Disney is very protective of their property rights. The best way to determine if a particular use is allowed is to describe the use and formally request permission from the rights\\-holder. If they say \"No, absolutely not\", that would be a reason to ask your lawyer if s/he thought that you could mount a fair use defense against infringement.\n\nAnother issue to consider is whether the design enjoys protection as a trademark. Unlike copyright, trademark is not automatic, but you can search the [US trademark database](https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-application-process/search-trademark-database), though actually finding things is not trivial. In US law, there are two types of fair use defenses for trademark infringement. One is \"descriptive\" use, which address the fact that Apple computer company has a registered trademark on \"Apple\", but that doesn't mean that grocery stores have to start calling the tree fruit \"pomme\". Conceivably, some company might register a drawing of a quarter moon as a trademark, but that does not mean that nobody can then use a quarter moon as a graphic element. When someone uses an existing image / design as a trademark, they have much less control over use of that design. Little Einstein Leo would be totally outside the realm of descriptive fair use.\n\nThe other version is \"nominative\" fair use, where you are referring to the product, using only as much of the trademark as is needed to identify the thing, and not implying endorsement by the trademark owner. I could refer to Boeing, the airplane maker, as \"that plane maker with facilities in Renton\", or I could use their trademark. But using their circle\\-swoop\\-plane graphic would be beyond nominative fair use. What you are describing is well beyond any fair use concepts for trademarks in the US.

But here the roundabout is entirely filled with cars (those of the other drivers participating in the scheme).

The correct answer is C (70 mph) for the following reasons:\n\n1. The road is described as a farm-to-market road, which falls under Texas Transportation Code Section 545.352(b)(2).\n2. It's considered to be outside an urban district with few driveways, which aligns with the conditions for the 70 mph limit on numbered highways.\n3. The old speed limit signs have been removed, and no new signs are posted. This negates the enforceability of the previous 55 mph limit or any town ordinance, as drivers cannot reasonably be expected to know about unpublished local regulations.\n4.

A reasonable person would look for signs of an urban area or speed limit changes and, finding none, would assume the standard highway speed limit applies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the 30 mph urban limit doesn't apply to highways or areas outside urban districts. Option B is a distractor based on the police's claim, but it's not legally enforceable without posted signs.

We can only address questions about the general nature of law, etc. The caveat out of the way, the first question is whether financial aid is \"compensation\". [MS\u00a725\\-4\\-3(e)](http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2015/title-25/chapter-4/article-1/section-25-4-3/) in article on the Ethics Commission defines the term:\n\n> \"Compensation\" means money or thing of value received, or to be\n>  received, from any person for services rendered or to be rendered\n\nStudent aid is not necessarily compensation, but it might be. One form that it can take is as a loan, or as a grant: that is not a thing of value for services rendered. But another is e.g. work\\-study, which is employment, where you do some work and are paid for it \u2013 that is compensation. So it depends on the facts. \n\nThe other question is whether (if the aid was in the form of employment) the employer got the money to pay you from a public body. There is not a clearly applicable definition of \"public body\" in the ethics statutes. [\u00a731\\-7\\-301](http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2013/title-31/chapter-7/timely-payment-for-purchases-by-public-bodies/section-31-7-301) defines \"public bodies\"\n\n> The term \"public bodies\" shall mean all state agencies, political\n>  subdivisions, school districts, municipalities and public\n>  corporations, whether created by charter, statute or executive order,\n>  whether supported wholly or in part by public funds, or which expend\n>  public funds.\n\nThis, though, is in an unrelated section about timely payment for purchases by public bodies. The Public Records law [\u00a7 25\\-61\\-3](http://law.justia.com/codes/mississippi/2013/title-25/chapter-61/section-25-61-3) defines a public body as\n\n> any department, bureau, division, council, commission, committee,\n>  subcommittee, board, agency and any other entity of the state or a\n>  political subdivision thereof, and any municipal corporation and any\n>  other entity created by the Constitution or by law, executive order,\n>  ordinance or resolution.\n\nThe wording is different, but there isn't a clear difference in terms of what things are covered by one definition versus another. In case you worked for a committee that was created by a city council resolution, that would not obviously be covered by first definition, but it is clearly included by the second; the first definition ties \"public body\" to public funds but the second doesn't. It is therefore difficult to tell what the law says, when the law doesn't actually give a uniform definition of the term. In case of doubt, include everything.\n\nFurther supporting an expansive legislative intent is the definition of \"public servant\" as an elected or appointed official of the government (pretty normal) and also\n\n> Any officer, director, commissioner, supervisor, chief, head, agent or\n>  employee of the government or any agency thereof, or of any public\n>  entity created by or under the laws of the State of Mississippi or\n>  created by an agency or governmental entity thereof, any of which is\n>  funded by public funds or which expends, authorizes or recommends the\n>  use of public funds; or\n> \n> \n> Any individual who receives a salary, per diem or expenses paid in\n>  whole or in part out of funds authorized to be expended by the\n>  government.\n\nIn other words, if the money can be traceable back to a governmental unit, that is probably considered to be a \"public body\". Also, \"public employee\" is defined as:\n\n> any individual who receives a salary, per diem or expenses paid in\n>  whole or in part out of funds authorized to be expended by the\n>  Mississippi State Legislature or by the governing body of any\n>  political subdivision thereof, or any other body politic within the\n>  State of Mississippi\n\nFor example, if I happen to give a lecture, not even in Mississippi, and part of my expenses are paid in part by U. Miss, then I am a \"public employee\" \u2013 not the ordinary interpretation of the term, but they can define terms as they want. \n\nThe really tricky part is that the payment does not have to be directly from a public body.

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The question asks for compensation received \"directly or indirectly\" from public bodies. This broad definition captures both direct payments (like the work-study) and indirect payments (like the spouse's job at a company funded by public money).\n\n2. The definition of \"public body\" in Mississippi law is expansive and includes entities that expend public funds. The private company, being 60% funded by state grants, would likely fall under this definition.\n\n3. The ethics laws define \"public employee\" very broadly, including anyone who receives salary paid in whole or part out of funds authorized to be expended by any governmental body. This would apply to both the spouse and the adult child.\n\n4. The question specifically asks about compensation received by the candidate, spouse, and any person over 21 residing in the household.

The basic idea is that on an issue of public concern, an honest opinion isn't defamatory unless it makes a reasonable listener think the speaker knows something that is in fact not true (the classic example is \"In my opinion, Jones is a liar:\" here the speaker implies he knows that Jones lied, which is a statement of fact that can be true or false).\n\nIn your example, there are questions that have to be reached before fair comment even enters into it. First off, in US law *any* defamation claim has to be for a statement that a reasonable person would interpret as being a statement of fact or (if it's an opinion) implying a statement of fact (like \"I think Jones is a liar\"). This is context\\-dependent. \"I wouldn't let my child be alone with someone like *famous convicted pedophile 1*, *famous convicted pedophile 2*, or *politician*\" is more likely to be read as \"*politician* is a pedophile.\" A marked work of fiction is unlikely to be read as a statement of fact. If the statement is read as a simple opinion, or as pure fiction, there's no defamation under US law.\n\nOnce we've established that an express or implied statement of fact is at issue, fair comment asks whether the fact is true or false and whether it's an issue of public concern. But in the US, with a politician, you'd never go for the fair comment defense, because you have a much stronger defense \\-\\- a politician can only win the suit if they show that not only is the statement false, but the speaker actually knew or strongly suspected that it was false. It's not enough that a reasonable person would suspect it's false; it has to reach the level of recklessness, which is *extremely* hard to show (public figures in the US do not often win defamation suits). This is strictly easier than for fair comment.\n\nIf the politician wasn't a politician, and was actually a private figure, then fair comment could enter into it. In that case, the question is whether the statement is a reasonable opinion drawn from the (true) facts that lots of people didn't want their daughters alone with the person.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications and potential defenses in this scenario?\n\nA) The novelist can claim fair comment as a defense, regardless of the politician's status as a public figure.\n\nB) The case will likely be dismissed as the work is clearly labeled as fiction and thus cannot be considered defamatory.\n\nC) The politician must prove actual malice to win the case, making it extremely difficult to succeed in the defamation suit.\n\nD) The novelist can be held liable for defamation if the politician can prove the statement is false, regardless of intent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because the scenario involves a politician, who is considered a public figure. In U.S. law, public figures face a much higher bar when pursuing defamation claims. They must prove \"actual malice,\" meaning the defendant (in this case, the novelist) knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while fair comment could be a potential defense, it's not the strongest or most relevant defense in this case given the politician's status as a public figure. The actual malice standard provides a much stronger protection for the novelist.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while fiction is generally protected, it's an oversimplification to say the case would automatically be dismissed. If the work could reasonably be interpreted as implying factual statements about the politician, it could still potentially be considered defamatory.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it doesn't account for the politician's status as a public figure.

In those comments I claimed that the estate of a deceased person is not a legal entity and that it is the personal representatives (executors if testate, administrators if intestate) who hold legal title to the assets of the estate and can sue and be sued in relation to those assets. That assertion was challenged by several people, which leads me to wonder if this is something which varies by jurisdiction.\n\nTo avoid any confusion, I'm taking \"legal entity\" to mean an entity which can hold legal title to an asset and be named as a party to a lawsuit in relation to that asset. There was some talk in the discussion about entities being *represented* in court by a natural person, but I do not consider that the same as being the person named as the party. So e.g. an assertion that \"*to sue for the assets in an estate, you sue the executor*\" would suggest that an estate is *not* a legal entity, while \"*to sue for the assets in an estate, you sue the estate itself which is then represented in court by the executor*\" would suggest that it *is* a legal entity.\n\n**Is the estate of a deceased person a legal entity?**\n\nGiven the level of disagreement, I'd prefer if possible to see jurisdiction tags and citations of which at least one is an authoritative legal source (ideally primary sources such as legislation or precedents, but secondary sources such as legal textbooks, journal articles, or practice notes aimed at practitioners would suffice).\n\nIt was pointed out that the IRS refers to an estate as a legal entity but my research indicates that carries a different meaning to the legal one and is relevant only in the context of federal tax filings. If intending to cite the IRS I'd be grateful if this could be backed up with a legal source to show that their use of \"legal entity\" carries the same meaning as the one defined above.\n\nI will self\\-answer to provide some citations which I believe support my proposition.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Good news: it behaves *like* a legal entity.\n--------------------------------------------\n\nAn estate is a collection of assets and liabilities that belonged to the deceased. The collection behaves a great deal like an LLC or other legal entity, *although states don't call it that*.\n\n* The collection is isolated from anyone else's collection of assets and liabilities. For instance, it's not part of the executor's personal assets, nor liabilities. That's very important because...\n* If the collection is *sued* e.g. by a creditor, the suit can only make claims against assets in the \"collection\". That is to say, the executor's own assets are not at risk. **That's very important if you're thinking about volunteering to become an executor or manager of a trust. You can do so without fear of personal liability**. Asterisk here \\*, but don't panic, it's a harmless asterisk.\n* The collection can buy and sell goods and services (more the latter generally). A typical service purchased by an estate is storage unit rental.\n* The collection can hire, fire and generally do business. Consider an estate which owns an apartment building. Life goes on: rent must be collected, utilities paid, leaky toilets fixed, contractors and managers hired and fired. In this case, the estate is *a going\\-concern business* behaving a lot like an LLC.\n* The collection/estate could potentially do business *indefinitely*, if the will of the heirs is to continue doing so. This might happen if splitting the assets equitably amongst the heirs wasn't possible (e.g. the estate of Leonard Cohen collects a lot of royalties)... or too complex to easily back out of (say: the deceased owned 5 McDonalds franchises and had bet the farm on opening two more; backing out now would bankrupt the estate, so the estate might oddly open two McDonalds.)\n* The collection can also sue, and proceeds from the suit or settlement go into the collection. Asterisk again. \\*\n* The collection has its own Taxpayer Identification Number (aka SSN or EIN).\n* The collection files its own 1040 tax form, and may do so for years or even decades.\n\n### The point of all these practical examples is that an estate *looks, walks and quacks* like a \"legal entity\". To the point where the IRS even calls it one.\n\nAnd to a boots\\-on\\-ground executor, manager or trustee, the reality is it handles like a legal entity, and the experience you have managing legal entities will largely apply, almost in full. Almost.\n\n\\* Now, that asterisk. Due to state court rules in many states, if you attempt to sue an estate, you have to use the right name. *And that's what this question is all about.*\n\nIt's a naming convention, and that is all.\n------------------------------------------\n\nAnd courts treat it as such.\n\nTake *Roe v. Wade*. \"Roe\" is an adaption of \"Doe\" as in \"John Doe\". Wade, however, was the district attorney of Dallas County at the time of filing. Wade wasn't being sued *personally*. It's just the quirky naming convention the court uses.\n\nWhat you have identified is a similar quirk in court rules, where instead of suing\n\n* Estate of John Q. Example,\n\nthe syntactically correct thing is to sue\n\n* Jane Doe, *in the capacity of, Executor of John Q Example's estate*.\n\nAnd the italic parts are optional, because the court knows that.\n\nWhy is this important?\n\nIt's not important, and that's what the Florida Court of Appeals said in [florida](/questions/tagged/florida \"show questions tagged 'florida'\") [Spradley v Spradley 213 So. 3d 1042 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2017](https://casetext.com/case/spradley-v-spradley-5). The plaintiff had made exactly the above error: suing \"the estate of\" instead of suing \"Derreck Spradley et.al. (implied: in their capacity as executor)\". The judge threw out the case, saying in essence \"You forgot to \"dot an i\". The appeals court said no, the distinction is trivial and the court should have simply let the brother \"dot their i\" and continue with an entirely valid case.\n\nIn other words, **it was a distinction without a difference**.\n\nSo if sued, the executor should not panic about being \"named personally\" in the suit \\- you're not personally liable. And it is a waste of time to pick nits over how the name of the defendant is spelled, so says the Florida court at least... and in my humble opinion that precedent would be well received in other state courts, as it avoids wasting docket time and citizen filing fees on an action that will simply be re\\-filed correctly the next day.\n\nNot a license to cheat, however.\n--------------------------------\n\nOne way an executor *can* manage to create personal liability is to abuse or mishandle the role with extreme negligence.

The estate can hold assets, conduct business, file taxes, and be involved in legal proceedings. However, there's a crucial distinction in how lawsuits are formally filed. \n\nThe Florida case Spradley v Spradley 213 So. 3d 1042 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2017) illustrates that while it's common to refer to suing \"the estate,\" the technically correct legal procedure is often to name the executor \"in the capacity of Executor of [deceased's] estate.\" This naming convention is treated as a formality by courts, with the Florida Court of Appeals ruling it a \"distinction without a difference.\"\n\nThe estate behaves like a legal entity in that it:\n1. Has isolated assets and liabilities\n2. Can be sued (though with specific naming conventions)\n3. Can conduct business transactions\n4.

This nuanced status makes option B the most accurate reflection of the estate's legal and practical standing.

In fact, the government owes me a $500 rebate.).\n\nAll 501(c) organizations (there are 29 different classifications) have rules about what they may and may not do and will lose their tax\\-exempt status if they fail to abide by those rules.

Is this the case in the whole of Canada?\n\nSubject to an exception for holographic wills (in all but one Canadian province) and choice of law issues, yes.\n\n**Ordinary Written Wills And Witnessing Irregularities In Them**\n\nA will does not need to be notarized to be valid, although the notarization makes the admission of the will to probate (i.e. the court process of determining that a will is legally valid) easier.\n\nA will with one witness that is notarized by a separate person still meets this requirement, however.\n\nSome people are not eligible to witness a will. So, if a will is signed by the testator and two witnesses, but one of the witnesses is ineligible to serve as a witness (e.g. because the witness is 7 years old, or has certain prohibited conflicts of interest), there is a problem.\n\nBut, I don't know what remedy would be applied in each province. Some jurisdictions allow a witness who was ineligible at the time and is not ineligible to be a witness at the time of death to testify and cure the defect. Some jurisdictions invalidate the will. Some jurisdictions, for example, in a case where someone not allowed to be a witness due to a conflict of interest witnessed the will, validate the will but void the rights of the ineligible witness under the will.\n\n**Other Irregularities In Written Wills**\n\nSome U.S. jurisdictions (including Colorado) and some jurisdictions in Australia, recognize the validity of the will that have immaterially defective formalities that were signed with an intent to be a will and have two witnesses.\n\nFor example, these jurisdictions might validate wills when the wife accidentally signed the husband's will and the husband accidentally signed the wife's will, both intending to sign their own will, or where \"magic words\" are missing from the execution clause or notarization, or where the testator's name is spelled inconsistently or incorrectly.\n\nOntario is a strict compliance jurisdiction. Any inconsistency with the formal requirements, as set out in the *Succession Law Reform Act*, renders a will invalid.\n\nI do not know if any other Canadian provinces have a legal authorization to remedy or reform such an inadvertent error in the formal execution of a will. I suspect that some do, either by statute or case law, but don't know and don't have a good source for finding out.\n\n**Holographic Wills**\n\nA will written substantially in the handwriting of the testator (i.e. of the person making their will) and signed by the testator, also known as a holographic will, is valid in most, but not all, Canadian provinces. Some jurisdictions honor oral wills in the hand writing of the testator, even without a signature, if the text makes clear that the testator is making a will for himself or herself.\n\nThe provinces that consider handwritten wills legal are Alberta, Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and Saskatchewan.\n\nHolographic wills are not recognized in the province of British Columbia. But if the will was written outside British Columbia and the concerned property is within BC, then the will can be upheld by the court.\n\n**Will Contracts**\n\nEven if a document is not itself a holographic will because it lacks language clearly intending to make it one itself and instead merely promises to make a will with certain provisions, a typed writing signed by someone who late dies can sometimes be interpreted as a valid contract to make a will that is enforceable in that fashion, even thought it is not itself enforceable as a valid will.\n\n**Oral Wills**\n\nNo Canadian provinces recognize the validity of oral wills (also known as nuncupative wills), that are recognized as valid under some circumstances in other common law jurisdictions.\n\nAny will not printed out in writing is an oral will, even if it is in a typewritten record in electronic form, and even if it has an electronic signature.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nA typewritten will merely signed by the testator, and not witnesses by two witnesses (perhaps with just one witness or no witnesses), or not printed out at all, would generally be invalid.\n\n**Choice of Law Exceptions**\n\nThere is also a choice of law issue. Usually a will which is valid where entered into is valid elsewhere even if it does not meet the formal requirements of the place where it is admitted to probate at the time it is admitted to probate. This is why a holographic will executed outside of BC is valid in BC (even as to BC property) even though BC does not recognize holographic wills.\n\nMost jurisdictions with common law legal systems also require that a will be in a writing signed by the testator and witnesses by two witnesses, so usually, it doesn't matter where the will was signed.\n\nBut, for example, Colorado has recently adopted a law authorizing certain will to be valid without being printed out, but to the best of my knowledge, no Canadian province has adopted legislation to this effect.\n\nSo, if you executed an electronic will in Colorado under circumstances where it would be valid in Colorado, a Canadian court might recognize it even though it doesn't meet the standards for a valid will executed in Canada.\n\nSimilarly, if an oral will was valid where it was made, but invalid in Canada, a Canadian court might still honor it.\n\n**Exceptions For Will Substitutes**\n\nAlso note that while a will must always be in writing in Canada, there are circumstances when a trust may be established orally and without witnesses other than the person entrusted with assets.\n\nAlso, some beneficiary designations on bank accounts and insurance policies and retirement policies and transfer on death deeds, for example, that function as *will substitutes*, are not held to the formal requirements of a will, even though they dispose of property upon death just as a will does. These are usually valid if signed by the person making the designation and delivered to a third\\-party associates with the asset (or noted in real property records in the case of real property) prior to the death of the person making them.\n\n**Lost Wills**\n\nUnlike most legal documents, generally, a will is like a $20 bill, a photocopy or scanned copy is not as good as the real thing. Sometimes documents like this are called \"real documents\" or \"real instruments.\" (Original promissory notes have the same character because they can be transferred to a new owner by endorsement of the original physical promissory note.)\n\nThis rule exists because, at common law and under the law still in force today in Canada and most common law jurisdictions, a will can be revoked by physically destroying or defacing the original with an intent to revoke it.\n\nBut, in the event that an original will is destroyed by fire or other disaster or malfeasance of a third party under circumstances that indicate that there was no intent to revoke it by the testator, the will can be admitted to probate based upon a paper or electronic copy of the original with adequate testimony regarding the unavailability of the original will.\n\n**Grounds For Contesting Facially Valid Wills and Will Substitutes**\n\nA will or will substitute that meets the formal requirements for a will or will substitute may still be invalidated, in whole or in part.\n\nThe most common grounds for doing so are:\n\n* undue influence on the testator by a beneficiary of the instrument,\n* lack of testamentary capacity which invalidates the instrument,\n* inauthentic signatures that invalidate a will (i.e. a forged instrument),\n* fraud in the inducement of the instrument,\n* a benefit conveyed by the instrument to someone who subsequently slays the decedent which is rendered void by operation of law,\n* a gift in favor of someone who subsequently divorced the decedent which is rendered void by operation of law,\n* unintentionally failing to provide for a child living at the time of death which results in an implied in law gift to that child,\n* partial invalidity for failing to make adequate provision for a surviving spouse, or\n* full or partial invalidity for failing to honor a valid contract or court order to make a will with specific provisions.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A Canadian resident, living in Ontario, creates a will using an online service.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Copyright infringement typically requires a substantial reproduction of the original work. In this case, the modifications to the ship's design and the addition of unique elements may be enough to avoid copyright infringement, especially if the overall impression is distinct from the original.\n\n2. However, trademark law protects against the use of similar marks that could cause confusion in the marketplace.

(in an parallel: does using \"you're a wizard, Harry!\" to teach English pronunciation infringe H.P. copyright?)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Applicability of trademark laws\n-------------------------------\n\nTrademark laws apply when you intend to use a word as the name of a brand, make, model, or otherwise the identifier of what you intend to sell. In addition, trademarks are registered within a bound domain and do not impact anything outside it. For example:\n\n* There are two Apple trademarks: One for Apple Inc., the notorious American company that sells iPhone and Mac. The other is a record label.\n* The Metro Inc. from Canada and the Metro AG from Germany cannot sue Microsoft for trademarking the word \"Metro\" for its API.\n\nApplicability of copyright laws\n-------------------------------\n\nCopyright, however, does not apply to individual names. Once a work as a whole is protected by copyright laws, no part of it may be reproduced in any way without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. But then, copyright laws of different countries are subject to such exceptions as:\n\n* Threshold of originality (whether something as a whole has enough authorship to be protected by copyright, whose purpose is to foster the growth of original art and culture); this does not apply to you.\n* The *de minimis* principle (applies when the violation of the law, including copyright, is so insignificant that the only disruption in the whole system of the governing country is the lawsuit itself)\n* The *fair use* principle (an exemption that applies to works that definitely infringe upon the core statements of copyright laws but they don't impact the author of original work significantly and actually foster the growth of art and culture). See the following:\n\n[Would it be legal to copy a small passage from a book to a website for language teaching purposes?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29148/would-it-be-legal-to-copy-a-small-passage-from-a-book-to-a-website-for-language)\n\nThe sum of all fears! (Pun intended)\n------------------------------------\n\nSo, for the usage that you mentioned, neither the trademark laws nor copyright laws hinder you.\n\nBut err on the side of caution: I've been told that while the spirit of the laws don't hinder what you explained, there were cases in U.S. in which some trademark holder attacked a party that used its mark, claiming that the latter intended to falsify association. Believe me, you don't want this to happen, i.e. you don't want to go to the court even though you win. (Not unless you have ample money, time and nerves, and are willing to waste them.)\n\nSo, publishers (well... at least, American and Canadian publishers) usually add a fineprint like this to their works:\n\n> * \"Windows\" is a trademark of \"Microsoft Corporation\". Unless stated otherwise, our use of this trademark does not imply any form of association to, or endorsement by, Microsoft Corporation.\n> * \"Harry Potter\" is an imprint of \"Scholastic Corporation\". Unless stated otherwise, our mention of the aforementioned does not imply \\[...]\n\nYour disclaimer, however, should probably be in Brazilian Portuguese, in which I am not fluent. So, you might want to use the appropriate literature. The purpose of this disclaimer is to defuse the potential lawsuit before it goes to the court. First, it reassures the trademark holder that you don't seek to abuse his/her mark. Second, if he/she is not convinced, there will be the burden of proving that your disclaimer was a lie. Going to the court isn't cheap and the burden of proof makes it more expensive.

It's worth noting that Java APIs, including the contested ones are [easily accessible from Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html) by default.\n\nI'm wondering if, given Oracle wins, the legal consequences for Google would be materially different if Google was to suddenly drop support for the contested APIs on Android, (possibly by providing non infringing alternatives), while continuing to support, develop, and otherwise continue with the above projects.\n\n(I'll mention here that this is an attempt to rework [this closed question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/51622/assuming-oracle-wins-google-v-oracle-america-then-does-google-have-an-incentiv) to be on\\-topic.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nDamages are restitution for events that have already happened (although the damage may be still in the future e.g. future lost earnings).\n\nHowever, if they loose, then it is likely that the judgement will contain an injunction *prohibiting* them from using the contested material in the future.\n\nThey then have 4 choices:\n\n1. stop using them and do nothing,\n2. agree licence terms from a poor negotiating position\n3. use their own alternative\n4. keep using them and go to jail for contempt of court.\n\nThey probably aren\u2019t considering number 4 but they are probably considering all the others.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly!

Negotiating a licensing agreement can potentially resolve the immediate legal issue and prevent an injunction.\n2. Simultaneously developing alternatives (like supporting Kotlin or developing Fuchsia) provides a long-term solution to reduce dependency on the contested APIs.\n3.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that being unconscious \"does not constitute withdrawal of consent (which is implied, by law).\" This means that in DUI cases, consent for blood draws is implied even when the suspect is unconscious.\n\n2. While the Missouri statute mentions \"consent of the patient or a warrant,\" it also refers to acting \"at the request and direction of the law enforcement officer.\" This, combined with the implied consent provision, suggests that the officer's request is sufficient in this scenario.\n\n3.

Is that true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, One Can\n------------\n\nIn the United States, one may assert the Fifth Amendment privilege not to testify or otherwise give information that might tend to implicate the speaker in a crime. This is true in any court proceeding, civil or criminal, whether the person asserting the privilege is an accused, a witness, or a party to a civil case. It may be asserted in a Grand Jury or trial proceeding. One may also assert the privilege under police interrogation, or in an administrative proceeding. One may also assert it when testifying before Congress, a state legislature, or any local legislative body. One may also assert it when testifying before a government agency, such as the Interstate Commerce Commission. Asserting the privilege is often informally called \"pleading the Fifth\", although strictly speaking \"pleading\" is something that only an accused does (as in \"I plead not guilty\"). The availability of the privilege in civil cases has been true at least since the *Saline Bank* case of 1828 (see below).\n\nThe privilege is not available when no criminal prosecution is legally possible, such as when the statute of limitations has expired, or when the law invoked has been held unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, and no other valid law applies. Thus, if an authorized government official (usually a prosecutor) offers a grant of immunity, the privilege is no longer available on matters covered by the grant, and the person asserting it must then testify on such matters.\n\nThe privilege may be asserted when the person doing so is actually guilty, or when the person is not guilty, but has a reasonable belief that the statements asked for might be used against the speaker in some current or future criminal proceeding. A person who has been tried for a crime nut had the case end in a mistrial, or a dismissal without prejudice, could still be re\\-tried for that accusation, and so may assert the privilege.\n\nAny assertion must be clear, but need not use a specific form of worfs. The standard form advised by many lawyers is\n\n> I decline to answer on the grounds that the answer might tend to incriminate me.\n\nbut less formal wording such as 'I take the Fifth\" will also serve to assert the privilege.\n\nWhen the privilege is asserted in a court case, the Judge may question the person asserting it in private, off the record, to determine whether the fear of incrimination is reasonable.\n\nCase Law\n--------\n\n### *Saline Bank* (1828\\)\n\nIn the case of [*United States v. Saline Bank of Virginia*, 26 U.S. 100 (1828\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/26/100/) Chief Justice Marshall wrote:\n\n> It is apparent that, in every step of the suit, the facts required to be discovered in support of this suit would expose the parties to danger. The rule clearly is that **a party is not bound to make any discovery which would expose him to penalties**, and this case falls within it. \\[This case was cited in *Murphy*, below]\n\n*Saline Bank* was a civil suit by the US treasury in Federal curt against an apparently unincorporated bank, but a Virginia state law of the time made it a crime to operate or participate in a bank without a proper charter. Thus the Marshall Court held that a witness in a civil suit could assert the privilege against the future possibility of a state criminal proceeding.\n\n### *Kastigar* (1972\\)\n\nIn [*Kastigar v.

This Court has been zealous to safeguard the values that underlie the privilege \\[Citing the *Miranda* case in a footnote].\n\n(*Kastigar* was a case in which people subpoenaed before a Grand Jury asserted the privilege, were granted immunity, and still refused to testify, alleging that the grant of immunity was not enough to revoke the privialge.

In the court of its opinion, the *Kastigar* Court reviewed the history of the privilege and of immunity statutes in some detail.)\n\n### *Murphy* (1964\\)\n\nIn [*Murphy v.

The contrary must be accepted as settled. **The privilege is not ordinarily dependent upon the nature of the proceeding** in which the testimony is sought or is to be used. **It applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it.** The privilege protects a mere witness as fully as it does one who is also a party defendant.

There is a significant chance that the code would be \"substantially similar\" to the code that you were hired to build, also that if anybody else were to write a bubble sort or 24\\-to\\-am/pm conversion routine, it would look the same, where even variable names (which should describe function) are the same or very similar. In case of an infringement lawsuit, you would have to defend yourself by showing that there are only a few ways to code a given function.\n\nCopyright protects only the \"expression\", not the abstract idea. A linked list is an idea, which can't be protected by copyright; same with recursion, pointers, stacks, object\\-oriented programming... Anything that involves copy and paste is infringement. If you re\\-read the copyrighted code and then try to reconstruct it, you probably crossed the infringement line. If you remember the problems and solutions and accidentally write somewhat similar code, that is probably on the safe side.\n\nFrom the perspective of the programmer not wanting to always reinvent the wheel, it would be most useful to make a distinction in the contract between \"the essentials of the customer's program\" versus \"incidental utility work\". The difficulty will arise in saying specifically what is essential vs. incidental. For instance, I know that if I were to hire you to develop a speech\\-recognition system, low\\-level audio\\-acquisition and encoding would not be essential to my purpose, whereas DSP parsing routines would be the center of my interest.

If they can't comply with all three requirements, they are not allowed to offer these remote tests.\n\nBut what do the parts mean?

You want to set up a business that essentially combines three different concepts: \n\n* Network streaming from your PC to a different screen across the network using remote screen software; e.g. [Parsec](https://parsecgaming.com/features/), or a Chromecast, e.g. playing a PC\\-only game on your iPad, which I've done.\n* Basically [AWS](https://lg.io/2015/07/05/revised-and-much-faster-run-your-own-highend-cloud-gaming-service-on-ec2.html): Renting a dedicated server, racked in a server room far, far away, and remote\\-screening off that server. AND, time\\-sharing the dedicated server; i.e. the server is dedicated to you *while you are using it*, and an hour later your environment may be boxed, and the actual iron allocated to someone else.\n\nSo in principle, you'd have an array of racks and racks of dedicated PCs, all headless or blades. They'd all be preloaded with a standard image, with a virgin (un\\-customered) Steam, GoG, Battle.net etc. etc. Customer would \n\n1. Lease a dedicated PC from you, and you'd grab one out of the pool of available PCs.\n2. Remotely controlling it (a\\-la Parsec): Launch Steam etc., log into *their* account.\n3. Install a game on it.\n4. Play the game as long as they liked.\n5. Quit playing and log out.\n6. You'd wipe the PC's disk and return it to the pool.\n\nI'm with you so far. ([Blizzard isn't](https://www.reddit.com/r/cloudygamer/comments/cmi5wa/anybody_homestreaming_world_of_warcraft/)). \n\nWhere you might get in trouble is you try to *also* combine this idea with [GameFly](https://www.gamefly.com). Remember when Netflix was DVDs showing up in your mail, and you'd stick them in the pouch, mail it back, and the next one would automatically show up? That's the classic video rental model. The video store pays once for the tape ($89 for a VHS tape back in the day) and doesn't pay per\\-rental. Parallel to Old Netflix was a service called GameFly, that still exists (as does Old Netflix). So I suppose the next shoe to drop is that if your user wants to play a DVD\\-based console game, \"an elf in your warehouse\" will (in a few seconds) grab one of your stock copies and drop it in the DVD slot, right? (except the elf, and the DVD slot, will be virtualized.) *Now you better watch out*. \n\n---\n\nThe case to pay heed to is [Aereo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aereo).

Aereo *already knew* it would be illegal to just have one well\\-placed antenna and stream to everybody. So they had a well\\-placed warehouse with *thousands* of antennas, each connected to a PC with a DVR. So **each customer would get a dedicated antenna and PC/DVR**. And I thought that settled the matter; but they finally got in front of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said \"**Nope, the clever technology implementation does NOT negate the obvious intent of Congress, in requiring cable companies to pay TV stations for the right to rebroadcast their stations**.

I signed the forms and then paid \u00a34000, over half of my entire savings, for the procedure an hour and a half later.\n\nI am in complete shock that I did this and truly believe I wasn't in a clear and logical state of mind. I am also shocked that the clinic did no screening for mental health flags and also that they offered me the procedure in such a short timeframe after my initial consultation (1\\.5 hours later), without giving me time to go away, reflect on the information they'd provided, to research and make an informed decision. If I had done that, I'm certain I wouldn't have gone ahead with it and willingly given away such a substantial sum of money.\n\nI'm unsure if there is anything I can do here, as I obviously willingly signed the forms and agreed to it all on the day. The forms also included sentences around 'i understand I can withdraw at any time/I'm not being pressured into going ahead,' which I ultimately signed.\n\nAre there any UK laws specifically around consumers making poor decisions during a mental health crisis, and/or medical service providers not screening for such concerns, and/or not giving patient sufficient time to independently make a considered decision?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You went to this clinic voluntarily out of your own free will; things would be different if they had contacted you first. Did they have any reason to screen you for mental health problems? If you mentioned mental health problems, that might make a difference. Did they in any way force you to sign up and pay, for example walk with you to a cash machine? That might make a difference.\n\nIn the forms it said \"I understand that I can withdraw at any time\". That's what you should have done. \"I'm not being pressured into going ahead\" on the other hand would likely be worthless, since if you were pressured, you would have signed this anyway. But that doesn't mean you were pressured, you'd have to give evidence for this.\n\nUnless you can show that your mental problems are so bad that you will make decisions against your will, this looks difficult. And if you have those mental problems, that might mean that someone else would have to make those decisions.\n\nI would suggest consulting a lawyer and ask for their opinion. A lawyer would know better than you or me, and lawyers can often write convincing letters, for example they might convince the clinic to charge you only their actual cost.

As Matthew Yglesias [explains at Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2011/12/15/piracy_is_a_form_of_theft_and_copyright_infringement_is_neither.html):\n\n> If I steal your car then you don't have a car anymore, whereas if I\n>  duplicate a digital media file we both end up with it.

Which of the following best represents the potential legal argument for classifying this behavior as \"piracy\"?\n\nA) It deprives the service of physical property, similar to stealing a DVD from a store\nB) It violates the terms of service agreement, making it equivalent to trespassing\nC) It undermines the service's revenue model by circumventing paid subscriptions\nD) It constitutes armed robbery of digital assets in cyberspace\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the concept of \"piracy\" in the context of digital media and copyright law. The correct answer, C, aligns with the modern understanding of digital piracy as described in the documentation. It focuses on the economic impact of unauthorized access, which \"impairs the legally granted monopoly\" of the copyright holder.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misrepresents digital piracy as physical theft, which the documentation explicitly argues against. As stated, \"copyright infringement does not deprive anyone of use of the materials,\" unlike stealing a physical DVD.\n\nOption B, while related to legal issues, doesn't accurately represent the concept of piracy. Violating terms of service is a contractual issue, not necessarily copyright infringement or piracy.\n\nOption D is a distractor that combines the original meaning of maritime piracy with digital concepts, but it's an exaggeration and misrepresentation of digital copyright infringement.\n\nThe correct answer requires understanding that modern \"piracy\" in this context is primarily about economic impact on the copyright holder, not physical theft or violent crime. It tests the ability to apply the concept to a real-world scenario (password sharing) and understand the nuanced legal and economic arguments around digital copyright infringement."}, "73": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43732/is-a-company-still-required-to-pay-fines-if-the-applicability-of-a-law-changes-d", "docs_id": 43732, "title": "Is a company still required to pay fines if the applicability of a law changes during the investigation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: This question was inspired by [this question on Security.SE](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/215025/ex-contractor-published-company-source-code-and-secrets-online), regarding a data breach in a UK\\-based company.\n\nIn short, the data of a UK\\-based company was leaked by an US\\-based contractor. Since the UK is still part of the European Union, it is therefore still affected by the GDPR, and may be legally responsible to report a data breach.\n\nOne person commented, that said company would only be affected by the GDPR, until the UK would leave the European Union.\n\n---\n\nInspired by this, I would like to present a hypothetical situation, in which a UK\\-based company had a data breach while still affected by the GDPR, but chose not to report it, because that situation would change soon.\n\nHowever, the relevant offices were informed of the alleged breach, and began conducting an investigation. During this investigation, the UK leaves the EU in a way that EU laws and regulations would not apply to the UK anymore.\n\nIf that investigation were later come to the conclusion that the company would have been required to report the breach, would the EU have the right to fine the offending company?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is an interesting question. The general rule in common\\-law systems is that the law at the time of the alleged offense applies, **unless** the law that makes a change explicitly provides otherwise. So this might depend on the exact terms of the parliamentary action by which the UK withdraws from the EU.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that the GDPR applies, or at least purports to apply, to non\\-EU entities which are processing data of people who are in the EU. The hypothetical UK company would still come under that provision, although it is unclear, at least to me, how this would be enforced.\n\nBy the way, my understanding is that in EU member states fines are imposed by national authorities, so if any fines were to be imposed under the GDPR in this hypothetical case, they might well be imposed by the UK, not the EU.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based company experienced a data breach while still subject to GDPR regulations.

During the investigation, the UK left the EU in a manner that ended the applicability of EU laws. If the investigation concludes that the company should have reported the breach, what is the most likely legal outcome?\n\nA) The EU can impose fines as the breach occurred while the UK was still an EU member\nB) The UK authorities would be responsible for imposing any fines under national law\nC) The company cannot be penalized as EU laws no longer apply after Brexit\nD) The case would be referred to the European Court of Justice for a binding decision\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the scenario and integration of legal concepts. The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, the general rule in common-law systems is that the law at the time of the alleged offense applies. This suggests that GDPR would be applicable to the breach that occurred pre-Brexit.\n\n2. However, the documentation also mentions that in EU member states, fines are typically imposed by national authorities. This is a crucial point that indicates the UK authorities, not the EU directly, would be responsible for enforcement.\n\n3. Even after Brexit, the UK would likely have incorporated GDPR-like provisions into its national law to maintain data protection standards and facilitate data transfers with the EU. This means the UK authorities would still have the legal basis to impose fines for pre-Brexit violations.\n\n4. The question tests critical thinking by requiring consideration of the timing of the offense, the investigation, and Brexit, as well as understanding the mechanics of GDPR enforcement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the EU might have the theoretical right to impose fines, practical enforcement would likely fall to UK authorities. Option C is a common misconception that ignores the principle of law applying at the time of the offense.

If the intent is \"during that time period\", then you should say it that way, and perhaps the candidate will decide to not take the position.

The question mentions that the algorithm has potential applications in both renewable energy and cryptocurrency mining, which may or may not be related to the company's business or anticipated developments.\n3.

The documentation suggests that companies may need to \"clearly delimit what they are laying claim to,\" and absent such clear delimitation, the ownership becomes a matter of interpretation.\n5. Courts may interpret ambiguous language against the interest of the contract's author (the company), but this doesn't automatically grant rights to the employee.\n\nOption A is incorrect because even work done outside of work hours can potentially be claimed by the company if it's related to their business.

Seeks to use copyrighted content that is not available from publicly\\-licensed sources (e.g. MovieClips.com, public domain)\n2. Uses content in an objectively \"fair\\-use\" manner\n3.

This has been implied in responses elsewhere on stackexchange.\n\nContext: United States\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two senses in which \"content\" acquisition could be legal / illegal. One regards the act of copying from a source, and the other regards the legality of accessing that source. Copyright law does not distinguish between making an unauthorized copy from a DVD that you own, as opposed to one that you stole.\n\nThere is a practical difference between stealing a DVD and copying it, or hacking into a computer and stealing material, in that these acts involve a crime plus an actionable civil tort (copyright infringement): they involve \"illegal acquisition\" in the second sense, but not necessarily the first. Conversely, acquisition of a borrowed or owned DVD is not illegal, but acquiring material (copying) from the source may be illegal.\n\nCopyright law does not distinguish whether your access was legal or illegal. If you steal a DVD and copy an amount that is consistent with fair use, you may be prosecuted for theft, but that would not create liability for copyright infringement that would not exist if access to the material were lawful. \"Ripping\" and \"torrent\" are just popular ways of data acquisition typically associated with infringement. Copying from a DVD is not illegal, and streaming, no matter how fast, is not illegal. Copying without permission or in excess of fair use is what is illegal.\n\nHowever, outside the bounds of the law, the rights holder might find it okay if you make a copy if you own the DVD (the main record industry special interest organization at some point said \"we don't mind\", but that doesn't change the law). \n\nThe Creative Commons copyright\\-renunciation license CC\\-0, and expired\\-copyright works (so\\-called \"public domain\") are effectively immune to the limitations of fair use, in the former case because permission has been unconditionally granted, and in the latter case because the law no longer protects the work (copyright is not perpetual). Most publicly\\-licensed material is conditionally licensed, and thus it is possible to infringe copyright of publicly\\-licensed material (by not satisfying the license conditions). Even so, *all* licensed (and non\\-licensed) works are subject to a fair use analysis. Whether or not you break into a computer or have permission to access the computer, and in either event if you copy material subject to the Creative Commons Non\\-Commercial license NC, your liability for copyright infringement is strictly a function of whether you have complied with the license terms, or else your use is \"fair use\".\n\nIf a person puts an illegal copy of a book \"out there\" and protects it with a password that only he knows, the courts are likely to treat such an offense more generously, as compared to a person who wholesale steals hundreds of books and makes them flagrantly available to one and all.

The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced relationship between fair use and content acquisition methods as described in the documentation. \n\nThe professor's use of short clips for educational purposes may qualify as fair use, which will be evaluated based on the four factors of fair use, independent of how she acquired the content.

The CC BY\\-SA agreement contains two clauses relevant to the form of attribution.\n\nOne, as the question points out, is paragraph 4(c), which states that \"credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner.\" This language is much less restrictive than the StackExchange blog post.\n\nThe other relevant clause is the last clause of the agreement, paragraph 8(e), which is a standard integration clause:\n\n> This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. While the attorney's behavior may seem problematic, it doesn't necessarily violate ethical standards unless the delay becomes excessive. As per Rule 4.4, an attorney \"shall not use means that have no substantial purpose other than to embarrass, delay, or burden a third person.\" However, a short-term delay due to a busy schedule doesn't automatically qualify as unethical.\n\n2. The attorney's primary ethical obligations are to her own client (your ex-spouse), not to you as a third party. Rules 1.3 and 3.2 require \"reasonable diligence and promptness\" and \"reasonable efforts to expedite litigation,\" but these are open-ended standards that allow for some flexibility in managing workloads.\n\n3. The attorney's behavior would only become clearly unethical if the delay dragged on for a lengthy period, causing significant harm or if it was deliberately intended to cause you damage.\n\n4. The question of whether the ex-spouse has paid the attorney is irrelevant to the ethical considerations at hand.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply legal ethics concepts to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking about the balance between an attorney's obligations to their client, the court, and third parties.

The correct answer is A because:\n\n1. The contract language is ambiguous regarding whether \"midnight of Nov 9\" refers to the beginning or end of November 9.\n\n2. In legal contexts, ambiguities in contracts are often interpreted against the drafter of the contract (contra proferentem rule).\n\n3. To ensure compliance with both possible interpretations of the deadline (beginning or end of Nov 9), the safest action is to send the notice before November 9 begins.\n\n4. Overnight mail on November 8 ensures delivery by the earliest possible interpretation of the deadline.\n\n5. Option B is risky because it assumes the later interpretation of \"midnight\" and leaves no margin for error.\n\n6. Option C is problematic because the contract specifies \"mail or deliver,\" which may not include email.\n\n7.

What are examples of employer breaching employee contract?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The most simple way how an employer can violate a work contract is usually not mentioned specifically, but heavily implied: **Non\\-payment of wages.**\n\nIf the employer does not pay by the due date, he is in breach of the contract, as he had agreed to pay. But what happens then is dependant on the country you are in and the governing laws.\n\n### Example: [germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\nThe laws for the protection of the employees are strong in Germany. In the case of nonpayment by due date, the employer automatically is in violation of law and doesn't even need to be notified extra, the moment he doesn't pay he is liable for interest. He's *also* liable for *extra* expenses that the employee accrues because the payment is late. If the non\\-payment continues, the employee may reduce or stop working, depending on the amount of wages outstanding, until the outstanding wages are paid (partially). Neither of these results from the laws are ever referenced in work contracts, but their presence in the law is implied. It also leads to the wording in work contracts such as these:\n\n> \u00a71 \\[What is the employment contract for]\n> \n> \n> \u00a72 \\[Start and end of the employment]\n> \n> \n> \u00a73 *Compensation*\n> \n> \n> 1. Employer will pay employee X as wage per month \\[sometimes also phrased in an hourly rate].\n> 2. Payment is due till the last day of a calendar month by money transfer to a bank of employee's choice.\n> \n> \n> \u00a74 *weekly worktime* \\- The regular work time per week is Y hours.\n\nThe wording makes it rather clear, that non\\-payment of the compensation (wage) is a breech of the contract, having the aforementioned effects that are written out in the laws: \u00a7 286 Abs.2 Nr.1 BGB \\& \u00a7 614 BGB dictate the interest after the payment date and when that is. \u00a7 273 Abs.1 BGB allows the employee that is not paid on time to reduce the work done until the missing payment is done, and it is generally assumed that two full missing monthly wages allow to fully stop working till the missing amount is lower than this. \u00a7 626 Abs.1 BGB states, that the employee can, without notice period, dissolve the work contract if 2 monthly wages are not paid, as long as he notified the employer of not having paid on time in the proper way (\"Abmahnung\" \\~ Writeup).\n\nAnd atop that, as [gnasher](https://law.stackexchange.com/users/525/gnasher729) notes, not paying the employee still forces the employer to pay the income tax on the amount that is owed to the employee, and the tax has even to be paid before the employee is.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about employment contracts and employer breaches, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A software developer in Germany notices that their employer has failed to pay their monthly salary on time for the second consecutive month.

The correct answer, C, is supported by several key points from the documentation:\n\n1. Non-payment of wages is implicitly considered a breach of contract by the employer.\n2. According to \u00a7 273 Abs.1 BGB, an employee who is not paid on time can reduce their work until the missing payment is made.\n3. It's generally accepted that two full missing monthly wages allow the employee to fully stop working until the missing amount is reduced.\n4. \u00a7 626 Abs.1 BGB states that the employee can dissolve the work contract without notice if 2 monthly wages are not paid, but only after properly notifying the employer (\"Abmahnung\").\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate resignation without proper notification is not the most appropriate first step. Option B is overly passive and doesn't utilize the employee's rights under German law.

The correct answer is D because, as explained in the documentation, merely seeing classified information is not a crime. The key elements of crimes related to classified information involve intent and unauthorized actions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because viewing classified information accidentally is not a crime. There's \"nothing to forgive\" as stated in the documentation.\n\nOption B introduces a plausible-sounding legal concept (plain view doctrine) but misapplies it to this situation.

You can't copyright a word, or even a short phrase, whether or not it's a title. This is a matter of trademark law.\n\nSecond, it would probably not be a violation of trademark law, assuming the title is relevant to the work and you aren't trying to mislead people into thinking it's a King game.

Under the Rogers test, the title of an expressive work does not violate trademark law \"unless the title has no artistic relevance to the underlying work whatsoever, or, if it has some artistic relevance, unless the title explicitly misleads as to the source or the content of the work.\"\n\nHowever, it is very possible that you'd be sued by King, and it's even possible you'd lose.

Note that if a person is unable to perform the essential duties of a job, even with a reasonable accommodation, an employer is free not to hire such a person.

The correct answer is C because the key factor in determining whether the company's actions were legally permissible is whether the applicant's obesity qualifies as a physical disability under relevant laws, such as the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (CFEHA) or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\n\nThe explanation for each option:\n\nA) While this might be relevant to job performance, it's not the primary legal consideration. The laws focus on whether the condition qualifies as a disability, not its specific impact on job tasks.\n\nB) This option is a distractor based on the scientific studies mentioned, but it's not legally relevant. Employment decisions based on assumed personality traits linked to obesity would likely be considered discriminatory.\n\nC) This is the correct answer because both the CFEHA and ADA prohibit discrimination based on physical disability. The legal permissibility of the company's actions hinges on whether the applicant's obesity meets the definition of a physical disability under these laws.\n\nD) While company policies on health and fitness might be relevant in some contexts, they don't override anti-discrimination laws and wouldn't justify rejecting an applicant based on obesity if it qualifies as a disability.\n\nThe question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of legal concepts and their application to a real-world scenario.

The crutch of the debate was whether Federal employees or military could use a prostitute if they went to Las Vegas.\n\nProstitution is legal in certain parts of LV. However, the debate was whether there was a Federal law that would prohibit travelling to another state for the express purpose of using a prostitute. At least one person suggested it was illegal due to human trafficking's laws, though I'm not convinced that is accurate.\n\nSo, could a Federal employee legally travel to LV with the intent of using a prostitute there? As a related question is it possible that it's legal, i.e. I won't end up in jail, but would be grounds for termination from Federal employment; though I realize the latter question may be more policy than a legal question.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Short Answer\n\nIt is not illegal for a federal employee or anyone else, who is not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to travel to Nevada for the purposes of engaging the services of a prostitute in the counties of Nevada (Clark County where Las Vegas, Nevada is located is not one such county) where it is legal.\n\nBut, this is an offense under Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice applicable primarily to U.S. military personnel while serving in that capacity, even in cases where prostitution is legal under local law and the service member is not married.\n\n### Long Answer\n\n**Legal Prostitution In Nevada, In General**\n\nAs another answer correctly notes that in Nevada:\n\n> Clark County, the county in which Las Vegas is located, has made\n> prostitution illegal. . . . You also can't do it in Reno (it's illegal\n> in Washoe County) and the nearby independent city of Carson City\n> (Nevada State Capital).\n> \n> \n> In fact, the law only permits counties with a population of 70,000 or\n> less to do it per county law. And before you ask, you can't go to\n> Rachel, Nevada (closest settlement to Area 51\\) for some\n> extraterrestrial ladies of the night as well as Lincoln County, while\n> qualifying for legalized prostitution . . . prohibits it.\n> \n> \n> Of the 16 counties in Nevada, only 10 allow prostitution, all of which\n> must be done through regulated licensed brothels only. Even then, only\n> 8 counties have at least one active brothel in operation.\n\n**Civilian Legal Considerations In The U.S. Not Involving International Travel**\n\nIt seems as if the concern of the original post might be with the Mann Act.\n\n> [The Mann Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann_Act) (also known as the White\\-Slave Traffic Act of 1910\\) is a\n> federal law that criminalizes the transportation of \u201cany woman or girl\n> for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other\n> immoral purpose.\u201d\n\n([Source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/mann_act))\n\nThis has been revised in a manner that, among other things, is now gender\\-neutral and limiting it to circumstances in which the act for which the prostitute is transported is illegal. It was the first federal human trafficking law in the U.S.\n\nThis act applies to transporting the prostitute across state lines, not the prostitute's customer.\n\nCloser to the mark is the [Travel Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_Act):\n\n> The Travel Act or International Travel Act of 1961, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952,\n> is a Federal criminal statute which forbids the use of the U.S. mail,\n> or interstate or foreign travel, for the purpose of engaging in\n> certain specified criminal acts.\n\nBut, since the travel would be for the purpose of an act that is legal at its destination, it wouldn't apply.\n\nInternational treaties on sex tourism are inapplicable to domestic travel, and I don't try to analyze their applicability here.\n\nNone of these relevant laws treat military personnel or federal employees differently.\n\n**Prosecutions Under The Uniform Code of Military Justice**\n\nThe Uniform Code of Military Justice provides an internal means of prosecuting military service members who are currently serving and a small number of other persons, via courts\\-martial, which are quasi\\-criminal proceedings with quasi\\-criminal punishments.\n\nArticle 134 of the UCMJ is its general provision which is a catch\\-all article barring anything \"of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces\", and also certain unenumerated offenses which are illegal under local law where the offense is committed, or under federal law. Article 134 encompasses many sub\\-offenses which are enumerated in the Manual For Courts\\-Martial but not in the statutory language of the UCMJ itself.\n\nOne of the offenses which the Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) in the United States prohibits is adultery (which only a handful of U.S. states do and Nevada does not), so this would be an activity, if carried out, that would be subject to court\\-martial for a married member of the military who is currently serving in the military and thus subject to court\\-martial jurisdiction. Adultery prosecutions under the UCMJ are reasonably common even now.\n\n(A lesser included offense of adultery under the UCMJ is \"wrongful cohabitation\" which is akin to adultery and bigamy but does not require a showing a sexual intercourse.)\n\nAlso, as noted in the comments to the question, while patronizing a prostitute is not a specific offense in the UCMJ in the statute itself, it is another offense that can also be prosecuted under Article 134\\. It has been DOD policy [since at least 2006](https://www.stripes.com/news/patronizing-a-prostitute-is-now-a-specific-crime-for-servicemembers-1.43314) to prosecute service members under Article 134 for engaging in prostitution, whether or not the service member is married, and whether or not prostitution is legal under local law. (Prostitution is not illegal under federal law other than the UCMJ.)\n\nThis is not obvious from the language of Article 134 of the UCMJ (which is codified at 10 U.S. Code \u00a7 934\\), itself, which states:\n\n> Though not specifically mentioned in this chapter, all disorders and\n> neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the armed\n> forces, all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed\n> forces, and crimes and offenses not capital, of which persons subject\n> to this chapter may be guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a\n> general, special, or summary court\\-martial, according to the nature\n> and degree of the offense, and shall be punished at the discretion of\n> that court. As used in the preceding sentence, the term \u201ccrimes and\n> offenses not capital\u201d includes any conduct engaged in outside the\n> United States, as defined in section 5 of title 18, that would\n> constitute a crime or offense not capital if the conduct had been\n> engaged in within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of\n> the United States, as defined in section 7 of title 18\\.\n\nBut, the primary and authoritative interpretive authority for Article 134 of the UCMJ is the [Manual for Courts\\-Martial](https://www.sapr.mil/public/docs/ucmj/UCMJ_Article134_General_Article.pdf), with the force of a law or validly adopted regulation. This indicates that prosecutions for pandering a prostitute under Article 134 does not require a showing that it is illegal to do so under local law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A federal employee is planning a trip to Nevada with the intention of engaging the services of a legal prostitute.

The correct answer is D because active-duty military service members are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), which prohibits patronizing prostitutes under Article 134, even in locations where it is legal under local law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because visiting a licensed brothel in a county where prostitution is legal is not prohibited for federal employees who are not military personnel.\n\nOption B is a distractor based on the common misconception that all prostitution in Nevada is legal.

It was a high-stakes litigation against powerful media entities in Australia.\n3. Sumption's background as a highly regarded QC suggests he had experience in complex, high-value cases.\n4. The borderless nature of high-level legal practice, as mentioned in the documentation, allows for the integration of international expertise in national cases.\n5. The complexity of the case likely required someone who could understand and articulate intricate business strategies within a legal framework.\n\nThis answer demonstrates that Sumption's value lay not in specific Australian legal knowledge, but in his ability to handle complex, high-stakes cases and integrate business and legal strategies effectively. This skill set would be particularly valuable in a case involving media companies and large sums of money, regardless of the specific jurisdiction.\n\nThe other options are less comprehensive or accurate:\nA) is misleading as it suggests unethical practices.\nB) is too narrow, focusing only on media law expertise.\nC) is superficial and doesn't address the practical benefits of Sumption's involvement.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex situation, integrate multiple pieces of information, and understand the global nature of high-level legal practice."}, "96": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17538/do-alcoholic-ingredients-in-food-prohibit-distribution-to-minors", "docs_id": 17538, "title": "Do alcoholic ingredients in food prohibit distribution to minors?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I just received a supply of Member's Mark Beer Cheese from Saint Mary's Foodbank in Phoenix, Arizona USA, and I am only 20 years of age.

The key point is that Arizona law defines spirituous liquor as containing more than 0.5% alcohol by volume. \n\nOption A is the correct answer because the tiramisu contains 0.4% alcohol by volume, which is below the 0.5% threshold for spirituous liquor. Despite the recipient being under the legal drinking age, this distribution would likely be considered legal.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the ice cream contains 0.6% alcohol, which exceeds the 0.5% threshold, making it a spirituous liquor under Arizona law.\n\nOption C is incorrect as kombucha with 1% alcohol content is well above the 0.5% threshold.\n\nOption D is incorrect because chocolate liqueur candies with 2% alcohol content significantly exceed the threshold and would be classified as spirituous liquor.\n\nThis question tests the ability to apply the specific legal definition to various scenarios, requiring critical thinking about alcohol content percentages and their legal implications.

If you get it, great. Then you could do it with the owner's blessing.\n\nIt's possible to do your write up without the owner's permission, but then you have to be *much* more careful. For instance, the names of games cannot be copyrighted. No one can prevent you from writing \"A Guide to Bridge,\" or \"A Guide to Chess,\" etc. On the other hand, some games are *trademarked,* in which case you will need to attach a TM (trademark) symbol when referring to them. In this case, see a lawyer.\n\nYou are also allowed to discuss the game itself \"in your own words,\" but you must be careful not to \"plagiarize\" anything from the rules, or the official game description. That is, while you can refer to specific aspects of a game, such as building houses and hotels, the leash on copying is fairly short, as little as five words. This does not refer to five words in a common sequence referring to a single thought like \"The United States of America,\" but it could refer to five words in an original or unusual sequence such as \"I think therefore I am,\" by Rene Descartes, or \"X houses and Y hotels,\" where the numbers X and Y define the number of houses and hotels in a certain board game trademarked (I believe) by Parker Brothers.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A mobile game developer is creating a strategy guide app for a popular game without explicit permission from the game's owner.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. In Canada, linking does not reproduce any part of the original work and is not considered infringement.\n2. In Sweden and the EU, communicating a link does not constitute a new communication of the work to the public, thus not infringing copyright.\n3. Spain follows a similar principle to the EU, where linking itself is not considered copyright infringement.\n4. In the US, while linking is not per se infringement, knowingly linking to illegal copies with the intent to promote infringement could potentially lead to liability under contributory infringement theories.\n\nThe key distinction in option D is the element of knowledge and intent, which separates it from mere linking.

Do marketing emails require consent, if so are they breaking the law now that GDPR is active?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Do marketing emails require consent, if so are they breaking the law now that GDPR is active?\n\nYes. See [Article 21(2\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/):\n\n> 2. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.\n\nThis is not new, something similar was already put in the [ePrivacy Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002) ([2002/58/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058)):\n\n> Article 13\n> \n> \n> Unsolicited communications\n> \n> \n> 1. The use of automated calling systems without human intervention (automatic calling machines), facsimile machines (fax) or electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing may only be allowed in respect of subscribers who have given their prior consent.\n> 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, where a natural or legal person obtains from its customers their electronic contact details for electronic mail, in the context of the sale of a product or a service, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, the same natural or legal person may use these electronic contact details for direct marketing of its own similar products or services **provided that customers clearly and distinctly are given the opportunity to object**, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details when they are collected and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use.\n\nIn any case, it must be possible to stop this direct marketing, without any effect on other email or services. (See also [recital 43](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-43/), regarding freely given consent).\n\nIf you want to, you can [complain at the supervisory authority](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-77-gdpr/), which I believe is the [ICO](https://ico.org.uk/) in the UK, or you can [go to a court](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-79-gdpr/) directly.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A multinational company operating in the EU is struggling to comply with GDPR regulations regarding their email marketing practices. Which of the following scenarios would most likely result in a violation of GDPR principles?\n\nA) Offering customers the option to unsubscribe from marketing emails while continuing to receive essential service notifications\nB) Sending marketing emails to customers who have purchased similar products in the past without explicit consent\nC) Requiring customers to choose between receiving all emails or no emails at all when attempting to unsubscribe\nD) Delaying the implementation of an email preference center due to technical difficulties\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of GDPR principles in a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because it violates key GDPR principles outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. Article 21(2) of GDPR states that data subjects have the right to object to processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time.\n2. The ePrivacy Directive (2002/58/EC) emphasizes that customers must be given the opportunity to object to the use of their contact details for marketing, free of charge and in an easy manner.\n3. The documentation explicitly states that it must be possible to stop direct marketing without any effect on other email or services.\n\nOption A is actually a compliant practice, as it allows users to opt out of marketing while still receiving essential information. Option B, while not ideal, might be permissible under certain circumstances as long as an easy opt-out is provided (though explicit consent is preferred). Option D, while problematic, is not necessarily a direct violation if other compliant opt-out methods are available.\n\nOption C is the most egregious violation because it forces users to choose between receiving unwanted marketing emails or potentially missing important information about services they've paid for. This practice directly contradicts the GDPR principle of freely given consent and the right to object to direct marketing without losing access to other services.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the learner to integrate multiple concepts from GDPR and apply them to a realistic business scenario, targeting higher cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy."}}
