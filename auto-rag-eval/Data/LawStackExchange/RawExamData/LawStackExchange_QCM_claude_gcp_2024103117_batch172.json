Some examples: the password to the computer system; the home phone number and address of the chief of staff. It would not be legal to use an NDA as a basis for denying a patient the right to access their medical records when the HIPAA privacy rule [mandates disclosure](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=b5eb4a69fb3fd422f99cb6b31a4a3913&mc=true&n=sp45.2.164.e&r=SUBPART&ty=HTML#se45.2.164_1524) to the patient (with exceptions).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A healthcare professional is asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) by their employer.

HIPAA privacy rules mandate that patients have the right to access their own medical records, with some exceptions. An NDA cannot override this legal right.\n\nB) This is the correct answer. It's legal and ethical for healthcare professionals to sign NDAs that protect sensitive information not directly related to patient care, such as computer system passwords or other internal operational details.\n\nC) This is incorrect. While healthcare professionals are not obligated to disclose the existence of NDAs they've signed, having an NDA that explicitly forbids mentioning its existence could be seen as unethical and potentially illegal if it interferes with patient rights.\n\nD) This is incorrect because it's redundant. Healthcare professionals are already bound by HIPAA and other privacy laws to not share one patient's information with another. An NDA for this purpose would be unnecessary and could be seen as an attempt to circumvent existing legal protections."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7029/can-i-get-in-trouble-for-not-giving-oracle-credit-in-my-java-game", "docs_id": 7029, "title": "Can I get in trouble for not giving Oracle credit in my Java game?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: So I was planning on making a game for my favorite Youtuber, and I'm not sure if I will get into trouble with Oracle (since I am making it in Java) if I don't give credit to them for using their programming language.

The father can not force the mother to abort the pregnancy.\n2. *Ex post facto* agreements of non\\-payment are, in all likelihood, unenforceable.\n3. The father will be obligated to pay child support under the laws of the state with jurisdiction over the paternity.\n\nThe abortion angle won\u2019t work.\n------------------------------\n\nSetting aside commentary regarding the politics or ethics of abortion. I think we can agree it is a highly charged and emotional topic for some people. I point to the fact it always seems to be an issue during Supreme Court nominations and presidential elections.\n\nGiven the explosive nature of the issue of whether abortions should be legal or not (in the case where the mother does *not* want to carry full term) could you imagine how much more dynamite it would add to the debate if the question were whether or not to allow the father to force the mother to terminate the pregnancy **against the mother's wishes**!\n\nOne can only imagine how much more bombastic the abortion debate might then become.\n\nYou can\u2019t escape child support (most likely).\n---------------------------------------------\n\nTo give you a sense of how difficult it is to escape the obligations of child support. Consider the following...\n\n[A Kansas man was ordered to pay child support when he thought he was being a sperm donor only](http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/23/justice/kansas-sperm-donation/) and signed numerous agreements with the lesbian couple he thought he was *helping*. In that case, the court justified its ruling on the grounds that a doctor was not involved in the insemination process.\n\nBut nothing prevents future courts from making the same ruling in cases where a doctor *is* involved in the insemination process. Especially if that state either withdraws from the ***The Uniform Parentage Act***, amends it, repeals it, or never adopts it in the first place.\n\nSperm Donors and Child Support:\n\n> Even in cases in which the donor is known, but holds himself out as unknown, some courts have held the donor legally obligated to pay child support.\n\n[Read more here](http://family-law.freeadvice.com/family-law/child_support/artificial_insemination_donor_obligation.htm).\n\n*Ex post facto* agreements are problematic.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nNow that you've edited the question, the above link is even more useful for providing a possible avenue to try (albeit unlikely to work): a ***non\\-payment agreement***. The discussion in that link describes that even if you could somehow convince the mother to go along with it, it is unlikely (though not impossible) to be enforced by the courts. It depends on the facts (e.g., intercourse vs. *in vitro*), circumstances (e.g., relationship vs. no relationship between the parties), timing (e.g., before vs. after the agreement), etc. of the impregnation itself.\n\nNotwithstanding all the above, if you still have questions, you might consider floating an idea of an approach you think you might try (in a separate question) and get reactions to that specific proposal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A unmarried couple conceives a child unintentionally.

If they even use those words. After all you discriminate against Pepsi everytime you buy Coke.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the United States, what is \"fair\" and \"unfair\" is typically not a legal question, in large part because it is so subjective. There are some exceptions \\-\\- such as in copyright law or competition law \\-\\- but in the discrimination context, we use the lawful/unlawful distinction.\n\nBequeathing a house to your child solely because he is your child, for instance, is not fair but it is lawful. The same is true for giving more to your oldest child simply for being the oldest, or cutting a black relative out of your will: not fair, but lawful. Assuming there's a valid will, a court will rarely make a serious inquiry into the fairness of the decedent's discrimination among beneficiaries.\n\nThe same types of issues come up in contexts that are more routine subjects of discrimination law. In employment, for instance, you might have two employees: a lazy white salesman who's been around for 20 years and a new black woman who does an excellent job answering the phones.\n\nIf you only have enough money to give one raise, giving it to the black woman is both fair and lawful. Giving it to the white guy because he's been around longer is probably not fair but still lawful, while giving it to him strictly because he's white is probably neither fair nor lawful.\n\nThe inutility of the fair/unfair distinction can become especially clear in the affirmative\\-action context, where the question of fairness remains hotly debated.\n\nIf an employer has two equally qualified candidates, would it be fair to require him to choose a black applicant over a white applicant as a means of redressing centuries of discrimination against blacks? What if the black applicant is only marginally less qualified? What if the black applicant is far less qualified? There are many who think each of these would be fair, and there are many who think none of them would be.\n\nIn the end, then, the courts tend only to ask whether discrimination is lawful, which can usually be resolved by applying the facts to the law, leaving questions about what is fair to lawmakers and commentators.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company in the United States is hiring for a senior management position.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this hiring decision in the context of U.S. discrimination law?\n\nA) The decision is unfair but lawful, as U.S. law focuses on lawful/unlawful rather than fair/unfair discrimination.\nB) The decision is unlawful because it discriminates against minorities and women.\nC) The decision is fair and lawful because the chosen candidate has the most experience with the company.\nD) The decision would be considered \"fair discrimination\" under U.S. law, similar to South African legal concepts.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. In the United States, discrimination law focuses on whether an action is lawful or unlawful, rather than fair or unfair. While choosing the white male with 20 years of experience over equally qualified diverse candidates might be seen as unfair by some, it is likely lawful if the decision was genuinely based on his long experience with the company rather than his race or gender. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the decision, while potentially unfair, is not necessarily unlawful if it's based on a non-protected characteristic (years of experience).\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the decision may be lawful, it's not necessarily considered \"fair\" in a legal sense. The concept of fairness is subjective and not typically a legal consideration in U.S. discrimination law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because U.S. law does not use the concept of \"fair discrimination\" in the same way as South African law.

In the same vein, [Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, 317 U.

This privilege typically allows for reasonable detention if there are grounds to suspect theft. The Fourth Amendment doesn't apply here as it only protects against government searches, not those conducted by private businesses. While customers may refuse receipt checks, this refusal alone doesn't make the detention illegal if the store had reasonable grounds for suspicion and acted within the bounds of applicable shopkeeper's privilege laws.

A warrant (I assume you mean arrest warrant) can be issued under court orders, if there is probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed.

When can service animals be excluded?\n> \n> \n> \n> > A. The ADA does not require covered entities to modify policies, practices, or procedures if it would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of the goods, services, programs, or activities provided to the public. Nor does it overrule legitimate safety requirements. If admitting service animals would fundamentally alter the nature of a service or program, service animals may be prohibited. In addition, if a particular service animal is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it, or if it is not housebroken, that animal may be excluded.\n> \n> \n> Q26\\. When might a service dog's presence fundamentally alter the nature of a service or program provided to the public?\n> \n> \n> \n> > A. In most settings, the presence of a service animal will not result in a fundamental alteration. However, there are some exceptions. For example, at a boarding school, service animals could be restricted from a specific area of a dormitory reserved specifically for students with allergies to dog dander. At a zoo, service animals can be restricted from areas where the animals on display are the natural prey or natural predators of dogs, where the presence of a dog would be disruptive, causing the displayed animals to behave aggressively or become agitated. They cannot be restricted from other areas of the zoo.\n\nThis seems to indicate that the zoo exception exists because it would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of the zoo. I don't think that it would \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the nature of a store with a mascot cat for the cat to be temporarily restricted to the upstairs living quarters or other area away from the customer areas where a service dog must be permitted to accompany a disabled customer.\n\nIn the FAQ document [Service Animals under the ADA](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=16&ved=2ahUKEwiPjc6Z2rniAhVic98KHQufCwYQFjAPegQIBxAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fadagreatlakes.com%2FPublications%2FLegal_Briefs%2FBriefNo015ServiceAnimals.pdf&usg=AOvVaw1WqMqFp4MSRGQsX4cPQMPs) from the Great Lakes ADA center, on page 7, it is said that:\n\n> In General Covered entities must modify policies,\n>  practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a\n>  disability in any area open to the general public, unless the entity can demonstrate\n>  (1\\) that making such modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the\n>  entity\u2019s goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or\n>  accommodations, (2\\) the safe operation of the entity would be jeopardized, or (3\\)\n>  such modifications would result in an undue financial or administrative burden.\n> \n> \n> 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 35\\.130(b)(7\\), 35\\.136, 35\\.150 (a)(3\\), 35\\.164, 36\\.301(b), 36\\.302 (c)(1\\),\n>  and 36\\.303(a). \n> \n> \n> DOJ commentary suggests that Congress intended the ADA\n>  to allow service animals the \u201cbroadest feasible access\u201d to public\n>  accommodations and public entities and to avoid unnecessarily separating service\n>  animals from from their owners. 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, App. C.\n> \n> \n> Covered entities that have blanket policies or practices that exclude service animals\n>  may be subjected to court orders or settlement agreements requiring modification of the relevant policy or practice.\n\nOn pages 8\\-9 of the same document it is said that:\n\n> It is the entity\u2019s burden to allege and prove the existence of a fundamental alteration. The outcome of such defense will depend on the distinct\n>  facts of each case.\n\nThe document cites [*Lentini v. California Center for the Arts, Escondido*, 370 F.3d 837 (9th Cir.2004\\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1371927.html), in which (according to the document) an attempt to exclude a service dog which had previously barked during musical concerts was not allowed, and a \"fundamental alteration\" defense was denied at both the distinct and circuit court levels.\n\nThe Great Lakes document also cited *Johnson v. Gambrinus Company/Spoetzel Brewery*, 116 F.3d 1052 (5th Cir. 1997\\), in which a brewery attempted to exclude a service dog for a tour open to the public, Citing FDA regulations in support of a \"no animals\" policy, and argued that to admit animals would constitute a \"fundamental change\". The Fifth Circuit ruled that the brewery must modify its policy, and awarded damages under a parallel state law.\n\nThis seems to confirm that the \"zoo exception\" is limited to a situation where the animals on display are a \"fundamental\" part of the operation of the facility, as is surely the case with a zoo, but would not be the case in a store as described in the question. \n\nI have not found any case law directly on point.

Which of the following is the most accurate legal assessment of this situation under the ADA?\n\nA) The store owner can legally refuse entry to the service dog because the cats' agitation constitutes a \"fundamental alteration\" to the store's operation.\n\nB) The store owner must allow the service dog, but can restrict it to certain areas of the store where the cats are not present.\n\nC) The store owner must allow the service dog full access to the store, as the presence of cats does not meet the \"zoo exception\" or constitute a fundamental alteration of services.\n\nD) The store owner can refuse entry to the service dog if they can prove it would cause an undue financial burden to accommodate both the cats and the dog.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The ADA requires businesses to allow service animals in all areas where the public is normally allowed to go, with very limited exceptions. The \"zoo exception\" mentioned in the text applies specifically to situations where displayed animals are natural predators or prey of dogs, which is not applicable to a retail store with pet cats. The presence of cats in the store does not \"fundamentally alter\" the nature of the retail business, unlike the case of a zoo where the animals are the primary attraction. The store owner would likely be required to make reasonable accommodations, such as temporarily relocating the cats to the upstairs living area if necessary, to allow the service dog access. Options A and B are incorrect as they misapply the \"fundamental alteration\" concept and the extent of required access. Option D is incorrect because the financial burden of accommodating both cats and a service dog in a retail environment would likely not meet the threshold of \"undue burden\" under the ADA."}, "24": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29349/cyberstalking-and-ratemyprofessors-com", "docs_id": 29349, "title": "Cyberstalking and RateMyProfessors.com", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Imagine this hypothetical scenario:\n\n1.

It does elect one \"Delegate\" who sits in the House, and may speak in debate, but does not have the right to vote.\n\nThe Constitution allows congress to exercise \"Exclusive legislation 8in all cases whatsoever\" over the District. However, since 1973 the Congress has allowed limited \"home rule\" in the district, although it could cancel this at any time by a new law.\n\nThe district has a local government, but it more closely resembles the government of a major city than that of a state. It is led by a Mayor and a city council.\n\nIt is specified in some Federal laws, and one Constutiuonal provision that for certain limited purposes the Districtm should be treated \"as if it were\", a state.\n\nThere have been a number of proposals to make the District into a state. The most recent ones have proposed to do this by redefining the \"Capital District\" into the White House, the Capital building, the Mall between them, buildings adjacent to the mall, and a small adjacent area. The rest of the district would, under such proposals, be admitted as a new state. Congress has the power to admit new states, so this would not require a Constitutional Amendment. But no such proposal has yet passed Congress.\n\nThere are some special provisions in the way the District is Governed. For one thing, to compensate for the many public building and facilities (which pay no taxes) and the special demands on the District of the Federal Government, Congress provides some of the funds needed to run the district, with the rest coming from local taxes.

The addition of subsections (e)(2\\)(B) and (e)(2\\)(C) has broadened the scope of the CFAA significantly. The development of the internet, so that almost all data on the internet has traveled or is likely to travel across state lines, means that almost every computer with an internet connection can be regarded as a \"protected computer\" under the CFAA, including most cell phones. The CFAA has thus become a general anti\\-hacking act.\n\nOffenses\n--------\n\nSection 1030 defies several offenses, which I summarize here: unauthorized disclosure of information obtained from a protected computer (subsection (a)(1\\)); obtaining information from a protected computer without proper authorization (subsection (a)(2\\)); unauthorized access to certain protected computers (subsection (a)(3\\)); fraud, that is using unauthorized access to commit fraud, further any fraudulent scheme, or fraudulently obtain any benefit or thing of value (subsection (a)(4\\)); transmitting malware (subsection (a)(5\\)(A)); causing damage, whether recklessly or not (subsections (a)(5\\)(B) \\& (a)(5\\)(C)); selling passwords and access codes (subsection (a)(6\\)); transmitting ransomware or threats to damage a protested computer or interfere with its operation (subsection (a)(7\\)).\n\nEach of these subsections has limiting language, and applies only when \\[*emphasis added*]:\n\n* > \\[(a)(1\\)] having **knowingly accessed** a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access and and by means of such conduct having obtained information that has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive order or statute to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or foreign relations, or any restricted data, as defined in paragraph y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, **with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States**, or to the advantage of any foreign nation\n\nIt seems unlikely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute \"knowing access\" or will result in obtaining such protected or restricted data, but if it does, one can avoid criminal liability under (a)(1\\) simply by nt disclosing any such data to any third party.\n\n* > \\[(a)(2\\)] **Intentionally** accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains\u2014\n> (A) **information contained in a financial record of a financial institution, or of a card issuer** as defined in section 1602(n)\u202f\\[1] of title 15, or **contained in a file of a consumer reporting agency** on a consumer, as such terms are defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.\n\nIt seems even less likely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute \"intentional access\" or will result in obtaining such financial data.

Even so, it applies only if information is in fact obtained (or under a later subsection there is an attempt to obtain information).\n\n* > \\[(a)(3\\)] **intentionally**, without authorization to access any nonpublic computer **of a department or agency of the United States**, accesses such a computer of that department or agency that is exclusively for the use of the Government of the United States or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, **is used by or for the Government of the United States** and such conduct **affects that use** by or for the Government of the United States; ...\n\nAgain, It seems unlikely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute **intentionally** accessing a computer owned or used by the US Federal Government\n\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)] **knowingly** and with **intent to defraud**, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct **furthers the intended fraud** and obtains anything of value,\n\nIt is very hard to see how merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute acting with **intent to defraud**, nor how it will allow the person connecting the device to obtain anything of value fraudulently.\n\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(A)] **knowingly** causes the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, **intentionally causes damage without authorization**, to a protected computer;\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(B)] **intentionally** accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, **recklessly causes damage**;\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(C)] **intentionally** accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, **causes damage and loss**.\n\nAside from subsection (a)(2\\)(C), all the listed offenses require \"knowing\" or \"intentional\" action. Even (a)(2\\)(C) requires proof that the accused intentionally accessed a protected computer without authorization.

The scenario described (using content as evidence in an academic integrity hearing) would likely fall under fair use exemptions, especially in an educational context. However, fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, so it's not guaranteed. Option A is too restrictive and doesn't account for fair use. Option B is too broad, as not all educational uses automatically qualify as fair use. Option D is unnecessarily restrictive, as fair use doesn't require explicit permission. Therefore, C is the most accurate statement, reflecting the likely applicability of fair use while acknowledging that it's not an absolute certainty."}, "38": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/5094/is-a-job-offer-letter-sent-and-accepted-by-email-legally-binding", "docs_id": 5094, "title": "Is a job offer letter sent and accepted by email, legally binding?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: TL;DR: You could also jump to the last paragraph. \n\nI was interviewed and selected by a software startup in India. Saturday was not a working day for them, but yet their tech VP, product manager and CEO came on Saturday at their new office and interviewed me. The interview process was very mature, they were very polite and even after the interview when I did a background check of the company and didn't find proof of registration of the company on the Ministry of Corporate Affairs [website](http://www.mca.gov.in/mcafoportal/findLLPIN.do), they offered me proof of registration of the company, including the Corporate Identification Number. The company was called `X Pvt.Ltd.` (this is the company that is registered). They were later called `Y` and now they are named `Z`. \n\nThey are funded by a reputed company named `G`, and `G`'s website shows that they are funding company `Y`. My offer letter mentions the company name as `Z (*)` and at the bottom of the letter, is the explanation of the asterisk, which goes like `X Pvt.Ltd. d/b/a Z`. The d/b/a, I understand is \"Doing Business As\". I also verified the registrations on [this website](http://www.register.com/whois.rcmx). \n\nThe bottom of the offer letter mentions the CEO's name and the letter (pdf format) has been emailed to me by the tech VP via the company `Z`'s email domain name. The offer letter says \"*Therefore, please confirm your acceptance of terms contained herein by signing and returning a duplicate copy of this letter*\", so when I spoke to the VP on phone about signatures, he said I was welcome to come to their office on Monday and he'd keep a copy of the letter signed by the CEO, ready for me. He also mentioned that they usually don't follow the procedure of having signatures on the offer letter for new joinee's, and assured me that they trust me and they would honour the offer letter even if it was not signed. Considering that the current company I work for (a very reputed one), had also sent me an offer letter by email when I was a campus recruit, and they had not even expected me to reply with a \"yes\", and instead just wanted me to send across the document proof they required, can I assume it is safe to just send an email to the startup saying that I accept the offer letter, and then resign from my current job? The notice period is 1\\.5 months. Is it safe and legally binding to do this via email?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes.\n\nThe formation of a contract requires (among other things) that the parties intend to be legally bound.

As stated in the documentation, the formation of a contract requires that the parties intend to be legally bound. Sending an offer from a corporate email address and receiving an acceptance via email can demonstrate this intent. Physical signatures are not always necessary for a contract to be legally binding. Verbal contracts can also be binding in many situations. The use of a d/b/a name on official documents is generally acceptable as long as it's properly linked to the registered company name.

This may fatally backfire.

In this scenario, the prosecutor has made a strategic error by only charging the defendant with first-degree murder, which requires proof of premeditation.

Of course there was a contract. There is a clause in the contract that states that the tenants are responsible of maintaining the quality of the items (listed) in the house and replacing them (unless there has been a fire). This is worded longer but has this information.\n\nWhen I was considering signing the contract, I read the clause and decided to ask the landlord what would happen if something breaks \"because is old\". The conversation was more or less as follows:\n\n> Seating in the Landlord's living room in his own house, me, my girlfriend, Landlord and his wife, reading the contract.\n> \n> \n> Me: About this clause, what would happen if something breaks?\n> \n> \n> Landlord: If it breaks... what do you mean?\n> \n> \n> Me: Well, if the thing is old, sometimes they just break. Would you pay for it in that case?\n> \n> \n> Landlord and wife, together: Yes, yes of course.\n> \n> \n> We sign.\n\nRecently something broke (after 1\\.5 years) and we called the landlord. After about a month of doing technicians etc the result ended in needing to buy a new one. While discussing moderately about how long is taking to fix thing my landlord told us that we shouldn't complain, because he is paying for it, and we should be the ones paying. While asking why he says that if he mentioned that he would pay for it he said \"you should have read the contract, its in the contract that it is your responsibility to pay for it\".\n\nIt seems that nothing bad will happen, but I am curious about the legal implication if he decides to make us pay for it.\n\nWe asked about it and he said it, but of course, its not literally written like that. However, one of the reasons we signed that contract was because of that verbal agreement (can it be called like that?).\n\nIn British law, is there somehow a possibility that that conversation can be used to defend us? Or as it is not written is as if it didn't happened?\n\nWould this mean that a landlord could actually tell a lots of lies about a contract (for example to someone that has limited reading capabilities, or like me, someone that is not used to English law \"slang\" as its not their mother tongue) and \"cheat\" the tenant to sign?\n\nI guess one possible (and likely) answer to this is \"its the tenant responsibility to understand the contract, and the only things that apply are the ones in the contract\".\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not looking for real legal advice, just curious on how far the law extends here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is the tenant's responsibility to understand the written contract. Oral statements about the contract do have to be consistent with the written contract (that is, in the context where you ask the landlord what a particular clause means before signing \\-\\- not in the case where you are modifying an existing contract). If I were renting a room and the contract says \"Du m\u00e5 betale $1000 hver dag\", which I don't understand because my Norwegian is terrible, I would ask about this, and the landlord might say that it means \"You must pay $1000 every month\", which could be a decent deal. Actually, the clause says \"You must pay $1000 every day\". When the reality of the situation becomes clear, then it is obvious that we didn't have an agreement in the first place. Perhaps he mis\\-spoke, or his English is as bad as my Norwegian, but I would not be held to rate in the written contract, assuming that I could back up my claim that he gave me that interpretation: the lease would probably be voided, as not an actual agreement. The underlying principle is that there has to be a \"meeting of the minds\" where the parties understand what they will get and what they must give, and there was a demonstrable failure of understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, if I sign a contract without really reading it carefully, and there is a clause in English (which I speak) saying that I have to pay $1000 a day, but I didn't really think about the clause so that in a sense I didn't understand what I had agreed to, well, I may still be on the hook. (On the third hand, a court would probably say that's a ridiculous rent and void the contract on policy grounds). In general, \"not my first language\" is not a get\\-out\\-of\\-contract card, though attempts to trick people into signing documents in languages that they really have no understanding of won't be successful. Virtually nobody but a lawyer actually understands contractual language, yet contracts are enforced all the time.\n\nA contract can be explicitly modified by verbal agreement, or can be entirely verbal, but oral agreements face evidence problems, namely, what *exactly* did A and B say? It's scientifically well established that parties can be morally certain that the conversation went \"A\" (for one person) and \"Not A\" (for the other person). Using \"could\" rather than \"would\" in speech makes a huge difference in interpretation. There is a rule, the [parol evidence rule](http://articles.rollingsons.co.uk/2012/04/the-parol-evidence-rule.html), which essentially says that unless there is a good reason to not do so, the contract as written is what is enforced.\n\nEven if the conversation had been written into the contract, there's no basis in the contract for objectively determining whether a thing is old and \"just broke\". So even as an additional clause in the contract, it doesn't afford you a clear escape hatch.

Verbal agreements made prior to signing a contract can be considered in interpreting the contract, especially if they clarify ambiguities or demonstrate a clear misunderstanding. However, generally, the written contract prevails due to the parol evidence rule. Courts may consider verbal discussions if there's strong evidence of misrepresentation or a failure in the \"meeting of the minds,\" but this is not automatic.

The court addresses the question of whether \"merely viewing\" can constitute actual possession: the court found that it did:\n\n> Crabtree urges us to consider that his merely viewing child\n>  pornography images before deleting them should not be deemed to\n>  constitute actual possession. After reviewing the facts of this case,\n>  we are not persuaded that this is a valid argument in light of the\n>  Ninth Circuit's definition of possession in Romm, supra: that the act\n>  of seeking out child pornography and exercising control over it\n>  constitutes criminal possession\u2014regardless of whether it is\n>  downloaded. Crabtree admitted to seeking out the material and to\n>  having it on his computer.\n\nIt would be impractical to try to review 50 states' worth of child porn laws plus the federal statute, but there is also a \u201cTemporary innocent possession\u201d defense, which is conceivably applicable to the situation where you click a link and surprise! In the above case, defendant had to click a link that indicated the nature of the contents, and had to confirm file\\-saving of a file whose name was indicative of its content. Such circumstances overrule the presumption of temporary innocent possession.\n\nA question raised in the comments is whether a porn\\-ambush could lead to a conviction. Suppose that a web page has a number of embedded child\\-porn images which are saved to a user's computer without his knowledge. As pointed out in [this report](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/news/congressional-testimony-and-reports/sex-offense-topics/201212-federal-child-pornography-offenses/Chapter_02.pdf) of the US Sentencing Commission,\n\n> A conviction for receipt, however, requires proof beyond a reasonable\n>  doubt that a defendant *knowingly* came into possession of child\n>  pornography at the time that the image or video was received\n\nwith case law citations. The case of [US v. Kuchinski](https://openjurist.org/469/f3d/853/united-states-v-kuchinski), 469 F. 3d 853 is instructive, because defendant did knowingly seek out and download a number of child porn images, and was convicted. In 94 of those cases, he knew he was receiving child pornography; in over 10,000 other cases, such images were found in his system cache (this is relevant to sentencing). The court found that it matters that \"Kuchinski had no knowledge of the images that were simply in the cache files\", and the court concluded, in K's favor, that\n\n> Where a defendant lacks knowledge about the cache files, and\n>  concomitantly lacks access to and control over those files, it is not\n>  proper to charge him with possession and control of the child\n>  pornography images located in those files, without some other\n>  indication of dominion and control over the images. To do so turns\n>  abysmal ignorance into knowledge and a less than valetudinarian grasp\n>  into dominion and control.\n\nDo you know about the system cache, and do you know how to control it? If not, you might avoid the charge. \nIn other words, it depends on the circumstances surrounding the possession and the evidence of a *knowing* act, as well as the jurisdiction.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John is browsing an adult website that claims all content is of legal adults.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's potential legal liability?\n\nA) John cannot be held liable because the website claimed all content was of legal adults.\nB) John is automatically guilty of possessing child pornography because the file is in his cache.\nC) John's liability depends on factors such as his knowledge of the cache, ability to control it, and awareness of the content.\nD) John is protected by the \"temporary innocent possession\" defense as long as he deletes the file within 24 hours.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. John's potential liability is not straightforward and depends on several factors. As noted in cases like US v.

Simply having content in a cache without awareness may not be enough for conviction.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because a website's claim doesn't provide automatic legal protection.

These Credits could then be used to purchase real\\-world items on the site, such as clothes, computers, etc., and have them shipped to you. When you purchased an item, you would have to pay for shipping with United States Dollars. Additionally, the amount in credits of the item you bought would be deducted from you and added to the seller.\n\nIt was a \"virtual economy\", in a way, permitting users to buy and sell items for free by using so\\-called Listia Credits. This currency was *not* a cryptocurrency. It could not be redeemed for cash or legal tender in any way.\n\nI'm wondering what the legality of building such a system is in the United States. According to [Lexology.com](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a0243a6e-75e2-4dd3-9bb0-72a720837f85), \n\n> In 2013, FinCEN released guidance (the \"Guidance\") explaining its position on money transmission in the context of virtual currency. An individual or company involved in virtual currency transactions would be considered a money transmitter if (1\\) it acts as an \"exchanger\" or \"administrator\" in the transactions; (2\\) the virtual currency involved is a \"convertible virtual currency\" (CVC); and (3\\) the company facilitates the movement of funds between different persons or locations.\n\nPertaining to exchanging/issuing:\n\n> Importantly for app and game developers, an administrator is an entity that (1\\) issues a virtual currency and (2\\) has the authority to redeem the virtual currency. \"Issuing\" means putting a virtual currency into circulation, for example, by providing users virtual currency for free, in exchange for real currency, or as a promotion. Redeeming means withdrawing the virtual currency from circulation, whether in exchange for in\\-game/in\\-app items or features, real\\-world goods or services, or real currency, or otherwise.\n\nAnd more specifically, \n\n> An administrator would be a money transmitter, however, only if the virtual currency it issues and redeems is a CVC. FinCEN defines a CVC as a virtual currency that either (1\\) has an equivalent value in real currency or (2\\) acts as a substitute for real currency.\n\nBased on that, would you say that a company like Listia would be considered a \"Money Transmitter\" and that they are required to implement a BSA/AML program? Would companies building a similar marketplace today be considered as such? Is the information provided in the quotes correct?\n\nNote that Listia now uses the cryptocurrency XNK, prior to this, however, they used Lista Credits, a virtual in\\-app only currency.\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a \"how things are in practice\" answer, not statutory. \n\nThe ruling question is whether the virtual currencies *are readily exchangeable for USD*. \n\nFor instance if there is a thriving, open currency exchange where I can convert 1000 World of Warcraft gold into 1 USD and back again anytime I please, then WoW gold takes on the character of a foreign currency, and Blizzard Entertainment finds themselves in the shoes of a money transmitter, *and all that implies*, including the need to prevent the platform from being used to launder or traffick money. **That's a big part of why Blizzard works so hard to stop gold selling**, and why features like \"WoW Tokens\" (buying game time with in\\-game gold) are so convoluted.\n\n*Blizzard knows they can't enforce absolutely: gold\\-for\\-real\\-money does indeed happen, but by making a serious effort to stop third\\-party trading, they keep Treasury off their back. This is typical of how capricious this field is, and how \"laws as written\" provide little practical guidance.*\n\nWith in\\-game virtual currencies, game platform developers want USD to turn into those currencies, and not become USD again. This solves the \"money transmitter\" problem. (It also complies with the [First Rule of Acquisition](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition): *Once you have their money, never give it back.*) \n\nIt sounds like before, Listia was managing their program like a \"credit card rewards program\" or an \"airline miles program\". You could redeem for purchases but not USD. (The problem came if the purchases were easily fungible to cash, e.g. Krugerrands, Bally's casino chips, or Visa gift cards). \n\n* Very often, this is scammish in that the \"great values\" are in fact cheap Chinese junk (if they sell iPads those are fairly fungible; selling unresaleable junk moves them even further away from being a money transmitter), and/or\n* they charge you retail UPS shipping, and handling too, while they *pay* UPS's best volume discount rate.\n\n**There is no substitute for having good legal advice and keeping up with the trends of what is happening in the in\\-game\\-currency field.

This would be based on your friend being the actual father, and the non\\-mother not having adopted the child (extinguishing the obligations of the father). Many states, but not Michigan, have adopted the Uniform Parentage Act which covers assisted reproduction, but even in those states, this does not constitute assisted reproduction. The \"agreement\" is legally invalid (surrogate parentage contracts are [unenforceable](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(az2hzlgpudqfozvvzec0a2n3))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectName=mcl-act-199-of-1988)), and that, folks, is why you should hire an attorney rather than devising a legal theory on your own.\n\n[This article](https://www.icle.org/modules/books/chapter.aspx?chapter=13&book=2020553510&lib=family&partdisplayed=2&from=store) summarizes the various paternity laws of Michigan. Under the [Paternity Act](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(fhfblzdrgwa0cpysgkxqlykp))/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectname=mcl-722-711), this may be a child born out of wedlock, if the child is\n\n> a child begotten and born to a woman who was not married from the\n> conception to the date of birth of the child, or a child that the\n> court has determined to be a child born or conceived during a marriage\n> but not\n> *the issue of that marriage*\n\nwhere the meaning of the last expression would have to be determined by the court. Probably the court would say \"this child is not the 'issue' of the marriage\", given legislative intent. Under the [Acknowledgment of Parentage Act](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(oj2s2t0izrcixpt0y53jirgj))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Act-305-of-1996), unmarried parent can by signing a statement \"define\" the parentage of a child, but the statute is specifically limited to a man acknowledging paternity, and cannot apply to a lesbian couple.\n\nThe clearest statement of the law of parentage for lesbian couples in Michigan is [Lefever v.

An important distinguishing feature is that in this case, the woman at a statutory disadvantage sought parental rights, whereas your question is about a legal parent seeking to avoid a legal obligation to the child.

(This hate can be documented. The mutual hate may be simply because of the groups they belong to.) They both bring guns to an encounter.\n* X shoots a Y but misses. Y shoots back at X but misses.\n* Although X intended to outright murder Y on his first shot, he now has a self\\-defense claim if he kills Y on his 2nd shot, because Y just shot at him.\n* Further, even the first shot of X becomes debatable, because what he was supposed to do if e.g. he (claims he) saw Y raise his gun at him? After all, Y did fire his gun so that makes it more likely he might have fired first anyway.\n\nBasically, is something like that that explains most prosecutorial decisions to abandon charges in such mutual gun fights, e.g. between rival gangs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In a situation with two suspects where one of them committed a crime, the prosecution has to prove which one is guilty. They can't just prosecute both. If they can't identify the guilty party then both have to go free.\n\nIn the case of a gunfight where both parties claim self defence, one of them is probably lying, but unless the prosecution can bring evidence to prove that one of them started the fight they can't prove that either is guilty.\n\nAnd of course there might be situations under some legal frameworks, especially in \"[stand your ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law)\" states, where both of them *might* have acted in self defence.\n\nStatement by Mr Bloggs:\n\n> Smith was walking towards me, shouting in an aggressive manner.

In complex gunfight scenarios with multiple armed participants, prosecutors often face significant challenges in proving beyond a reasonable doubt who initiated the violence or fired the fatal shots. This difficulty in establishing clear culpability can lead to abandoning charges against all parties.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because \"mutual combat\" is not a universally accepted legal justification and is often considered an abuse of the term in these scenarios.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because prosecutors cannot simply charge all participants without sufficient evidence against specific individuals. They must prove guilt for each person charged.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while stand-your-ground laws may complicate prosecution in some cases, they do not automatically exempt all participants from prosecution in a mass gunfight scenario.\n\nThe key factor, as highlighted in the Waco 2015 case, is the prosecutorial burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which becomes extremely challenging in chaotic, multi-party gunfights where evidence may be inconclusive or contradictory."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/61245/make-my-day-in-the-office", "docs_id": 61245, "title": "Make my Day... in the office?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Assume Adam, Esquire, is working in Colorado. He has an office different from his home. Let's say Downtown in a sleepy town that has no extra gun control laws.

His trusty Taurus Public Defender is sitting on a pile of files next to him.\n\nButch decides that he wants to break into the office of Mr. Adam to try and steal something. Butch picks the lock and sneaks into the front room of the office. He entered from the back of the building and didn't see the light, so is not suspecting someone would be there. As a result, he isn't very silent.\n\nAdam hears the commotion and guns Butch down with a snarky remark of \"Make my Day\".\n\nHe knew that Butch committed trespassing besides the breaking and entering \\- nobody is allowed to be there but him after closure.

(1\\) says that :\n\n> The general assembly hereby recognizes that the citizens of Colorado have a right to expect absolute safety **within their own homes.** (\\*emphasis added)\n\nSubsections (2\\), (3\\), and (4\\) all refer to \"any occupant of a dwelling\" as the class authorized to use force by this section. An offie is not a dwelling.\n\n[Section 18\\-1\\-901\\.

It is highly questionable that \"a lesser degree of force is inadequate\". Any conclusion that the intruder represents an \"imminent use of unlawful physical force\" seems dubious, but I can't say what a court might find.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of Adam's actions?\n\nA) Adam's use of deadly force is fully justified under the \"Make My Day\" law, as his office is considered an extension of his dwelling.\n\nB) Adam cannot claim protection under the \"Make My Day\" law, but his actions are clearly justified under Colorado's general self-defense statutes.\n\nC) Adam cannot claim protection under the \"Make My Day\" law, and his use of deadly force is likely not justified under other self-defense laws given the circumstances.\n\nD) The \"Make My Day\" law applies to Adam's office during after-hours, providing him the same protections as if he were in his home.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The \"Make My Day\" law (CRS 18-1-704.5) specifically applies to dwellings, defined as buildings used for habitation. Adam's office does not qualify as a dwelling, so this law does not apply. Under the general self-defense statute (18-1-704), the use of deadly force requires a reasonable belief that lesser force is inadequate and that there is imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. Given that Butch was not aware of Adam's presence and had not directly threatened him, it's questionable whether Adam's use of deadly force meets these criteria. While Adam might argue he felt threatened, the circumstances suggest his response may have been disproportionate to the actual threat, making his actions potentially unjustified under Colorado's self-defense laws."}}
