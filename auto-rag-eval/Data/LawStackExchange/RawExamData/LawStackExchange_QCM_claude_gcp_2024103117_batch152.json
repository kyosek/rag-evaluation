Sharing the IP address with the victim to aid in identifying and potentially stopping the harasser is unlikely to be considered a violation of the harasser's privacy rights. The harasser used the platform's services to engage in harmful behavior, and the IP address was logged as part of the platform's normal security measures.

Or are there general protections because we're married?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a difference between \"idea\" and \"invention\". Only an invention is subject to being patented, thus becoming an enforceable property right. Disclosing ideas, without restrictions, can quickly mean you lose any control over resulting inventions. No, marriage does not automatically imply ownership of ideas of the spouse, let alone inventorship.\n\nHypothetically, under US law, each inventor must file an oath and declaration regarding inventorship of the invention disclosed and claimed in the application for a patent. Where an inventor has a legal obligation to the employer to cooperate in such things, but refuses, there are other ways to file a substitute.\n\nHowever, where the inventor is independent, the employer has no inherent ownership claim and the inventor has no obligation to sign anything. \n\nIf, on the other hand, the \"idea\" is prematurely disclosed to others, outside of fiduciary or other obligations of confidentiality, such others could proceed to make their own invention, using their own inventors, and file and claim the patent advantages of that invention without regard to where they obtained the initial idea.\n\nOne major goal of the patent system is to reward the disclosure of \"new and useful\" inventions to the public (in the form of a patent application), in exchange for a \"limited right\" of the inventors to reap the financial advantages, once the invention is deemed patentable. Under current laws, the \"first to file\" a claim to the invention is presumed to be \"the inventor\".\n\nA less wooly analysis might be had from experts in the Ask Patents area of this site.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John, an employee at a tech company in Boston, has a brilliant idea for a medical device.

The documentation clearly states that marriage does not automatically imply ownership of ideas or inventorship between spouses. Additionally, disclosing ideas without restrictions can lead to loss of control over resulting inventions. Therefore, John should take precautions, such as having Sarah sign a non-disclosure agreement, before discussing his idea with her. This would help protect his idea from potential claims by Sarah's employer or others.\n\nOption A is incorrect because marriage does not provide automatic protection for shared ideas. Option B is mistaken because even without a patent application, discussing the idea without precautions could risk ownership.

Does this change the issue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is going to depend a good deal on there exact nature of the clips being reused. it will also depend, at least somewhat, on what country or countries the various parties are in.\n\n**General Principle**\n---------------------\n\nThe general principle is that a peerson's post on social media is protected by copyright, just as all original works are. It is a copyright infringement to copy and redistribute the, **unless** permission has been granted by the copyright holder (normally the author in the case of a social media post, as those are rarely sold) or an exception to copyright applies.\n\n**Permission**\n--------------\n\nThere are various ways in which permission might be granted. \n\nThe re\\-user might directly email (or otherwise reach out to) the original author and **ask**, and be granted permission.\n\nThe original author might have released some or all of his or her posts under a permissive license.\n\nSome social media might **require** that posts be released under a permissive license, or otherwise automatically grant such permissions. Remember that Wikipedia, for example, mandates that all posts and contributions be released under a CC\\-BY\\-SA license, although posters have the option to add an additional alternate license, or more than one. \n\n**Exceptions**\n--------------\n\nThe most obvious exception is Fair use, **if** the parties are (or at least the re\\-user is) in the US. People sometimes speak as if fair use is a world\\-wide legal rule. it is a very specifically US legal concept. Some other countries have a somewhat similar concept, known in English as \"Fair Dealing\". It is, i understand, rather moore limited than fair use. [This law.se question and its answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/) discusses fair use in some detail.\n\nMost of the posts being reused here have no market, and so their re\\-use cannot harm the market. That would weigh for fair use. If the re\\-user uses the whole post, or a substantial part of it, that would weigh against fair use. If the re\\-user inserts significant comment on each re\\-used post, that would be analytical if not transformational, and would weigh for fair use. If the re\\-use is monetized, that would weigh against fair use somewhat.\n\nIn short, we cn't tell in general if fair use would apply to any particular post being re\\-used. it might or it might not. Specifics will control, and ultimately it is a judgement call to eb made by a court, if the matter comes to that.\n\n**Enforcement**\n---------------\n\nUnless the copyright holder for a given post files an infringement suit, or files a take\\-down notice, or complains to the host site, there will be no enforcement and no consequences. If a complaint or a take\\-down is filed, the host could remove the content, cancel the re\\-user's account, or both. If the user has monetized the re\\-use, ad revenue can be redirected to the copyright owner. \n\nIf the copyright holder files an infringement suit, and wins, there will be an award of damages, which might be quite small, or rather large. But with no market for the original, and probably little or no income from the re\\-use, low damages are more likely than high. And the original copyright holder would have filing fees, legal expenses, and possibly other expenses in advance.\n\nThere are firms with which one can register one's copyrighted work, who search for it being improperly used and take action, in return for a small up\\-front fee and a share of any damages recovered. But posters of general opinion on social media seem unlikely to use such services.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nSuch a \u201cSocial Media Reacts\u201d\\-video is somewhat risky, from a copyright perspective, but the **likely** negative outcomes are not large.

In this scenario, option C is the most legally justifiable action because it directly relates to the quality and completeness of the work product, which is what the contractor is hired to deliver.\n\nOption A is problematic because it focuses on the method rather than the outcome. If the transcript meets quality standards, the choice of software shouldn't affect payment.\n\nOption B, while possibly good for contractor relations, isn't necessarily what's required legally. The company could justifiably reduce payment for missed deadlines if that's part of the contract.\n\nOption D incorrectly applies employee-like standards to a contractor relationship by focusing on time spent rather than the quality of the output.\n\nThe correct answer, C, aligns with the principle that independent contractors are paid based on their performance and the quality of their work product, not the process or time invested."}, "9": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31620/what-incentives-cynical-reasons-da-cops-have-when-prosecuting-someone", "docs_id": 31620, "title": "What &quot;incentives&quot;/cynical reasons DA/Cops have when prosecuting someone?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I read that many laws are unenforced.

This depends on the place and date of publication. In many countries copyright now lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. Some countries use different rules. In the US, a work published before 1978 is in most cases copyrighted for 95 years. Works published after that are protected for 70 years after the death of the author. More complex cases are detailed in [this well\\-known chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain).\n\nWho holds the Copyright?\n========================\n\nFor most novels, copyright is initially held by the author(s). The author may sell or give away the copyright at any time. If the author does not transfer the copyright during life, it will pass with other property st the author's death. It may pass by will or by default (intestate) inheritance in the absence of a will. The author's surviving spouse children, if any, are often the heirs to any copyrights, but not always. Authors with many works still in print may have s \"literary estate\" set up to handle their copyrights.\n\nWorks with multiple co\\-authors usually have the copyright shared between all authors; in equal shares unless they agree otherwise. Any one copyright holder may license a derivative work such as a translation.\n\nA would\\-be translator of a work still under copyright must find the copyright holder(s) and obtain permission. If the holders cannot be found, no permission can be obtained, and any translation would be an infringement of copyright. The copyright holder could sue for damages after publication. Damages may be quite substantial in some cases. This varies by country and by the facts of the case.\n\nIn the US The [Federal Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/)  will search its records to try to determine who holds a copyright. They charge a fee for doing so, and success is not guaranteed. Other countries may have similar services.\n\n**Addition**:\nThere is no automatic or guaranteed way to find who now owns a copyright. In some cases the owner does not even know that s/he owns the copyright. If the holder died without heirs the copyright may belong to the government (state government in the US).\n\nResearch into the author's life may reveal probable heirs. An obituary may list the author's children, if any.

Which of the following statements is the MOST accurate regarding the copyright situation and the translator's next steps?\n\nA) The translator can freely translate the work since the original author is deceased and the publishing house no longer exists.\n\nB) The translator must first determine if the work is still under copyright by checking the publication date and country of origin, then locate the current copyright holder if applicable.\n\nC) The translator should contact the Federal Copyright Office, which will automatically grant permission for the translation.\n\nD) Copyright always expires 70 years after an author's death, so the translator only needs to verify the date of the author's passing.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most accurate course of action is to first determine if the work is still under copyright protection. This depends on factors such as the country of publication and the publication date. In many countries, copyright lasts for 70 years after the author's death, but there are variations. For example, in the US, works published before 1978 are typically copyrighted for 95 years.\n\nIf the work is still under copyright, the translator must locate the current copyright holder to obtain permission. This could be the author's heirs, a literary estate, or another entity that acquired the rights. The fact that the original publishing house no longer exists doesn't automatically place the work in the public domain.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the author's death and the publishing house's non-existence don't automatically terminate copyright. Option C is wrong because the Federal Copyright Office doesn't grant translation permissions; they can only assist in searching for copyright holders. Option D oversimplifies copyright duration and doesn't account for variations in international copyright law."}, "12": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/81603/is-it-legal-to-write-a-check-that-will-bounce-and-leave-it-in-a-public-place", "docs_id": 81603, "title": "Is it legal to write a check that will bounce and leave it in a public place?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: John Doe, who has $50 in his checking account, write a check to CASH for $1,000,000 and signed it, then left the check in a public place.

Only a court can answer that. I can give you general information about laws involving destruction of mail.\n\nUnder [18 USC 1703](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1703):\n\n> Whoever, being a Postal Service officer or employee, unlawfully secretes, destroys, detains, delays, or opens any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail entrusted to him or which shall come into his possession, and which was intended to be conveyed by mail, or carried or delivered by any carrier or other employee of the Postal Service, or forwarded through or delivered from any post office or station thereof established by authority of the Postmaster General or the Postal Service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nSo it would generally be a crime to deliberately destroy or delay mail that was otherwise deliverable.\n\nIf a carrier took back mail that should have been delivered, that would probably count as \"detaining\" or \"delaying\" that mail. In the case at hand, though, I suppose the carrier might argue that when you refused to sign for the letter, it gave her reason to doubt that the addressee(s) actually lived there, in which case perhaps the mail should not have been delivered after all. So she might say that she took it all back to the post office for further investigation as to where or whether it should be delivered.\n\nDestroying the mail would similarly be illegal. However, based on other information in your question that is now removed, it appears that she did not actually do so. Merely *threatening* to destroy mail, if the threat is not carried out, does not seem to be a crime under this section. I don't know whether it might be prohibited by some other statute.\n\nCrimes involving mail are normally investigated by the [US Postal Inspection Service](https://www.uspis.gov/), not by local police.\n\nOf course, even if the behavior is not a crime, it may still be cause for the postal employee to be fired or otherwise disciplined.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to 18 USC 1703, which of the following actions by a postal employee would NOT be considered a criminal offense?\n\nA) Secretly opening a package intended to be delivered by mail\nB) Delaying the delivery of a letter without lawful reason\nC) Threatening to destroy mail but not actually doing so\nD) Deliberately destroying a postal card entrusted to them\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) Secretly opening a package intended for delivery is explicitly mentioned as a criminal offense under 18 USC 1703.\nB) Delaying the delivery of mail without lawful reason is also specifically listed as an offense in the statute.\nC) While threatening to destroy mail is unprofessional and could lead to disciplinary action, the mere threat without action is not explicitly criminalized under 18 USC 1703. The law focuses on actual destruction, detention, or delay of mail, not threats.\nD) Deliberately destroying a postal card entrusted to a postal employee is clearly stated as a criminal offense in the statute.\n\nThe correct answer is C because the law does not specifically criminalize threats to destroy mail if not carried out, whereas the other options are explicitly mentioned as criminal offenses in 18 USC 1703."}, "14": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/93451/does-the-sale-of-goods-act-continue-to-be-applicable-to-second-hand-items-bought", "docs_id": 93451, "title": "Does the Sale of Goods Act continue to be applicable to second-hand items bought from private individuals rather than professional traders in 2023?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been told that the Consumer Rights Act 2015 only supersedes the Sale of Goods Act 1979 for second\\-hand items bought from companies, and not ones bought from individuals.

In Finland where I'm from, the charge for causing a death in any way is always a criminal charge; you can't start a civil suit over it (as far as I know).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: They are two different courts, with different standards of proof. In a criminal court, the standard of proof is \"guilty beyond any reasonable doubt\". In a civil court, the standard of proof is \"more likely guilty than not guilty\".

The state doesn't suffer any injustice if you are not convicted, and the state is very powerful, that's why the standard of proof is high. In a civil court, you have often two private persons fighting it out.

Simpson was found liable in civil court but not guilty in criminal court.\n\nD) In both criminal and civil courts, the state is always the plaintiff, but civil courts allow for monetary compensation to victims.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Criminal and civil courts use different standards of proof, which can lead to different outcomes in related cases. In criminal courts, the prosecution must prove guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" which is a very high standard. In civil courts, the plaintiff must prove liability by a \"preponderance of the evidence,\" which means it's more likely than not (over 50% likelihood) that the defendant is responsible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while it's true that civil courts allow for monetary damages and criminal courts typically involve imprisonment, they do not use the same standard of proof.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it reverses the standards of proof. Criminal courts actually have a higher standard of proof than civil courts.\n\nOption D is incorrect because in civil courts, the plaintiff is often a private individual or entity, not the state. Additionally, while civil courts do allow for monetary compensation, this is not the distinguishing factor between criminal and civil courts.\n\nThis difference in standards of proof explains why O.J.

This is for a research project lasting one year with the question to what extent does cognitive bias play a role in court/businesses?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The law doesn't directly address mental states, it addresses actions, and a law may (or may not) have a \"mental state\" requirement as part of the determination of liability. For example, abstractly hating a person for their race is not a crime and you cannot be sued for abstractly hating a person because of their race, but you can be punished or made to pay damages because of your actions \u2013 beating them or refusing to sell to them \u2013 and that mental state may figure into the determination of guilt. There are [hate crimes laws](http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.36.080) in the US whereby criminal actions are given stiffer punishments, where in Washington the distinguishing element is motivation: \"because of his or her perception of the victim's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or mental, physical, or sensory handicap\". The government must prove that the victim was assaulted because of his race, and not because the assailant thought the victim was an easy mark. This is an instance of the popular concept of \"bias\".\n\nCognitive bias, however, is extremely broad, and there are literally hundreds of possible answers. For example, cognitive bias figures into visual perception (let's say of color), which means the law has to have a way to deal with eyewitness testimony. Expert testimony could introduce reasonable doubt as to the reliability of witness testimony based on scientific testimony to the effect that humans have a cognitive bias in a particular direction, which may show that the eyewitness testimony is unreliable. What the law has to deal with is whether such scientific testimony is pertinent (admissible). There is a body of law surrounding the [Daubert Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daubert_standard) which answers that question. The key here is that the attorney has to know to call up an appropriate expert witness to impeach eyewitness testimony. Or circumstantial evidence, when the evidence is based on a subjective assessment by an expert (that is, when a lab tech makes a professional judgment as to fact, such as whether this voiceprint matches that voiceprint).\n\nCognitive bias is a fact of human psychology and is not punished.

This aligns with the information provided about using scientific testimony to introduce reasonable doubt about the reliability of eyewitness accounts. This approach follows the Daubert Standard for admitting expert scientific testimony in court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no indication of bias from the judge, and unconscious bias alone is not grounds for recusal.

It was patented in US. I have few questions:\n\n1. *Basics* Although it is patented in US, is it \"working\" worldwide? Could two countries have the same patent from different inventors? When someone brings patent to patent service in his country, the patent service will check if there same patent anywhere in the world?\n2. *Basics* If last sentence is false, \\- if someone from country A stole patent from country B, then inventor from country B should go to country A court?\n3. How (US) law describes expiration of patent? What does it mean? Can it be repatented? Can anyone free use expired patent?\n4. In the page I provided the status of patent is `Expired - Fee Related` \\- was does it mean?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For the first question \\- **No, patents are territorial**. A US patent is not \"working\" anywhere else. Of course one can apply in multiple countries if the proper time frames and procedures are followed. There is a mechanism (PCT Treaty) that allows a straightforward way to *apply* in over a 140 countries simultaneously. Although it is frequently used, it is expensive to continue to prosecute the application in each place and even in high\\-value inventions only a handful of places are eventually chosen to actually pursue patents. Each country's/region's laws and processes are different and success in patenting can vary.\n\nNormally two countries would not have the same thing patented by different inventors. The patenting or publication of the first one would make it prior art to the second filed one. This should be found by the second examiner and stop a duplicate patent by a second inventor. However there can be subtle differences between similar inventions and mistakes do happen. In the case of true simultaneous invention this can happen.\n\nTo get a patent, the invention must be novel \\- that means no one has published or patented it anywhere in the world at any time in any language. Before the AIA law in the U.S. the law said \"or known in this country\". It could have made a loophole where something was known publicly elsewhere but did not constitute prior art in the U.S. That is now changed to be world\\-wide.\n\nEven if the examiner does a world wide search they might miss something and a patent might get issued even though the invention was not novel and a patent elsewhere is granted. To invalidate it the original patent owner would need to look into available procedures in country A. It might be court or it might be administrative.\n\nIn most places an annual \u201crenewal\u201d fee must be paid to keep a patent in\\-force. In the U.S. a \u201cmaintenance\u201d fee must be paid at the 3\\.5 year, 7\\.5 year and 7\\.5 year points in order to stay in\\-force.\n\nA patent who\u2019s renewal or maintenance fee hasn\u2019t been paid is expired for fee reasons. That can imply that it can be revived by the *patent owner* by paying the fees and usually a penalty. There may be a time limit or a small set of allowable circumstances to revive.\n\nA patent labeled expired for fee reasons might now be past its normal lifespan and therefore not revivable.\n\nIn general patents are given to inventors and those an inventor assigns their rights to.

Option A is incorrect because patents are territorial and do not automatically provide worldwide protection. Option B is incorrect because while patents are territorial, prior art is considered globally, so the earlier Japanese filing could potentially affect the US application. Option C is incorrect because patent offices don't automatically know about or consider foreign filings unless they've been published or submitted via specific international procedures.\n\nOption D is the most accurate. The American company can potentially obtain a US patent, as they independently developed the invention. However, they may face challenges if the Japanese company filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application within the 6-month period between the two filings.

Cars that are rented to customers for insurance reasons (accidents, etc) are supposed to match the size of the car that was damaged as close as possible. I'm speaking for one rental car company in particular here but I'm assuming others have a similar policy but every 2 years old the car is it goes down a size in rental. So your 2014 would and could be considered a \"standard\" size or even \"compact depending\" on what is available on that rental lot or how that agent is feeling. \n\nWith that being said, I've seen customers complain to insurance companies to get bigger cars sizes or even pay out of pocket for larger vehicles. In most insurance rental situations, the company provides \"X\" amount of dollars per day, generally between $20\\-25\\. These insurance companies have deals with rental agencies to secure rates that align with these low daily costs \\- the same car they get for $20 a day would cost a walk in customer double or triple that.

To legally own the truck, John must go through the proper channels to transfer the title.

With that said, in movies you'll rarely see the person asking the question get to respond to the objection, but you'll notice in the trial that happens in most cases. For example, if one party objects that a question calls for hearsay, the examiner may defend their question by pointing out that the statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, or that it falls into one of the hearsay exceptions.

I've researched placing a lien or garnishing wages on the individual but can you do that against a company?\n\nJurisdiction: NV, US\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, you should simply **write them a letter demanding payment of the judgment**. You can keep sending them demand letters updating the interest on the judgment regularly (e.g. every month) and call them demanding to be paid on a regular basis so that your claim is annoying to them.\n\nSecond, you can **use legal tools at your disposal**. In the approximate order of the likelihood that you would resort to them and the ease of using them, these are:\n\n1. You can record a judgment lien against any real property it owns, if any. This must be cleared when the property is sold and hurts the credit record of the company. You can also foreclosed on the lien although doing so involve quite a bit of legal technicalities and process and may require you to assume or pay off mortgages and liens higher in priority than your own. Basically, this involves getting the right kind of proof that the judgment was entered (in Colorado one gets a \"transcript of judgment\" from the clerk, but Nevada process may vary) and recording it in the real property records of the county where the real estate owned by the company is located.\n2. You can garnish its bank accounts, if you know where the company banks, if not, you can learn this in the next step. This involves filling out a garnishment form (which may need a clerk of court's stamp) and then mailing it to the judgment\\-debtor and the bank (local practice might require a process server to deliver it).\n3. You can issue interrogatories or take depositions of corporate officials to have them disclose what assets and sources of income it has (pursuant to Rule of Civil Procedure 69\\). This is somewhat of an involved process with legal rules and forms involved but if you don't know where the company has assets, you have few other choices but to do this and it gets their attention as well. You could also hire a private investigator to try to locate the company's assets.\n4. You can obtain a writ of execution and attachment to have the sheriff seize tangible personal property belonging to the company. This involves multiple court form filings, fees, and coordination with the civil division of the sheriff's department that will often require you to post a liability bond, to hire people to carry away the property to a secure storage unit when it is seized for later auction, and for you to pay to publish notice of a sheriff's sale with a newspaper authorized to give legal notices. It may also require you to hire a locksmith and/or some to document the assets seized and to value them in real time during the seizure.\n5. You can garnish accounts payable to the company from individuals and businesses who owe it money. The paperwork is similar to a bank account garnishment but it often doesn't go as smoothly and has to be more actively litigated since non\\-bank persons aren't as familiar with the process.\n6. If you learn through Step 3 that the company has transferred assets to its owners or others while insolvent without receiving reasonably equivalent value in exchange, you can sue the recipient of the assets under the fraudulent transfers act in a separate lawsuit. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n7. In an extreme case (probably not justified by a small claims court judgment) you have force the judicial dissolution of the company and liquidation of its assets for failure to pay its debts in a separation lawsuit. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n8. In combination with other creditors of the company who are also unpaid, you can force the company into an involuntary bankruptcy. This is almost impossible to do successfully without a lawyer.\n9. Wait for the company to go bankrupt (if this is likely) and file a claim in the bankruptcy. This involves filling out a one or two page form and filing it with the bankruptcy court.\n\nIn my experience in Colorado which has similar rules on this subject, companies with real estate usually pay upon demand (especially if they have a mortgage since an unsatisfied judgment is a condition of default on most business mortgages). But, if the company owns no real estate, commencing collections actions combination of 2, 3 and 4 is usually sufficient to get the company to simply pay the judgment without having to take the processes involved to completion.\n\nThis said, most of the options above involve fairly complicated paper work and procedural requirements. The average person who doesn't have a graduate degree or a business background would really struggle to do it right and there are sometimes significant fees involved.\n\nThird, you can use other methods that don't involve the legal process that involve **notifying people of their non\\-payment of a judgment**.\n\nOne trick is to learn who it has major contracts like leases and large loans with, and advise them that there is an outstanding judgment against the company, which is often a condition of default under those contract that must be cured quickly.\n\nSimilarly, complaining about the company's non\\-payment of the judgment on customer review sites and social media can work sometimes.\n\nFourth, you can **hire someone to do it for you**. Often lawyers and collection agencies are more willing to collect a true money judgment from a court than they are to take on a claim that hasn't yet been reduced to judgment and will have to be litigated.\n\nSo, because it is so technically difficult to enforce your legal rights without a lawyer, even if you obtained the small claims court judgment without a lawyer, it may be worth the money to hire a lawyer to collect the judgment obtained, or to turn the judgment over to a collection agency (which also hurts the company's credit record) and to pay what that costs.\n\nOn a contingent fee basis, a 33%\\-50% contingent fee would be customary. Hourly legal fees can run from $150 to $450 per hour in Nevada for this kind of work and it would take at least several hours of work.\n\nIf the judgment is too small, it may not be cost effective to hire anyone to collect it on an hourly basis, and even collection agencies may decline to take on the case on a contingent fee basis because the work required would cost them more than the fee they would obtain if they won.\n\nIn the case of a small claims court judgment that isn't very large it is often not cost effective or worth your time and effort to pursue it actively.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John has won a small claims court case against XYZ Corp in Nevada, but the company is refusing to pay the judgment.

What about backups that go beyond the *subject* realm (e.g. database backups, disk backups, ...)? \n\nOne idea to solve a part of the problem would be to [crypto\\-shred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-shredding) data. So when a *subject* asks to erase him/her *personal data*, we simply **erase the encryption key**. That would render all data unusable. However, data encrypted with what is considered a strong encryption method might not be strong anymore in a not\\-so\\-distant future (e.g. quantum computing, new algorithms, or a weakness found in the encryption mechanism).\n\nSo here are my questions:\n\n1. Is crypto\\-shredding considered a valid erasure method?\n2. What storage mediums are affected by the so\\-called **undue delay**?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In my opinion, this should be enough. The GDPR regulation is general \\- it does not attempt to address these issues directly, precisely for the reasons we see here: You can never predict how the technology will develop.\nWhen interpreting the GDPR, we must keep the intended goal in mind. What is the purpose of the \"right to erasure\"? To prevent anyone from further processing the personal data. If you \"crypto\\-shred\" it, it can't be processed anymore, not even theoretically. The encryptec file cannot be used to identify the subject, therefore it is not even personal data anymore.\n\nIn case it can be decrypted in the future... Well, that is just a speculation. The courts can go to great lengths in interpreting what personal data is (dynamic IP address is considered personal data, since it can be linked to a person by the police with a court order), but i am pretty sure that \"it can be theoretically possible in some distant future\" is beyond the limit.\n\nAs for the second question, I am not aware of any applicable case\\-law, but I guess that current security and technological standards will be used to assess the delay. You have a right to protect your data, the subject has a right to erase them. Those rights must be balanced, neither fully overrules the other.\nThe delay should be short enough so the right to erasure is effective, and it should not extremely long compared to other (economically viable) backup solutions available, in line with current industrial standards.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the GDPR's right to erasure, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of crypto-shredding as a method of data erasure?\n\nA) Crypto-shredding is explicitly prohibited by the GDPR as it does not physically delete the data.\n\nB) Crypto-shredding is considered a valid erasure method as it renders the data unusable and unidentifiable, fulfilling the purpose of the right to erasure.\n\nC) Crypto-shredding is only acceptable if the encryption method used can withstand potential future decryption attempts, such as those using quantum computing.\n\nD) Crypto-shredding is not mentioned in the GDPR and therefore cannot be considered a valid erasure method under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The answer is B because, as explained in the documentation, crypto-shredding effectively prevents further processing of personal data, which is the main goal of the right to erasure. By encrypting the data and then erasing the encryption key, the data becomes unusable and can no longer be used to identify the subject, thus no longer qualifying as personal data. While future decryption possibilities are speculative, courts are unlikely to consider theoretical future possibilities when interpreting current compliance with the GDPR.

'On the same occasion' is interpreted by the court. I'm not aware of any case law on this point, so a court will be able to apply its discretion. \n\nNote that this only applies to the penalty point aspect of the *sentence*: the convictions will all stand, and any fines awarded as a result are not subject to the same rule. \n\nOf course the police may use their own discretion and charge a subset of the offences actually detected. \n\n**A short glossary**\n\n* **endorsement** means that the offender's licence will be 'endorsed' with a number of penalty points.\n* **penalty points** are recorded on the driver's record at DVSA and expire after a number of years, depending on why they were awarded.
