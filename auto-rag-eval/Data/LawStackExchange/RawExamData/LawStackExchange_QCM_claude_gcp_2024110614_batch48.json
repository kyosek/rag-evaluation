[The document](https://support.avast.com/en-ph/article/170/#idt_055) states:\n\n> Each time you run a Network Inspector scan, you are prompted to select if the network you are currently connected to is Home or Public. Network Inspector scans for different issues and offers different solutions depending on the network type, so it is important to select the correct option:\n> \n> \n> * Home: Scan a private network that you own (such as your home network).\n> * Public: Scan a network that you do not own. This may be a public Wi\\-Fi network, or a work or school network that is managed by a separate network administrator.\n\nThe document does not detail what scans are different on a \"Home\" network, but it might well be that scans which would constitute unauthorized invasions are not run on \"public\" networks.\n\nCFAA\n----\n\nIn the US, anti\\-hacking l;aw is largely included in the [The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act), which has been codified at [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1030](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1030)The CFAA has been amended several times since 1984, each time broadening its reach.\n\nSection 1030 prohibits unauthorized access to a \"protected computer\" under any of several conditions, and also prohibits unauthorized obtaining of information from a \"protected computer\".\n\nProtected Computer\n------------------\n\nSection 1030 (e)(2\\) defines \"protected computer:\n\n> (e) (2\\) the term \u201cprotected computer\u201d means a computer\u2014  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (A) exclusively for the use of a financial institution or the United States Government, or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, used by or for a financial institution or the United States Government and the conduct constituting the offense affects that use by or for the financial institution or the Government;\n> \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (B) which is used in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or communication, including a computer located outside the United States that is used in a manner that affects interstate or foreign commerce or communication of the United States; or\n> \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) that\u2014  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (i) is part of a voting system; and  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii)  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii) (I) is used for the management, support, or administration of a Federal election; or  \n> \n> (e) (2\\) (C) (ii) (II) has moved in or otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce;\n\nOriginally only subsection (e)(2\\)(A) was part of the CFAA, and the act onloy applied to computers owned or used by the US Federal government, or by banks and simialr financial institutions. The addition of subsections (e)(2\\)(B) and (e)(2\\)(C) has broadened the scope of the CFAA significantly. The development of the internet, so that almost all data on the internet has traveled or is likely to travel across state lines, means that almost every computer with an internet connection can be regarded as a \"protected computer\" under the CFAA, including most cell phones. The CFAA has thus become a general anti\\-hacking act.\n\nOffenses\n--------\n\nSection 1030 defies several offenses, which I summarize here: unauthorized disclosure of information obtained from a protected computer (subsection (a)(1\\)); obtaining information from a protected computer without proper authorization (subsection (a)(2\\)); unauthorized access to certain protected computers (subsection (a)(3\\)); fraud, that is using unauthorized access to commit fraud, further any fraudulent scheme, or fraudulently obtain any benefit or thing of value (subsection (a)(4\\)); transmitting malware (subsection (a)(5\\)(A)); causing damage, whether recklessly or not (subsections (a)(5\\)(B) \\& (a)(5\\)(C)); selling passwords and access codes (subsection (a)(6\\)); transmitting ransomware or threats to damage a protested computer or interfere with its operation (subsection (a)(7\\)).\n\nEach of these subsections has limiting language, and applies only when \\[*emphasis added*]:\n\n* > \\[(a)(1\\)] having **knowingly accessed** a computer without authorization or exceeding authorized access and and by means of such conduct having obtained information that has been determined by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive order or statute to require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or foreign relations, or any restricted data, as defined in paragraph y. of section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, **with reason to believe that such information so obtained could be used to the injury of the United States**, or to the advantage of any foreign nation\n\nIt seems unlikely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute \"knowing access\" or will result in obtaining such protected or restricted data, but if it does, one can avoid criminal liability under (a)(1\\) simply by nt disclosing any such data to any third party.\n\n* > \\[(a)(2\\)] **Intentionally** accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access, and thereby obtains\u2014\n> (A) **information contained in a financial record of a financial institution, or of a card issuer** as defined in section 1602(n)\u202f\\[1] of title 15, or **contained in a file of a consumer reporting agency** on a consumer, as such terms are defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.\n\nIt seems even less likely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute \"intentional access\" or will result in obtaining such financial data. Note that data must be obtained by a perso0n con constitute a violation of (a)(2\\).\n\nHowever (a)(2\\)(C) also prohibits obtaining:\n\n> information from any protected computer;\n\nThis is the potentially broadest subsection. It contains no intent element, and no restriction on which computers it applies to. Even so, it applies only if information is in fact obtained (or under a later subsection there is an attempt to obtain information).\n\n* > \\[(a)(3\\)] **intentionally**, without authorization to access any nonpublic computer **of a department or agency of the United States**, accesses such a computer of that department or agency that is exclusively for the use of the Government of the United States or, in the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, **is used by or for the Government of the United States** and such conduct **affects that use** by or for the Government of the United States; ...\n\nAgain, It seems unlikely that merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute **intentionally** accessing a computer owned or used by the US Federal Government\n\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)] **knowingly** and with **intent to defraud**, accesses a protected computer without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct **furthers the intended fraud** and obtains anything of value,\n\nIt is very hard to see how merely connecting a device with an Avast Security product installed will constitute acting with **intent to defraud**, nor how it will allow the person connecting the device to obtain anything of value fraudulently.\n\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(A)] **knowingly** causes the transmission of a program, information, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, **intentionally causes damage without authorization**, to a protected computer;\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(B)] **intentionally** accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, **recklessly causes damage**;\n* > \\[(a)(4\\)(C)] **intentionally** accesses a protected computer without authorization, and as a result of such conduct, **causes damage and loss**.\n\nAside from subsection (a)(2\\)(C), all the listed offenses require \"knowing\" or \"intentional\" action. Even (a)(2\\)(C) requires proof that the accused intentionally accessed a protected computer without authorization. I am inclined to doubt that merely connecting a device with a publicly sold security product installed would be held to constitute intentional access to other computers on that network, and such intent would need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, just as any other element of any crime.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A user installs Avast security software on their laptop and connects to a public Wi-Fi network at a caf\u00e9.

The correct answer is C because it involves intentional action to access protected information, which is a key element in several CFAA offenses.\n\nOption A is unlikely to result in liability because merely detecting vulnerabilities without accessing or obtaining information is not explicitly prohibited under the CFAA as described.\n\nOption B, while potentially concerning, lacks the intentional element required by most CFAA offenses.

The correct answer, B, is the most comprehensive and legally sound approach. \n\nCreating a detailed credit contract addresses several key points mentioned in the documentation:\n\n1.

The correct answer is B because it balances the California requirement for a neutral party to serve papers with the practical involvement of the plaintiff.\n\nOption A is incorrect because in California, the plaintiff cannot directly serve the defendant. This is to avoid potential confrontations and ensure unbiased testimony about service if disputed.\n\nOption C, while using a non-party to the lawsuit, is likely not acceptable because the administrative assistant is still an employee of the plaintiff company, which doesn't meet the neutrality requirement.\n\nOption D is incorrect because simply mailing the papers, even via certified mail, is generally not sufficient for proper service in most cases.\n\nThe correct option (B) uses a professional process server (neutral party) to actually serve the papers, which satisfies California's requirement.

Probation gives the **employer** the right to terminate employment without cause or reason during the probation period; it gives the **employee** no rights.\n\nIn general, the contract is the contract: if you agreed to pay for training if you leave within the first 12 months then that is what you are legally obliged to do. You may be able to avoid paying for training in Work Health and Safety as in most jurisdictions an employer is legally obliged to provide this without charge.\n\nThat said, **if** the employer misrepresented the role then the contract may be void or voidable \\- this would need real legal advice and **evidence** of the misrepresentation.\n\nAll of that said, if you explain your problem to the employer it is quite likely that you will be able to part ways amicably and without involving the law \\- that would be best all around,", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a high-quality, challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: An employee in the UK is considering leaving their job after 4 months due to misrepresentation of job responsibilities during the hiring process. Their contract states they must pay for training if they resign within a year. Which of the following strategies is most likely to result in a favorable outcome for the employee?\n\nA) Resign immediately and refuse to pay for training, citing the ongoing probation period as justification\nB) Continue working for 8 more months to avoid the training repayment clause, then resign\nC) Seek legal advice to void the contract based on misrepresentation, gathering evidence of the discrepancies between promised and actual job responsibilities\nD) Negotiate with the employer for an amicable separation, explaining the situation and requesting a waiver of the training repayment clause\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation and application of legal principles. Option A is incorrect because probation typically gives rights to the employer, not the employee, and doesn't negate contractual obligations. Option B avoids the repayment issue but forces the employee to stay in an unsuitable position for an extended period, which is not ideal. Option C has merit, as misrepresentation could potentially void the contract, but it's a complex legal route that may be time-consuming and costly. \n\nOption D is the best approach because:\n1. It aligns with the top answer's suggestion to try resolving the issue amicably without involving the law.\n2. It acknowledges the contractual obligation while seeking a mutually beneficial solution.\n3. It allows the employee to explain the misrepresentation issue without immediately escalating to legal action.\n4.

The correct answer is C because it accurately reflects the rights of a shareholder in a corporation, particularly a C-Corporation (which is likely in this case, as mentioned in the documentation).\n\nKey points:\n1.

The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. The documentation states that Google can offer different license terms to different users, which means a special agreement between Google and the ride-sharing company is possible.\n2.

The usual approach is to charge A with all three, and then convict for the highest that the jury agrees with (for example, the jury might agree that it was at least second degree murder, but not agree that it was first degree murder beyond reasonable ground). \n\nA prosecutor who wants a first degree murder conviction might charge with first degree murder only, hoping that the jury will agree with the charge rather than letting a proven killer go free. This may fatally backfire. If a proven killer is *only* charged with first degree murder, and there is insufficient evidence for first degree murder, then yes, with a responsible jury that killer will go free.

The correct answer, D, is the most strategic approach because:\n\n1. The prosecution's charge of premeditated first-degree murder doesn't preclude the jury from considering lesser charges like second-degree murder or manslaughter.\n\n2. As mentioned in the documentation, prosecutors often charge the highest possible offense (first-degree murder) but may secure convictions on lesser charges if the evidence supports them.\n\n3. Focusing solely on disproving premeditation (option B) or arguing for complete acquittal (option A) is risky. If the jury believes a killing occurred but premeditation isn't proven, they could still convict on a lesser charge if it's available.\n\n4. While a plea bargain (option C) might be considered, it's premature without first assessing the strength of the evidence and potential for acquittal or conviction on lesser charges.\n\n5. By presenting a defense strategy that addresses multiple levels of homicide charges, the attorney can adapt to how the evidence unfolds during the trial and how the jury perceives it, maximizing the chances of the best possible outcome for the defendant.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about legal strategy, requires integration of multiple concepts from criminal law, and applies them to a real-world scenario, meeting the criteria for a high-quality, challenging exam question."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9055/what-happens-legally-if-my-landlord-lied-verbally-about-a-clause-in-the-contract", "docs_id": 9055, "title": "what happens legally If my landlord lied verbally about a clause in the contract before signing it", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Recently something happened that got me wondering about the legal implications of it.\n\nAbout a year an a half ago I moved to a flat in the UK. Of course there was a contract. There is a clause in the contract that states that the tenants are responsible of maintaining the quality of the items (listed) in the house and replacing them (unless there has been a fire). This is worded longer but has this information.\n\nWhen I was considering signing the contract, I read the clause and decided to ask the landlord what would happen if something breaks \"because is old\". The conversation was more or less as follows:\n\n> Seating in the Landlord's living room in his own house, me, my girlfriend, Landlord and his wife, reading the contract.\n> \n> \n> Me: About this clause, what would happen if something breaks?\n> \n> \n> Landlord: If it breaks... what do you mean?\n> \n> \n> Me: Well, if the thing is old, sometimes they just break. Would you pay for it in that case?\n> \n> \n> Landlord and wife, together: Yes, yes of course.\n> \n> \n> We sign.\n\nRecently something broke (after 1\\.5 years) and we called the landlord. After about a month of doing technicians etc the result ended in needing to buy a new one. While discussing moderately about how long is taking to fix thing my landlord told us that we shouldn't complain, because he is paying for it, and we should be the ones paying. While asking why he says that if he mentioned that he would pay for it he said \"you should have read the contract, its in the contract that it is your responsibility to pay for it\".\n\nIt seems that nothing bad will happen, but I am curious about the legal implication if he decides to make us pay for it.\n\nWe asked about it and he said it, but of course, its not literally written like that. However, one of the reasons we signed that contract was because of that verbal agreement (can it be called like that?).\n\nIn British law, is there somehow a possibility that that conversation can be used to defend us? Or as it is not written is as if it didn't happened?\n\nWould this mean that a landlord could actually tell a lots of lies about a contract (for example to someone that has limited reading capabilities, or like me, someone that is not used to English law \"slang\" as its not their mother tongue) and \"cheat\" the tenant to sign?\n\nI guess one possible (and likely) answer to this is \"its the tenant responsibility to understand the contract, and the only things that apply are the ones in the contract\".\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not looking for real legal advice, just curious on how far the law extends here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is the tenant's responsibility to understand the written contract. Oral statements about the contract do have to be consistent with the written contract (that is, in the context where you ask the landlord what a particular clause means before signing \\-\\- not in the case where you are modifying an existing contract). If I were renting a room and the contract says \"Du m\u00e5 betale $1000 hver dag\", which I don't understand because my Norwegian is terrible, I would ask about this, and the landlord might say that it means \"You must pay $1000 every month\", which could be a decent deal. Actually, the clause says \"You must pay $1000 every day\". When the reality of the situation becomes clear, then it is obvious that we didn't have an agreement in the first place. Perhaps he mis\\-spoke, or his English is as bad as my Norwegian, but I would not be held to rate in the written contract, assuming that I could back up my claim that he gave me that interpretation: the lease would probably be voided, as not an actual agreement. The underlying principle is that there has to be a \"meeting of the minds\" where the parties understand what they will get and what they must give, and there was a demonstrable failure of understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, if I sign a contract without really reading it carefully, and there is a clause in English (which I speak) saying that I have to pay $1000 a day, but I didn't really think about the clause so that in a sense I didn't understand what I had agreed to, well, I may still be on the hook. (On the third hand, a court would probably say that's a ridiculous rent and void the contract on policy grounds). In general, \"not my first language\" is not a get\\-out\\-of\\-contract card, though attempts to trick people into signing documents in languages that they really have no understanding of won't be successful. Virtually nobody but a lawyer actually understands contractual language, yet contracts are enforced all the time.\n\nA contract can be explicitly modified by verbal agreement, or can be entirely verbal, but oral agreements face evidence problems, namely, what *exactly* did A and B say? It's scientifically well established that parties can be morally certain that the conversation went \"A\" (for one person) and \"Not A\" (for the other person). Using \"could\" rather than \"would\" in speech makes a huge difference in interpretation. There is a rule, the [parol evidence rule](http://articles.rollingsons.co.uk/2012/04/the-parol-evidence-rule.html), which essentially says that unless there is a good reason to not do so, the contract as written is what is enforced.\n\nEven if the conversation had been written into the contract, there's no basis in the contract for objectively determining whether a thing is old and \"just broke\". So even as an additional clause in the contract, it doesn't afford you a clear escape hatch.

Before signing, the tenant verbally confirms with the landlord that the landlord would cover replacements for items that break due to age. After 18 months, an item breaks and the landlord insists the tenant should pay for replacement, citing the contract. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this situation under UK law?\n\nA) The verbal agreement supersedes the written contract, making the landlord responsible for the replacement.\nB) The tenant is fully responsible for the replacement as stated in the written contract, regardless of the verbal discussion.\nC) The contract is void due to the discrepancy between the verbal and written agreements.\nD) The tenant may have grounds to challenge the contract, but success depends on proving a \"meeting of the minds\" failure.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This situation involves complex interplay between written contracts, verbal agreements, and the principle of \"meeting of the minds\" in contract law. While the written contract states the tenant is responsible for replacements, the verbal discussion before signing suggests a different understanding. \n\nThe correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The parol evidence rule generally favors enforcing the written contract as-is, which would support the landlord's position.\n\n2. However, the tenant may argue that there was no true \"meeting of the minds\" when the contract was signed, as the verbal clarification from the landlord contradicted the written terms.\n\n3. The success of challenging the contract depends on the tenant's ability to prove that this verbal clarification was a significant factor in their decision to sign and that there was a genuine misunderstanding, not just a failure to read carefully.\n\n4. Unlike option A, verbal agreements don't automatically supersede written contracts, especially when they contradict written terms.\n\n5. Option B is too absolute, ignoring the potential legal implications of the pre-contract verbal agreement.\n\n6.

In order to view anything on the internet, you have to first receive it, so there is potential criminal liability.

[Crabtree v. Kentucky](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ky-court-of-appeals/1609602.html) is an example of such a (successful) conviction. The court addresses the question of whether \"merely viewing\" can constitute actual possession: the court found that it did:\n\n> Crabtree urges us to consider that his merely viewing child\n>  pornography images before deleting them should not be deemed to\n>  constitute actual possession.

The case of [US v. Kuchinski](https://openjurist.org/469/f3d/853/united-states-v-kuchinski), 469 F. 3d 853 is instructive, because defendant did knowingly seek out and download a number of child porn images, and was convicted. In 94 of those cases, he knew he was receiving child pornography; in over 10,000 other cases, such images were found in his system cache (this is relevant to sentencing). The court found that it matters that \"Kuchinski had no knowledge of the images that were simply in the cache files\", and the court concluded, in K's favor, that\n\n> Where a defendant lacks knowledge about the cache files, and\n>  concomitantly lacks access to and control over those files, it is not\n>  proper to charge him with possession and control of the child\n>  pornography images located in those files, without some other\n>  indication of dominion and control over the images. To do so turns\n>  abysmal ignorance into knowledge and a less than valetudinarian grasp\n>  into dominion and control.\n\nDo you know about the system cache, and do you know how to control it?

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"A person's belief that the website was moderated is not a defense.\" This eliminates option A.\n\n2. While lack of knowledge can be relevant, it's not a strong defense on its own. The law focuses on \"knowingly\" possessing or accessing, which can be interpreted broadly.

These Credits could then be used to purchase real\\-world items on the site, such as clothes, computers, etc., and have them shipped to you. When you purchased an item, you would have to pay for shipping with United States Dollars. Additionally, the amount in credits of the item you bought would be deducted from you and added to the seller.\n\nIt was a \"virtual economy\", in a way, permitting users to buy and sell items for free by using so\\-called Listia Credits. This currency was *not* a cryptocurrency. It could not be redeemed for cash or legal tender in any way.\n\nI'm wondering what the legality of building such a system is in the United States. According to [Lexology.com](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a0243a6e-75e2-4dd3-9bb0-72a720837f85), \n\n> In 2013, FinCEN released guidance (the \"Guidance\") explaining its position on money transmission in the context of virtual currency. An individual or company involved in virtual currency transactions would be considered a money transmitter if (1\\) it acts as an \"exchanger\" or \"administrator\" in the transactions; (2\\) the virtual currency involved is a \"convertible virtual currency\" (CVC); and (3\\) the company facilitates the movement of funds between different persons or locations.\n\nPertaining to exchanging/issuing:\n\n> Importantly for app and game developers, an administrator is an entity that (1\\) issues a virtual currency and (2\\) has the authority to redeem the virtual currency. \"Issuing\" means putting a virtual currency into circulation, for example, by providing users virtual currency for free, in exchange for real currency, or as a promotion. Redeeming means withdrawing the virtual currency from circulation, whether in exchange for in\\-game/in\\-app items or features, real\\-world goods or services, or real currency, or otherwise.\n\nAnd more specifically, \n\n> An administrator would be a money transmitter, however, only if the virtual currency it issues and redeems is a CVC. FinCEN defines a CVC as a virtual currency that either (1\\) has an equivalent value in real currency or (2\\) acts as a substitute for real currency.\n\nBased on that, would you say that a company like Listia would be considered a \"Money Transmitter\" and that they are required to implement a BSA/AML program? Would companies building a similar marketplace today be considered as such? Is the information provided in the quotes correct?\n\nNote that Listia now uses the cryptocurrency XNK, prior to this, however, they used Lista Credits, a virtual in\\-app only currency.\n\nThank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a \"how things are in practice\" answer, not statutory. \n\nThe ruling question is whether the virtual currencies *are readily exchangeable for USD*. \n\nFor instance if there is a thriving, open currency exchange where I can convert 1000 World of Warcraft gold into 1 USD and back again anytime I please, then WoW gold takes on the character of a foreign currency, and Blizzard Entertainment finds themselves in the shoes of a money transmitter, *and all that implies*, including the need to prevent the platform from being used to launder or traffick money. **That's a big part of why Blizzard works so hard to stop gold selling**, and why features like \"WoW Tokens\" (buying game time with in\\-game gold) are so convoluted.\n\n*Blizzard knows they can't enforce absolutely: gold\\-for\\-real\\-money does indeed happen, but by making a serious effort to stop third\\-party trading, they keep Treasury off their back. This is typical of how capricious this field is, and how \"laws as written\" provide little practical guidance.*\n\nWith in\\-game virtual currencies, game platform developers want USD to turn into those currencies, and not become USD again. This solves the \"money transmitter\" problem. (It also complies with the [First Rule of Acquisition](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition): *Once you have their money, never give it back.*) \n\nIt sounds like before, Listia was managing their program like a \"credit card rewards program\" or an \"airline miles program\". You could redeem for purchases but not USD. (The problem came if the purchases were easily fungible to cash, e.g. Krugerrands, Bally's casino chips, or Visa gift cards). \n\n* Very often, this is scammish in that the \"great values\" are in fact cheap Chinese junk (if they sell iPads those are fairly fungible; selling unresaleable junk moves them even further away from being a money transmitter), and/or\n* they charge you retail UPS shipping, and handling too, while they *pay* UPS's best volume discount rate.\n\n**There is no substitute for having good legal advice and keeping up with the trends of what is happening in the in\\-game\\-currency field.

This scenario would likely meet FinCEN's criteria for a CVC, as the tokens would have \"an equivalent value in real currency\" or act as a \"substitute for real currency.\" Additionally, by facilitating the exchange of tokens for cryptocurrencies, the company would be acting as an \"exchanger,\" triggering money transmitter status.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about the application of financial regulations to virtual economies and requires candidates to analyze the key factors that differentiate a regulated money transmission service from an unregulated virtual economy."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/22647/movie-to-a-book-and-copyright", "docs_id": 22647, "title": "Movie to a book and copyright", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Scenario: a movie is made a couple of decades ago.

An important distinguishing feature is that in this case, the woman at a statutory disadvantage sought parental rights, whereas your question is about a legal parent seeking to avoid a legal obligation to the child.

The correct answer is C for several reasons:\n\n1. The handwritten agreement is not legally valid. As mentioned in the documentation, \"surrogate parentage contracts are unenforceable\" in Michigan, and the agreement was made without legal counsel or proper documentation.\n\n2.

They can't just prosecute both. If they can't identify the guilty party then both have to go free.\n\nIn the case of a gunfight where both parties claim self defence, one of them is probably lying, but unless the prosecution can bring evidence to prove that one of them started the fight they can't prove that either is guilty.\n\nAnd of course there might be situations under some legal frameworks, especially in \"[stand your ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-your-ground_law)\" states, where both of them *might* have acted in self defence.\n\nStatement by Mr Bloggs:\n\n> Smith was walking towards me, shouting in an aggressive manner.

This stems from several factors discussed in the documentation:\n\n1. As mentioned in the top answer, \"If they can't identify the guilty party then both have to go free.\" The prosecution must prove which party is guilty and cannot simply prosecute both.\n\n2. The scenario described in the question highlights the complexity of determining the initial aggressor. Even if one party intended to commit murder with their first shot, subsequent actions by the other party (returning fire) can muddy the waters of who acted in self-defense.\n\n3. The Waco 2015 case cited specifically mentions that \"it's simply not possible to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt [of] who fired the shots that killed people.\"\n\n4. Both parties can claim self-defense, and without clear evidence to the contrary, it becomes challenging to disprove these claims.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"mutual combat\" is noted as potentially being an abuse of the term in these situations.

Adam fatally shoots Butch, claiming he acted under Colorado's \"Make My Day\" law. Given the circumstances and relevant statutes, what is the most likely legal outcome of this situation?\n\nA) Adam's actions are fully protected under the \"Make My Day\" law, as his office qualifies as a dwelling after hours.\nB) Adam can successfully claim self-defense, but cannot invoke the \"Make My Day\" law due to the location.\nC) Adam's use of deadly force is likely unjustified, as the threat level doesn't meet the standard for either the \"Make My Day\" law or general self-defense.\nD) Adam can invoke the \"Make My Day\" law if he can prove he was living in the office temporarily.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This situation requires careful analysis of multiple legal concepts and statutes. The \"Make My Day\" law (CRS 18-1-704.5) specifically applies to dwellings, defined in Section 18-1-901 as buildings used for habitation. Adam's office, even after hours, does not meet this definition, ruling out options A and D. \n\nWhile option B seems plausible, it overlooks the stricter requirements for using deadly force in self-defense outlined in Section 18-1-704. This statute allows deadly force only if the person reasonably believes lesser force is inadequate and there's an imminent danger of death or great bodily injury, or during specific violent crimes.\n\nGiven the described scenario, where Butch is unaware of Adam's presence and isn't described as overtly threatening, it's questionable whether Adam could reasonably believe he was in imminent danger of death or great bodily injury. The use of deadly force appears disproportionate to the perceived threat of trespassing or potential theft.\n\nTherefore, option C is the most accurate. Adam's use of deadly force is likely unjustified under both the \"Make My Day\" law (which doesn't apply due to location) and the general self-defense statute (due to the apparent lack of imminent threat of death or great bodily injury).

In a big system like this, individuals can usually claim misunderstandings and errors of omission, which makes such a proof difficult.

They work on revenue share. If there is not enough revenue to where their share would be greater than or equal to minimum wage, is the company required to cover the difference? What if this is a full\\-time employee, opposed to a contractor?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anyone who is an employee as defined in the federal [Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf) (FLSA), 29 USC 201 et seq.(or parallel state minimum wage laws) and is not within the scope of an exemption to the minimum wage law, must be paid minimum wage.\n\nThe relevant question is whether or not the person is an employee who is not exempt from the minimum wage requirement as defined in the FLSA. The question is a mixed issue of fact and law in which the characterization given to the relationship by the company and the person doing the work is one factor, but not the only or the controlling factor, in determining employee status.\n\nThe exact nature of the work governs whether the FLSA's minimum wage requirement applies or not. For example, \"employee\" is defined for puroses of the FLSA at 29 USC 203(e) to exclude \"any individual employed by an employer engaged in agriculture if such individual is the parent, spouse, child, or other member of the employer\u2019s immediate family\" and certain kinds of volunteers. Piecework pay is allows under certain limited circumstances by 29 USC 207(g) when the usual result is that reasonable workers earn the minimum wage. Tipped employees (which is a form of revenue sharing) also receive special treatment. Most of the exemptions are found at 29 USC 213\\. Most relevant to your question is 29 USC 213(a)(1\\) which includes an exception for an \"outside saleman\" who is paid on a straight commission basis, and 29 USC 213(a)(5\\) and (a)(6\\) which contain exclusions for certain farming and fishing occupations.\n\nStraight commission compensation without regard to the minimum wage is generally not permitted with regard to an employee who is an \"inside salesman\" (e.g. someone who works at a retail store in a mall or at a phone bank for a telemarketing company), or for anyone other than an outside saleman in non\\-agricultural jobs.\n\nIndependent contractor status generally depends upon the degree of control that the company has over the manner in which the work is performed, the assignability of the contract to do the work, and the extent to which the worker does work for many different companies on a contract basis while complying with employment related laws for the contactor's own employees (e.g. worker's compensation). The working for many different companies on a contract basis prong of the test is frequently controlling in practice. Six of the main factors considered by the Labor Department in determining independent contractor status are discussed in [Fact Sheet \\#13](https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs13.htm).\n\nA true independent contractor may be paid on a revenue sharing basis without regard to minimum wage, although in practice, if this results in the independent contractor earning less than minimum wage, there will be strict scrutiny of the practice. Typical independent contractor arrangements that would be allowed would include an attorney working on a contingent fee basis, or an independent broker or realtor working on a straight commission bais. More often than not, a true independent contractor is someone you couldn't even imagine being an employee subject to minimum wage laws of the company in light of the overall relationship and often this will involve a business to business contract, rather than a business to a non\\-professional individual contract with only personal services involved.\n\nThere are some safe harbor provisions that if met can insure independent contract status, but it is very common for someone who legally is an employee to be misclassified as an independent contractor in an attempt (often futile if the matter is pressed by regulatory or tax officials) to avoid compliance with laws incident to the employment relationship.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A tech startup hires remote workers on a \"revenue share\" basis, where their compensation is directly tied to the company's monthly revenue.

Like if you burn your mom a CD. Or gift your girlfriend a mix tape. Or copy a page of the book and hand out the excercise to your two study buddies.\n\nSo there was a [court decision](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatkopie#Anzahl_der_Kopien) that \"more than seven\" was more than what you would normally consider a private copy covered by this fee. If you make more than seven copies of a cassette for example, it would be okay to assume that you no longer did that \"for a close friend\".\n\nObviously, copying something from a book as you describe, by writing it down with a pencil on a notepad, is in no way \"a lossless copy\". Even if you type it into an app, manually copying something into another medium is not lossless. Ever. It is also for your very personal use, you don't give it to anyone, not even close friends.\n\nSo yes, you can make as many copies as you like, for yourself. If one breaks, and you make another, that is fine. If one breaks every day and you need 700 over the course of two years? Fine.

It acknowledges the existence of discrepancies between official sources, as evidenced by the difference between the HTML and PDF versions of the constitution.\n2. It proposes a systematic approach to handling these discrepancies, which is crucial for maintaining accuracy in a legal analysis tool.\n3. It allows for the inclusion of multiple official sources, recognizing that no single source may be entirely up-to-date or error-free.\n4. It incorporates a manual review process, which is important for legal matters where human expertise is still necessary to interpret and verify information.\n\nOption A is incorrect because relying on a single source, especially one that has been shown to be outdated, could lead to significant errors in legal analysis.\n\nOption C is flawed because it assumes infallibility of one source over another without considering potential errors or delays in updates across different formats.\n\nOption D, while seemingly proactive, is not the most practical or scalable solution. Government offices may not be equipped to handle individual inquiries about constitutional interpretations, and this approach doesn't address the ongoing need for accurate, up-to-date information.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, including the importance of cross-referencing sources, the impact of constitutional amendments, and the challenges of maintaining up-to-date legal information across different formats.

From what I understand, an insanity plea results in being committed to a mental institution indefinitely. However, Juan is no longer insane and doesn't require further treatment.\n\nN.B.

A finding of NCRMD is a special verdict that results in the accused being placed under the jurisdiction of the Review Board.1\n\nAssuming for the sake of analysis that such an outcome is made out in the circumstances that you've described (much would depend on the expert evidence), such an outcome would not necessarily lead to indefinite detention.\n\n[The options available are](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/jsp-sjp/rr06_1/p1.html#sec11):\n\n* absolute discharge;\n* conditional discharge; or\n* detention in custody in a hospital\n\nAnd even when in detention in a hospital, there is a regular review and the person is released when detention is no longer necessary for public safety.\n\nThe burden is not on the detained to show that the chance of a repeat is essentially zero. That would be a great exaggeration of the barrier to release and incorrectly reverses the burden. Instead, the Review Board must find evidence that there is a significant continuing risk to the public, at the time of the hearing, in order to keep the person in custody. **There is no burden on the accused or on anyone to rule out future occurrences with any certainty**.\n\n[Latimer and Lawrence explain](https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/jsp-sjp/rr06_1/p1.html#sec11):\n\n> The Supreme Court of Canada further clarified in *[R. v. Winko](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1711/index.do)* that Section 672\\.54 does not create a presumption of dangerousness. In other words, while the protection of society is paramount, there must be clear evidence of a significant risk to the public before a court or Review Board can maintain control over an accused through the imposition of a conditional discharge or detention order.\n\nSome extracts from *Winko*:\n\n> Restrictions on his or her liberty can only be justified if, **at the time of the hearing**, the evidence before the court or Review Board shows that the NCR accused actually constitutes such a threat\n\n> **there is never any legal burden on the NCR accused** to show that he or she does not pose a significant threat to the safety of the public\n\n> **A past offence committed while the NCR accused suffered from a mental illness is not, by itself, evidence that the NCR accused *continues* to pose a significant risk to the safety of the public**.\n\n---\n\n1\\.

The correct answer, D, aligns with the principles outlined in the documentation:\n\n1. The Supreme Court of Canada clarified in R. v. Winko that there is no presumption of dangerousness in NCRMD cases.\n2. The Review Board must find clear evidence of a significant continuing risk to the public at the time of the hearing to justify restrictions on liberty.\n3. A past offence committed while suffering from mental illness is not, by itself, evidence of continued risk.\n4. There is no legal burden on the accused to prove they are not a threat.\n\nOption A is incorrect because indefinite commitment is not automatic, and the current mental state is considered. Option B is wrong as it reverses the burden of proof, which the documentation explicitly states should not happen. Option C is incorrect because immediate release without any assessment is not the standard procedure; a Review Board assessment is required.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of legal principles and their application to a specific scenario, rather than mere memorization of facts.

But when using Google Analytics configured in the way explained in my other post, the visitor is not tracked. At least not in a way which violates the GDPR.\n\nYou worry about the cookies. I also found [this article](https://www.humix.be/blog/configure-google-analytics-for-gdpr/) which also does and suggests to either:\n\n* change the `_ga` cookie to a session cookie, so it will be removed when the browser is closed. To do this, set the Cookie Expiration variable in your Google Analytics Settings to 0\\.\n* completely disable cookies. (GA does not require cookies). To do this, set the `storage` field to `none`:\n\n```\nga('create', 'UA-XXXXX-Y', {\n  'storage': 'none'\n});\n\n```\n\nIf you do not disable cookies, cookies can be used for tracking, which is more general defined in the GDPR as profiling. Profiling is defined in [Art. 4 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) as:\n\n> \u2018profiling\u2019 means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;\n\n[Art. 22(1\\) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-22-gdpr/) disallows profiling. Therefore in the settings menu from Google Analytics you have to disable data sharing and data collection.\n\nSo data will only be used for the analytics function. But because you have configured to Anonymize your visitors IP Address, the part of the IP address used for this, is no longer considered personal data. This is because approx. 250 other users share the same part of the ip address which is stored, so data is not distinguishable between those 250 users. \n\nThe anonymisation used by google is currently considered good enough. At least by the Dutch DPA. This might change if someone proves it is not good enough anonymized. \n\nNote that I am not a lawyer either, but I have read from multiple experts that analytics can be a \"legitimate interest\", the same way marketing can be a legitimate interest. This way configured the privacy impact is considered very low.\n\nIt is also very important to note that a [DPA](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-6/) consideres GA Google Analytics compliant. Even if a court would not agree in the future, you are acting in good faith if you follow those instructions, so you will probably not be fined. The DPA does currently not suggest to change the `_ga` cookie to a session cookie, or disable cookies completely.\n\nNote that the GDPR does not require doing anything to make it **technical** impossible to track someone. If a website has access to the data to track someone, but \"promises\" not to do that, that is fine. And rules regarding the usage of cookies in general, is not part of the GDPR, but (currently) part of the [ePrivacy Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002).

The correct answer balances the business need for analytics with GDPR compliance requirements. \n\nOption A is incorrect because using default settings without modifications doesn't adequately address GDPR concerns, especially regarding cookie usage and data sharing.\n\nOption B improves upon the default by anonymizing IPs and disabling data sharing, but the 2-year cookie duration could still be considered excessive under GDPR.\n\nOption C provides the best balance. It incorporates the necessary GDPR protections (anonymized IPs, disabled data sharing) while also addressing the cookie concern by converting it to a session cookie. This approach significantly reduces the potential for long-term tracking while still allowing for basic analytics functionality.\n\nOption D, while the most privacy-focused, may be overly restrictive for many businesses and could significantly impact the utility of Google Analytics.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the documentation's suggestion to modify cookie behavior and the Dutch DPA's guidance on Google Analytics compliance.

In common law systems, which likely influence South African law, when someone lends an item (in this case, a car) to another person primarily for the borrower's benefit, it creates a gratuitous bailment.

While the hallway is public, \"fair use\" (option B) typically applies to copyrighted materials for purposes like criticism or education, not trade secrets or unreleased designs.\n3. Option C is most likely correct because even though the photographer is in a public space, the design could still be considered a trade secret. The owner took reasonable precautions (keeping it in a closed showroom) and the design has potential economic value.\n4. Option D is incorrect as the documentation doesn't mention any specific local laws protecting furniture designs at trade shows.\n\nThis scenario tests the application of trade secret principles in a real-world context, requiring critical thinking about the balance between public spaces and protected information.

The correct answer, C, is the most strategic approach given the available evidence and legal principles:\n\n1. Circumstantial evidence can be powerful in civil cases, where the burden of proof is \"balance of probabilities\" rather than \"beyond reasonable doubt.\"\n\n2.

The original recording is not made\n> available to the public but transcripts are. When, where, and why is\n> this done?\n\nIn Colorado this is done in all limited jurisdiction court proceedings (i.e. the courts where misdemeanors and smaller money claims and evictions involving premises with fairly low rents are tried), and in most general jurisdiction court proceedings unless the parties pay for live transcription at their own expense. Transcripts are made when there is a sound recording only upon a request submitted to the court that then outsources the request to independent contractor transcriptionists.\n\nThis is a fairly recent development and there may be live stenographers (also known as court reporters) in some general jurisdiction courts still today in Colorado, but it is profoundly less expensive to tape record a hearing or trial and just transcribe them upon request at the expense of a party, than it is to have a live stenographer make a verbatim record of every hearing or trial. In limited jurisdiction courts typically only about one in a hundred cases is appealed, and in general jurisdiction courts typically about one in ten cases are appealed. The marginal cost of an audio recording that isn't transcribed, once the courtrooms are wired for sound, is negligible (perhaps $10 per day (or less) for storage media). The marginal costs of a live stenographer or transcriptionist per day is on the order of $240\\+, which adds up over the course of a year. In the limited jurisdiction court, live court reporting would cost about $24,000 per day of trial *in cases that are actually appealed* (since only about 1% of cases are appealed and those cases would have to bear the entire cost of the transcription system). In general jurisdiction courts, live court reporting would cost about $2,400 per day of trial *in cases that are actually appealed* (since only about 10% of cases are appealed and those cases would have to bear the entire cost of the transcription system).\n\nIn contrast, with sound recordings, the cost per day of trial actually appealed in limited jurisdiction courts would cost $1,240, and in general jurisdiction courts it would cost $340\\. These are judicial branch expenses small enough to be financed with court filing fees.\n\nDepositions prior to a trial are often handled by a live stenographer and sometimes handled by a videographer as well, but almost never conducted with sound only recordings in the absence of extreme circumstances like a blizzard that makes it impossible to secure the court reporter's attendance (in part because there is almost always a desire to have a transcript made and because the stenographer can confirm spellings and ambiguous sounding words with the deponents and counsel during breaks avoiding errors in the final product).\n\n> Are court proceedings ever filmed or otherwise visually recorded?\n\nDepositions and court proceedings are sometimes filmed. A video of a deposition can be presented to a judge or jury in lieu of testimony when the witness is not available or to impeach the testimony of the witness.\n\nIt is unusual in Colorado for court proceedings to be visually recorded. But, in Alaska, there is a state constitutional right to participate in most kinds of court proceedings and legislative hearings by video conference (because geographically, Alaska is about a third the size of the continental U.S. and thinly populated with large roadless areas), so I presume that in Alaska, court proceedings are routinely videotaped.\n\nSome courts in the U.S. do initial appearances and arraignments in many criminal cases by closed circuit television from the jail, before a judge in the court house, in order to reduce the need to transport prisoners from the jail to the court house for a perfunctory five minute hearing which is not evidentiary, and there may be video recordings of those proceedings as well.\n\nMany federal courts and some state courts do status conferences and similar minor procedural hearings by telephone conference call and those are usually audio recorded without a live court reporter.\n\nIn Colorado, all oral arguments in appeals (except those rare cases that are secret such as juvenile cases and rare cases involving the details of trade secrets) are live streamed and podcast over the Internet. Many other appellate courts (but not the U.S. Supreme Court) do this as well. But, transcripts of oral arguments at the appellate level are rarely considered in further appeals. The video (or in the case of U.S. Supreme Court hearings, previously transcripts only and now audio as well) are released for PR reasons and for public transparency, reflecting appellate court's role as law making institutions, not for the litigants themselves.\n\n> It seems that facial expression, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc.\n> are part of the body of evidence on which a judge or jury decides a\n> case. So is this type of record ever made available, and if so, when?\n\nA deposition or other videotape provided as evidence in a case at trial is part of the record on appeal that an appellate court may consider. And, a judge or jury may consider things like facial expressions, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc. in those cases.\n\nBut, video of the court proceeding itself is simply a basis for preparing a transcript that will become part of the court record. Appellate courts in common law systems are forbidden from considering things like facial expressions, hand motions, vocal intonations, etc. of witnesses testifying in a trial. This is part of the credibility evaluation function that is reserved entirely to the judge or jury who is the trier of fact in a case.\n\nThe only time a video of a trial court proceeding itself would be considered would be as evidence in a different trial arising out of events that took place in the courtroom itself.\n\nFor example, suppose that a court bailiff goes berserk and starts shooting jurors for no reason in the middle of a trial that was being videotaped. That videotape could be considered in a criminal trial of the court bailiff for assault with a deadly weapon or murder, or in a civil case brought by the jurors or their surviving next of kin, for battery or wrongful death. The appellate court of the criminal or civil trial of the bailiff could consider the videotape, but an appellate court considering an appeal of the proceeding that was being videotaped could not.\n\nThis is basically just a historical artifact. If videotape had been in existence at the time of the Norman invasion in 1066 CE, appellate courts in common law countries would no doubt have the right to review questions of both fact and law, rather than merely law as they do today.\n\nIn civil law countries, such as those of continental Europe, judges take notes regarding evidence, but there is no verbatim record of the proceedings and any assertion that the judge was mistaken about the facts is resolved by retrying the disputed facts over again in a second instance court proceeding, a process reflecting even more rudimentary court resources than those existing prior to tape and video recording were invented.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about court recordings, here's a question that meets the criteria:\n\nQuestion: A high-profile criminal trial is taking place in a jurisdiction that typically uses audio recordings instead of live stenographers.

This word is usually applied to aiding in the commission of a crime. To abet another to commit a murder is to command, procure, counsel, encourage, induce, or assist.

The correct answer is C because John's actions constitute abetment of bribery. According to the provided definition, abetment includes encouraging or inciting another to commit a crime. By suggesting that \"a little extra incentive can help things along,\" John is indirectly encouraging Sarah to consider bribery, even though he doesn't explicitly instruct her to do so. This subtle encouragement falls under the legal definition of abetment, which includes commanding, procuring, counseling, encouraging, inducing, or assisting in the commission of a crime.\n\nOption A is incorrect because explicit instruction is not necessary for abetment; encouragement or incitement is sufficient. Option B is incorrect because abetment is a separate offense from bribery itself, and one can be guilty of abetment without directly offering the bribe. Option D is incorrect because speech that encourages illegal activities is not protected as free speech, especially in the context of corporate communications about potentially illegal activities.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of the concept of abetment to a real-world scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere memorization of the law."}, "60": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4633/can-someone-who-does-not-consider-himself-a-us-citizen-be-extradited-and-punishe", "docs_id": 4633, "title": "Can someone who does not consider himself a US citizen be extradited and punished for a US felony crime due to a US citizenship?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: based off of the answer to this question: [If one leaves the US to commit an act illegal in the US but legal in the country they travel to are they guilty of a crime?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/4629/if-one-leaves-the-us-to-commit-an-act-illegal-in-the-us-but-legal-in-the-country/4631#4631) My first bizarre loophole question has to do with situations when someone is a US citizen, but consider themselves to be citizens of a different country with different laws..\n\nLets say you have two Individuals Bob, age 17, and Alice, who just turned 18, who live in, and are citizens of, some non\\-US country X, who are dating and have a sexual relationship. Say country X considers the age of consent 16, recognizes dual citizenship, and has an extradition treaty with the US...\n\nHowever, Alice happened to have been born on a cruise while the cruise ship was sailing through US territorial waters, thus making her a US citizen. She has never done any of the things which can cause someone to officially lose their US citizenship.\n\nFederal law states [it is illegal for a US citizen to have sex with an individual under the age of 18 in a 'foreign place'](http://trac.syr.edu/laws/18/18USC02423.html)\n\nI'm wondering what, of any of these scenarios, would be illegal due to the above law and could theoretically lead to either extrication, or to arrest when/if they ever visited the US at some later date (and if one is possible but not the later).\n\n1. Alice never realizing she was born actually born in US waters and never thinking of herself as a US citizen, and she never visited the US or engaged in any of the activities that cause her to lose citizenship\n\nIf the above would not be sufficient would any of the below situations potentially lead to prosecution:\n\n\t* Knew she was also a US citizen and had once claimed some minor right or privileged due to being a US citizen.\n\t* Occasionally visits a friend or relative within the US for brief periods, using her US citizenship to allow easier entry to the US, without going through the steps of the VWP.\n\t* Once stayed in the US with said friend/relative for slightly more then 90 days (beyond the length a regular tourist can stay) many years ago\n\t* Had just spent spent 91 day summer vacation with her family relative before returning to her home country and having sexual relations with Bob.\n2. Alice and Bob both live in and were citizens of X but originally met when both were on a vacation to the US, ultimately having a sexual relationship in their home country.\n\nWould Alice potentially face prosecution, if not would this change if: \n\n\t* The couple had (legally) engaged in sexual activity in the US prior to traveling back home\n\t* The couple originally met in a state where sexual intercourse would have been illegal and so waited until returning home before having a sexual relationship?\n\t* Alice bought bob plan ticket home, so she is officially 'transporting' bob? (section a of the above law applies)\n\t* Alice and bob did have a relationship prior to their visit to the US which continued during their US visit.\n\nI realize that prosecutor discretion would usually result in no one choosing to prosecutor most if not all of the above cases, despite any legal right, but I'm asking rather they could face charges if a prosecutor did choose to move forward for some reason. I don't know why they would, maybe they are angry at Alice for some other legal act and this is their way of bending the laws to punish Alice in some way, maybe someone is putting pressure on Alice as some political maneuver to pressure her important father into something, maybe some prosecutor is just really gung\\-ho in prosecuting crimes for some reason whatever...\n\n\\*Edit:\nLooking back at the law I linked I realized that the definition of illicit sexual encounter, when outside of US territories, is effectively defined as a commercial sexual act, which negates all my examples since no one was being payed. However, I'm not interested in the specific law so much as how any law making activities on foreign territory illegal would be applied to citizens, and only used this law because it was the only one I knew of to reliable reference. For now umm...just pretend that illicit sexual act part of the law was not limited only to commercial acts when answering this question? I think the heart of what I'm trying to understand wouldn't change if that law were slightly different and that's easier then my rewriting all of the above.\n\nps. A US citizen can travel to Angola and have sex with a 12 year old without any repercussion so long as he doesn't pay anyone if I'm reading the law right? That's something I really didn't need to know about. I knew I shouldn't have used that particular law as my example for this...\n\npps. Also the definition of \"any person can be charged with a\n criminal offense\" seems extremely vague since it doesn't specify what country/state laws would apply for deciding if the person could be charged with a criminal offense, and I'm sure if you look far enough countries have outlawed all kind of things as sexual offenses, like being in the presence of a women who isn't wearing a hijab.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Ignorantia juris non excusat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignorantia_juris_non_excusat)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can say I didn't know: it won't keep you out of jail.\n\nRather than delving into the specifics of your question, I will keep my answer general.

The correct answer is C because it combines several critical elements that could trigger US federal law:\n\n1. Alice is a US citizen, making her subject to certain US laws even when abroad.\n2. By buying Bob a plane ticket to the US, Alice could be seen as \"transporting\" a minor for sexual purposes, which is explicitly prohibited under US federal law.\n3. The sexual activity takes place within US jurisdiction, removing any ambiguity about the applicability of US law.\n\nOption A is unlikely to lead to prosecution because, despite Alice's technical US citizenship, the activity occurs entirely in a country where it's legal, and neither party has any connection to the US beyond Alice's unexercised citizenship.\n\nOption B avoids prosecution because the sexual activity occurs in Country X where it's legal, and merely meeting in the US doesn't constitute a crime.\n\nOption D is a more complex situation, but is less likely to lead to prosecution than C.

Sometimes contracts that waive liability that would otherwise exist in the absence of an agreement are viewed as objectionable. But, a requirement in a contract that simply places upon a party the liability that they would have in the absence of an agreement is usually enforced.\n\n> The Subcontractor agrees to indemnify and hold harmless \\[the\n>  contractor] and the United States Government, and their respective\n>  officers, employees and agents (the \"Indemnities\"), from and against\n>  any and all liabilities, of whatsoever kind or nature, arising out of\n>  or in any way connected with the Subcontractor's performance under\n>  this Agreement, excepting only (i) liability arising from affirmative\n>  acts, done with intent to cause loss, damage or injury, by the\n>  Indemnities; (ii) liability arising from the sole negligence of the\n>  Indemnities; or (iii) any express liability as may be specified\n>  elsewhere in this Agreement.\n\nThe big limiting factor here is that the liability must arise out of or be connected with the Subcontractor's performance under the Agreement.\n\nUsually, if liability arises from the Subcontractor's performance, the Subcontractor would be, at least, jointly and severally liable for the liability in any case, where liability does not arise from the other party's intentional acts, or from the other party's sole negligence.\n\nLiability for defects in goods sold is generally a matter of strict liability. \n\nIf the Subcontractor did defective work, and the general contractor simply purchased that work and did nothing else to contribute to the liability, why should it be on the hook?\n\nThe only case where this may modify the default rule is when both the subcontractor and the general contractor are at fault. For example, maybe the subcontractor made a defective good but the defect was so obvious that the general contractor should have noticed a returned the goods before using them in a larger project. This puts full liability on the subcontractor, even when the general contractor is also negligent.\n\nBut, in practice, the general contractor will still be on the hook for most of the liability that the general contractor is forced to pay, because the subcontractor will generally be almost judgment proof and will go bankrupt before it pays a small portion of the amount that it owes to the general contractor in the event of the subcontractor's fault giving rise to a major liability (e.g. if goods it supplied caused a multi\\-million dollar project to have to be done over from scratch).\n\nAlso, subcontractors routinely can and do insure against this risk and figure the cost of the insurance into their prices. Working on a federal government subcontract can be a source of lots of business, and this is worth it if the primary risks can be insured against and the insurance cost can be recovered in the price charged for the work.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A small business is considering accepting a government subcontract with a broad indemnity clause.

Both the harmful and offensive contact varieties of battery require a bad intent: \u00a713 \"An actor is subject to liability to another for battery if (a) he acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact...\", and per \u00a716, \"If an act is done with the intention of inflicting upon another an offensive but not a harmful bodily contact...the actor is liable to the other for a battery although the act was not done with the intention of bringing about the resulting bodily harm\". \u00a718 Battery: Offensive Contact says more or less the same thing with \"offensive\" inserted. Furthermore,\n\n> \u00a718(2\\) An act which is not done with the intention stated in Subsection\n>  (1,a) does not make the actor liable to the other for a mere offensive\n>  contact with the other's person although the act involves an\n>  unresonable risk of inflicting it and, therefore, would be negligent\n>  or reckless if the risk threatened bodily harm.\n\nSo, if A throws a dart at a dartboard while B is right next to it, and hits B in the eye, it would seem that this is not battery, and poor B might be out of luck.\n\nI *think* this would be generic negligence, where \u00a7281 \"The actor is liable for an invasion of an interest of another, if: (a) the interest invaded is protected against unintentional invasion...\". The problem is, the description of the interest in freedom from harmful bodily contact only protects against the interest w.r.t. intentional contact, so where does the protection of that interest come from in terms of *unintentional* contact. Specifically: is there a general rule that every protection against an intentional invasion of interest entails a protection against *unintentional* invasion of that interest? (I assume the \"duty\" is a generic and universal one).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is generic negligence. In most United States jurisdictions, Negligence is a tort requiring (1\\) duty, (2\\) breach of that duty, (3\\) but\\-for and proximate causation, and (4\\) harm. In most human interaction, one person has a duty to act as a reasonable person to avoid harming another person. So if you do something a reasonable person would not do, and that causes harm, you can be liable for the resulting harm. The reason for this is that you have the ability to control your activity, and you should be willing to engage in reasonable activities without risking civil liability. Thus it discourages unreasonable behavior if you have to pay for the harm that results from your lack of reasonable care.\n\nBecause negligence requires breach of duty under a reasonable person standard rather than requiring intent, it necessarily creates a sphere of protection around the invasion of interests recognized by intentional torts that also have harm as an element. However, that sphere of protection does not protect against all unintentional invasions, just against those unintentional invasions which are sufficient to support a case for negligence in a given jurisdiction.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A professional dart player, Alex, is practicing alone in a pub. Unknown to Alex, his friend Ben has quietly entered and is standing near the dartboard. Alex throws a dart with his usual force and precision, aiming for the bullseye, but the dart veers off course and strikes Ben in the eye, causing serious injury. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) Alex is liable for battery because he intended to throw the dart, even though he didn't intend to hit Ben.\nB) Alex is not liable for any tort because Ben assumed the risk by standing near the dartboard.\nC) Alex is likely liable for negligence if he failed to exercise reasonable care in ensuring the area was clear before throwing.\nD) Alex is strictly liable for Ben's injury because throwing darts is considered an inherently dangerous activity.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario tests the application of both battery and negligence concepts from tort law. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. Battery requires intent to cause harmful or offensive contact. While Alex intended to throw the dart, he did not intend to hit Ben, so this does not meet the criteria for battery as outlined in the Restatement of Torts, Second \u00a713 and \u00a718.\n\n2. The scenario doesn't provide enough information to conclude that Ben assumed the risk, especially if he entered quietly and Alex was unaware of his presence.\n\n3. Negligence is the most appropriate tort to consider here. As explained in the documentation, negligence requires (1) duty, (2) breach of that duty, (3) causation, and (4) harm. In most human interactions, there's a duty to act as a reasonable person to avoid harming others. A reasonable dart player would likely check their surroundings before throwing to ensure no one is in harm's way.\n\n4. Strict liability typically applies to inherently dangerous activities or defective products, which doesn't fit this scenario.\n\nTherefore, Alex is most likely to be liable for negligence if it can be shown that he failed to exercise reasonable care by not checking the area around the dartboard before throwing. This aligns with the concept of generic negligence described in the documentation, where unintentional invasions of interests (in this case, Ben's bodily integrity) can be protected against if the elements of negligence are met.\n\nThis question requires analysis and application of multiple legal concepts, integration of information from the documentation, and consideration of a real-world scenario, thus meeting the criteria for a challenging exam question."}, "69": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/41776/license-ambiguity-when-license-version-is-not-specified-by-author", "docs_id": 41776, "title": "License ambiguity - When license version is not specified by author?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am tasked with making a due diligence of legacy software.

When you are in a movie theater you have what is called a \"license\" from the theater to be present, which is revocable at will without due process (possibly subject to breach of contract damages) and not a property right to be in the theater the way that a tenant who must be evicted does.\n\nAs a practical matter, given that the amount in controversy is, at most, $25 or so, and this is not a situation where the prevailing party would get their attorneys' fees, this is not cost effective to litigate, regardless of who is correct, even in small claims court without an attorney.\n\nWhether or not the theater breached its contract isn't perfectly clear, because usually, the contract between a movie goer and a movie theater is not spelled out in any writing provided to the movie goer, incorporated by reference in something disclosed to the movie goer, or signed by either of the parties, or even with an oral offer and acceptance setting forth all of the terms of the agreement. (Of course, if a written terms of service is actually provided to the movie goer, or a reference to where it can be found is provided to the movie goer, those terms will control and the contract will almost certainly be written to allow the movie theater to do what it did in this case.) In the frequent case where this is not done, the contract between a movie goer an a movie theater is usually a contract implied in fact whose terms at the edges aren't terribly well defined and there is little case law to tell us what the terms of the contract is, because the cases aren't worth litigating up to an appellate court where binding precedents are made.\n\nIndeed, one reason that movie theaters may have declined to put their implied in fact contracts with movie goers in writing is to leave the situation ambiguous so as to discourage someone whose case would be clear even if for a small dollar amount, if the terms of the contact were clear, from suing them over issues like this one. When the stakes are small and the outcome is always uncertain, it almost never makes sense to sue.\n\nThere is certainly a colorable argument that you breached the contract by being present without an adult at an R\\-rating movie when the public statements about an R rating made available to the movie goers says that rated R means only admitted with a person over the age of 17, contrary to the theater's policies on that issue, although it isn't perfectly clear if this is a suggestion or a binding term of the agreement.\n\nAnother fair interpretation of the contract between a movie goer and the movie theater is that a movie goer can be removed from any movie whenever, if in the reasonable opinion of the movie theater management, good cause exists to do so, and that its discretion should be upheld so long as it acts in good faith and in a non\\-discriminatory manner.\n\nI don't agree, however, that the question of whether or not you breached a contract was unambiguously clear, because the terms of the agreement are not well defined.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The theater committed a clear breach of contract and is liable for damages\nB) The teens have a strong case for age discrimination under public accommodation laws\nC) The theater's actions were likely legal, but the contract terms are ambiguous\nD) The teens are entitled to a refund by law, as they were denied the service they paid for\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex legal concepts related to implied contracts, property rights, and business practices. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The theater's actions were likely legal: As stated in the documentation, the theater grants a \"license\" to be present, which is revocable at will. This means they have the right to ask patrons to leave without it being considered a crime.\n\n2. Contract terms are ambiguous: The documentation emphasizes that the contract between moviegoers and theaters is often implied and not clearly defined. There's no explicit written agreement, making the exact terms unclear.\n\n3. Multiple interpretations possible: The answer mentions there are different ways to interpret the implied contract. One interpretation suggests the theater can remove patrons for good cause at their discretion. Another view might consider the R-rating requirements as part of the agreement.\n\n4. Lack of clear breach: While the teens might feel wronged, it's not unambiguously clear that the theater breached a contract.

The developer wants to protect their intellectual property rights. Given the information from the Indian Copyright Office, what is the most comprehensive and strategically sound approach for the developer to secure copyright protection?\n\nA) Register the source code as a literary work and the user interface as an artistic work separately with the Copyright Office\nB) Rely solely on automatic copyright protection without formal registration, as it is not legally required\nC) Register only the source code as a literary work, as it's the most valuable component of the application\nD) File a single application for copyright registration covering all aspects of the web application as a multimedia work\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is A for several reasons:\n\n1. The documentation states that \"computer programmes, tables and compilations, including computer databases\" are considered literary works and can be registered. This covers the source code.\n\n2. The user interface design would likely fall under artistic works, which require a separate application as per the FAQ: \"Separate applications should be made for registration of each work.\"\n\n3. While copyright is automatic and registration is not legally required (as mentioned in the FAQ), the documentation notes that \"certificate of registration of copyright and the entries made therein serve as prima facie evidence in a court of law with reference to dispute relating to ownership of copyright.\" This makes registration strategically important for potential legal disputes.\n\n4. The question about registering websites specifically states that \"a separate application has to be filed for registration of all these works\" when a website contains multiple types of works.\n\n5. Third-party APIs would not be eligible for copyright by the developer, so they are not mentioned in the correct approach.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while automatic protection exists, it doesn't provide the legal advantages of registration. Option C is incomplete as it ignores the user interface. Option D is incorrect because the documentation doesn't support registering a web application as a single multimedia work, instead recommending separate registrations for different components.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple pieces of information from the documentation and apply them to a real-world scenario, requiring critical thinking beyond mere memorization."}, "74": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21135/can-australian-government-departments-use-isp-meta-data-for-general-analytics", "docs_id": 21135, "title": "Can Australian government departments use ISP meta data for general analytics", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Australia all ISP s have to capture 2 years of all users metadata, a number of government departments can access the data with out warrant.

The correct answer is C because prosecutors have broad discretion in offering and rescinding plea agreements, as stated in the documentation. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule 11 governs this process, allowing prosecutors to withdraw or modify offers until a judge accepts them.\n\nOption A is incorrect because prosecutors are not obligated to maintain offers, especially when circumstances change, such as the filing of motions.

The correct answer is A because the documentation states that \"Someone on a tourist visa, in contrast, is very greatly limited in what they could do with a company.\" This presents the most significant legal barrier to growing a business compared to the other options.\n\nOption B is incorrect because lawful permanent residents can \"conduct almost any kind of business,\" with only minor limitations on tax election choices. This presents fewer barriers than option A.\n\nOption C, while not providing limited liability protection, does not face significant legal barriers to growth for a U.S. citizen.\n\nOption D presents the least barriers, as a naturalized U.S. citizen would have full rights to establish and grow any type of business entity.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the legal implications of different business structures and visa statuses, requiring them to apply the information from the documentation to a practical scenario.

I am wondering if this is permitted because these casinos are constructed within the sovereign territory of tribal nations within states, or, if it is because that ruling itself loosened regulations for all gaming institutions, Native or not. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The two general federal restrictions on gambling are in [18 USC ch. 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-50), against off\\-shore gambling ships, and wire communication for transmitting information that assists interstate / international gambling on sporting events and competitions. Interstate lotteries are legal and internet sales of lottery tickets is legal (until Congress or SCOTUS says otherwise). These laws have the usual commerce clause justificational language.\n\nIn addition, the [Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-120/pdf/STATUTE-120-Pg1884.pdf) says that you can't use the internet to engage in otherwise\\-illegal gambling, so if your state prohibits lotteries or bingo, you can't use the internet to gamble (in\\-state or across state/tribal lines). The definitions section ([31 USC 5362(10\\)(C)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/5362)) narrows the term \"unlawful Internet gambling\" so that an online wager is legal if made exclusively within or between the land of one or more tribes, and follows applicable Indian gaming regulations, see below.\n\nGambling on tribal land is covered by [25 USC ch. 29](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/chapter-29) which was passed in response to California v. the Cabazon, and there are three classes of gambling. Traditional and social games with minimal reward are unrestricted; bingo, cards (not games where you play against \"the house\") and other stuff is class II which requires tribal approval etc. The broader 3rd class requires a compact to be negotiated between the state in which the venue is located and the tribe. Section [2710(d)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/25/2710) address the most stringent (and most generally\\-relevant) restrictions. The federal \"take\" on these matters is mediated via the Indian Gaming Commission under Interior (and not, for example, the DOJ), and 2 of the 3 commisioners must be registered tribe members. The law is framed in terms of location on tribal land which is \"within the reservation\" or \"on tribal trust land\", thus an operation owned by a tribe but located on other land is not covered by this act (and would be covered by the relevant state law).\n\nNo specific law is required to permit anything pertaining to gambling, instead a specific law would be necessary to prohibit it. The federal government prohibits very little, leaving that to the states. A state has authority to regulate gambling, but it has no authority to regulate gambling on tribal land, unless Congress gives it such authority (and Congress has not). The Indian Gaming Commission has (apparently) not issued any general regulations to the effect that a casino must disallow out\\-of\\-state gamblers or anything to that effect, although it might technically have the authority to do so.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The casino can offer unrestricted gambling options to customers from all states as long as it's located on tribal land.\nB) The casino must negotiate separate compacts with States A, B, and C to offer Class III gaming to residents of each state.\nC) The casino can offer Class II gaming without restrictions, but must negotiate a compact with State A for Class III gaming.\nD) The casino's online gambling offerings are legal for all U.S. residents due to tribal sovereignty, regardless of state laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and tests critical thinking about the application of gambling laws to tribal casinos. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 USC ch. 29) categorizes gambling into three classes. Class II gaming (like bingo and certain card games) requires only tribal approval, while Class III gaming (which includes most casino-style games) requires a compact negotiated between the tribe and the state where the casino is located.\n\n2. The casino's physical location on tribal land within State A means it only needs to negotiate a compact with State A for Class III gaming, not with States B and C, even if it attracts customers from those states.\n\n3. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act narrows the definition of \"unlawful Internet gambling\" to allow online wagers made exclusively within or between tribal lands, provided they follow applicable Indian gaming regulations.\n\n4. The federal government leaves most gambling regulation to the states, but states have no authority to regulate gambling on tribal land unless Congress grants such authority (which it hasn't).\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are restrictions on Class III gaming.

What is it like in other countries?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> In European anti\\-monopoly law, does that not represent some kind of\n> abuse and monopoly of communications?\n\nAs a general rule, governments are allowed to award monopolies to individuals or private firms, or to governmental entities, and governmental entities are not, in general, subject to anti\\-trust liability.\n\nFor example, governments may nationalize a particular industry, government may authorize a firm that is regulated as a utility to have a monopoly in lieu of using private competition between firms to provide utilities, governments can award patents to inventors which are monopolies, governments can establish a national health service, and so on.\n\nAnti\\-trust law is a create of statute and only prohibits what national governments decide to prohibit by statute, which rarely includes their own activities.\n\nIn the E.U., this is somewhat complicated by the fact that the E.U., generally speaking, tries to put government contracts from within the E.U. but outside the country offer government contracts on an equal footing. But that does not, in general, prevent the government from nationalizing a good or service and making it an exclusively governmental function. The Postal Service is a governmental entity and/or regulated utility, so this would seem to be proper.\n\nIn the same vein, across Continental Europe, notaries public have transferrable, non\\-exclusive license to a particular territory in the country (that can be bought and sold between licensed notaries) and only a small number are allowed in any jurisdiction. Anyone who wants to do business transactions that require notaries must deal with one of them and in low population areas there may well be a monopoly.\n\nAnti\\-trust law is generally directed at preventing unregulated anti\\-competitive conduct by private firms.\n\nAlso, as noted in the original question, the use of means other than mail to cancel contracts isn't mandated, it is a choice of the parties in the context of laws that allow for alternatives. And, while the statutes disfavor electronic communications, the statutes do not, as a comment notes, state that contracts may not be terminated by a letter delivered by hand, signed in person and in presence, or delivered by another carrier providing traceability. The government post office means is presumably less expensive than a private courier providing hand delivery, but termination by hand delivery or courier of a signed dead tree paper letter appears to be allowed to cancel a contract without counter\\-party consent. So, it isn't a true monopoly.\n\nIn the same vein, the law does not mandate that apartment leases require payment of a security deposit, but the prevailing legal rules create an incentive that makes this practice very widespread.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A French tech startup is developing a new digital platform for contract management. They want to disrupt the current market by offering fully digital contract cancellation services. Given the legal landscape described, which of the following strategies would be most likely to succeed while complying with existing regulations?\n\nA) Lobby the government to change Article 1126 of the Civil Code to mandate acceptance of digital cancellations\nB) Partner with La Poste to offer a hybrid digital-postal cancellation service\nC) Create a digital signature system that produces a unique, traceable code for each cancellation request\nD) Offer to handle the physical mailing process for clients, effectively digitalizing the user experience\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal and market situation described in the documentation. The correct answer, B, represents the most pragmatic approach given the current constraints:\n\n1. It acknowledges the legal requirement for physical mail cancellations, which is deeply entrenched and unlikely to change quickly (ruling out option A).\n2. It recognizes La Poste's dominant market position (99% market share) and the legal encouragement for their monopoly, making partnership more feasible than direct competition.\n3. It provides a path to digitalization that doesn't violate the current legal framework, unlike option C which wouldn't satisfy the requirement for physical letters.\n4. It offers a more integrated solution than option D, which merely shifts the burden of mailing but doesn't address the core issue of digital-postal integration.\n\nThis solution requires integrating multiple concepts: the legal requirements, market dynamics, and technological possibilities. It also tests critical thinking by asking students to consider a real-world application that balances innovation with regulatory compliance.

It was used in the context of when a woman promises her partner something in the future for something now.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An \"[executory contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executory_contract)\" is a contract under which not all obligations arising under it have been performed, which seems to fit this definition. In bankruptcy, executory contracts may be either affirmed, in which case both the bankrupt and the counterparty must continue to perform according to its terms, or rejected, in which case the contract is treated as breached and the counterparty has a claim for breach of contract money damages in the bankruptcy together with all other creditors.\n\nWhen a promise is made but is not supported by any consideration other than the other party's reliance, a suit to enforce the promise is called \"promissory estoppel\" rather than \"breach of contract\".\n\nLess likely possibilities are a \"parol contract\" which is a contract that is oral rather than in writing, or a \"pre\\-contract\" which is which is an agreement not to enter into a contract with anyone else until negotiations on the current contract are complete, or a \"personal contract\" which cannot be assigned (such as a contract for personal services).\n\n(Definitions are paraphrased from Black's Law Dictionary, 5th ed. 1979\\. entry on \"contract\").", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A startup founder promises a potential investor 20% equity in the company if the investor provides $500,000 in funding immediately. The founder states that the equity transfer will occur after the company achieves profitability. Which legal concept best describes this arrangement, and what potential issues might arise?\n\nA) This is a standard executory contract with no significant legal concerns\nB) This arrangement may be vulnerable to a promissory estoppel claim if not formalized\nC) The agreement is a pre-contract and is fully enforceable as-is\nD) This is a parol contract and is unenforceable due to the Statute of Frauds\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves multiple legal concepts discussed in the documentation. The arrangement has elements of an executory contract, as not all obligations have been performed (the equity transfer is contingent on future profitability). However, the key issue here is the potential lack of consideration on the founder's part, as the promise of future equity is contingent and not guaranteed.\n\nThis situation closely aligns with the concept of promissory estoppel mentioned in the documentation. If the investor relies on the promise and provides the $500,000, but the agreement is not properly formalized, they might have to resort to a promissory estoppel claim rather than a standard breach of contract suit.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are significant legal concerns with this informal arrangement. Option C is incorrect because a pre-contract typically refers to an agreement not to negotiate with others, which isn't the case here. Option D is incorrect because while this may be a parol (oral) contract, the Statute of Frauds doesn't automatically make all oral contracts unenforceable, and the immediate performance by the investor (providing funds) might take it out of the Statute of Frauds in many jurisdictions.\n\nThis question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and critical thinking about the potential legal implications and risks of informal business agreements."}, "86": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56066/where-does-a-no-parking-zone-start-when-there-is-a-no-parking-sign", "docs_id": 56066, "title": "Where does a no-parking zone start when there is a no parking sign?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the United States, Where does a no\\-parking zone start when there is a no parking sign?

The correct answer is B for several reasons:\n\n1. The R8-3a word message \"NO PARKING\" sign is explicitly mentioned in the MUTCD as suitable for prohibiting parking along a given highway, which would include urban streets.\n\n2. Placing the sign before the actual no-parking zone begins ensures that drivers have advance notice, improving compliance and safety.

The use of a supplemental plaque to indicate the zone's extent is consistent with the MUTCD's provision for word message supplemental plaques, which can provide additional information such as time restrictions or zone limits.\n\n4. This solution balances legal compliance with practical urban design considerations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't provide advance warning and could lead to confusion about whether parking immediately before the sign is allowed.

And of an authority that recognizes and enforces such.\n\nHistorically, debtor\u2019s prisons with penal labor effectively enabled that in most countries, and which is still the practice in some.\n\nThe clearest rationale for the existence of such a right is in any country with a formal security classification system. A person holding a security clearance becomes subject to certain limits on their future actions, beyond that of that of the regular citizenry, which they cannot unilaterally remove even after leaving the position that required it. This appears to be quite close to contracting oneself into an indefinite, limited, servitude.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **NO** (mostly).\n\nServitude means that the employer, or owner of the indenture, or whatever, can use physical force to make the indentee carry out the work given. If the indentee runs away they can be arrested and forcibly returned.\n\nThis is distinct from the law of contracts. If Alice agrees to provide labour for Bob and subsequently fails to fulfil the contract then Alice may have to pay damages, but that is all. Even in cases of crminial fraud where Alice never meant to provide the labour in the first place, the penalty is defined by law, and would not be the provision of the contracted labour.\n\nAs the OP notes, military service is generally an indenture\\-style contract; desertion is a crime.

It also applies this knowledge to a realistic scenario, testing the ability to analyze the situation and determine the most likely law enforcement response based on the given guidelines."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80564/sentencing-guidelines-for-regulation-of-investigatory-powers-act-2000-ripa", "docs_id": 80564, "title": "Sentencing guidelines for Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA)", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have read into [section 49](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/49) of the **Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA)** which can demand suspects surrender passwords for encrypted devices, and [section 53](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/53) makes it an offence not to do so when compelled.\n\nI am confused as to why I was unable to find the **sentencing guidelines** for the above **RIPA** offences, to better understand how a judge would make a decision as to the sentence, and type of sentence (suspended, community order, immediate custodial etc...).\n\nWhy do some offences not appear on the sentencing guidelines website?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statutory requirement for sentencing guidelines are at [section 120](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2009/25/section/120?timeline=false) Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which includes:\n\n> (2\\) A sentencing guideline **may be general in nature** or limited to a particular offence, particular category of offence or particular category of offender.\n\nTherefore, not every offence etc requires \\- or has \\- its own specific sentencing guideline. (*Presumably as there are far too many offences to easily cover, so limited resources might need to be focused on the more common ones*.)\n\nNote that at the foot of the Sentencing Council's [explantory materials](https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/explanatory-material/magistrates-court/item/using-the-mcsg/using-sentencing-council-guidelines/) is this link:\n\n> Where there is no guideline for an offence, refer to the\u00a0[General guideline.](https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/overarching-guides/magistrates-court/item/general-guideline-overarching-principles/)\n\nWhich states it is for:\n\n> sentencing offences for which there is no offence specific sentencing guideline...\n\nSo this General guideline is the one to be applied when dealing with a s.53 RIPA offence. (*I've not reproduced it here to save space*)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: A judge is presiding over a case where the defendant is charged under section 53 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 for failing to surrender passwords for encrypted devices when compelled. The judge needs to determine an appropriate sentence. Which of the following approaches is most aligned with current UK sentencing practices?\n\nA) Consult the specific sentencing guidelines for RIPA offences on the Sentencing Council website\nB) Apply a standardized sentence based on precedent set by similar cases in the past\nC) Refer to the General guideline provided by the Sentencing Council for offences without specific guidelines\nD) Defer the sentencing decision to a specialized cyber-crime sentencing panel\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the given information in a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C because the documentation explicitly states that when there is no specific sentencing guideline for an offence (as is the case with RIPA offences), judges should \"refer to the General guideline.\" This General guideline is designed for \"sentencing offences for which there is no offence specific sentencing guideline.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the documentation indicates that specific sentencing guidelines for RIPA offences are not available on the Sentencing Council website. This reflects the reality that not every offence has its own specific guideline.\n\nOption B is plausible but incorrect. While precedent can play a role in sentencing, the documentation emphasizes the use of the General guideline for offences without specific guidelines, rather than relying solely on past cases.\n\nOption D is a distractor that might seem plausible given the technical nature of the offence, but there's no mention of such a specialized panel in the provided information, and it doesn't align with the described sentencing process.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to interpret legal procedures and apply them to a specific scenario, requiring integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and critical thinking rather than mere memorization."}}
