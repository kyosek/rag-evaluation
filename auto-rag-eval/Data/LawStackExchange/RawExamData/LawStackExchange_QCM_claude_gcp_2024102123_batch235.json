There are many companies and public bodies that have a disproportionate balance across the whole spectrum of protected characteristics but they act fairly and equitably.\n\nAlthough statistics may go towards supporting such an allegation, there must be evidence to show (for example) that the HR policies, recruitment and promotion procedures, and/or company officials are discriminatory and contrary to the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/2/chapter/2/crossheading/discrimination?timeline=false):\n\n> **s.13 Direct discrimination**\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if, because of a\n> protected characteristic, A treats B less favourably than A treats or\n> would treat others.\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> (5\\) If the protected characteristic is race, less favourable treatment\n> includes segregating B from others.\n> \n> \n> \\[...]\n> \n> \n> **s.19 Indirect discrimination**\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A person (A) discriminates against another (B) if A applies to B a\n> provision, criterion or practice which is discriminatory in relation\n> to a relevant protected characteristic of B's.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) For the purposes of subsection (1\\), a provision, criterion or\n> practice is discriminatory in relation to a relevant protected\n> characteristic of B's if\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) A applies, or would apply, it to persons with whom B does not\n> share the characteristic,\n> \n> \n> (b) it puts, or would put, persons with whom B shares the\n> characteristic at a particular disadvantage when compared with persons\n> with whom B does not share it,\n> \n> \n> (c) it puts, or would put, B at that disadvantage, and\n> \n> \n> (d) A cannot show it to be a proportionate means of achieving a\n> legitimate aim.\n> \n> \n> (3\\) The relevant protected characteristics are\u2014 age; disability;\n> gender reassignment; marriage and civil partnership; race; religion or\n> belief; sex; sexual orientation."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company's workforce is 20% Hispanic, but only 2% of promotions in the past year were given to Hispanic employees.

According to the Equality Act 2010, discrimination must involve treating someone less favorably because of a protected characteristic (direct discrimination) or applying a provision, criterion or practice that disadvantages a protected group without justification (indirect discrimination).

A neighbor kid, who lives about 3/4 of a mile from me, and I are training a team of oxen. We walk them on their leads along the road a couple of time a week. There are no houses between my house and the neighbor's. Since only one or two vehicles go by during our walk, often none, we can hear any vehicles from about half a mile away. When we hear a vehicle approaching, we get the team as close to the side of the road as possible, and hold them still. There is no shoulder, one side of the road goes up a hill and the other side down a steep bank to a creek, about 50 feet below road level. Most of the drivers slow down, smile and wave, but there is one driver who, when he sees us, guns his motor, races straight toward us, and swerves at the last minute, passing within two feet of us at 45\\-50 mph. He drives a big, double cab diesel pick\\-up. We can hear him coming, and can tell that he changes how he drives as soon as he sees us, speeding up and heading straight for us. The speed limit is not posted, but is technically 50 mph, although no part of the road is appropriate for that speed. Most drivers go about 30\\-35 mph. I don't know the driver, since he's never stopped to talk.\nMy question is what can be done about this rude, dangerous, intimidating driving, short of not using the road for walking. It is zoned agricultural. This is in the United States, in Oregon. Is what he's doing perfectly legal, or would this be considered reckless endangerment?

This will give you documentation to prevent a \"he said, she said\" situation with the driver and the district attorney and sheriff's department.\n\nThis is really a combination legal and law enforcement situation: you need to bring your own evidence to the attorney, as the sheriff's department isn't going to be able to patrol in hopes of seeing one of these incidents themselves.\n\nGet a smart phone or small video camera and tape one or more of these incidents.

While the developer is required to comply with tax laws in different countries, many jurisdictions have thresholds below which foreign sellers are not required to register or remit taxes.

Answer A is incorrect because international tax obligations can't be ignored entirely. Answer B is too extreme, as it doesn't account for sales thresholds.

Excluding the question of geographic location, the hereditary nature of citizenship seems to be in glaring contrast to other U.S. founding ideals. In Ancient Rome, for instance, being a citizen was more akin to being a nobleman. Similar to our current system, Romans could earn citizenship through service \\- usually militarily. Given that citizenship carries so much weight and is clearly hereditary in the U.S., why is it not considered as a title of nobility? While it does not indicate a British rank, it certainly indicates social rank. If all men are created equal, then why should this distinction exist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The granting of citizenship is expressly recognized in multiple places in the US Constitution. It would be incoherent if the prohibition on titles of nobility meant that the US could not confer citizenship on people. It would also be totally out of sync with any public understanding of \"titles of nobility\" at the time of the framing or today.\n\nThe US has conferred citizenship by parentage to children born abroad since 1790, which is further indication that the nobility clause was not understood to preclude citizenship by parentage.\n\nThe concern behind the nobility clauses was the creation of \"super\\-citizens.\" As [Joseph Story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Story) wrote in his [*Commentaries on the Constitution*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States) at [Vol. 3, p. 215](https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the/Am152G8mqiUC?hl=fr&gbpv=1&pg=PA215&printsec=frontcover):\n\n> \\[the nobility clause] seems scarcely to require even a passing notice. As a perfect equality is the basis of all our institutions, state and national, the prohibition against the creation of any titles of nobility seems proper, if not indespensible, to keep perpetually alive a just sense of this important truth. *Distinctions between citizens*, in regard to rank, would soon lay the foundation of odious claims and privileges, and silently subvert the spirit of independence and personal dignity, which are so often proclaimed to be the best security of a republican government.\n\nHe cited [Federalist No. 84](https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-81-85#s-lg-box-wrapper-25493491), in which Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n> Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be denominated the corner\\-stone of republican government; for so long as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the government will be any other than that of the people.\n\nThe worry was that titles of nobility would undermine the republican system of government.\n\nI also question your premise that citizenship is \"clearly hereditary in the U.S.\" As you say, the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to those merely born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction. For the vast majority of U.S. citizens, citizenship is based on their place of birth being in the U.S. Knowing that somebody is a citizen tells you nothing about their heritage."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation provided, why is U.S. citizenship not considered a title of nobility, despite its hereditary nature for children born abroad to U.S. citizens?\n\nA) Citizenship is explicitly recognized in the U.S. Constitution, while titles of nobility are prohibited.\nB) The 14th Amendment grants citizenship based on birthplace, not heredity.\nC) Citizenship does not create \"super-citizens\" or undermine the republican system of government.\nD) U.S. citizenship has been conferred by parentage since 1790, predating the nobility clause.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key reason citizenship is not considered a title of nobility is that it does not create \"super-citizens\" or undermine the republican system of government, which was the primary concern behind the nobility clauses. The other options, while factually correct, do not directly address the core issue of why citizenship differs from nobility in its impact on the governmental system. Option C best captures the essence of Joseph Story's and Alexander Hamilton's explanations about the purpose of prohibiting titles of nobility, which was to prevent distinctions that would \"subvert the spirit of independence and personal dignity\" and pose a danger to the government being \"that of the people.\""}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/34125/do-i-need-an-illinois-drivers-license", "docs_id": 34125, "title": "Do I need an Illinois Driver&#39;s License?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm an international student on a J1 Visa pursuing a Master's degree at a university in Chicago.

She was ready to provide the service, and it is not her fault she couldn't (and she may have turned down other opportunities because she had this one). I think your fiance's claim would be against the firm providing the security service (they are the ones that frustrated the contract). I foresee the following problems:\n\n* What are her losses? She was prepared to pay $315 (which she has paid), and the dog has been looked after. Where is the loss? (She may be able to argue that it was worth $315 to her, not to have to owe her mother a favour. I don't know if that will fly.)\n* The contract with the security firm almost certainly waives liability for this sort of thing. She would have to convince the court that the contract terms were unreasonable/unconscionable (or whatever the term is in the local jurisdiction).\n\nThere are two obvious options here: a) see if there is legal cover on her household insurance (or her pet insurance); b) forget it (it's only $175 all told)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of the pet sitter who was unable to complete the agreed-upon services due to being denied entry by security, which of the following statements is most accurate from a legal perspective?\n\nA) The pet sitter is legally obligated to refund the entire $315 payment since she did not complete the full 9 days of service.\n\nB) The pet sitter is entitled to keep only $70 (2 days of service) and must refund the remaining $245.\n\nC) The pet sitter is likely legally entitled to keep the full $315 payment, as she was ready to provide the service and the failure to complete it was not her fault.\n\nD) The pet owner has a strong legal case against the pet sitter for breach of contract and can easily recover the full $315 in small claims court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The pet sitter is likely legally entitled to keep the full payment. This is because she was ready and willing to provide the agreed-upon service, and the failure to complete it was due to circumstances beyond her control (being denied entry by security). In contract law, this situation is often viewed as a \"frustration of purpose\" or \"impossibility of performance,\" where the party who was prepared to fulfill their obligations is generally not penalized. Additionally, the pet sitter may have turned down other opportunities to take this job, further justifying retention of the full payment.

At least not fully and not via a corporate structure.\n\nIt is fundamental that entities cannot change their liability to third parties without the consent of the third parties (subject to specific statutory exceptions like the priority afforded secured creditors vis\\-a\\-vis unsecured creditors, and the limited liability concept itself).\n\nSo, if a \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" is negligent, nothing in your corporate structure can relieve that worker from liability. This is true without regard to whether the \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" is an employee or an independent contractor, although, in practice, it is less common to sue an employee than to sue an independent contractor. You can pay for construction defect liability insurance and comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance for them, but they can still be sued and will still have primarily liability.\n\nIn general, absent a direct contractual arrangement to the contrary, a \"mason\" will not have negligence liability for work done by a \"carpenter\" and vis\\-a\\-versa. \n\nOf course, it is often impossible to prevent both from being made parties to a lawsuit for defective work, because the question of whose work caused the problem is often a factual one that isn't clear until an exhaustive investigation by experts has been done. Often both will be sued at the outset and some who are determined to be not at fault or only minimally at fault will be dismissed voluntarily, or with token settlements, as investigations during the course of the litigation reveal who was really at fault.\n\nNow, if you have a contractual relationship with a third party, say the person who is hiring the general contractor, the contract between the person hiring the general contractor and the general contractor can contractually waive the liability of the general contractor and/or the liability of the subcontractor, for ordinary negligence (but not for intentional conduct of a subcontractor since such waivers are contrary to public policy), and can relieve the subcontractors of contractual liability to the person hiring the general contractor.\n\nThis is all a consequence of the contract between the general contractor and the person hiring the general contractor, however, and really has nothing to do with the corporate structure of the general contractor vis\\-a\\-vis the subcontractor.\n\nYou cannot limit the liability of the \"mason\" or \"carpenter\" for harm to persons with whom there is no contractual relationship. For example, suppose that the mason negligently nicks a natural gas line causing an explosion that kills a dozen people who just work in the building and destroys the building. The individual mason and the individual mason's firm, will have liability to the people killed which could not have been limited contractually, although it could be insured against. This is true even if the mason's firm is incorporated, although, if the mason's firm is incorporated, only the person who actually did the work and the firm will have liability, not the co\\-workers of the person who did the work or passive investors in the firm.\n\nHowever, if the mason intentionally engaged in sabotage directed at the natural gas line, with an intent to harm the person who hired the general contractor or anyone else, any contractual waiver of liability in favor of the mason would be void and the mason's insurance policy would not cover the loss (and would not be allowed to cover the loss as a matter of public policy). On the other hand, if the victims of the sabotage had insurance to cover this kind of event, their insurance policies could cover their losses.\n\nIn the other direction, a pre\\-dispute waiver of a subcontractor's right to file a mechanic's lien against the person hiring the general contractor, is usually not permitted for any reason other than payments of the amounts owed to the subcontractor, as a matter of public policy."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A general contractor wants to create a corporate structure that limits liability for different trades (masonry, carpentry, etc.) working under them.

The documentation clearly states that entities cannot change their liability to third parties without the consent of those third parties, except in specific statutory cases. Corporate structure alone cannot shield individual workers or trades from liability for their own negligence, especially towards parties with whom they have no contractual relationship. While insurance can be provided and certain contractual arrangements can limit some liabilities, the fundamental principle remains that individuals and entities are responsible for their own negligent actions.

And being federal land, the state would have no jurisdiction.\n\nThe part about the state having no jurisdiction is something I wouldn't have guessed. It is, after all, within a state, and murder trials are usually not held in federal courts.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Article III, Section 2 of The Constitution requires that\n\n> The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by\n>  jury; and such **trial shall be held in the state** where the said crimes\n>  shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state,\n>  the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law\n>  have directed\n\nSince the Idaho portion of Yellowstone is part of the state of Idaho and is not part of a non\\-state, ergo the trial shall be held in Idaho, according to The Constitution.\n\nOne jurisdictional statute, [16 USC 24](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/16/24), says \n\n> The Yellowstone National Park, as its boundaries now are defined, or\n>  as they may be hereafter defined or extended, shall be under the sole\n>  and exclusive jurisdiction of the United States.

I put emphasis on a sentence that doesn't have a straightforward interpretation. There is another jurisdictional statute [28 USC 131](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/131), the problematic one, which states:\n\n> Wyoming and those portions of Yellowstone National Park situated in\n>  Montana and Idaho constitute one judicial district.\n> \n> \n> Court shall be held at Casper, Cheyenne, Evanston, Lander, Jackson,\n>  and Sheridan.\n\nTherefore, the crime must be tried in Wyoming. Moreover, the judicial district of Wyoming also includes that unoccupied portion of the park in Idaho. This statute conflicts with Article III, Section 2, which requires court to be held in Idaho. Since The Constitution has precedence over federal statutes, the instruction to hold court in Wyoming is unconstitutional. \n\nThe 6th Amendment does not pose a particular problem, with its requirement that\n\n> the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an\n>  impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have\n>  been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained\n>  by law\n\nsince the jury could be of Idahoans, and transported to Wyoming \u2013 the 6th addresses the nature of the jury, not the location of the trial.\n\nIt is an open question what the 6th Amendment refers to in talking of \"state and district\", since district is not defined at a constitutional level. The only district with constitutional stature is the District of Columbia, which is not a state, and therefore there could be no \"state and district\" if we mean \"district, as specifically mentioned in The Constitution\". The [Judiciciary Act of 1789](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1789) first created federal judiciary districts, signed by Washington on September 24, 1789, and the 6th Amendment was passed by Congress the next day. It is reasonable to assume that this is what they meant by \"district\".\n\n28 USC 131 does say that all of Wyoming plus a sliver of Idaho are a judicial district, so one could have a jury composed of citizens of Wyoming which satisfies the \"jury of the district\" requirement, but that would not satisfy the \"jury of the state\" requirement. If anyone lived in that area, those people could constitute a \"jury of the state and district\", but you would still have a clash between the statutory and constitutional requirements for venue."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the hypothetical scenario where a crime is committed in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal proceedings?\n\nA) The trial must be held in Idaho with a jury of Idaho residents, as per Article III of the Constitution.\n\nB) The trial can be held in Wyoming with a jury of Wyoming residents, as per 28 USC 131.\n\nC) The trial cannot be held at all due to the impossibility of forming a constitutional jury.\n\nD) The trial must be held in Idaho, but can have a jury composed of residents from both Idaho and Wyoming.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: This question tests understanding of the complex jurisdictional issues raised by the Yellowstone scenario. Option A is correct because Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution requires that the trial \"shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed.\" This constitutional requirement takes precedence over the conflicting federal statute (28 USC 131) that places the entire park in Wyoming's judicial district. \n\nOption B is incorrect because it contradicts the Constitution's requirement. Option C is incorrect because while there are complications, the Constitution does provide a clear venue (Idaho), and a jury could theoretically be formed from Idaho residents. Option D is a creative solution but doesn't align with the Constitution's requirement for jurors from the state where the crime was committed.\n\nThis question highlights the tension between constitutional requirements and federal statutes in this unique jurisdictional scenario."}, "16": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14266/is-direct-voting-of-bills-laws-by-the-people-allowed-in-the-consitutionus", "docs_id": 14266, "title": "Is direct voting of bills/laws by the people allowed in the consitution(US)?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm talking big issues like the recent vote by the British vote to exist EU.

Art. 1 Sect 7 says that Bills originate in the House or Senate (and revenue specifically in the House); and there is a procedure for presidential signing / veto / veto\\-override, in order to become law. Section 8 states what powers Congress has. In order for it to be binding at the national level for people to vote on some issue, there would have to be massive amendment of the Constitution, to give The People power to enact legislation, perhaps immune to presidential veto (or perhaps *with* absolute veto power, or some specified means of overriding a veto).\n\nAn alternative would be that for a special issue, Congress could \"contingently\" pass a bill, through the normal vote in both houses plus presidential approval, and the bill could then contain a further provision that the act is nullified if... and then you could specify some conditions. It could be for example a simple yes/no majority vote of those voters eligible to vote for president. In case Congress and POTUS approved the law but the majority of The People voted the law down, there is a distinct possibility that the constitutionality of the \"refer it to a vote\" provision would be ruled unconstitutional (conflicting with Art. 1 Sect. 1\\), and thus the bill would become law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the U.S. Constitution, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the process of enacting federal laws through direct public vote, similar to the Brexit referendum in the UK?\n\nA) The Constitution allows for direct public votes on federal laws without any amendments, as long as Congress approves the referendum.\n\nB) The Constitution explicitly prohibits any form of direct public vote on federal legislation.\n\nC) The Constitution would require significant amendments to allow for binding national referendums on federal laws.\n\nD) The President has the authority to call for a national referendum on federal laws without Congressional approval.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The U.S. Constitution, as it currently stands, does not provide for direct public voting on federal laws. Article I, Section 1 vests all legislative powers in Congress, consisting of the Senate and House of Representatives. To allow for binding national referendums similar to the Brexit vote, significant constitutional amendments would be necessary to grant the public direct legislative power.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Constitution does not currently allow for direct public votes on federal laws, even with Congressional approval.

For example, your surgeon and police examples could potentially constitute [negligent homicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligent_homicide) if someone died.\n\nSpeaking very generally, contractual damages are usually calculated to put the plaintiff in the position they would have occupied if the contract was not breached, so a person who gives insufficient notice would only be liable to compensate the employer for the losses that relate to the insufficient notice, not any additional losses that are inherent in the replacement of an employee. The cost of litigation and public relations risk associated with suing an ex\\-employee are major reasons not to sue for these losses.

Her actions are not criminal per se in a civilian context. However, she may be liable for civil damages related to the insufficient notice. The non-abandonment clause is not automatically enforceable, and a court would likely assess actual damages incurred by the employer due to the lack of notice. These damages could be less than, equal to, or potentially even exceed the $50,000 specified in the clause, depending on the specific circumstances and provable losses.

The first question is what (or who) is actually being sanctioned, second who is impacted by the sanction, third what is the specific sanction? There are a variety of different types of sanctions, sanctions against the state, businesses, people, etc. Most sanctions for example are against specific people, or conduct like investment or movement of capital, not necessarily the purchase of goods. I go into further discussion below, but for the **quicker answer to your specific question**, unless the person you are buying from is directly sanctioned or the subject of sanctions, or the entities specifically involved in the sale of goods (export company, vessel, etc) are directly sanctioned (or Russian companies operated in Crimea), yes it would be legal to purchase. So yes, unless the specific item you are buying/ entity you are buying it from is specifically sanctioned it would be legal, it is not particularly common for sanctions to prohibit the purchase of goods by consumers, unless there is a unique circumstance.\n\nHere is the 2\\-3 page overview of U.S. sanctions on Russia: [https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10779\\.pdf](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/row/IF10779.pdf)\n\nAs to the further discussion. For example see below, many current sanctions are against government officials; Or in the case of EO 13685 from 2014 concerning the occupation of Crimea many of the sanctions imposed aren't strictly against *Russia*, but instead prohibits U.S. business, trade, or investment *in occupied Crimea*.\n\nEO 13685 excerpt:\n\n> Section 1\\.

It is quite probable that your landlord said \"fine\" to the month\\-to\\-month extension because it was already part of your existing lease.\n\nSecond, you will need to look at your existing lease and see what notification was required for you to move out. Typically, a lease transitions to month\\-to\\-month and in your lease it probably already said that you needed to provide 30 days notice even if you were leaving at the end of the lease's original term.\n\nThird, yes, you are on the hook for rent until you give 30 days notice. Your \"verbal agreement\" is a contract and your landlord agreed to allow you to stay in the apartment as long as you gave him 30 days notice before moving out and paid your rent every month.\n\nMost of this is probably already spelled out in your current lease. Even if it isn't, you have indicated that you have a verbal contract with your landlord."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John's one-year lease is ending in 3 days. He verbally agreed with his landlord to switch to a month-to-month arrangement with 30 days notice required before moving out. John then finds a new place and wants to move immediately when his current lease ends. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's legal obligations?\n\nA) John has no obligation to pay any additional rent since he hasn't signed a new written agreement for the month-to-month arrangement.\n\nB) John is only obligated to pay rent for the 3 remaining days of his current lease.\n\nC) John must pay for an additional 30 days of rent from the day he gives notice, even if it extends beyond his current lease end date.\n\nD) John's obligations depend entirely on the specific wording of his original lease agreement regarding lease termination and notice periods.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Even though John didn't sign a new written agreement, his verbal agreement with the landlord to switch to a month-to-month arrangement with 30 days notice is considered a valid contract. By agreeing to this arrangement, John has committed to providing 30 days notice before moving out, regardless of when his original lease ends. Therefore, he is legally obligated to pay rent for an additional 30 days from the day he gives notice, even if this period extends beyond the end date of his original lease. This scenario emphasizes the binding nature of verbal agreements in tenancy situations and the importance of carefully considering commitments before making them."}, "23": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33901/youtube-copyright", "docs_id": 33901, "title": "YouTube Copyright", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What could happen if I copy some content from an article on a website and narrate it on my YouTube channel with some modifications?

Expedia offers airline credit but it's extremely restricted. Basically you can only use it for a single ticket on one booking for the same person on the same airline departing from the same country and costing the same price. Ideally we want cash back or at least Air France's conditions which offer a voucher that becomes refundable after one year.

They are not a traditional travel agent acting as an intermediary.\n\nSo, no matter what, you can\u2019t get your money from them.\n\nWhat does the contract say?\n---------------------------\n\nWe have already established that the regulation requiring a refund has excluded itself so the first thing to look at is your contract and *why* Air France cancelled the contract. They could have cancelled it because a government prohibited the flight, or because it was unsafe to make the flight, or because it was uneconomic, or ... \n\nAs an added complication, you might have been prohibited from taking the flight even if it had been operated depending on your nationality and government restrictions at the time, if so, the cancellation of the flight has caused you no damage beyond that which you suffered from the government decree\n\nThe first step is to read your contract and find out who bears the risk for each of those eventualities and what has to be done. If the contract says you get a refund, you get a refund, if it says you get a credit, you get a credit. Ultimately, if there is a complete and utter failure of consideration, you are entitled to a refund \\- that is if they cannot provide you with a flight within a reasonable time. In theory, when this all ends, they could contact you and say, \u201cwe can fly you tomorrow\u201d \\- they would then have fulfilled their obligation even if you don\u2019t want to fly tomorrow.

That is, between the parties, who took the risk of that unforeseeable event?\n\nIf the contract is silent then, under French (civil) law, Air France is relieved of its contractual obligations, that is, they are not in breach of their contract and are not subject to damage. However, if the contract is under Common (English/US etc.) law then they have breached their contract and owe you damages. Whose law is the contract under?

Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_v._Garner), common law allowed police to use deadly force to effect the arrest of a person suspected of a felony. Even though SCOTUS there held that such a practice violates Fourth Amendment civil rights, I was surprised to find that [in some states it is *still* lawful for police to use deadly force to effect an arrest](https://web.archive.org/web/20190206192128/http://www.slu.edu/colleges/law/journal/police-use-of-deadly-force-state-statues-30-years-after-garner/)!\n\nLet us examine the most extreme case, which is that the police can legally shoot at you to effect your arrest. As explained [here, you are always allowed to resist \"excessive force.\"](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/2211/10) If you make it to court, these qualifications (e.g., \"necessary\" and \"excessive\") are ultimately decided based on what a \"reasonable person\" would have believed in the situation. So if a cop shoots at you, and you \"dodge\" the bullet, it is *possible* for you both to be found not guilty of any crime. I.e., the cop can be found to have acted \"reasonably\" because he believed you were a violent felon and shooting you was the only way to stop you. And you can be found to have acted \"reasonably\" because you believed you were being subject to excessive force.\n\nWhile this is an interesting hypothetical, in practice of course by the time a cop is shooting at you you are almost certainly going to be *charged* with resisting arrest. Or, if the cop fired in self\\-defense (rather than to effect an arrest) you will be charged with a number of far more serious crimes (starting with felony assault, reckless endangerment, and going on from there...)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, under what circumstances might a person legally be allowed to dodge or avoid being shot by the police without it being considered resisting arrest?\n\nA) Only if the person is innocent of any crime\nB) If the person reasonably believes the police are using excessive force\nC) If the person is suspected of a misdemeanor rather than a felony\nD) Never, as any attempt to avoid police gunfire is always considered resisting arrest\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, a person is always allowed to resist \"excessive force\" from law enforcement. If an individual reasonably believes that the police are using excessive force - such as shooting at them in a situation where it's not warranted - they may legally try to avoid being shot without it being considered resisting arrest.

Fair\\-use defenses look at four questions, and the answers to the questions can tip the scales in favor of or against a finding of fair use:\n\n1. **Does your kind of copying affect the market for the original?** To what extent can your copy fulfill the demand for the original? What if there were widespread copying of the kind you're considering? The more potential there is for the copies to replace the original, the less likely it is to be fair use. *(This is the most important factor in the analysis.)*\n2. **Why did you make the copy?** If you made the copy for purposes of news reporting, criticism, or commentary, it's more likely to be fair use. If you made a copy just so you could emjoy the work again whenever you felt like it, that may still be fair use, but it is somewhat less likely. If you made a copy just so you could sell it for profit, that's almost certainly not fair use.\n3. **How much did you copy?** Did you copy the whole thing, or did you copy only as much as you needed to achieve your purpose under Question 2? If you copy \"too much\" \u2013 either in the raw amount or as a fraction of the whole work \u2013 it's less likely to be fair use.\n4. **What did you copy?** Highly creative works, such as poems, music, and movies, are at the \"core\" of copyright principles. A fair use analysis will be more stringent in these cases than when dealing with a copy of a purely factual work, such as a phone book, biography, or list of statistics. Such works are still protected by copyright, but that protection is not as strong.\n\nSo take all of those and imagine the answer to each on a spectrum. If you see things generally tipping in the direction of fair use, that's a good indication that you're going to be safe. If you see things tipping in the other direction, you may want to reconsider.\n\nThese questions can be trickier than you might think. If you're dealing with a real situation, you should consult an attorney to get an answer specific to your situation.\n\nBut what if I don't make any money?\n-----------------------------------\n\nThis fact tips the scales in your favor, but only on Question 2; you still need to consider the other factors. Whether you make money is less important than whether your copying deprives the copyright owner of the opportunity to make money, but then you have to balance that consideration against the First Amendment principles embedded in fair\\-use analysis.\n\nSo if you're ripping *Star Wars* DVDs to hand them out as Christmas presents, your lack of a profit motive will not save you.

The second cheapest alternative is filing a claim in small claims court (assuming your jurisdiction doesn't have a special landlord\\-tenant dispute adjudication board). This does not require a lawyer, it simply requires that you can say why you think you are entitled to have your deposit returned. He will, of course, say why he thinks he is entitled to keep the deposit. This is where it could be useful for you to actually know the landlord\\-tenant law of your jurisdiction.\n\nFor example, it is pretty much guaranteed that deduction for \"furniture usage\" which you didn't agree to is illegal. It is reasonably likely that a stain on the carpet could be deductible. You are probably entitled to a written statement of alleged damages, and you would need to dispute his claims (in writing, delivered by certified mail). In that dispute letter you should provide all of the evidence you have to support your claim (for example, photos). If it all comes down the carpet stain (total replacement because of a dirty spot), the court is not likely to accept his deduction.

Are there changes to be made?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two relevant EU laws: GDPR and ePrivacy.\n\nUsing Google Analytics does not require consent as far as the GDPR is concerned. The processing can instead be based on legitimate interest, but you do have to offer opt\\-out and must use suitable security measures, for example by signing the data processing agreement with Google. Alternatively, an argument is possible that the collected data doesn't qualify as personal data \u2013 but I don't think that argument is correct.\n\nThe ePrivacy directive is more tricky. It is not directly enforceable law. Instead, directives are implemented through member state law. As a result, there can be subtle differences between member states. What one data protection authority allows is not necessarily relevant in another country.\n\nePrivacy requires you to collect consent when you access information on the user's device, for example when you read or write cookies or use similar technologies, regardless of whether the information is personal data in the sense of the GDPR. The only exception is when the access is strictly necessary for your application \u2013 but that doesn't cover analytics. This ePrivacy requirement is the source of all the cookie consent banners you see on the web.\n\nGoogle Analytics stores a Client ID on the user's device, which is used to combine separate events into a session or user profile. Optionally, this Client ID can be linked with a User ID, which lets you track a signed\\-in user across devices.\n\nBut storing/acessing this Client ID requires consent under ePrivacy.\n\nIf you want to avoid asking for consent, you must disable storage of the Client ID. On the web, this can be reached by setting `'storage': 'none'` for analytics.js or `'client_storage': 'none'` for gtag.js. I use this approach on my personal website, with the result that \u201cpageviews\u201d and \u201csessions\u201d are now synonymous. I am not sure what the equivalent would be on mobile, but the same concerns apply.\n\nI assume (but do not know for sure) that the consent requirement only applies to persistently stored data. Keeping a transient User ID in memory is likely fine. That would let you correlate events into a session while the app remains open, without having to ask for consent."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A mobile app developer wants to implement Google Analytics in their EU-based application without obtaining user consent.

By disabling the storage of the Client ID and only keeping transient data in memory, the app avoids storing information on the user's device, which would require consent under ePrivacy. This approach still allows for some analytics functionality without triggering the consent requirement.\nC) is insufficient because offering an opt-out doesn't negate the need for initial consent under ePrivacy for storing information on the user's device.\nD) is incorrect because mobile apps are not exempt from ePrivacy regulations.

Per ORC 2741\\.02, \"except as otherwise provided in this section, a person shall not use any aspect of an individual's persona for a commercial purpose...\", as long as you are not dead and have not given written consent for the use, a question that you should research carefully), also it must not be \"in connection with any news, public affairs, sports broadcast, or account\", not political campaign, and also as long as you are \"an individual whose domicile or residence is in this state\" (with various exceptions to the exceptions).\n\nIf they have violate your right of publicity, you can sue them, but there is a requirement to notify the trespasser (your attorney will deal with this, I mention this just in case you decide to try a DIY lawsuit). If you win, you might get actual damages (i.e. how much did you actually lose), which includes \"any profits derived from and attributable to the unauthorized use of an individual's persona for a commercial purpose\", or at your discretion between $2,500 and $10,000\\. There is also the option of punitive damages which adds as much as twice the compensatory damages award, if their act was \"really bad\" (a very complex calculation, but basically \"not an innocent mistake\").\n\nThen there are [other exceptions](http://codes.ohio.gov/orc/2741.09v1) where the law does not apply, much of which doesn't have clear relevance but the provision \"The use of the persona of an individual solely in the individual's role as a member of the public if the individual is not named or otherwise singled out as an individual\" is likely to be a problem for a lawsuit."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An employee at an amusement park discovers that their image has been used without their consent in various promotional materials for the park's hiring efforts.

An assault is a threat or attempt to inflict offensive physical contact or bodily harm on a person which puts the person in immediate danger of or in apprehension of such harm or contact. Groping is an example of offensive contact that does not involve bodily harm. Assault is against the law in two ways. First, it is a tort, meaning that the victim can sue the assailant for the damage that was caused. Second, it is generally a crime, meaning that the assailant might be punished, if convicted. The Canadian law regarding the crime of assault is [\u00a7265 of the Criminal Code](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-265.html). The law says plainly that\n\n> A person commits an assault when (a) without the consent of another\n>  person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly\n>  or indirectly\n\nWhether or not the government will pursue the matter is difficult to say. The standard procedure is that the victim reports the event to the police, who will decide whether to investigate, and it could end up in court being prosecuted by the Crown.\n\nThe other path is a lawsuit, where the person harmed files a lawsuit and has his day in court. The victim files a complaint alleging that certain events took place (it has to match toe legal definition of assault), and that you were harmed in a way that can be redressed with an award of money. You would, of course, hire a lawyer to pursue this, because you can't just say to the court \"Make him pay, he punched me\". You might be awarded something for emotional distress. You might want to talk to a lawyer about the prospects for getting an award large enough to cover your legal bill.\n\nNeedless to say, punching as payback is *also* assault, which as I mentioned is a crime. It's quite possible that the police will decide not to pursue the first assault but would take a dimmer view of revenge assault and prosecute you."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Canadian law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the situation described in the school field trip incident?\n\nA) The repeated light punches on the arm do not constitute assault because they did not cause bodily harm.\n\nB) The victim's best course of action is to punch the offender back, as it would be considered self-defense.\n\nC) The incident meets the legal definition of assault under Canadian Criminal Code \u00a7265, but prosecution depends on various factors.\n\nD) The victim must file a civil lawsuit to have any legal recourse for the unwanted touching.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the Canadian Criminal Code \u00a7265, assault occurs when a person \"without the consent of another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly.\" The repeated unwanted touching, even if light, meets this definition. However, whether the incident will be prosecuted depends on factors such as police investigation and the Crown's decision to pursue the case. While the victim could potentially file a civil lawsuit, it's not the only legal recourse available. Retaliating with physical violence (option B) would itself be considered assault and is not a legal solution. Option A is incorrect because the absence of bodily harm does not negate the possibility of assault under the law."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42499/what-kind-of-trust-should-i-choose-when-applying-for-ein-roll-over-assets-fro", "docs_id": 42499, "title": "What kind of &quot;Trust&quot; should I choose when applying for EIN?

This is because a revocable trust becomes irrevocable upon the death of the last grantor. The trust doesn't need to be completely recreated, but it does require a new EIN to reflect its changed status.

This approach allows for continuity in managing the trust's assets while acknowledging the legal change in the trust's nature.

Perhaps if the decision was 8\\-0 one could argue that the Texas lawmakers should have known better and were just wasting taxpayers' time and money, but there were 3 dissenting justices, which to me, legitimizes the attempt to pass the law. Yet, I'm not fully understanding the dissenting opinions.\n\nMy question: are the dissenting opinions claiming that Texas HB2 does not present a \"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion\", or are they claiming that the premise is wrong and it should be OK for a law to present a \"substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion\", or something else entirely?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Justice Thomas's position is two\\-pronged. First, he argues that the court has taken the wrong approach to protecting abortion all along:\n\n> I remain fundamentally opposed to the Court\u2019s abortion\n>  jurisprudence.\n\nHe then argues that even taking *Casey* as precedent, the court has raised the standard that laws affecting access to abortions are judged by:\n\n> These precepts \\[...] transform the undue\\-burden test to\n>  something much more akin to strict scrutiny.\n\nMy takeaway is that he thinks jumping straight to a balancing test muddles the \"undue\\-burden\" and \"legitimate interest\" portions of the *Casey* test. He would have answered *first* whether these laws posed an undue burden upon women seeking abortions. If the answer there was \"no\", then the law only needs to pass a rational basis test. However, by immediately jumping to a test than balances the burden on women and legitimate interests of the state, he argues that a more heightened scrutiny is applied to these laws than *Casey* stands for.\n\nFurther, he argues that the clinics should not be able to sue to protect a right that they don't even claim belongs to them:\n\n> This suit is possible only because the Court has allowed\n>  abortion clinics and physicians to invoke a putative constitutional\n>  right that does not belong to them\u2014a woman\u2019s\n>  right to abortion.\n\nJustice Alito's position rests on *[res judicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_judicata)*."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to Justice Thomas's dissenting opinion in the Supreme Court decision on Texas HB2, what is the primary issue with the majority's application of the undue-burden test from Casey?\n\nA) The majority ignored the undue-burden test completely\nB) The majority applied the undue-burden test too leniently\nC) The majority transformed the undue-burden test to be more akin to strict scrutiny\nD) The majority failed to consider the state's legitimate interests\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Justice Thomas argued that the majority's approach to the undue-burden test from Casey effectively transformed it into something more akin to strict scrutiny. He believed that by immediately balancing the burden on women against the state's legitimate interests, the Court applied a higher level of scrutiny than what Casey originally intended. Thomas argued that the Court should have first determined whether the law posed an undue burden, and only if it did, then apply a more stringent test. This transformation of the test, in his view, went beyond the precedent set in Casey and imposed a stricter standard on laws affecting abortion access."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/79231/renting-a-property-for-more-than-one-year", "docs_id": 79231, "title": "Renting a property for more than one year", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I read the following sentence on a website regarding rental properties in Washington:\n\n> In Washington State, if your lease is longer than 1 year a Legal Description of the property is required along with a notarized lease agreement.\n\nWhat does \"a legal description of the property is required\" mean?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [That statement](https://tsquareproperties.net/snohomish-county-rental-agreement/) goes beyond what Washington law actually says.\n[RCW 59\\.18\\.210](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18&full=true#59.18.210) states (for residential tenancies) that\n\n> Tenancies from year to year are hereby abolished except when the same\n> are created by express written contract.

Resol. 669 (2001\\)](http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1278&context=facpub) in \"Mandatory Binding Arbitration and the Demise of the Seventh Amendment Right to a Jury Trial\" partially addresses this (the focus though is on binding arbitration). One thing to note is that the Seventh Amendment does not appear to apply to issues in state court (it is a separate and fascinating question to wonder what parts of The Constitution are incorporated against states, and why). All is not lost for the constitutional question, we just need a different constitution.\n\nBy the agreement terms, \"This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York\". Therefore, New York's Constitution (Article 1 Sect 2\\) is also applicable:\n\n> Trial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been guaranteed\n>  by constitutional provision shall remain inviolate forever; but *a jury\n>  trial may be waived by the parties in all civil cases in the manner to\n>  be prescribed by law*.\n\nThus, the right may be waived. Waiver of a right to jury trial is not the same as waiver of the right to trial: what the agreement says is that litigants would have a civil bench trial, where the judge determines whether there was a breach.\n\nIn New York, [NY CPLR \u00a7 4102](http://law.justia.com/codes/new-york/2012/cvp/article-41/4102) allows parties to waive civil trial by jury (and unlike [California](https://casetext.com/case/grafton-partners-v-superior-court-2)), such waiver terms have been [upheld](http://www.chadbourne.com/sites/default/files/publications/hall%20judge%20smith%20nylj%20reprint%2012%2009.pdf), but the courts have recognized that there is a problem, so it's not always obvious whether such waivers in contracts are legal."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Under New York state law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding contractual waiver of the right to a jury trial in civil cases?\n\nA) Contractual waivers of jury trials are always enforceable, as the right to a jury trial can be freely waived by parties in any contract.\n\nB) Contractual waivers of jury trials are never enforceable, as they violate the New York State Constitution's guarantee of jury trials in civil cases.\n\nC) Contractual waivers of jury trials are generally enforceable, but courts have recognized potential issues and may scrutinize such waivers on a case-by-case basis.\n\nD) Contractual waivers of jury trials are only enforceable if explicitly authorized by a separate New York statute for each type of civil case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

I'm interested in what can still make something obscene without involving other crimes.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: As far as I can tell, the established category of \"obscene\" material is child pornography, and the most current relevant case is [US v. Williams](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/553/285/#tab-opinion-1962658), 553 U.S. 285\\. The relevant law is 18 USC 2252A which refers as a subcase to \"an obscene visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\". Obscenity is not actually a requirement for conviction under the law, it suffices for material to be non\\-obscene \"child pornography\" ([Osborne v. Ohio](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/495/103/), 495 U.S. 103\\). Outside of the realm of child pornography laws, there don't appear to be any cases of tenable laws against \"obscenity\" from the past 25 years. The Miller test ([Miller v.

According to the information provided, child pornography is the most established and consistently prosecuted category of obscene material under current U.S. law. The most recent relevant case mentioned is US v. Williams (2008), which deals with child pornography laws.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage indicates that outside of child pornography, there haven't been notable obscenity prosecutions in the past 25 years.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while the Miller test potentially applies to non-child-related cases, the passage states that \"nothing recent clearly establishes a concrete category of prohibited materials\" using this test.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the question specifically asks about obscenity separate from other crimes, and bestiality would likely be prosecuted under animal abuse laws rather than purely obscenity statutes."}}
