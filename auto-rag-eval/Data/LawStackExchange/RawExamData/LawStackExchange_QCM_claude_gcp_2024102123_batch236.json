Or an e\\-mail signature that is attached to every e\\-mail?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question of whether a person was acting on their own behalf or that of a company would generally be a question of fact, so if such a case came to court it would be for both sides to present evidence and argue for their interpretation of it.\n\nIn most cases the context makes it clear. You mention having a company email domain and associated email signature; that is certainly good practice and would go a long way towards creating a presumption that you were acting for a company. Also signing yourself with your job title or role (e.g. \"Joe Bloggs, Chief Bottlewasher\") makes it clear that you are speaking in your role as an employee.\n\nThe content of the communication also matters; if you use your company email address to order goods from a supplier that the company has used before then the recipient can reasonably assume that you are ordering on behalf of the company and a court is likely to agree. OTOH if you use the company address to send libellous emails then the recipient would have a much higher bar to claim that this was the company view rather than a personal one.",

Which of the following scenarios is MOST likely to be interpreted as Jane acting on behalf of her company rather than as an individual?\n\nA) Jane uses her personal Gmail account and signs off with just her name.\nB) Jane uses a company email address with the business domain, includes her job title in the signature, and references previous orders made by the company.\nC) Jane uses her personal email but mentions her company name once in the body of the email.\nD) Jane uses a company email address but discusses personal matters unrelated to the business in the same email.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Option B provides the strongest evidence that Jane is acting on behalf of her company. It incorporates multiple best practices mentioned in the documentation:\n1. Using a company email address with the business domain\n2. Including a job title in the signature\n3. Referencing previous company orders, which establishes context for a business transaction\n\nOption A lacks any indication of company affiliation. Option C provides minimal company association. Option D, while using a company email, introduces personal matters that could blur the line between personal and professional communication. Option B clearly establishes the business context and Jane's role within the company, making it the most likely scenario to be interpreted as Jane acting on behalf of her company."

Fair use in the United States is determined on a case-by-case basis, considering multiple factors as outlined in 17 U.S. Code \u00a7 107. These factors include the purpose and character of the use (including whether it's commercial or nonprofit educational), the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the potential market for the original work. While educational use is a factor that can support fair use, it's not the only consideration, and even educational use isn't automatically fair use. Similarly, the presence of donations doesn't automatically disqualify fair use, though it may be considered in evaluating the commercial nature of the use. Proper citation alone does not guarantee fair use. Each situation must be evaluated individually based on all relevant factors."

The tenants recently renewed for another 12 month lease and have been very happy. Through offhanded discussions with them, the landlord learned that they effectively do not utilize the security system. The inclusion of such system is not explicit (or implicit) anywhere in the lease.\n\nIs the landlord within their legal rights to inquire about whether they use it, so that they may turn it off and stop paying for it if not? Is this rude?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is certainly no legal problem in asking if the tenants would be agreeable with the landlord discontinuing the security service. Even if it were in the lease, a lease like pretty much any contract can be changed by mutual agreement of all parties (unless there is a law preventing such a change, which is rare and I do not think will apply in this case).\n\nA more difficult question would be if the landlord would be within his or her rights to discontinue the service without asking the tenants first, since it is not in the lease. Since the property was advertised as coming with the service, it might be held that the continued service was reasonably expected by the tenants, and thus an implicit term of the lease. But since the landlord does not plan to take such unilateral action, that remains a purely theoretical issue.\n\nThe landlord could offer the tenants a small rent reduction, perhaps one quarter of the amout that was being paid to the security firm, but there is no legal requirement to do so.\n\nAs to whether asking for such a change would be \"rude\", I don't think so, but that is a matter of opinion, and not really on\\-topic here.",

What is the most legally sound approach for the landlord?\n\nA) Discontinue the security service without informing the tenants, as it's not explicitly mentioned in the lease.\nB) Inform the tenants that the service will be discontinued and reduce their rent by the full amount of the security service cost.\nC) Ask the tenants if they would agree to discontinue the service, potentially offering a small rent reduction.\nD) Continue the service without discussion, as it was part of the original advertisement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most legally sound and ethical approach. The landlord has the right to inquire about the tenants' use of the security system and propose discontinuing it. This approach respects the tenants' expectations based on the original advertisement while allowing for a mutually agreeable change. Offering a small rent reduction (suggested as perhaps one-quarter of the security service cost) is a good-faith gesture but not legally required. This option avoids potential issues of implicit terms in the lease while maintaining open communication with the tenants.\n\nOption A is risky as it could be argued that the service was an implicit term of the lease based on the advertisement. Option B goes beyond what's legally necessary by offering the full cost as a rent reduction. Option D is unnecessarily costly for the landlord if the service isn't being used, and there's no legal requirement to maintain an unadvertised service."

Now, the business owner is focused on testing out the business idea, and does not have money to hire a legal consultant just yet. So there are a few GDPR violations on the web blog that don't seem that obvious (or serious) to the naked eye, for example:\n\n* Visitors are not asked to consent to using cookies\n* The blog uses a web analytics plugin, that sends customer's IP addresses and locations to a 3rd\\-party company outside of UK/EU, and the business owner does not sign any additional agreements with the 3rd party\n* The website has a very short and generic Terms of Service page that are just copied over from another similar website, and are not using contractual language\n* Visitors are allowed to upload images to the web server when they write comments, but are not asked/warned to avoid uploading any illegal/copyrighted content\n\nNow, the business owner has no malicious intent to steal people's data, etc, and there have been no security breaches where hackers could gain access to the data. And there are not many users of the web blog anyway (let's say \\~500 people who registered their names and email addresses in the system).\n\nHowever, it is clear that quite a few GDPR rules are violated here.

The GDPR Enforcement Tracker shows examples of fines imposed on private individuals and small entities, ranging from 500 to 3000 Euros.

An advertisement could lawfully encourage applications by persons having certain protected attributes (e.g., born and raised in South America; Native American; Veteran; transgender) in order to diversify the workforce, but it could not lawfully suggest that hiring preference would be given to applicants with those protected attributes. That's a fine line, and it's easy for an employer to cross it, either willfully or inadvertantly. It's best\\-\\-from both a practical and a legal perspective\\-\\-to determine the hiring criteria and process before seeking applicants; and to separate that screening process from the advertising process. The advertising process could, for example, target underrepresented groups as long as it did not preclude other persons/groups from learning about or applying for the opportunities.",

Which of the following actions by an employee would be most legally appropriate when sharing a job posting on social media?\n\nA) \"We're looking for women and people of color to fill this position.

We encourage applications from all qualified individuals: [link]\"\nD) \"Preference will be given to applicants from underrepresented groups. Apply now: [link]\"\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most legally appropriate action. It encourages diversity without showing preference for any protected class or potentially discouraging other applicants. Option A directly states a preference for specific protected classes, which could be seen as discriminatory. Option B, while less direct, still implies a preference for certain groups. Option D explicitly states that preference will be given based on protected characteristics, which is illegal. The correct approach is to encourage diversity and applications from all qualified individuals without suggesting hiring preferences based on protected attributes."

When did beating your child become illegal? Or was it always and now it is just more strictly enforced? Is spanking a child technically legal?\n\nA man I knew, who fought in World War 2, once boasted about how well behaved his children were growing up. He said that only once one threw a tantrum and it was in a store and he \"swiftly pulled down his pants, hit him a few times, pulled up his pants and carried on.\" Is this illegal?\n\nEDIT: what about how it was done in public? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are many countries / states / provinces in North America, each with their own laws on this subject, so this question is potentially quite broad. I will focus on the United States.\n\nTo this day, it is legal in all 50 US states for a parent to strike a child as a means of discipline (\"corporal punishment\"), but laws generally include a requirement that the force used is \"reasonable\" in some sense. However, it is not legal for a parent to cause serious injury to a child. The line between \"reasonable punishment\" and \"serious injury\" seems to not be well defined, and may have shifted over time due to changes in law, court decisions, or prosecutorial discretion. So the answer may hinge on what you mean by the word \"beating\". However, spanking seems to be generally considered \"reasonable\" under the law.\n\nI found the following article which explores this issue in depth:\n\n> Coleman, Doriane Lambelet; Dodge, Kenneth A;, and Campbell, Sarah Keeton. Where and how to draw the line between reasonable corporal punishment and abuse. 73 *Law and Contemporary Problems* 107\\-166 (Spring 2010\\). <http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol73/iss2/6>",

According to the information provided, corporal punishment of children by parents is legal in all 50 US states, but with the requirement that the force used is \"reasonable\" and does not cause serious injury. While the exact definition of \"reasonable\" may not be well-defined and may have shifted over time, spanking is generally considered to fall within this category. \n\nOption A is incorrect because corporal punishment is not completely illegal in any US state. Option C is incorrect because spanking is specifically mentioned as being generally considered reasonable under the law. Option D is incorrect because the information states that corporal punishment is legal in all 50 states, not varying by state.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of the current legal status of corporal punishment in the US, highlighting the nuances between what is considered legal and illegal in this context."

It is regarded as a criticism or comment on the original copyrighted work. In simple terms, it has to convey to the audience some type of message about the original work. This \u201cmessage\u201d fits can be understood to transform the original work (the work that\u2019s being parodied) because that message is adding something new; it takes all or part of the original work and gives it a different purpose or character. \\[...]\n\nMaking a game about characters from this TV show fighting each other, when in the series it's all about loving each other could be seen as criticism or comment on the peacefulness of the original characters. So why doesn't that count as parody?\n\nIn a related fashion, I'm thinking about a game where giant dynamaxed Pokemon unleash death and destruction onto the world. If PETA's Pokemon clone is parody, wouldn't an overly brutal version of Pokemon be parody as well? I would be creating my own assets.\n\nWhat exactly is and isn't parody?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The details of this specific matter are not clear because [it appears](https://kotaku.com/hasbro-lawyers-stable-my-little-pony-fighting-is-magic-5982987) that Mane6 relented in response to a cease and desist letter, rather than be dragged through court. Since we are not privy to the letter from Hasbro, the best we can do is guess based on the degrees of freedom that exist under the law. The claim that this game was a \"parody\" is an affirmative defense that Mane6 would have to raise in response to a copyright infringement claim (we don't know if there were also trademark infringement claims in the letter). Then the jury would look at the arguments of the two sides to determine whether this was really \"fair use\", performing the \"balancing act\" to see how much of the original work was copied, how transformative the derived work is, what the effect on market would be. The lines drawn for making these judgments are not bright. A quick scan of a successor product Them's Fightin' Herds suggest that someone thought the artwork was too substantially similar to the Hasbro product, that is, the fighting pony version was judged to not be transformative enough.

While the game could potentially be seen as commentary on the peaceful nature of the original characters, the key issue appears to be that the artwork was too similar to Hasbro's original designs. For a work to qualify as parody under fair use, it needs to be sufficiently transformative. The fact that the developers later created a new game with original characters (Them's Fightin' Herds) suggests that the artwork in the original fan game was deemed too close to Hasbro's copyrighted material.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the game's premise of peaceful characters fighting could potentially be seen as commentary.\nOption C is incorrect because the genre of the game is not the determining factor for parody.\nOption D is incorrect because copyright disputes are not automatically won by the original copyright holder and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThis question tests understanding of fair use, parody, and the importance of transformative work in copyright law."

Her will, as she explained to me, explains how the estate will be divided among her 3 children (not the grandchildren, just 3 equal divisions). Granted, at the time, the Bush tax cuts were due to expire in 10 years so it wasn't guaranteed, but it was likely to avoid any inheritance tax.\n\nShe told me that as a result of being married to a partner, she had free legal care if she ever needed it.

U.S. agencies typically require more formal documentation or court orders for name changes. While the question mentioned that U.S. embassies might accept these for passport purposes, the provided information does not confirm this, and it's clear that domestic agencies like the DMV do not recognize them as valid on their own."

Under US law, this will be a form of ***fair use*** Under the laws of other countries, this **may** be permitted under one or another ***exception to copyright***. The available exceptions and how they work vary from country to country, but reasonable quotes should be allowed in almost every country.\n\nSee [Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use?

The same principles apply as with a reference quote: make what is quoted clear; attribute the source; and quote no more than is reasonable needed for your purpose.\n\nConsider whether you really need to quote \"long paragraphs\" or can just quote key sentences, perhaps along with paraphrases of the rest.\n\nIf at all possible, the parts you quote should be only a small proportion of the source work.",

It aligns with fair use principles and copyright exceptions by:\n1. Using quotes sparingly and only when necessary\n2. Paraphrasing content to avoid excessive direct copying\n3. Clearly attributing all sources\n4. Ensuring quoted material is a small proportion of both the new work and the original source\n\nThis approach balances the need to reference secondary sources with the legal and ethical requirements of copyright law. It allows the author to incorporate ideas and information from other sources while adding their own analysis and maintaining the originality of their work.\n\nOption A is problematic because it involves copying long paragraphs without proper quotation, even if visually differentiated. Option B goes against the principle of fair use by using extensive quotes that could potentially substitute for the original work. Option D lacks proper attribution and could be seen as plagiarism if the writing closely follows the original source without clear quotation."

Section Section 12182 (a) and Section 12182 (b) (1\\) (A) would also seem to apply.\n\nFiling an actual suit under the ADA would be a possibly costly and time consuming solution, however.

However, because unemancipated minors cannot buy or sell property on their own, managing their stocks can be a hassle. For example, children need a guardian if they want to sell the stock.\n\nTo avoid these hassles, in many (most?) cases, the stock is owned through some legal entity that gives an adult control over that stock. These range from custodial IRAs to living trusts. In all of these, the stock belongs to the minor, but is managed by an adult. These entities differ in all sorts of ways, including when (if ever) the minor gets control of the stock, how the stock is taxed, what the stock can be used for, and so on.\n\nOne of the most popular entities is a [UTMA Account](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utma.asp). These are named after the *Universal Transfer to Minors Act,* found at [Chap. 201A](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201a) of the *General Laws of Massachusetts*. These are custodial accounts designed specifically to allow minors to hold property, including stock. These accounts simplify the management of the minor\u2019s stock, and offer some tax breaks. In Massachusetts, the custodianship *[generally](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter201A/Section20)* terminates when the minor turns 21\\. At that point, she gets complete control of her stock.\n\nTo find out more about the advantages and disadvantages of the UTMA compared to other ways of holding property for children, see [here](https://www.thebalance.com/beginners-guide-to-ugma-and-utma-custodial-accounts-4060475), [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinefletcher/2019/12/12/why-utma-accounts-are-not-as-simple-as-they-seem/#74aeb79c7b34) and [here](https://southcoastestateplanning.com/when-can-my-child-get-the-money-in-the-utma-custodial-account-i-created-2/).",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) It is unlawful for minors to own shares in Massachusetts under any circumstances.\n\nB) The minor can freely buy, sell, and manage the shares without any restrictions.\n\nC) The minor can own shares, but they must be held in a UTMA account until the minor turns 18.\n\nD) The minor can own shares, but management typically requires an adult custodian or guardian until the minor reaches a certain age.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is D. In Massachusetts, it is lawful for minors to own shares of a company, but there are complications due to their legal status as minors. Minors cannot buy or sell property independently, which includes stocks. To manage this situation, shares are often held through legal entities like UTMA accounts, custodial IRAs, or living trusts, where an adult manages the stock on behalf of the minor.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it is indeed lawful for minors to own shares in Massachusetts.\n\nOption B is incorrect because minors cannot freely buy, sell, or manage shares without restrictions. They require adult involvement due to legal limitations on minors' ability to conduct financial transactions.\n\nOption C is partially correct but contains inaccuracies. While UTMA accounts are a popular method for minors to hold shares, the age of termination in Massachusetts is generally 21, not 18. Additionally, UTMA accounts are not the only way for minors to own shares.\n\nOption D is the most accurate statement, reflecting the reality that while minors can own shares, the management typically requires adult involvement through various legal structures until the minor reaches the age of majority or the specific age determined by the type of account used (e.g., 21 for UTMA accounts in Massachusetts)."

According to the information provided, remote notarization is only legal in Montana and Virginia. Virginia's laws are more permissive, allowing for a wider range of documents and situations to be notarized remotely. Montana's law is more restrictive, only allowing remote notarization for legal residents and for \"state internal\" matters.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because remote notarization is not legal in all 50 states, only in Montana and Virginia.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because Washington state law specifically requires the individual to \"appear personally before the notarial officer,\" which precludes remote notarization.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because Montana's law is actually more restrictive, only allowing remote notarization for legal residents and for in-state matters, not for out-of-state residents or international documents."

Also, it would likely be very painful for me to hold onto the person for the hour until help arrives.\n\nNow, in the eyes of a US court, am I a murderer? \n\nFurthermore, if the answer is that I would be considered a murder in the eye of the law, what if we change one detail of the premise: Rather than knowing I have a 99\\.9% chance of saving the person's life while avoiding any physical or mental damage, that number becomes 90%. Or 80%.

This principle holds true even if the potential rescuer could help without risk to themselves. The exception to this rule is when there is a special relationship or duty of care, such as parent-child, doctor-patient, or if the person created the dangerous situation. In this scenario, assuming no pre-existing duty, the person who chose not to help would not be legally liable for the death, regardless of how morally reprehensible their inaction might be.

The relationship between a data controller and data processor, including financial arrangements for GDPR-related tasks, is primarily governed by their contractual agreement, typically outlined in a Data Processing Agreement (DPA). While GDPR mandates that processors assist controllers in fulfilling data subject requests, it doesn't specify pricing for these services. The legality and appropriateness of fees charged by processors depend on the terms agreed upon in their contract with the controller. If the DPA states that the controller must pay for expenses related to data subject requests, the processor can charge fees, but the reasonableness of such fees could be subject to contractual dispute resolution mechanisms or legal challenge if deemed excessive. Options A and B are incorrect as GDPR doesn't explicitly prohibit or require such fees. Option D is incorrect because GDPR generally requires that data subject rights be exercised free of charge, with costs borne by the controller, not the data subject."

The Amendment, in clear words and in manifest intent, includes the children born, within the territory of the United States, of all other persons, of whatever race or color, domiciled within the United States.\n\n...\n\n> To hold that the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution excludes from citizenship the children, born in the United States, of citizens or subjects of other countries would be to deny citizenship to thousands of persons of English, Scotch, Irish, German, or other European parentage who have always been considered and treated as citizens of the United States.\n\nIn short the phrase \u201cand subject to the jurisdiction thereof\u201d excludes three and only three groups of people:\n\n* Children born to foreign diplomats here on diplomatic business, who have diplomatic immunity to US Law;\n* Children of members of an invading army that has occupied and controlled some part of US territory, born on that occupied area, who are obviously not subject to US Law (which has rarely happened in the US, although Guam was occupied during WWII, and parts of Alaska, and small parts of Maine during the War of 1812\\); and\n* Members of Native American tribes, subject to the jurisdiction of their tribal governments, who do not pay US taxes. (This was true when the 14th amendment was passed, but it no longer is. See section below on the act that changed it in 1924\\.)\n\nAny other person born in the proper US or in incorporated US territory is a citizen, no matter who his or her parents are or were. (The case is less clear for unincorporated US territory.)\n\nSee also [the Wikipedia article on the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Wong_Kim_Ark)\n\nThis view was confirmed in 1995 in [an opinion from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel](https://www.justice.gov/olc/file/626891/download#page=352) written by then\\-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, taking the position that this rule could not be changed by legislation, only by Constitutional Amendment, writing:\n\n> My office grapples with many difficult and close issues of constitutional law. The lawfulness of this bill is not among them. This legislation is unquestionably unconstitutional. The Fourteenth Amendment declares that \u201c\\[a]ll persons bom or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. XIV, \u00a7 1\\. The unmistakable purpose of this provision was to constitutionalize the\n> existing Anglo\\-American common law rule of jus soli or citizenship by place of birth and especially to extend it to persons of African descent and their descendants.\n\nIn [Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe) the Supreme Court of the United States struck down both a state statute denying funding for education to children in the United States illegally and a municipal school district's attempt to charge an annual $1,000 tuition fee for each student. The case upheld the same principle that the constitutional phrase \"within the jurisdiction\" applies to the children of people who had entered the US illegally.\n\nAccording to [the Wikipedia article on the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plyler_v._Doe):\n\n> Texas officials had argued that illegal aliens were not \"within the jurisdiction\" of the state and thus could not claim protections under the Fourteenth Amendment. The court majority rejected this claim, finding instead that \"no plausible distinction with respect to Fourteenth Amendment 'jurisdiction' can be drawn between resident immigrants whose entry into the United States was lawful, and resident immigrants whose entry was unlawful.\" The dissenting opinion also rejected this claim, agreeing with the Court that \"the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies to immigrants who, after their illegal entry into this country, are indeed physically 'within the jurisdiction' of a state.\"\n\nThus the question of whether such aliens were \"within the jurisdiction\" of the US was very much at issue in *Plyler v. Doe*\n\n**EDIT:**\nSince the [Indian Citizenship Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Citizenship_Act) was passed, all Native Americans born within the US have been citizens by birth, and the third class of exceptions noted in the earlier cases non longer exists. Prior to this act Native Americans were in many ways treated as foreigners by the US. They were not citizens by birth, and their tribes had some but not all of the attributes of independent nations.\n\nThe text of the law is:\n\n> Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That all non citizen Indians born within the territorial limits of the United States be, and they are hereby, declared to be citizens of the United States: Provided That the granting of such citizenship shall not in any manner impair or otherwise affect the right of any Indian to tribal or other property.\n\n(End edit on Indian Citizenship Act of 1924\\)\n\n**Edit**: On reading through the decision of the case of *Wong Kim Ark* I find one more small exclusion: persons born on board a foreign naval ship, even though present in US waters in time of peace, are not citizens of the US because of their birth location. This is apparently not a usual case, but is premised on the ground that a military vessel remains the territory of the nation it belongs to. Such persons might of course be citizens by inheritance if one or both parents are US citizens, and the statutory conditions are complied with. (The term \"public ship\" in the 1800s was used to mean a national ship, that is a military ship.)\n(End edit on naval ships)\n\nI just learned that some parts of the State of Maine were occupied by the British during the war of 1812\\. I do not know if anyone was born during that occupation whose citizenship might have been affected.",

However Bob refused to provide their physical address, despite multiple requests including links to the [government website](https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-insurance/if-youre-in-an-accident) detailing this requirement, apparently as a result of advice from their insurance company. After a month of exchanging out of court settlement offers with the insurance company Alice wants to initiate a [court claim for money](https://www.gov.uk/make-court-claim-for-money) for the cost of the vehicle. However this seems to require [\"a postal address in England or Wales\"](https://www.moneyclaims.service.gov.uk/eligibility/defendant-address).

Alice would like to avoid problems for Bob, as it appears they have been poorly advised by their insurance company as to their responsibilities. Mostly Alice cares about the easiest and cheapest solution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Use the vehicle registration number plate to request information about a vehicles registered keeper from DVLA.\n\nSince setting this in motion doesn't adversely affect anything else it's worth doing immediately. It might turn out to be unnecessary but given the glacial speed that DVLA operate at it's better to get the wheels in motion sooner rather than later.\n\n> Report the lack of provision of address to police\n\n[Section 170](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/52/section/170) of the *Road Traffic Act 1988* has this to say on the subject:\n\n> The driver of the mechanically propelled vehicle must stop and, if required to do so by any person having reasonable grounds for so requiring, give his name and address and also the name and address of the owner and the identification marks of the vehicle.\n\nSo assuming Bob was driving a vehicle involved in an accident with Alice's vehicle, thus Alice is someone \"having reasonable grounds\" for requiring Bob's name (and crucially in this case *address*). Failing that they **must** report the accident to the Police (either directly to a Constable, at a police station or via 101\\) and provide these details.

London \\-\\> Bangkok, Bangkok \\-\\> Tokyo, Osaka \\-\\> London (via Bangkok)\nOn the day of the Bangkok to Tokyo flight (Nov 17th), I had food poisoning, we got to the airport, but I was constantly throwing up and severely dehydrated, so we saw the airport doctor, they ruled me not fit to fly and sent me to the hospital in an ambulance, my partner stayed with me the entire time.\nWhilst at the airport doctor's, one of the nurses took our flight information and went up to inform Thai that we wouldn't be able to make the trip (this was about 4 hrs before the flight was due), unfortunately there wasn't anybody manning the check\\-in desk so they weren't able to notify them, however they said they would return later to let them know.\n\nI sent an e\\-mail to Thai the following morning (Nov 18th) when I was no longer incapacitated checking whether the remaining flights were still valid. \nThe morning after that (Nov 19th), I received a call from Thai at 9am at the hospital saying that unless we rebooked our tickets (with a new Bangkok to Tokyo flight) at a cost of \u00a31000 each (the original ticket cost us \\~\u00a3740 each) by 11am, all our remaining flights would be cancelled.\nWe believe the airport doctor notified Thai (in Thai's T\\&C it states if they are informed prior to the flight they won't cancel the remaining flights), though we don't have any physical evidence.\n\nWe could have booked a flight to Tokyo by ourselves for aprox \u00a3300 each on the day. \n\nWould there be any room for us to take Thai Airways to court to reclaim the \u00a32000 we had to pay?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\n*You* missed the flight.

The airline charges them a significant fee to rebook their remaining flights. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the couple's legal position?\n\nA) The couple has a strong case to sue the airline for the rebooking fee, as they notified the airline through the airport doctor.\n\nB) The airline is legally obligated to waive the rebooking fee due to the medical emergency.\n\nC) The couple has no legal recourse against the airline and is responsible for the rebooking fee.\n\nD) The airline must offer a partial refund of the rebooking fee if the couple can prove they were hospitalized.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the legal advice given, the couple has no legal recourse against the airline and is responsible for the rebooking fee. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. The passengers missed the flight due to their own circumstances (illness), not the airline's fault.\n2. The airline is not responsible for the passengers' acts and omissions.\n3. There's no clear evidence that the airline was properly notified before the flight.\n4. The rebooking fee, if charged according to the contract terms, is valid.\n5. This situation is precisely what travel insurance is designed to cover.\n6. The airline might waive the fee as a courtesy if asked, but they are not legally obligated to do so.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they assume the airline has a legal obligation to waive or refund the fee, which is not the case. Option D is also incorrect, as there's no legal requirement for the airline to offer a partial refund even with proof of hospitalization."

The next day she reports this to the police.\n\nThis question is not related to being poisoned with a date rape drug, or being forced to drink alcohol.\n\nEdit below to address comments.\n\nI think before 2016 in Germany a woman being too drunk to consent was not considered a crime. Whether this is correct, I wonder whether there are any countries where this is the scenario?\n\n**Bounty \\- I am looking for answers like the one mentioning Japan, just for other countries.**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Example where rape charges requires use of violent force:\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn Japan, for example, the legal definition of sexual rape is:\n\n> A person who, through assault or intimidation forcible commits sexual intercourse with a female of not less than thirteen years of age commits the crime of rape and shall be punished by imprisonment with work for a definite term of not less than 3 years. The same shall apply to a person who commits sexual intercourse with a female under thirteen years of age.\n\nTherefore, someone who has sexual intercourse with another person while they are intoxicated may not be considered rape if the act did not involve violent force.\n\nIt is important to note that this definition has some limitations. For example, it does not account for victims who are violated while incapacitated in a medical setting, and it also does not consider the possibility of male victims.\n\nExample where rape charges requires non\\-voluntary intoxication:\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere have also been attempts within the legal system to distinguish between people who were unknowingly drugged and those who voluntarily consumed a large amount of alcohol and became intoxicated.\n\n> The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a person can\u2019t be found guilty of sexually assaulting someone, who is mentally incapacitated due to intoxication, if that person became intoxicated by voluntarily ingesting drugs or alcohol.\n\nIn Minnesota, for example, there was a requirement for non\\-voluntary intoxication.\n\n[A Minnesota man can\u2019t be charged with felony rape because the woman chose to drink beforehand, court rules \\- March 26, 2021](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/03/26/minnesota-rape-alcohol/)\n\nHowever, the Minnesota legislator has recently amended their legal codex for this.\n\n[New Minnesota Law Is 'Significant Victory' For Survivors Of Sexual Assaults While Intoxicated \\- September 14, 2021](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/new-minnesota-law-is-significant-victory-for-survivors-of-sexual-assaults-while-intoxicated/)",

This definition potentially excludes cases where a victim is intoxicated but no physical violence occurred. \n\nGermany reformed its laws in 2016, so it no longer fits this criterion. The United States has varying laws by state, but generally recognizes intoxication as a factor in consent. Minnesota is not a country, and it recently changed its laws to include cases of voluntary intoxication in sexual assault charges. \n\nThis question tests the student's ability to distinguish between different legal approaches to consent and intoxication in sexual assault cases, as well as their attention to detail in reading comprehension and geographical knowledge."

[18 U.S. Code \u00a7 713](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/713) says:\n\n> (a) Whoever knowingly displays any printed or other likeness of the great\n>  seal of the United States, or of the seals of the President or the\n>  Vice President of the United States, or the seal of the United States\n>  Senate, or the seal of the United States House of Representatives, or\n>  the seal of the United States Congress, or any facsimile thereof, in,\n>  or in connection with, any advertisement, poster, circular, book,\n>  pamphlet, or other publication, public meeting, play, motion picture,\n>  telecast, or other production, or on any building, monument, or\n>  stationery, for the purpose of conveying, or in a manner reasonably\n>  calculated to convey, a false impression of sponsorship or approval by\n>  the Government of the United States or by any department, agency, or\n>  instrumentality thereof, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned\n>  not more than six months, or both.  \n> \n>  ...  \n> \n>  (e) Whoever, except as directed by the United States Congress, or the\n>  Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives,\n>  acting jointly on its behalf, knowingly uses, manufactures,\n>  reproduces, sells or purchases for resale, either separately or\n>  appended to any article manufactured or sold, any likeness of the seal\n>  of the United States Congress, or any substantial part thereof, except\n>  for manufacture or sale of the article for the official use of the\n>  Government of the United States, shall be fined under this title or\n>  imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\n\nI am not sure if someone could make a First Amendment argument, but it seems likely. I note that [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States) isn't afraid to have *pictures* of the Great Seal on the webpage about it. Also, a modified Great Seal was used in the film *National Treasure: Book of Secrets* (although it purported to be a presidential seal). I also found an [instance](https://web.archive.org/web/20051028070028/http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/10/26/odd.onion.reut/index.html) where the White House officially asked the Onion to stop using the Presidential seal, but it's unclear what happened with that. The Onion did not immediately remove the seal, however, and I think we would have heard if they had been arrested. I do not believe that Wikipedia, the filmmakers, and the Onion would have done this if there was a serious risk of six months in prison. In each of those cases, there was a strong First Amendment speech/press use, and there was no risk of anyone thinking the seal was being used for a government endorsement.\n\nThere is an executive order (visible from the \"Notes\" section of the link to the law) regarding the use of the seals of the President and Vice President:\n\n> Section 1\\. Except as otherwise provided by law, the knowing\n>  manufacture, reproduction, sale, or purchase for resale of the Seals\n>  or Coats of Arms of the President or the Vice President of the United\n>  States, or any likeness or substantial part thereof, shall be\n>  permitted only for the following uses:\n> \n> \n> (a) Use by the President or Vice President of the United States;\n> \n> \n> (b) Use in encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, journals, pamphlets,\n>  periodicals, or magazines incident to a description or history of\n>  seals, coats of arms, heraldry, or the Presidency or Vice Presidency;\n> \n> \n> (c) Use in libraries, museums, or educational facilities incident to\n>  descriptions or exhibits relating to seals, coats of arms, heraldry,\n>  or the Presidency or Vice Presidency;\n> \n> \n> (d) Use as an architectural embellishment in libraries, museums, or\n>  archives established to house the papers or effects of former\n>  Presidents or Vice Presidents;\n> \n> \n> (e) Use on a monument to a former President or Vice President;\n> \n> \n> (f) Use by way of photographic or electronic visual reproduction in\n>  pictures, moving pictures, or telecasts of bona fide news content;\n> \n> \n> (g) Such other uses for exceptional historical, educational, or\n>  newsworthy purposes as may be authorized in writing by the Counsel to\n>  the President.\n\nThis provides several legal ways to use the Presidential seals. However, the seal of the President is not the same as the Great Seal, so this technically does not apply if you want to use the Great Seal in particular.",

The key factors are:\n\n1. The use is non-commercial and for the purpose of political speech.\n2. It's unlikely to be mistaken for actual government endorsement.\n3. There are precedents of satirical and educational uses (e.g., The Onion, Wikipedia) that haven't faced legal consequences.\n4. The modification of the seal further distinguishes it from official use.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are some allowable uses, especially under First Amendment protections. Option C is not accurate because merely modifying the seal doesn't guarantee legality. Option D is incorrect because the guidelines mentioned are specifically for Presidential and Vice Presidential seals, not the Great Seal, and don't directly apply in this case."

As per the documentation, for private individuals, name inversions on contracts generally do not pose a significant legal problem as long as both parties acknowledge the true identity of the person involved.

Advise Tam.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Sania is entitled to a reward of 7,50\u20ac.\n---------------------------------------\n\n[germany](/questions/tagged/germany \"show questions tagged 'germany'\")\n\nIn Germany, to reward honest finders, the finder of an item is entitled to 5% of a lost item's value of up to 500\u20ac under [\u00a7 971 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__971.html). Airpods cost about 150\u00a0\u20ac, so Sania is entitled to a Fider's reward of 7,50 \u20ac. Anything more would be at the discretion of Tam, accepting less is at Sania's discretion.\n\nDo note, that denial of the finder's reward at the moment that Sania hands over the item means, that they also deny their entitlement to the reward. In fact, it is upon Sania to demand the reward, and unless they do so, it is presumed that they do not want a finder's reward.\n\n**However** in making her entitlement to the reward known, Sania may not cross the line into coercion or blackmail (\u00a7\u00a7 240, 253 StGB). Should Sania say, without explanation \"I demand a payment of 100\u00a0\u20ac for the airpods\", that could be coercion, as she is not entitled to that. If she however says \"I am entitled to finder's reward of 7,50\u00a0\u20ac, and had expenses of 2\\.50\u00a0\u20ac to get the phone to you, therefore you owe me 10\u00a0\u20ac\" the picture is different \\- that is *exactly* the amount that the law says she would be owed. This is because atop the actual reward Sania can reclaim reasonable fees, such as the bus fare to get the phone to Tam under [\u00a7 970 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__970.html). Under \u00a7 972 BGB, Sania does not have to relinquish the item till the reward and expenses have been paid but also does not become the owner of the item.\n\n#### The Fundb\u00fcro\n\nTo evade a possible claim for \"Unterschlagung von Fundsachen\" (\\~conversion by not reporting a found item), the Fundb\u00fcro (Found item's office) exists when the owner can't be made out rapidly. Not only does it calculate the required finder's reward, but also handing it over to the office fulfills the requirement to report a found item that is worth more than 10\u00a0\u20ac under [\u00a7 965 BGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bgb/__965.html). It is customary to store the lost items at the Fundb\u00fcro, but that is not required.\n\nTo gain the item from the Fundb\u00fcro, Tam will have to pay any required handling fees to the office but also gets notice of how much he should pay to Sania as well as her contact details. Sania will get contact details of Tam in return, together with a notice that she has a claim to a reward of such value. Should Sania not have given her details, it is presumed that she did not want the finder's reward.\n\nIf Sania retained the item, the Fundb\u00fcro will inform Tam of the estimated finder's reward and contact details for Sania, so Tam can reclaim the item.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, Sania found Tam's lost AirPods worth 150\u20ac on campus. She returned them without knowing about any reward. The next day, she saw Tam's advertisement offering a 50\u20ac reward. Which of the following statements is correct regarding Sania's entitlement to a reward under German law?\n\nA) Sania is entitled to the full 50\u20ac reward as advertised by Tam.\nB) Sania is entitled to a finder's reward of 7.50\u20ac (5% of the AirPods' value) plus any reasonable expenses she incurred.\nC) Sania is not entitled to any reward because she returned the AirPods before seeing the advertisement.\nD) Sania is entitled to 10% of the AirPods' value (15\u20ac) as a standard finder's fee.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to German law (\u00a7 971 BGB), finders are entitled to 5% of a lost item's value up to 500\u20ac. For AirPods worth 150\u20ac, this amounts to 7.50\u20ac. Additionally, \u00a7 970 BGB allows for reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in returning the item. Sania's right to this reward exists regardless of when she learned about Tam's advertisement. The advertised 50\u20ac reward is not legally binding, and the 10% fee in option D is incorrect. Sania retains her legal right to the finder's reward even if she initially returned the item without knowing about it, as long as she hasn't explicitly declined the reward."

According to the provided information, copyright protection requires originality. In the US, this means \"a modicum of creativity,\" while in Canada, it requires an \"exercise of skill and judgment\" that is not \"a purely mechanical exercise.\" The process of converting public domain images to text through OCR is essentially a mechanical process that does not involve creativity or original authorship. The resulting digital text files are faithful reproductions of the public domain content and do not meet the originality requirement for copyright protection. Therefore, the museum cannot claim copyright on these digital text files.\n\nOption A is incorrect because using OCR technology does not constitute an innovative change that would qualify for copyright protection. Option B is wrong because effort and resources alone do not grant copyright; originality is required. Option D is incorrect because there is no special 10-year copyright term for digitized public domain works; they remain in the public domain."

The IP address was logged during an unauthorized and potentially malicious action (attempting to reset another user's password). In this context, the harasser's expectation of privacy is diminished, especially when their actions constitute harassment. The platform's duty to protect its users from harassment likely outweighs any potential claim of privacy by the harasser.

Hypothetically, if I had a medical patent idea generated solely by me, would I need to take any precautions before discussing it with my wife to avoid giving her employer any claims to it? Or are there general protections because we're married?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a difference between \"idea\" and \"invention\". Only an invention is subject to being patented, thus becoming an enforceable property right. Disclosing ideas, without restrictions, can quickly mean you lose any control over resulting inventions. No, marriage does not automatically imply ownership of ideas of the spouse, let alone inventorship.\n\nHypothetically, under US law, each inventor must file an oath and declaration regarding inventorship of the invention disclosed and claimed in the application for a patent. Where an inventor has a legal obligation to the employer to cooperate in such things, but refuses, there are other ways to file a substitute.\n\nHowever, where the inventor is independent, the employer has no inherent ownership claim and the inventor has no obligation to sign anything. \n\nIf, on the other hand, the \"idea\" is prematurely disclosed to others, outside of fiduciary or other obligations of confidentiality, such others could proceed to make their own invention, using their own inventors, and file and claim the patent advantages of that invention without regard to where they obtained the initial idea.\n\nOne major goal of the patent system is to reward the disclosure of \"new and useful\" inventions to the public (in the form of a patent application), in exchange for a \"limited right\" of the inventors to reap the financial advantages, once the invention is deemed patentable. Under current laws, the \"first to file\" a claim to the invention is presumed to be \"the inventor\".\n\nA less wooly analysis might be had from experts in the Ask Patents area of this site.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential implications of this situation?\n\nA) John's idea is automatically protected by patent law as soon as he conceives it, so he can freely discuss it with Sarah without risk.\n\nB) As John and Sarah are married, their ideas are considered shared intellectual property, protecting the idea from claims by either of their employers.\n\nC) John should take precautions before discussing the idea with Sarah, as premature disclosure without confidentiality agreements could potentially allow others to file a patent based on the idea.\n\nD) Sarah's employer would automatically have a claim to the idea if John discusses it with her, regardless of the nature of Sarah's involvement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation emphasizes that merely having an idea does not constitute a patentable invention, and that disclosing ideas without restrictions can lead to loss of control over resulting inventions. Marriage does not provide automatic protections for intellectual property. Premature disclosure to others without confidentiality agreements could allow them to develop and patent their own invention based on the idea. Therefore, John should take precautions before discussing his idea with Sarah to protect his potential intellectual property rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because having an idea does not automatically grant patent protection. Option B is false because marriage does not imply shared ownership of ideas or inventions. Option D is overly broad and incorrect, as Sarah's employer would not automatically have a claim to John's idea merely through discussion with Sarah."

Does this change the issue?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is going to depend a good deal on there exact nature of the clips being reused. it will also depend, at least somewhat, on what country or countries the various parties are in.\n\n**General Principle**\n---------------------\n\nThe general principle is that a peerson's post on social media is protected by copyright, just as all original works are. It is a copyright infringement to copy and redistribute the, **unless** permission has been granted by the copyright holder (normally the author in the case of a social media post, as those are rarely sold) or an exception to copyright applies.\n\n**Permission**\n--------------\n\nThere are various ways in which permission might be granted. \n\nThe re\\-user might directly email (or otherwise reach out to) the original author and **ask**, and be granted permission.\n\nThe original author might have released some or all of his or her posts under a permissive license.\n\nSome social media might **require** that posts be released under a permissive license, or otherwise automatically grant such permissions. Remember that Wikipedia, for example, mandates that all posts and contributions be released under a CC\\-BY\\-SA license, although posters have the option to add an additional alternate license, or more than one. \n\n**Exceptions**\n--------------\n\nThe most obvious exception is Fair use, **if** the parties are (or at least the re\\-user is) in the US. People sometimes speak as if fair use is a world\\-wide legal rule. it is a very specifically US legal concept. Some other countries have a somewhat similar concept, known in English as \"Fair Dealing\". It is, i understand, rather moore limited than fair use. [This law.se question and its answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/) discusses fair use in some detail.\n\nMost of the posts being reused here have no market, and so their re\\-use cannot harm the market. That would weigh for fair use. If the re\\-user uses the whole post, or a substantial part of it, that would weigh against fair use. If the re\\-user inserts significant comment on each re\\-used post, that would be analytical if not transformational, and would weigh for fair use. If the re\\-use is monetized, that would weigh against fair use somewhat.\n\nIn short, we cn't tell in general if fair use would apply to any particular post being re\\-used. it might or it might not. Specifics will control, and ultimately it is a judgement call to eb made by a court, if the matter comes to that.\n\n**Enforcement**\n---------------\n\nUnless the copyright holder for a given post files an infringement suit, or files a take\\-down notice, or complains to the host site, there will be no enforcement and no consequences. If a complaint or a take\\-down is filed, the host could remove the content, cancel the re\\-user's account, or both. If the user has monetized the re\\-use, ad revenue can be redirected to the copyright owner. \n\nIf the copyright holder files an infringement suit, and wins, there will be an award of damages, which might be quite small, or rather large. But with no market for the original, and probably little or no income from the re\\-use, low damages are more likely than high. And the original copyright holder would have filing fees, legal expenses, and possibly other expenses in advance.\n\nThere are firms with which one can register one's copyrighted work, who search for it being improperly used and take action, in return for a small up\\-front fee and a share of any damages recovered. But posters of general opinion on social media seem unlikely to use such services.\n\n**Conclusion**\n--------------\n\nSuch a \u201cSocial Media Reacts\u201d\\-video is somewhat risky, from a copyright perspective, but the **likely** negative outcomes are not large. Asking permission whenever possible, and trying to stay within the fair\\-use principles (if they apply) will reduce those risks.",

This approach doesn't align with key fair use factors such as the amount of the copyrighted work used and the purpose of the use (e.g., criticism, commentary, or parody).\n\nOption A is more likely to be fair use due to the brief nature of the content used and the addition of extensive commentary. Option C shows an attempt to protect user privacy and focuses on discussing the content rather than merely reproducing it. Option D demonstrates a transformative use by creating a parody, which is often favored in fair use analyses.\n\nRemember that fair use is a complex legal concept determined on a case-by-case basis, and this question simplifies the nuances for exam purposes."

The correct answer is B because failing to provide adequate food and water would constitute neglect and could be grounds for legal intervention.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while regular grooming is often recommended, it is not a legal requirement and failing to do so does not typically constitute animal cruelty or neglect.\n\nOption C, while important for pet health, is not explicitly mentioned as a legal requirement in the given context.\n\nOption D, while partially true in that grooming habits alone are not grounds for prevention of pet ownership, is not the best answer because there are indeed some circumstances (such as those in option B) where past pet care practices could lead to legal intervention.\n\nThis question tests understanding of animal welfare laws, the distinction between legal requirements and best practices in pet care, and the limits of government intervention in pet ownership."

Protect its customers; and\n3. Protect the security of its business; and\n4. Protect its business interests.\n\nIt's unlikely that access of information to comply with the law is illegal.\n\nAt least one EU directive, [Directive 95/46/EC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=URISERV:l14012), sets limits on the collection and use of personal information. We're concerned with the first condition for lawful data processing, and the second principle of data quality.\n\n> Data processing is only lawful if\n> \n> \n> * the data subject has unambiguously given his consent; or\n> * processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party; or\n> * processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; or\n> * processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject; or\n> * processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller or in a third party; or\n> * processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interest pursued by the controller or by the third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests for fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection.\n> \n> \n> The principles of data quality, which must be implemented for all lawful data processing activities, are the following:\n> \n> \n> * personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully, and collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes. They must also be adequate, relevant and not excessive, accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date, must not be stored for longer than necessary and solely for the purposes for which they were collected;\n> * special categories of processing: it is forbidden to process personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade\\-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life. This provision comes with certain qualifications concerning, for example, cases where processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or for the purposes of preventive medicine and medical diagnosis.\n\nSo, let's say that someone has given their consent. It'd be at least a little questionable whether the inspection of private information could mean that they access *personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade\\-union membership, and the processing of data concerning health or sex life*.\n\nI'm a bit less clear on US laws, but you'd probably look for laws around Personal Identifying Information, as that's where a lot of focus has been.",

In which of the following scenarios would the company be MOST justified in paying only half the promised rate?\n\nA) The contractor produced a transcript that captured 90% of the content but used their own document instead of the company-provided Google document.\n\nB) The contractor completed the work in half the expected time, but the transcript contained several minor spelling errors.\n\nC) The contractor delivered a transcript that was accurate but formatted differently from the company's usual style guide.\n\nD) The contractor submitted a transcript that omitted significant portions of the audio content and contained numerous inaccuracies.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The key principle here is that independent contractors are paid for the outcome, not the process. Option D represents a clear failure to deliver the contracted outcome - an accurate and complete transcript. This significantly impacts the quality and usability of the work.\n\nOption A might be against company policy, but if the content is largely accurate, it may not justify halving the pay. Option B actually shows efficiency, and minor errors might not warrant a significant pay cut. Option C is about formatting, which, while important, doesn't necessarily impact the core content and accuracy of the transcript.\n\nOption D, however, represents a fundamental failure to deliver the contracted service - an accurate and complete transcript. This aligns with the principle that contractors are paid for performance and outcomes, not just time spent or effort.

In this scenario involving a mother recording bullies, it's unlikely that the defendant would have information about more serious criminal activities.\n\nOption A is a relevant factor, as court dockets and case backlogs often influence prosecution decisions. Option B is also important, as prosecutors consider the strength of evidence and likelihood of conviction. Option C is relevant because, in many jurisdictions, district attorneys are elected officials and may consider the political implications of their decisions.

This depends on the place and date of publication. In many countries copyright now lasts for 70 years after the death of the author. Some countries use different rules. In the US, a work published before 1978 is in most cases copyrighted for 95 years. Works published after that are protected for 70 years after the death of the author. More complex cases are detailed in [this well\\-known chart](https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain).\n\nWho holds the Copyright?\n========================\n\nFor most novels, copyright is initially held by the author(s). The author may sell or give away the copyright at any time. If the author does not transfer the copyright during life, it will pass with other property st the author's death. It may pass by will or by default (intestate) inheritance in the absence of a will. The author's surviving spouse children, if any, are often the heirs to any copyrights, but not always. Authors with many works still in print may have s \"literary estate\" set up to handle their copyrights.\n\nWorks with multiple co\\-authors usually have the copyright shared between all authors; in equal shares unless they agree otherwise. Any one copyright holder may license a derivative work such as a translation.\n\nA would\\-be translator of a work still under copyright must find the copyright holder(s) and obtain permission. If the holders cannot be found, no permission can be obtained, and any translation would be an infringement of copyright. The copyright holder could sue for damages after publication. Damages may be quite substantial in some cases. This varies by country and by the facts of the case.\n\nIn the US The [Federal Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/)  will search its records to try to determine who holds a copyright. They charge a fee for doing so, and success is not guaranteed. Other countries may have similar services.\n\n**Addition**:\nThere is no automatic or guaranteed way to find who now owns a copyright. In some cases the owner does not even know that s/he owns the copyright. If the holder died without heirs the copyright may belong to the government (state government in the US).\n\nResearch into the author's life may reveal probable heirs. An obituary may list the author's children, if any. Finding them and asking is a reasonable place to start.",

Copyright does not automatically expire upon the author's death or when a publishing house closes. In most countries, copyright lasts for a significant period after the author's death (often 70 years, but this varies). The copyright may have been inherited by the author's heirs or transferred to another entity. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the death of the author and the closure of the publishing house do not make the work public domain. \n\nOption B is wrong because while the Federal Copyright Office can help search for copyright information, they don't automatically grant translation permissions. \n\nOption D is incorrect because copyright duration varies by country and publication date, and is not always simply 70 years after the author's death.\n\nThe best course of action, as stated in C, is to research the author's life, look for potential heirs through sources like obituaries, and attempt to contact them for permission. This approach is most likely to lead to identifying the current copyright holder and obtaining the necessary permission for translation."

Obviously the faked banknotes might get me into trouble, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d owe the finder $10,000\\. That might be quite close to the question.\n\nI could argue that a finder of abandoned things gets exactly what they found, could be a broken bicycle (worth repairing or not), could be a crime novel with the last page ripped out, in this case a check over a million that is worth nothing because nobody will pay out for it.\n\nOr I might have written the check to pay a debt to Joe, Joes bank manager just laughed, so Joe threw the check away in a public place. For extra fun, imagine I win a million in the lottery and it gets put into my account\u2026\n\nI\u2019d recommend not doing that kind of thing to avoid trouble for everyone.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John writes a check for $1,000,000 to CASH, signs it, and leaves it in a public place. Jane finds the check and attempts to deposit it, but it bounces due to insufficient funds in John's account. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) John has committed fraud and can be criminally charged for writing a bad check.\nB) Jane can successfully sue John for $1,000,000 because he wrote and signed the check.\nC) John has not necessarily committed a crime, but could face potential legal consequences for his actions.\nD) Jane has no legal recourse against John and cannot sue him for the money.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. John's actions, while potentially reckless, do not necessarily constitute a crime. Writing a check for an amount greater than one's account balance is not inherently illegal, especially if there was no intent to defraud. However, John could face potential legal consequences depending on the specific circumstances and local laws regarding abandoned property and check writing.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because writing a check with insufficient funds is not automatically fraud; intent to defraud must be proven.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because Jane, as a finder of abandoned property, does not automatically gain the right to the face value of the check. The check's value is limited to John's actual account balance.\n\nAnswer D is too absolute. While Jane may have limited legal recourse, it's not accurate to say she has no recourse at all. The specific circumstances and local laws would determine her options."

I declined.\n\nShe ended up snatching all the mail she handed me which was primarily non certified (Only one piece was certified which meant it required a signature). She said she was destroying all the mail and we would never receive it or any future mail at that address. She explained she was making my life difficult like I was making hers by not signing for the one piece of certified mail to my dad. I asked what she was doing with all the mail she snatched back that didn't require a signature and she replied she was throwing it away. She then drove off.\n\nDid she do at least two crimes?: 1\\) steal property\n2\\) threaten to destroy property for the purpose of intimidation\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I cannot answer whether this particular person committed a crime or not. Only a court can answer that. I can give you general information about laws involving destruction of mail.\n\nUnder [18 USC 1703](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1703):\n\n> Whoever, being a Postal Service officer or employee, unlawfully secretes, destroys, detains, delays, or opens any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail entrusted to him or which shall come into his possession, and which was intended to be conveyed by mail, or carried or delivered by any carrier or other employee of the Postal Service, or forwarded through or delivered from any post office or station thereof established by authority of the Postmaster General or the Postal Service, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\n\nSo it would generally be a crime to deliberately destroy or delay mail that was otherwise deliverable.\n\nIf a carrier took back mail that should have been delivered, that would probably count as \"detaining\" or \"delaying\" that mail. In the case at hand, though, I suppose the carrier might argue that when you refused to sign for the letter, it gave her reason to doubt that the addressee(s) actually lived there, in which case perhaps the mail should not have been delivered after all. So she might say that she took it all back to the post office for further investigation as to where or whether it should be delivered.\n\nDestroying the mail would similarly be illegal. However, based on other information in your question that is now removed, it appears that she did not actually do so. Merely *threatening* to destroy mail, if the threat is not carried out, does not seem to be a crime under this section. I don't know whether it might be prohibited by some other statute.\n\nCrimes involving mail are normally investigated by the [US Postal Inspection Service](https://www.uspis.gov/), not by local police.\n\nOf course, even if the behavior is not a crime, it may still be cause for the postal employee to be fired or otherwise disciplined.",

The law explicitly states that \"delaying\" mail that was intended to be conveyed is a criminal offense for postal employees.\nD) While intimidation is unprofessional and potentially against postal service policies, it is not specifically mentioned as a criminal offense in 18 USC 1703.\n\nThe key here is understanding that the law focuses on actions that interfere with the actual delivery or integrity of the mail, rather than verbal interactions or threats. Delaying mail that should be delivered is a direct violation of the postal employee's duty and the law."

It supersedes the Sale of Goods Act 1979 in these cases, even for second-hand items. Option B involves a purchase from a registered business, making it the only scenario where the Consumer Rights Act 2015 would apply.\n\nOptions A and C involve consumer-to-consumer transactions, which are still governed by the Sale of Goods Act 1979.

This derivative author then gives you permission to copy their derivative. Independently, you have a legal right to copy the original song (an example would be you live in Canada where personal\\-use copying of music is generally [legal](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/469/3209)).\n\nIt then appears that you aren't infringing the derivative author's rights since you have their permission, nor are you infringing the original author's rights since there's an exemption within the law.\n\nIt seems weird to me that there might be a legal possibility for you to own an unauthorized derivative by performing what appears to be a completely legal copy action, so I'm wondering if I missed something here.\n\nIs the copying of the derivative work legal? Does the answer change depending on whether you have knowledge that the derivative is infringing? I'm most interested in answers covering Canada or the \nEuropean Union.\n\n**Edit:** I've since stumbled on [a journal article by William J. Braithwaite](https://digitalcommons.osgoode.yorku.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1990&context=ohlj) that basically discusses my question in pgs 213\\-220, minus the portion about copying the original being legal.

And even if you have the right to copy the original work, you don't have the right to copy the derived work because it is a different work. I could extract my changes, and allow you to take them and do with them what you like. You could then create an illegally derived work yourself. I couldn't sue you, but the original copyright holder could. \n\nTo the comments: One, a work and a derivative of the work are not the same, so even if you have the right to make a copy of a work, that doesn\u2019t give you any right whatsoever to copy a derivative work \\- they are not the same work. Two, the copyright holder has the exclusive right to control copying *and* the creation of derivative works.

Even though you have permission from the creator of the unauthorized music video and the right to copy the original song for personal use in Canada, you still cannot legally copy the music video. This is because:\n\n1. The music video is an unauthorized derivative work, and the original copyright holder has the exclusive right to control the creation and distribution of derivative works.\n\n2. The creator of the unauthorized music video does not have the legal right to grant permission for copying the entire work, as it incorporates copyrighted material they don't own.\n\n3. Your right to copy the original song for personal use does not extend to copying derivative works based on that song.\n\n4. The music video is a separate work from the original song, and your rights regarding the original song do not apply to this derivative work.\n\n5.

Contacting a county attorney is free and doesn't require you to get a lawyer, and it can be a surprisingly effective tactic against a criminal.\n\nA phone call or a detailed letter to the county attorney for the person's county of residence that explains the criminal activity may be the key to getting some movement in the situation. You have lots of hard evidence to hand the attorney about an individual who is committing fraud, and that evidence may make simply make the case for the attorney, as it is documented evidence they can immediately verify and use, either at the county level, or be passed to the district (state) prosecutor.\n\nA loss of $4000 is significant, and may be a felony in that state. But the *\"$6,000 in products that were not shipped\"* is intent on the criminals' part and is not a loss to you. \n\nIf it is a county with a large population, the attorney will have many assistants who may have time to pursue the case.

In the United States, a subpoena is generally used to obtain existing records or information. It cannot compel a company to create new records or change its business practices.

The CHRA does not contain a definitions section and specifically doesn't define the terms \"gender identity\" or \"gender expression\" introduced in bill C\\-16\\.\n\n---\n\nAs an aside, I did find a few instances in BC of courts and human rights tribunals enforcing use of pronouns preferred by the transgender person, but none in an employment context ([1](http://canlii.ca/t/hzvgj), [2](http://canlii.ca/t/hzdgk), [3](http://canlii.ca/t/ggzx4)).",

The passage states that the CHRA does not contain a definitions section and specifically doesn't define the terms \"gender identity\" or \"gender expression\" introduced in Bill C-16. However, it's suggested that interpretations from provincial human rights codes (like Ontario's) may influence how these concepts are applied at the federal level, even though they are not directly incorporated into the CHRA.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the passage does not indicate that the Ontario Code directly defines terms in the CHRA or C-16. Option B oversimplifies the relationship between federal and provincial laws. Option C overstates the impact of C-16, as the information provided does not support that it explicitly compels speech in all contexts, though it notes that misgendering could be considered discrimination in certain areas covered by the Code."

This is supported by several factors in the documentation:\n\n1. The person claims to \"know for a fact\" they have multiple cases that will \"pay out huge,\" which shows a lack of understanding about the uncertainty of legal outcomes.\n\n2. The description involves multiple unrelated issues (Walmart, a municipality, corruption, malicious prosecution, a landlord threat) without clear focus, suggesting a lack of a coherent legal case.\n\n3. The documentation explicitly states that one possibility is that \"All your cases actually lack merit, a lawyer sees this and you do not.\"\n\n4. The sheer number of attorneys (over 300) declining suggests a fundamental issue with the case itself rather than communication problems or being on a vexatious litigant list, which are less likely to uniformly deter so many attorneys.\n\nWhile communication issues (A) or being on a vexatious litigant list (D) are possible, they are less likely to be the primary reason given the context.

What laws mention or describe this situation (in any state)? If it *is* required, how are you to know if the police car is legitimate?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In most states you are required to pull over to the side of the road and come to a stop for *any* vehicle displaying flashing red and/or blue lights, whether oncoming or overtaking. If you don't you are guilty of a moving violation.[1](http://www.fearlesstiger.com/safetyTips/policeStoppingUnmarked.htm)\n\nIf the vehicle with the lights then pulls in behind you the same law forbids you from moving your vehicle. So that's the law for being pulled over by an unmarked car.\n\nIf you are concerned that you were stopped in this manner by someone not authorized to do so (police impersonators have been known to do this) you should call 911 and get the dispatcher to confirm whether the apparent emergency vehicle is legitimate. In general, if you fear for your safety, you can stay in your car and ask to be escorted to a known police station before exposing yourself. E.g., [here's the advice of one Ohio State Highway Patrolman](http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/oh-cuyahoga/police-offer-tips-on-what-to-do-if-you-are-pulled-over-by-an-unmarked-car):\n\n> If the area where you stop looks desolate, Miller said you don't have\n>  to stop there.

While you are generally required by law to pull over for any vehicle displaying flashing red and/or blue lights, you should prioritize your safety if you have concerns about the legitimacy of an unmarked vehicle. Slowing down and activating your hazard lights signals to the officer that you're aware of their presence and intend to comply, while proceeding to a well-lit or public area ensures your safety. This approach aligns with the advice given by law enforcement officials for such situations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because immediately pulling over in a potentially unsafe location and exiting your vehicle could put you at risk if the person is not a legitimate officer.\n\nOption B is incorrect because ignoring emergency lights is typically a violation of traffic laws, regardless of whether the vehicle is marked or unmarked.\n\nOption D is not only illegal but extremely dangerous and could result in severe legal consequences even if the vehicle was not a legitimate police car."
