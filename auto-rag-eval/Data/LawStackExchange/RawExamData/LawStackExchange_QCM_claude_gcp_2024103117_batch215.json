Not only that, they were also blackmailed into doing certain incriminating actions, such as e.g. transporting the corpse to a place, leaving it there, and being seen on CCTV footage leaving the area.\n\nNow, after the convict has been convicted, if the video of the blackmail, along with the blackmail material, is published, can this ever be good enough to exonerate the convict, given that the convict also retracts their confession after the release?\n\nIf such a release would be sufficient (which I assume it would be in certain cases), my question is then the following:\n\n*When would it be sufficient? How weak would the evidence that the convict committed the crime have to be for this release to be sufficient on its own?*\n\nIn certain cases, I guess the evidence could be strong enough that the release of the proof of blackmail wouldn't be good enough. Perhaps this is only true in cases where the evidence was sufficiently good that all confessions were superfluous to the proof of guilt?\n\nFurthermore, a question of what even constitutes as \"proof of blackmail\" arises. I am simply imagining a video of the blackmailer telling the convict that they have to do \"X\" in order for \"Y\" not to be released. And then this video is released in conjunction with Y. Furthermore, if Y is undeniable proof that the convict did something of a nature far more grave and criminal than the crime they confessed to, this makes it very unlikely that the whole ordeal is a tactic to exonerate the convict, given that it would only put the convict in more legal and social trouble than their original conviction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under U.S. law, this would not alone be sufficient, although sometimes with additional facts it could be.\n\nIn addition to showing that the confession was obtained through blackmail, the convicted defendant would also have to show that:\n\n* The evidence that the confession was obtained through blackmail to take action serious enough and with threats that were credible enough, that no other choice was available to the defendant and that duress would bar the charges, is sufficiently credible;\n* the confession would have changed the outcome of the case on guilt/innocence if the case had been fully tried (which can be particularly tricky if the defendant was guilty of something even if not the crime of conviction);\n* the blackmail was such that it deprived the convicted defendant of an opportunity to raise this issue in the court process and preserved as a legal issue (if the issue could have been raised in the original case, but was not raised, this is not a basis for setting aside the conviction, and proving this is likely to be the hardest issue in the case);\n* the time limits for bringing challenges to the conviction not based upon government misconduct or misconduct by his own lawyer have not expired;\n* it is possible to remedy the wrongful conviction now in a meaningful way (usually this is the case due to the collateral effects of a conviction even if the sentence has been served, but not always).\n\nI am deliberately omitting the exact legal standard of proof and duration of time for each of these points which is a highly technical area of the law.\n\nThe proceedings to set aside a wrongful conviction can also take a very long time. Five to twenty years after the conviction isn't uncommon. And, there is a fair amount of potential legal uncertainty, because most wrongful conviction cases involved alleged wrongdoing by the prosecution or alleged ineffective assistance of counsel by the defendant's lawyer. There is less case law and hence more room for novel legal issues with uncertain resolutions, when neither side's lawyer has done anything wrong.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A convicted defendant discovers evidence that their confession was obtained through blackmail after their conviction.

But I do wonder if this is legal.\n\nWhen I got home, I looked it up. According to this [digital media law site](http://www.dmlp.org/legal-guide/recording-phone-calls-and-conversations), it is not illegal to record a conversation if you are one of the parties:\n\n> Federal law permits recording telephone calls and in\\-person conversations with the consent of at least one of the parties.

An audio recording is a valuable resource for the patient if they want to review instructions or explanations they might have missed.  \n\n\\- It empowers a patient to a small extent, evening out the huge imbalance of power between physician and patient. Anything I can do to increase confidence in me in particular, and in the medical profession in general, is a plus.  \n\n\\- The patient has as much a right to an audio copy of our interaction as a paper copy of the chart.  \n\n\\- I have nothing to hide if I'm doing my best and meeting (hopefully exceeding) the standard of care.  \n\n\\- It protects me as well if a claim is made (I imagine alteration of audio recordings can be detected if necessary.\n\nMy previous malpractice carrier encouraged transparency in all things, and had no problems with this.

In Pennsylvania, it *is* illegal to record a conversation if you are a party and if the other party does not consent.\n\nThe fact that federal law doesn't ban something doesn't mean that states can't ban it. There is generally a presumption that when both the feds and the states can legitimately regulate something, the feds weren't trying to preempt all state laws on the topic. While people often say \"federal law takes precedence over state law,\" the normal rule is that *both* laws apply; the federal law only blocks the state law if the feds *wanted* to block said state laws. So far as I can tell, the federal law has never been held to preempt two\\-party consent laws; the point of the federal law was to *restrict* recording, not extend it.\n\nIt's like how federal law doesn't prohibit taking hostages inside the US to coerce a private company into doing what you want (anti\\-terrorism laws might, I guess, but the federal hostage\\-taking law doesn't); while the federal law excludes most hostage\\-taking in the US, that doesn't mean that it's legal to take hostages.

Bob has submitted a number of subject access requests to various data controlling bodies, including businesses and several police forces.\n\nSome police forces simply require scan of id with photo, name, dob, while others need two forms including proof of address. However it is not clear from their requirements whether both must indicate all the required informations or if they simply must both between them indicate all of them.\n\nAre there rules on what requirements may be deemed unlawfully or excessively onerous as preconditions for complying with a SAR?\n\nAnd why would they require this when other perfectly analogous police forces are happy with one basic photo ID?\n\nBoth aspects: why do they need your address (and what if you are a vagabond/nomad with NFA?), And why is one id not good enough?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Verifying the identity of the person making an SAR is a requirement (for fairly obvious reasons) but there's no specified way this is to be done. As the ICO puts it:\n\n> If you\u2019re not sure the requester is who they say they are, you must check this quickly. You shouldn\u2019t ask for formal ID unless it\u2019s necessary and proportionate. Instead, you could ask questions that only they would know, about reference numbers or appointment details for example. Or you can ask for ID that you can actually verify. There\u2019s little point insisting on photo ID if you don\u2019t know what the requester looks like \u2013 it should be proportionate.\n\nThe key word to take account of here is \"proportionate\" \\- and this is going to hinge on not just the data the SAR is asking for but the type of data that the Data Controller/Processor is handling.\n\nA police force is likely to be storing far more sensitive data about the data subject than e.g. a retailer and you'd expect a more robust identification process.\n\nThe fact that the law doesn't specify ID requirements is what will lead to different organisations having different requirements \\- they've ultimately had a large amount of leeway in determining what is appropriate themselves, and that leads naturally to variation.\n\nIn general terms (rather than specifically for SARs) requiring two forms of ID is not uncommon, it does after all increase the security of the process. Pick\\-pocketing someone's wallet will often get you their driver's license but it will rarely get their wallet *and* their recent utility bill. Successfully intercepting a utility bill won't get you their driver's license. It's not perfect but it raises the difficulty of circumventing the check.\n\n> Are there rules on what requirements may be deemed unlawfully or excessively onerous as preconditions for complying with a SAR?\n\nIf Bob feels the ID requirements are too extreme they can complain to the ICO and if they agree they can \"advise\" the data controller to ease up on the requirements and if this fails to reach a satisfactory outcome Bob ca take legal action \\- but I doubt the examples given would raise any concern. Even the two\\-forms level is only on a par with the requirements many agencies have for renting a car.\n\n> why do they need your address (and what if you are a vagabond/nomad with NFA?)\n\nIn addition to the ID\\-aspects having your address may be necessary in terms of communicating with you regarding the SAR. If you're someone of no fixed address this requirement may provide difficulties of course \\- but SARs are by no means unique in this regard.

The key word highlighted in the documentation is \"proportionate,\" which means the level of identification required should be appropriate to the type and sensitivity of data being requested. \n\nOption A is incorrect because requiring two forms of photo ID in all cases may be excessive and not always necessary. Option B is also incorrect as it suggests using the most stringent methods possible, which may not be proportionate in all cases. Option D is incorrect because verifying identity is actually a requirement, though it should be done in a balanced way. \n\nThe correct answer, C, reflects the ICO's guidance that identification methods should be tailored to the specific circumstances, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data and the nature of the request.

A little later I got an automated email with a picture of the building entrance, and detailed instructions about check\\-in procedure.\n\nI arrived in Oslo late on December 2nd, went to the address of the apartment and verified that the entrance was the same as in the picture I had previously received in the check\\-in instructions.\n\nAccording to the instructions, there was a key\\-box near the entrance. I found this, but the code that was supplied did not work. At the time it was minus 15\u00b0C outside, so I thought maybe the key\\-box was frozen.\n\nI was unsure what to do at this point, but I ended up ringing the doorbell to the apartment that I was supposed to stay in. After a while, a person came out. He informed me that these apartments were no longer rented out, and that he had been living there for the last half year. He let me inside the entrance, so that I could stay inside while calling the support number in the booking confirmation.\n\nI called the support number and reached a person on the other end, this was apparently at a support center. In the beginning he did not know what I was talking about, but after explaining for a while, he did recall that they had previously been handling support for this address. He informed me that whomever was renting out the apartments were no longer in business, and he could not help me find any place to stay.\n\nSince I had nowhere to stay, and it was minus 15\u00b0C outside I simply had find somewhere else.

He informs me that, before a refund is given, they have to figure out what happened. I ask him if he can see that my booking was confirmed and that they received payment, to which he confirms. I ask him when I can expect a refund. His reply is pretty vague, but I understand it will be a few days at least.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding John's health insurance options under COBRA?\n\nA) John can choose any of the health insurance plans his former employer offers under COBRA coverage.\nB) John can only continue Plan A under COBRA, but at the same premium rate he paid while employed.\nC) John can only continue Plan A under COBRA, typically at a higher premium rate, for up to 36 months.\nD) John automatically loses all health insurance coverage and cannot access COBRA because he was laid off.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: When an employee is laid off, they are typically eligible for COBRA continuation coverage. However, COBRA allows the former employee to continue the same health insurance plan they had at the time of the qualifying event (in this case, the layoff). They cannot switch to a different plan offered by the employer. The premium for COBRA coverage is usually higher than what the employee paid while employed, often up to 102% of the employer's current rate. COBRA coverage is also time-limited, generally up to 18 months, but can be extended to 36 months in certain circumstances.

For example, POTUS can pardon people (including himself) on federal crimes. But can not pardon people for state crimes.\n\nNow imagine a scenario where a POTUS, while sitting in office, is indicted by a particular state Attorney General for a crime, say murder, under state statutes. In that scenario, can POTUS be tried, convicted and jailed for those crimes without being impeached?\n\nAs a practical matter, could it actually happen? How would it actually play out given the supremacy clause and other practical considerations of jailing the chief federal executive?\n\nEdit\n\nI do not think this question is a duplicate of [Can a sitting president of the United States be indicted by one of the states?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/31188/794).

The officer, observing that he had stopped the President of the United States, initially let him go with nothing but a verbal warning. \n\nLater the same day, the same officer stopped Grant again speeding in the same place. The officer then informed Grant that he would have to be taken in, to which Grant gave a reply encouraging the officer to do his duty. \n\nGrant was then taken to the police station where he was charged with speeding, and held until he paid a $20 fine, at which point he was released.\n\nIn summary, POTUS was:\n\n1.

I think that today, this is unlikely, since Secret Service would (legal or not) shield the President from arrests (national security reasons).

However, practically speaking, the Secret Service would likely try to prevent an arrest (option C), but this is not a legal solution. Option A is incorrect because there is no blanket constitutional immunity for state crimes. Option B is unlikely because a sitting president cannot effectively govern while imprisoned or on trial. \n\nOption D is the most likely scenario because it provides a constitutional mechanism to address the situation.

The are some closely related questions: What defines a team? What happens if the team grows?

More specifically, under [17 USC 401 (b)(3\\)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap4.html) the third element should be:\n\n> (3\\) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner\n\nAs a \"team\" is not generally a legal entity (unless it is incorporated) it cannot be the actual owner of the copyright. The owner in such cases will usually be the company for which the members of the team work, or possibly the individual members of the team as co\\-owners. Or some other entity may hold the copyright. The name of the team may serve as \"a generally known alternative designation of the owner\".\n\nMoreover, even if the name shown is simply wrong, 17 USC 406 (Copyright notice: error in name or date) provides in pertinent part:\n\n> ... where the person named in the copyright notice on copies or phonorecords publicly distributed by authority of the copyright owner is not the owner of copyright, the validity and ownership of the copyright are **not affected**. In such a case, however, any person who innocently begins an undertaking that infringes the copyright has a complete defense to any action for such infringement if such person proves that he or she was misled by the notice and began the undertaking in good faith under a purported transfer or license from the person named therein \\[unless copyright office records would have disclosed the true owner].\n\nSo, such a notice opens up the possibility of someone purporting to grant licenses in the name of the \"team\". But unless this is a concern, the exact name used in the notice does not really matter. And if it is a concern, copyright registration, or recording the copyright with the US copyright office, will deal with the issue.\n\nNote that a copyright notice is optional for any unpublished work and for any work first published since 1989\\. (The effective date of the change in US copyright law to comply with the Berne Convention.) However the presence of a valid notice does offer some legal advantages to the copyright owner under US law.\n\nThe use of a VCS does not in any way affect the copyright status of a work, nor does it change the effect of a copyright notice or its absence. It might be evidence of the date of creation of a work, if that was challenged in an infringement suit, but that is not commonly an issue in such a suit.\n\nCopyright registration affords additional legal rights to the owner(s), and must indicate the actual name(s) of the copyright owner(s). Agreements to transfer copyright must be in writing, and signed (but could be electronic).\n\nIf the copyright is actually co\\-owned by the members of a team, it would be very wise of them to have a contract spelling out who does and who does not own a share of the copyright. Otherwise if they later disagree, and the matter comes to court, evidence of who actually was a co\\-author would be needed, and might be troublesome to produce. VCS records might be useful in such a case. If the copyright is in fact owned by a company, either on a work\\-made\\-for\\-hire basis or on an assignment basis, a contract between the company and all co\\-creators will be essential, or at least highly desirable, spelling this out in detail. But none of this affects any third party this is all important only between team members and any company involved.\n\nNote that this answer is enti8rely concerned with US law.

The law recognizes that such alternative designations can be valid.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law allows for abbreviations or alternative designations of the owner. Option B is false because using a team name does not invalidate the copyright; in fact, it can be a valid form of notice. Option D is incorrect because while a VCS might provide evidence of creation dates, it does not eliminate the need for a copyright notice nor does it automatically establish ownership in a legal sense."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15840/would-an-automatic-download-for-lgpl-libraries-be-permittable-under-lgplv3", "docs_id": 15840, "title": "Would an automatic download for LGPL libraries be permittable under LGPLv3?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: *Disclaimer*: I am not a native English speaker NOR am I versed in the law beyond the basics you learn in highschool\\-/uni\\-courses.\n\n---\n\nI am writing a software which uses LGPL licensed libraries.

One side would argue that the other party owes them money; the other side would dispute the claim. In general, a person does it have the right to damage another person's property, so if B damaged your property, you *might* have a valid claim. The advantage of small claims court is that it's quicker and cheaper. However, one may need to hire an attorney anyhow, in order to correctly present your claim that B should be made to pay.\n\nIf you can prove that B maliciously kicked your backpack in order to cause you damage, the matter will probably be resolved easily in your favor. More likely, this was an accident (that was what you thought), so now the question is whether this was negligence on their part, or on your part. B's negligence could have been in not using ordinary care when walking, your negligence would be in putting the backpack in the walkway. The judge would listen to your explanation of the surrounding facts, and then lay blame. In Wisconsin, the judge would compare the contribution of the two parties and come up with a percentage. In this situation, B would not have a basis for counter\\-suing you, which simplifies the matter a bit. If you more than 50% responsible for the damage, you cannot recover from B. If you are found to be e.g. 49% responsible and the defendant is 51%, then he is liable for 51% of the damage that you have suffered.\n\nIf you consult with an attorney, they can give you a good estimate of the likelihood that you'll lose on the grounds that your negligence was greater than B's.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a small claims court case in Wisconsin involving damage to personal property, what factor would most significantly impact the plaintiff's ability to recover damages?\n\nA) The plaintiff's ability to prove malicious intent by the defendant\nB) The comparative negligence of both parties as determined by the judge\nC) The total cost of the damaged property\nD) Whether the plaintiff hired an attorney to present the case\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: In Wisconsin, the outcome of a small claims court case involving property damage is significantly influenced by the concept of comparative negligence.

What can I do about checking whether it is a valid fine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are several plausible possibilities.\n\n1. This is a scam and isn't actually from the public transit authorities, in which case paying them hasn't helped you, and has contributed to this being a problem in the future for others. The payment information may have some subtle differences from the correct information and may actually go to the fraudster. The EBE number discrepancy makes this the most likely scenario in my opinion.\n2. There was a technical error. Maybe someone with a name similar to your was really cited, but due to a typo, your name was entered instead and the street address and corrected name were entered via some sort of autocorrect function. Somebody got lucky and avoided the ticket that should have gone to them. Maybe somebody went into the wrong field in the ticket entry system which could also explain the EBE number error.\n3. Someone has stolen your identity (perhaps a refugee) and is going around with a fake ID using your name and address. This doesn't explain the EBE number discrepancy, however.\n4. I've also heard of cases in some big cities where two people have the same name and birthdate and are constantly getting tickets meant for the other person but don't discover this fact for many years. Maybe someone like that recently moved into your town. This also doesn't explain the EBE number error.\n\nThe bottom line is that even though it would perhaps be cheaper and less time consuming in the short run to just pay the fine, I would not recommend doing that in this case.\n\nIn scenario 1, you really have a moral civic duty to take a little extra effort to identify a fraudster who is preying on lots of people in your community.\n\nIn scenario 2, you again, have something of a moral civic duty to help the transit system get this problem fixed, and who knows, it might be a technical problem that is prone to recur and if you don't address it the first time, people will assume that your \"confession\" of fault by paying the first ticket undermines your credibility if it happens again.\n\nIn scenarios 3 and 4, the problem is likely to recur and so you have an interest beyond this transaction in sorting out the situation.\n\nWhile your bare assertions that this didn't happen might fall on somewhat deaf ears as potentially self\\-serving, when corroborated by the fact that you have a monthly pass, I think that the likelihood that you would be found to be credible and beat the ticket is great in your case. Germany is less corrupt in bureaucratic matters like this than most countries on Earth. If this is a scenario 1 situation, the legitimate transit agency wouldn't even have a record of the existence of a ticket in the system, so you could be reassured that you would be at no risk if you didn't pay it.\n\nGiven the EBE number problem, it is quite possible that even if you did try to pay it and it was simply a human data entry problem or something (or maybe your ex or a high school bully you defied and forgot about is now a transit cop and trying to inflict revenge) that you might not get proper credit for it anyway, so talking to a person at the agency is probably necessary anyway.\n\nSo, my advice would be to talk to a human being in their office, ideally by telephone (without using the ticket to determine the proper telephone number as the number on the ticket would be a scam in scenario 1\\), but in person, if necessary, to get to the bottom of this. If this didn't work, I would write a letter or email with a copy of the ticket enclosed. If this falls on deaf ears, I would even consider making a police report of a suspected fraud, or even enlisting a local newspaper reporter or television news reporter in pursuing this situation because it is odd and would resonate with the general public.\n\nAll of this will be a pain and won't necessary make narrow economic sense, but we don't always have a choice about when duty calls to fix a problem or what problem that will end up being.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A person receives a fine for not showing a valid ticket on public transport, but they are certain they didn't commit the offense.

Therefore, the government can levy the tax on income, but various forms and other revealing info should not be allowed.\n\nIs this true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Since you asked, and it's a perfectly legitimate question, here's *why* it doesn't violate the Fifth Amendment (from *Garner v. US*):\n\nThe Fifth Amendment doesn't say \"you can't be made to say anything that hurts you.\" It says \"no person...shall be compelled in any *criminal case* to be a witness against himself.\" The *only* time Fifth Amendment protection applies is if you are being forced by the government to make a statement that could open you up to an accusation or conviction of a criminal offense. It's fairly broad (if it would help prove any aspect of the charge, you can claim immunity), but it's also restricted (you can't claim it unless it really *would* tend to incriminate you).\n\nThat means that you could only argue the Fifth Amendment if your tax return might help prove a criminal case against you (the fact that disclosing income leads to you needing to pay tax does not qualify as \"self\\-incrimination\"). But the *amount* of income is not one of those things that might incriminate you \\-\\- you can get income through all sorts of ways. The thing that is incriminating is revealing the *source* of the income, and you can claim Fifth Amendment privilege for that.\n\nSo:\n\n* The only time you could possibly claim privilege is if you were being forced into a statement that might tend to incriminate you in a criminal proceeding. A statement that makes you liable for tax doesn't mean it might incriminate you.\n* Filing an income tax return isn't inherently incriminating. The fact that you have income not included in any other part of the return (illegal income goes under \"other income\") doesn't imply you've committed a crime \\-\\- lots of people have other income.\n* The *amount* of income can't be incriminating. The *source* can be, but you can claim Fifth Amendment privilege for that if it might incriminate you. And lawful income under \"other income\" still might give rise to a reasonable fear of prosecution, so the fact that you're justified in claiming Fifth Amendment privilege in source of income doesn't mean you're guilty of a crime.\n\nNote that there are cases where you *are* flat\\-out exempt from filing tax returns under the Fifth Amendment: *Marchetti v. US* and *Grosso v. US* found that registration and tax on gambling *could* be blocked by a Fifth Amendment claim, which didn't even have to be asserted at time of filing, because merely filing the special return would establish you as a gambler (heavily regulated/often criminalized at the state level). The difference with the normal income tax form is that *everyone* (just about) files one, and so filing it doesn't mean you're a criminal. If there was a separate line along the lines of \"Income from Illegal Drug Sales,\" that might be one thing (anything other than $0 is inherently incriminating).

An SRO is to advance the program objective which include \"Education of children regarding the role of laws, courts, and Police in society\", which is the hook into \"legitimate educational interest\". This nothwitstanding the part that says that they \"are police officers and not school teachers, school administrators, nor school counselors. The officers will assist teachers with classroom presentations on relative topics when requested and able\" (there is no principle that only teachers, administrators, or counselors can have a legitimate educational interest). This model memo does not say anything that indicates that the conditions \"Is under the direct control\" and \"Is subject to the requirements of \u00a799\\.33(a)\" are true, but those conditions could be satisfied external to the MOU.\n\nThere are some additional exceptions of the \"if required by law\" type, such as a state law \"adopted before November 19, 1974, if the allowed reporting or disclosure concerns the juvenile justice system and the system's ability to effectively serve the student whose records are released\"; or, after that date, is \"subject to the requirements of \u00a799\\.38\" which refers you to \u00a799\\.31(a)(5\\)(i)(B). If that is confusing, here are the two self\\-referring sections:\n\n\u00a799\\.38(a) If reporting or disclosure allowed by State statute concerns the juvenile justice system and the system's ability to effectively serve, prior to adjudication, the student whose records are released, an educational agency or institution may disclose education records under \u00a799\\.31(a)(5\\)(i)(B). \n\n\u00a799\\.31(a)(5\\)(i)(B).

[Massachussetts law](http://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr23.html?section=all) does include governmental third party disclosures: 603 CMR 23\\.07(4\\)(c)\n\n> A school may release information regarding a student upon receipt of a\n>  request from the Department of Social Services, a probation officer, a\n>  justice of any court, or the Department of Youth Services under the\n>  provisions of M.G.L. c. 119, sections 51B, 57, 69 and 69A\n>  respectively.\n\nThat does not directly apply to local police, but it is possible that a police officer is operating as a probation officer or an agent of the Department of Youth Services.

So it sits there unoccupied after all these years. \n\nBack around 2007 during the housing bubble, my mom used her house as collateral and purchased 2 other houses. When she passed a way, the debt from those houses created 2 liens. Shortly after they foreclosed and sold, therefore (from what our lawyer tells us) the liens should\u2019ve been removed.

This approach is recommended because:\n\n1. Title companies have a vested interest in resolving lien issues as they provide title insurance.\n2. Closing companies are motivated to clear liens to earn their closing fees.\n3. This method is likely to be more cost-effective than paying lawyers by the hour with no guaranteed results.\n4. Real estate agents can facilitate this process, especially if there's a potential buyer involved.\n\nAdditionally, the answer mentions that having a purchase and sale contract in hand can further motivate these companies to resolve the lien issues.

[The judge agreed with the prosecutors and revoked his bail](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-15/michael-avenatti-arrested-new-fraud-allegations):\n\n> At the end of the court hearing, Judge Selna said he agreed with prosecutors that Avenatti\u2019s handling of the $1 million was probably illegal.

Here we have an example in which a person's freedom awaiting trial was curtailed based only on an accusation of illegal behavior, not based on a legal conviction for committing a crime.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The concept of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is inherent in our constitutional protections for due process.\n\nAs far as I know, the Supreme Court first formally recognized it as a rule in [*Coffin v. United States*, 156 U.S. 432, 458\\-59 (1895\\)](https://casetext.com/case/coffin-v-united-states-2):\n\n> Now the presumption of innocence is a conclusion drawn by the law in favor of the citizen, by virtue whereof, when brought to trial upon a criminal charge, he must be acquitted, unless he is proven to be guilty. In other words, this presumption is an instrument of proof created by the law in favor of one accused, whereby his innocence is established until sufficient evidence is introduced to overcome the proof which the law has created.\n\nThe key phrase \\-\\- for purposes of your question \\-\\- is \"sufficient evidence.\" At a criminal trial, sufficient evidence consists of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on \u201call the essential elements of guilt\u201d [*In re Winship*, 397 U.S. 358, 361 (1970\\)](https://casetext.com/case/in-the-matter-of-samuel-winship-appellant).\n\nBut if the government wants to lock up a defendant pending trial, the question is not whether the defendant is guilty of the charged crime, but rather whether he poses a danger to the community and can be trusted to appear for trial. [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3142(e)(1\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3142). And on those questions, he retains the presumption of innocence, but the government's burden of proof when arguing otherwise is substantially lower. The courts recognize both the potential of fleeing from the court and the prevention of additional crimes as legitimate bases for pretrial detention.\n\nIn cases like Avenatti's, where the government is seeking pretrial detention because the defendant is a danger to the community, it needs to prove by clear and convincing evidence \"that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the community.\" [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 3142(f)(2\\)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3142).\n\nHowever, if the government is seeking to hold the defendant because it does not believe he will appear for trial, it need only prove its case on that question by a preponderance of the evidence. [*United States v. Martir*, 782 F.2d 1141, 1146 (2d Cir. 1986\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-martir#p1146) (\u201cFor detention to be proper, the government had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that no conditions of release would reasonably assure Martir's attendance at trial.\u201d).\n\nAs a side note, I'd agree with some of the answers that *in practice*, the bond system is regularly abused to the point that its underlying principles become unrecognizable.

If you want to get in the business of manufacturing pork insulin (nobody in the US does: there are no approved US sources), you have to get FDA approval. [21 USC 331](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/331) prohibits introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of unapproved drugs.\n\nYou can argue that personal use does not constitute \"introduction into interstate commerce\". An analogous argument was tried in the case of [Wickard v. Filburn](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/317/111/), 317 U.S. 111, where appellee was penalized for growing and feeding wheat to his livestock, contrary to federal law. The court found that manufacturing for personal use potentially impacts interstate commerce, so the wheat regulations are not unconstitutional. Nevertheless, insulin\\-relevant law is framed in terms of *introduction* into interstate commerce, not just *affecting* interstate commerce. \n\nThe FDA's consumer guidance on importing beef and pork insulin is [here](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/questionsanswers/ucm173909.htm#Q-1). They state that you can apply for permission to import unapproved animal insulin, and they state that they will not generally allow unapproved importation, however\n\n> FDA staff may use enforcement discretion to allow the importation of\n>  unapproved drugs into the U.S. under certain conditions. One such\n>  condition is personal importation of unapproved drugs, like beef or\n>  pork insulin, that are medically necessary and not available in the\n>  U.S. If you are a person with diabetes who can\u2019t be treated with\n>  human insulin or its analogs, FDA may permit you to import beef or\n>  pork insulin into the U.S. for your personal use.\n\nAgain, this is for person use only. The bottom line is that there is a basis for thinking that the FDA could restrict you, but not necessarily a sufficient basis to say that the restriction would be legal. The underpinning of these restrictions is the Commerce Clause, and the language of the restrictions is more narrow than the frequent \"affecting interstate commerce\" connection to that clause. While the courts generally accept that \"keeping people safe\" is a legitimate government interest, a narrow reading of the language does not support the theory that making your own insulin is illegal.\n\nThere would be no legal basis for the FDA to penalize the scrap seller.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A diabetic individual decides to extract insulin from slaughterhouse pancreas scraps for personal use.

While the FDA has the authority to regulate insulin and prohibit the introduction of unapproved drugs into interstate commerce, personal use complicates the matter. The language in relevant laws specifically mentions \"introduction into interstate commerce,\" which may not clearly apply to personal production and use. \n\nAdditionally, while cases like Wickard v. Filburn have established that personal use can affect interstate commerce, the specific language in insulin-related laws is narrower. The FDA's policy on importing unapproved animal insulin for personal use demonstrates some flexibility in their approach, but this doesn't guarantee the same treatment for personally extracted insulin.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the FDA does have authority to regulate insulin, their legal grounds for prohibiting personal extraction and use are not as clear-cut as this option suggests.\n\nAnswer B is overly permissive, as the FDA does have some basis for potential restriction, even if it's not definitively established.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the FDA shows some leniency with personal importation of unapproved animal insulin, this doesn't automatically extend to personally extracted insulin, nor does it require the FDA to allow the practice."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2089/is-displaying-open-source-license-acknowledgments-legally-mandatory", "docs_id": 2089, "title": "Is displaying Open Source License Acknowledgments legally mandatory?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: When a piece of software explicitly requires that their open source license acknowledgments be included in derivative software (software that uses the open source software), is this a legally enforceable requirement?\n\nAccording to [this blog post](http://blog.human-friendly.com/are-you-breaching-open-source-licenses-accidentally) it is, but let's look at an example.

In your case, you are talking about establishing a \"a design company/photography business\"; if the person you are concerned about sells fruit, you are probably not going to infringe their trade mark. Similarly, if your operations are sufficiently removed geographically that there is minimal chance of confusion you should be fine.\n\n[Copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) is a completely different concept and has to do with artistic or literary expression.

That means you need a *legal basis* to process them, but not necessarily consent from the user.\n\nThat IP addresses should be treated as personal data in most contexts is clear, regardless of whether you can associate the IP address with a user ID. That you make such an association affirms that both the IP address and user ID are personal data in your context though.\n\nAs the answers in the questions you linked indicate, there are alternative legal bases to consent. The GDPR offers a choice of six legal bases (Art 6(1\\) lit a\u2013f). In most cases, you would instead rely on a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d for logging. But it's not enough to claim that you have a legitimate interest. You must have a clear purpose for which such logs would be necessary, and you would then have to weigh this legitimate interest against the interests, rights, and freedoms of the affected data subjects. If such logs are necessary for security and anti\\-abuse purposes, your legitimate interest test is likely to prevail.\n\nHowever, you must limit retention of the logged data and the included information to what is actually necessary. For example, keeping user IDs in there might not be necessary. If the association of IP addresses and user IDs is not necessary for a legitimate interest, then you would indeed need consent.\n\n---\n\nDiscussion on why IP addresses are personal data.\n\nYou see many answers and opinions that IP addresses might not be personal data. Some of these are *technically correct*, but most are misinformed or outdated. I know only a single well\\-informed person that still disagrees. For everyone else [such as the EU Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/what-personal-data_en), IP addresses are clearly personal data.\n\nUnder the GDPR, personal data is any information that relates to an (indirectly) identifiable natural person. In the context of log files we can assume that the entries usually \u201crelate\u201d to a person, namely the person making the request. The exception would be requests triggered by automated systems. The more interesting question is whether the person to which the log entry relates is identifiable.\n\nWhile the GDPR does provide further guidance on the concept of identification in Recital 26, it does not provide clear unambiguous criteria. Thus, there is lots of debate about what that precisely means.\n\nOne approach is to sidestep that debate and and notice that the GDPR's definition of personal data explicitly notes that a person might be identified \u201cin particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier\u201d (Art 4(1\\)). Another but otherwise unrelated part of the GDPR mentions \u201cinternet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags\u201d as examples of online identifiers (Recital 30\\).\n\nWe can also look more deeply into Recital 26 and see that \u201csingling out\u201d already counts as identification. We can use the IP address to single out one person's log entries from the set of log entries, so this could be interpreted as meaning that any stable user ID renders the data personal data \u2013 and an IP address is sufficiently stable in this context.\n\nAnother part of Recital 26 says that we must consider \u201call the means reasonably likely to be used\u201d for identification, even if this involves additional information from third parties. This phrasing is virtually identical to the GDPR's predecessor, the EU Data Protection Directive. On the basis of that DPD, the EU's top court (ECJ/CJEU) was asked to rule on the question whether dynamic IP addresses are personal data (the *Breyer* case, C\u2011582/14, judgement from 2016\\-10\\-19\\). It said yes.\n\n\u201cIt did not say yes\u201d, some people will object. And they are *technically correct*. When someone rents an internet connection from an ISP, the ISP will have logs that connect the user's real\\-world identity to the IP address they were assigned at a time. You don't have access to the ISP's logs. But, if that user violated your rights (e.g. a cyberattack or copyright infringement), then you could (depending on civil vs criminal matters) report this to the appropriate authorities or to petition the court and they would have the right to order the ISP to disclose this information. The CJEU said that *if* this chain (you \u2192 authorities \u2192 ISP \u2192 user identity) is grounded in law, then the IP address would be identifiable. But whether there are suitable laws to compel the ISP to disclose this data would be up to national laws, and the CJEU doesn't concern itself with that. Spoiler: such laws are pretty common.\n\nTo summarize typical objections:\n\n* The IP address doesn't *relate* to a person:\n\nCan be a valid objection, but is not typically the case for user\\-facing web services.\n* The Recital 30 argument is not valid because it's about profiling, not identification, and it only says that IP addresses *may* be used for profiling, not that they are always identifying:\n\nTechnically correct, but I think that Recital 30 merely expresses the implied understanding that of course an IP address is an online identifier and permits identification by itself.\n* \u201cSingling out\u201d does not apply because SOME\\_REASON:\n\nIndeed, this is an ill\\-defined term with no case law to guide us. However, regulators such as the EDPB and their predecessor WP29 routinely use \u201csingling out\u201d to mean being able to distinguish one person's data from other people's data. An IP address lets us do that.\n* The *Breyer* judgement is not applicable because the defendant in that case was the German state, and the state has other legal means than ordinary website operators:\n\nNothing in that case was specific to the website operator being a state or other authority. If the website operator can contact the appropriate authority and if they have the right to order the ISP to disclose the relevant data, then the IP address is identifiable.\n* The CJEU didn't say \u201cyes\u201d in *Breyer*, it said \u201cif\u201d. So I'll take that as a \u201cno\u201d:\n\nThe CJEU concerns itself with the interpretation of EU law, not with national laws. Specifically in the *Breyer* case, lower courts confirmed that German law has the necessary means. In other EU member states, further checks would be necessary but it would surprise me if there wouldn't be equivalent subpoena powers.\n* If the ISP doesn't have the data, then the IP addresses are anonymous:\n\nIndeed, the CJEU scenario collapses if there is no additional data to be linked with the IP address. However:\n\n\t+ The CJEU used this scenario as an example to show that IP addresses can be identifiable. If that particular scenario fails, there could be other scenarios that still allow identification.\n\t+ The question of whether IP addresses are identifiable had of course been the subject of wider debate at the time. That the GDPR explicitly mentions IP addresses can be seen as a reaction to this debate. Thus, in a sense, the *Breyer* case is moot. It is still useful as an explanation of how broad \u201creasonably likely means\u201d must be interpreted.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small e-commerce website logs user IP addresses along with user IDs for security purposes.

The traffic offense \\- you driving the vehicle with a suspended license \\- occurred on public property en route to the station. That offense does not simply disappear because you are *now* on private property, nor do the police need to wait for you to leave private property in order to stop or arrest you. So... forget the gas station even exists in this scenario.\n\nThe real issue at hand here is whether or not the officer needs to actually see you driving the vehicle in order to make an arrest. **The answer is no.** There isn't any other valid reason your car would be where it is now other than it was driven there. If you are the only person with the car, then it's reasonable to assume that you were the one that drove it there. Plenty of people get arrested for this \"connect the dots\" way of proving they drove, especially in DUI cases. But the officer doesn't even need to assume that second part either.\n\nIt all comes down to the actual definition of \"driving\" in the law books. Most citizens would interpret the word as meaning actually moving in a vehicle. That's wrong. Defining a driver and what constitutes driving is actually way, way broader in the eyes of the law. In Kansas, a [driver is defined](http://www.kslegislature.org/li_2014/b2013_14/statute/008_000_0000_chapter/008_014_0000_article/008_014_0016_section/008_014_0016_k/) in such a way:\n\n> **8\\-1416\\.\u2003\"Driver\" defined.** \"Driver\" means every person who drives or is in actual physical control of a vehicle.\n\nEssentially, having physical control over the vehicle is generally enough to label you as the driver or that you are driving the vehicle.

I recognize this is ambiguous but I assume that copyright law has several bases on which to make such a judgement call.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The basic principle is that copyright **never** protects an idea, it only protects the expression of an idea. In the US, that rule is embodied in [17 USC 102(b)](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#103) which provides that:\n\n> (b) In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.\n\nWhen significant, detailed, and specific plot elements are copied from a prior work, then that **may** make the new work a ***derivative work***. Creation or distribution of a derivative work requires permission from the owner of the copyright (if any) on the prior work (source work). But the elements used must be significant and must be detailed. If all that is taken could be expressed in a summery contained in a single sentence or paragraph, this will not make the new work derivative.\n\nFor example, such ideas as:\n\n> * Napoleon meets the Emperor of China and they form an alliance. \\[My idea]\n> * Sherlock Holmes helps to repel the Martian invasion described in *The War of the Worlds*. Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger is also involved. \\[Wellman's *Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds*]\n> * Aliens crash land on Earth in 1905, creating an alternate timeline. They seek to start WWI early, to stimulate technical development. \\[Benson's *...And Having Writ*]\n\nwould on their own not be enough to constitute a derivative work and thus infringement. But the more specific detail from the source work is used, the more likely it is that an infringement suit would win.\n\nBy the way, the rule is the same whether the source work is a book, or a TV show, or an opera, or any other work subject to copyright protection. If the work is old enough, any copyright will have expired, but the format of the original does not matter, as long as it is \"fixed in a tangible form\" which includes video tape, DVD, computer file, or a script written on paper.

When we purchased our house recently it what not brought to our attention at the time but the neighboring property has a disused chimney stack which appears to have been cut by a previous owner of our house to make way for a single\\-storey extension.

If a builder is brought in to rectify the issue we would no doubt need building reg approval but in doing so do we risk invalidating our indemnity policy and risk the local authority asking us to knock down the extension?\n2. Would we require a Party Wall Agreement with the neighbors which consists of two leaseholders and two free holders?\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1irGM.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1irGM.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Building regulations\n--------------------\n\nYou most likely do risk invalidating the insurance policy. Such indemnity policies typically have clauses to say that you mustn't carry out any action which alerts the local authority to the situation. The risk from the insurer's point of view is that if the local authority are alerted they may decide to take enforcement action against the earlier breach, and the insurer doesn't want to be liable in that scenario. You should check your policy wording to be certain.\n\nEnforcement limitation periods are as follows:\n\n* Criminal fine for breach, 2 years from date of offence ([Building Act 1984, s 35A(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/55/section/35A)).\n* Notice to carry out removal / alterations, 1 year from completion of works ([Building Act 1984, s 36(4\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/55/section/36)\n* Application to court to impose injunction for removal / alteration, no time limit ([Building Act 1984, s 36(6\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/55/section/36)\n\nIn *practice* local authorities rarely enforce breaches older than 1 year (presumably because of the increased risk/cost of going to court vs simply serving a notice), but of course you can't rely on this being the case.\n\nAs an alternative to applying to the council, you can use a private building control company (an \"approved inspector\") provided that you instruct them *before* you commence any works (they are not permitted to issue retrospective building control approvals). They are not going to care about the previous breach. The local authority will still be alerted to the fact of the *new* works but this is just a short notice sent by the approved inspector at the start and the end, and the local authority are far less likely to inspect (it has never happened in my experience). There are plenty of such companies; just google \"building control approved inspector\". But in any case you may still risk (a) invaliding the insurance and (b) triggering enforcement action, it's just that the risks are lower.\n\nParty wall\n----------\n\nYou probably will be required to submit a party wall notice. If you can gain the cooperation of your neighbour, it is not necessary to go through the formal process of reaching an agreement, and they can simply reply to your notice to say that they are happy for you to go ahead. If they are not willing to do so then it will become more complicated and you will probably need to appoint a party wall surveyor to reach an agreement. This will boil down to a bit of hassle and money, but isn't a big disaster otherwise. Be wary of party wall surveyors sending you marketing which makes it sound like you need to use them (quite common after you do something semi\\-public like apply for planning permission); *always* try to settle it with a written consent before you waste money. There are plenty of online resources and books which can guide you through the process.\n\nPlanning permission\n-------------------\n\nAlthough you didn't ask about planning, you should be aware that pursuant to the [Town and Country Planning Act 1990, Section 171B(1\\)](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/171B), you gain immunity from enforcement 4 years after completion of the works. You are also entitled to request a Lawful Development Certificate for Existing Use from the Local Authority to confirm the immunity, although it is not necessary to do so and it is perhaps not recommendable in this case as you might alert them to the building control issue and you would almost certainly invalidate your planning indemnity policy (albeit that would be less important than the building control policy).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner in the UK discovers that their recently purchased house has an extension built 20 years ago without proper planning or building regulations approval.

Additional meetings may be called by the president or by 2/3 of the members of the board.\n\n[http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/32/title32sec13718\\.html](http://legislature.maine.gov/legis/statutes/32/title32sec13718.html)\n\nIn example two, the statute says specifically that the president's term lasts for exactly one year starting with the date of election.\n\nWhat I am seeing is, for example, with example two, they forgot to elect a president last year and yet the minutes all say that the \"president\" \"called\" the meetings last year. Does that make those meetings invalid? In one of those meetings, two thirds of the members were not even present. \n\nAnother question I have is, \"what about the meeting where officers are elected?\" The statute says \"additional meetings\" may be called by the president or 2/3, but is silent on the first meeting.\n\nHow do you interpret these \"convening\" clauses? I can't imagine they're meaningless. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Section 13716 is a textbook case of ambiguous drafting. Subsection 1\n\n> The board shall elect from its members a president and other officers\n>  as it considers appropriate and necessary to conduct its business.\n\ncan be read as *requiring* the board to elect a president, and *allowing* it to also elect other officers in case the board finds it appropriate and necessary. Or, it can be read as requiring them to elect both a president and other officers, at least as long as the board considers it necessary, though a board can certainly operate without a president. That is, \"as it considers appropriate...\" can have scope over everything that precedes i.e. (president and other officers) or just the immediately preceding conjunct (other officers). The ambiguity becomes relevant since one reading sanctions the possibility of a board without a president (when you make a mistake, like forgetting to overtly elect a president, then it's necessary to scramble for a legal foundation. I'm not approving, just pointing out that they are not technically required to elect a president).\n\nThe one required annual meeting need not be called at all. The additional meetings (which are \"called\") would need to be called by the president or 2/3 of the board. From what I can tell, there is no way to know who called (convened) the additional meetings. Reading some of the minutes, note that they start with a report of the \"call to order\". Calling a meeting to order is different from calling a meeting. The latter happens before the meeting and causes the meeting to come about; the former defines the start of the meeting. The minutes do not reflect who called the meeting (convened the meeting).\n\nThe website\\-available minutes do not indicate that a president was elected in the January 2015 meeting. Those minutes could be in error. Or, it could be that they failed to overtly do so (that is, it was understood that the president would keep his office for another term, though not formally voted on). That would be legally sketchy, but the actions of a regulatory body would not be cast aside because of a small procedural error. The empowering statute does not give any significant powers to the president (e.g. the president does not have veto power, unlike POTUS). The board has the power to elect a president and continued for a year to treat the person as \"the president\", apparently without protest. If the matter were taken to court, the issue would be whether the procedural error was so grave that all of the actions of the board for the year would have to be thrown out, and I just don't see what that grave injustice would be (then again, other details might come out in court).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A state board failed to formally elect a president at their annual meeting, but continued to operate for a year with someone acting as president.

The passage suggests that while failing to formally elect a president is a procedural error, it may not necessarily invalidate all of the board's actions. The text states, \"If the matter were taken to court, the issue would be whether the procedural error was so grave that all of the actions of the board for the year would have to be thrown out.\" This implies that a court would evaluate the severity of the error and its impact, rather than automatically nullifying all actions (ruling out A).
