Doesn't the emboldened phrase contradict itself? \n\n> 98. This is a case brought by a commercial entity whose only interest in the defendants\u2019 performance of their obligations under the covenants was commercial. Indeed, a restrictive covenant which went beyond what was necessary for the reasonable protection of the claimant\u2019s commercial interests would have been unenforceable. The substance of the claimant\u2019s case is that it suffered financial loss as a result of the defendants\u2019 breach of contract. The effect of the breach of contract was to expose the claimant\u2019s business to competition which would otherwise have been avoided. The natural result of that competition was a loss of profits and possibly of goodwill. **The loss is difficult to quantify, and some elements of it may be inherently incapable of precise measurement. Nevertheless, it is a familiar type of loss, for which damages are frequently awarded.** It is possible to quantify it in a conventional manner, as is demonstrated by Mr Hine\u2019s report.\n> 99. The case is not one where the breach of contract has resulted in the loss of a valuable asset created or protected by the right which was infringed. Considered in isolation, the first defendant\u2019s breach of the confidentiality covenant might have been considered to be of that character, but in reality the claimant\u2019s loss is the cumulative result of breaches of a number of obligations, of which the non\\-compete and non\\-solicitation covenants have been treated as the most significant, as explained in para 17 above.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't believe it is contradictory. Some kinds of injury are inherently difficult to calculate (e.g. damage to reputation caused by slander) but the judge or jury, as the case may be, will review the evidence and do the best they can. Lord Reed says as much in paragraph 38 of his judgment.\n\n... and as a practical matter, it appears the damages, in this case, were both calculable and supported by evidence. The Court's primary focus was not whether damages could be calculated but rather the measure of damages (i.e. the method of calculation)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Lord Reed's statement regarding damages for breach of contract in commercial cases, which of the following best describes the Court's approach to quantifying losses that are difficult to measure precisely?\n\nA) The Court will always refuse to award damages if the loss cannot be precisely calculated.\nB) The Court will rely solely on expert reports to determine the exact amount of damages.\nC) The Court will use conventional methods to estimate damages, even if some elements are inherently difficult to measure precisely.\nD) The Court will only award damages for losses that can be quantified with absolute certainty.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Lord Reed's statement acknowledges that while some elements of the loss may be inherently incapable of precise measurement, it is still a familiar type of loss for which damages are frequently awarded. He emphasizes that it is possible to quantify the loss in a conventional manner, even if it's difficult. This approach balances the reality of imprecise measurements in some cases with the need to provide a remedy for breach of contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the Court does not refuse to award damages simply because precise calculation is difficult. Option B is overly restrictive, as the Court considers various factors beyond just expert reports. Option D is too extreme, as it contradicts Lord Reed's acknowledgment that some elements may be inherently incapable of precise measurement."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/64000/does-a-property-owner-have-liability-for-signs-others-post-in-her-yard", "docs_id": 64000, "title": "Does a property owner have liability for signs others post in her yard?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Someone has a house with a yard that is close to a high\\-traffic street.

James D. TSCHECHTELIN et al.* No.\u20022044, Sept. Term, 1999\\. (Court of Special Appeals of Maryland.) 763 A.2d 209](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/md-court-of-special-appeals/1373579.html)\n\nThe court said, quoting past cases::\n\nTo establish a *prima facie* case of defamation when the plaintiff is not a public figure, the plaintiff must prove: \u2009(1\\) that the defendant made a defamatory communication to a third person; \u2009(2\\) that the statement was false; \u2009(3\\) that the defendant was at fault in communicating the statement; \u2009and (4\\) that the plaintiff suffered harm. \u2002*Thacker v.

App. 11, 20\\-21 (2016\\)\n\nThuds it is an essential element of a defamation calm \"**that the defendant made a defamatory communication to a third person**\"\n\nWhile it is a general principle of common law that:\n\n> The basic rule is that everyone involved in any way in the production or dissemination of defamatory material is liable as having published it.\n\naccording to the Wikipedia article [\"Innocent dissemination\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innocent_dissemination). That article goes on to say that:\n\n> At common law, a defense of innocent dissemination is available to a person who, neither knowingly nor negligently, had merely a subordinate role in the dissemination of the matter containing the defamatory statement.\n\nThis applies when:\n\n> 1. the defendant did not know that the publication complained of contained a libel;\n> 2. the defendant had no grounds to suppose that it was likely to contain defamatory matter; and\n> 3. the absence of knowledge was not due to any negligence on the defendant's part.\n\nIt would seem that on the facts assumed in the question the landowner has Arguably not **made** the defamatory statement at all, nor has she distributed or published it. She has merely failed to remove it from her property in as prompt a manner as she might have. Even if failing to remove the statement is considered to be a from of distributing the statemetn, it seems at least possible that a defense of innocent infringement would apply. I can find no court case at all closely on point, and the basic elements of defamation law in Marylnd seem to be common\\-law rather than statutory.\n\nSign Ordinances\n---------------\n\nThese are generally local or municipal rules. I could not find documentation for a typical rule in Maryland. I was formerly somewhat involved in public affairs, particularly in connection with lawn signs, political and otherwise, in the township of West Windsor, NJ.\n\nThere such signs could nort be placed so close to a roadway as to ovstruct teh sight\\-lines of drivers. Temporary signs in conection wiuth an event were required to be removed within 7 days after the date of that mevent. For political signs that was the eleection involvved. ll of this is contained in the township code section [\u00a7 200\\-152 Temporary signs](https://www.ecode360.com/8064689) Subsection B (1\\) provides that:\n\n> Temporary noncommercial, including political signs. Noncommercial signs, including but not limited to political signs which are temporary in nature, shall be permitted in all districts. Temporary noncommercial signs are those which are not permanently affixed to the ground, a building or other permanent structure on the property and not intended to be permanent in time. Temporary noncommercial signs shall not exceed 16 square feet (no side of any signs shall be more than six feet in any linear dimension) in residential zones and 32 square feet in nonresidential zones. Temporary political signs associated with an election shall be removed no later than seven days after the election. Site plan approval shall not be required for the placement of temporary noncommercial signs.\n\nThe details of such rules will vary widely with the locality, but generally will require the owner to remove signs within some period of time if the person placing the sign without permission does not. But they are not likely to hold the owner liable for the sign having been places in the first place."}, "answer": "Here is a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner allows political signs to be placed on their property near a busy street corner, but removes signs they disagree with more quickly than others.

The key elements of defamation include that \"the defendant made a defamatory communication to a third person.\" In this case, the homeowner did not create or actively distribute the defamatory content. Even if failing to remove the sign promptly could be considered a form of distribution, the homeowner might have a defense of innocent dissemination, as they did not knowingly or negligently play a role in spreading the defamatory content. The selective removal of other signs is not directly relevant to liability for a specific defamatory sign. Local sign ordinances may require removal within a certain timeframe, but this is separate from defamation liability."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/40811/what-happens-to-abandoned-infant-citizenship", "docs_id": 40811, "title": "What Happens to Abandoned Infant Citizenship?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the United States, you are considered a U.S. Citizen just by being born in the United States. However, I imagine that there are situations where there is no proof that a child was born in the United States, but it would be reasonable to consider or assume that a child was born in the United States, such as finding an infant in the United States.\n\nI know that there are a number of people who do not give birth to their child in a hospital. How do they prove a child was born in the United States, to then give them a birth certificate, therefore, citizenship? Do they trust a mother is telling the truth when she reports her child being born after\\-the\\-fact? Who/what agency does she report to, in that case?\n\nWhat happens if an infant within the United States is found, but no witnesses relating to the child are locatable/found, such as the child's mother? Technically, there is no proof/witness of birth. Does this child get a birth certificate? Do they get citizenship? Where are they a citizen of? If they receive a birth certificate, what date were they considered born?\n\nWas there some sort of court case that a court ruled that an infant found in the United States is considered born in the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is controlled by [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401) which details who qualifies for \"birthright citizenship\". Including of course the condition mandated by the 14th ammendment, Congress is otherwise free to bestow such citizenship essentially as it pleases by duly enacted legislation. One of the cases that receives birthright citizenship is\n\n> a person of unknown parentage found in the United States while under the age of five years, until shown, prior to his attaining the age of twenty\\-one years, not to have been born in the United States.\n\nSo the presumption for young children found in the US is that they *are* citizens by birth. The law in particular requires positive proof that the individual in question was definitely not born in the United States. Lacking this, or it failing to be found prior to reaching the age of 21 years, they are citizens.\n\nFor other cases, this will likely end up falling to the courts, who will decide the matter [on the preponderance of the evidence](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/33105/what-is-the-legal-standard-of-proof-required-for-us-citizenship). In this case it becomes the burden of the individual claiming citizenship to establish that they are a citizen\\*. Birth certificates can be filed after birth, and can be submitted as evidence. The laws controlling the validity of birth certificates is locally determined. If there are other birth certificates from other countries, or conflicting witness testimony, then it will fall to the court to decide which case is more likely based on the evidence available.\n\n---\n\n\\*More accurately the burden generally falls on the entity making the claim about someone's citizenship (their own or someone else's).

This means that the child in the question is presumed to be a U.S. citizen unless proven otherwise before they turn 21. \n\nOption A is incorrect because proof of U.S. birth is not required in this case; the law presumes U.S. birth unless proven otherwise. \n\nOption C is wrong because the child is already presumed to be a citizen and doesn't need to apply for naturalization. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the law provides an automatic presumption of citizenship without requiring a court hearing."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/15004/can-results-from-a-criminal-conviction-be-transplanted-into-a-corresponding-civi", "docs_id": 15004, "title": "Can results from a criminal conviction be transplanted into a corresponding civil case?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There is some overlap between crimes and torts, for example deliberately smacking a person in the head is the crime of battery and the tort of battery.

Bilunas\\-Hardy*, 93 P.3d 598, 600 (Colo. App. 2004\\) (\"Hardy contends Colorado law does not allow courts to apply collateral estoppel, now commonly known as the doctrine of issue preclusion, when the first adjudication is criminal and the subsequent litigation is civil. We disagree.\")\n\nSimilarly, a case out of California stated:\n\n> To preclude a civil litigant from relitigating an issue previously\n>  found against him in a criminal prosecution is less severe than to\n>  preclude him from relitigating such an issue in successive civil\n>  trials, for there are rigorous safeguards against unjust conviction,\n>  including the requirements of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and of a\n>  unanimous verdict, the right to counsel, and a record paid for by the\n>  state on appeal. Stability of judgments and expeditious trials are\n>  served and no injustice done, when criminal defendants are estopped\n>  from relitigating issues determined in conformity with these\n>  safeguards.\n\n*Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. v. Dominion Ins. Co.*, 58 Cal.2d 601, 606, 25 Cal.Rptr. 559, 375 P.2d 439, 441 (1962\\) (citations omitted).\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, this is the rule in every U.S. jurisdiction (with the possible exceptions of Puerto Rico and Louisiana which are not common law jurisdictions). It is also the historical rule in British common law, although I don't know if this continues to be the case in non\\-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nProcedurally, the determination that collateral estoppel applies would usually be made on a motion for summary judgment, or in the preparation of jury instructions which state that liability has been established and that the jury is to limit itself to determining causation and damages, rather than as an evidentiary matter.\n\nI've used this doctrine once or twice. \n\nFor example, I used it in a case where someone fraudulently sold ditch company shares worth several hundred thousand dollars (in Colorado, water is gold) that he didn't own (a transaction that could not be unwound because the buyer was a bona fide purchaser for value and the seller had apparent authority as a trustee of a trust owning the shares even though he didn't have the actual authority to sell them under the trust) and then spent the money he received before he was discovered (if I recall correctly, for gambling debts). He was convicted criminally and then my client, the victim, sued for money damages including statutory treble damages for civil theft and attorney's fees based upon collateral estoppel and an affidavit as to damages in a motion for summary judgment.\n\nFrom a practical perspective the four main difficulties are that (1\\) people convicted of crimes often lack the income or assets to pay judgments, (2\\) there are double recovery issues involved in reconciling restitution awards in a criminal case (where the measure of damages is narrower) and damage awards in a civil case (where the measure of damages is broader), (3\\) there are priority issues involved in reconciling criminal awards for fines, restitution and costs, in each case with civil awards for damages, and (4\\) if the defendant declares bankruptcy, the non\\-dischargeability of the civil judgment must be affirmatively raised and proved (often this is elementary but there are strict time limits) in the bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nTactically, it is often better to sue first, collect what you can, and to bring a criminal complaint only when it turns out that the perpetrator is judgment\\-proof."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a case where an individual is convicted of battery in criminal court, and the victim subsequently files a civil lawsuit for the tort of battery against the same defendant, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of the criminal conviction in the civil case?\n\nA) The criminal conviction cannot be used as evidence in the civil case, and all elements of the tort must be proven again.\n\nB) The criminal conviction can be introduced as evidence, but the jury still needs to determine if the act occurred and if the defendant is liable.\n\nC) The criminal conviction can be used to establish liability through collateral estoppel, leaving only causation and damages to be determined in the civil case.\n\nD) The criminal conviction automatically results in a civil judgment, with no need for a separate civil trial.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legal doctrine of collateral estoppel (also known as issue preclusion) allows a criminal judgment to have an effect in a subsequent civil case. This means that the criminal conviction can be used to establish liability in the civil case, as the elements of the crime have already been proven beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal court. In the civil case, the focus would then be on determining causation and damages, rather than re-litigating whether the act occurred or if the defendant is liable.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it contradicts the principle of collateral estoppel. The criminal conviction can indeed be used in the civil case.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct in that the conviction can be introduced, but it's incorrect in stating that liability needs to be re-determined. The conviction establishes liability through collateral estoppel.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while the criminal conviction can establish liability, it doesn't automatically result in a civil judgment. A separate civil proceeding is still necessary to determine damages and other civil remedies."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37943/can-a-police-officer-lie", "docs_id": 37943, "title": "Can a police officer lie?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the unfortunate event, someone finds themselves being questioned by the police in the US, and they ask for a lawyer, but in an unlikely event the police officer says \"you don't need a lawyer you're not under arrest, just being questioned\", then the person being questioned proceeds in self\\-incrimination. \n\nWere their statements legally obtained? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A police officer can lie, and lying does not render a statement inadmissible.

The officer's statement about not needing a lawyer, while potentially misleading, does not automatically make the confession inadmissible. The case of Oregon v. Mathiason established that police can even lie to suspects without necessarily rendering a confession inadmissible. The mention of wanting a lawyer is important, but its impact depends on whether John was in custody. If it's determined that John was not in custody, his statements may still be admissible even after mentioning a lawyer.

They register their marriage in the foreign country through the appropriate legal mechanisms\n3. Within three years, they are no longer US residents.\n4. The couple separates after four years. They hire a local lawyer to annul the marriage in the foreign country, and this is done.\n5. The marriage is still valid in the USA, according to a US Embassy.\n6. A significant time later, the couple wants to dissolve the marriage in the USA too. However, neither the US Embassy nor any lawyers they consult with, either overseas or in the USA, can give them a straight answer as to how to effect such a divorce. The couple is told that there are \"complicated jurisdictional issues\" involved.

The marriage was registered in a notary in the foreign country so that it would have legal validity there. The \"annulment\" I refer to was then the standard process for \"reversing\" this registration, so that the marriage no longer held legal validity in the foreign country.

This codified a portion of existing customary international law on diplomatic immunity. It is the result of several years of legal negotiations at establishing a common set of rules that would be generally acceptable.\n\nThe basic concept of immunity for ambassadors is very ancient, and there is still a body of customary international law that was *not* codified. For example, the 1961 Convention only deals with permanent missions, not temporary ones like for multinational summits. The history and practice are also helpful for interpreting the Convention itself, such as when considering the scope of diplomatic duties which are protected, as opposed to extracurricular activities which might not be.\n\nIn the UK, the Convention is implemented by the [Diplomatic Privileges Act 1964](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/81/contents). This mostly repeats the relevant parts of the Convention text, in Schedule 1, and also includes sections integrating those provisions with domestic law. As far as the courts, section 4 says that\n\n> If in any proceedings any question arises whether or not any person is entitled to any privilege or immunity under this Act a certificate issued by or under the authority of the Secretary of State stating any fact relating to that question shall be conclusive evidence of that fact.\n\nThis means that what happens procedurally in a UK court is that someone wanting to claim immunity must come with a letter from the Foreign Secretary attesting that they are a real diplomat and not just making it up. The court then considers, from that *fact*, what legal consequences follow, depending on the type of diplomat involved (e.g. heads of mission have broader protection), the nature of the case (criminal case where the diplomat is accused? civil case where they are the respondent?), etc. That is a matter of interpreting the Convention, plus maybe customary international law \\- it doesn't mean the diplomat gets to wave their certificate and end the proceedings.\n\nThe purpose of section 4 is to avoid the court entering its own fact\\-finding process about whether someone is a real diplomat. That is felt to run the risk of the court causing diplomatic offence by accident \\- consider Israel and Palestine and China and Taiwan for potential pitfalls. The doctrine of \"one voice\" obliges the courts to follow the executive's lead.\n\nPrior to the Act of 1964, diplomatic immunity was covered by several other enactments, but with the same basic model for implementing immunities in court. There were different regimes for Commonwealth countries and others, which is not the case any more. The first such Act was passed in 1708 after an embarrassing situation with the then ambassador from Russia, who was imprisoned for his debts, angering the Tsar.\n\nIn general, domestic courts in the UK can take account of customary international law if it is relevant. They can also look at treaty texts, even ones the UK has not signed, to help interpret international law. (In the same way, they can look at academic articles, travaux pr\u00e9paratoires, etc., which have no formal status as law.) If the UK signed the 1961 Convention but did not pass the 1964 Act, then courts might be able to treat the Convention as \"background\" \\- but would still be bound by the 1708\\-1955 Acts on the topic, as far as the actual procedure and rules to follow. A diplomat would not be able to avail themselves of their specific 1961 rights, unless perhaps there was some gap or ambiguity in the domestic law where they could squeeze in an argument that the Convention supplied the proper interpretation of whichever point of customary international law was involved."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A foreign diplomat is being sued in a UK court for damages resulting from a car accident.

This mutation does not constitute a disability, though it does provide certain minor difficulties in using certain aspects of modern housing and transport, as they are significantly taller than normal humans. This mutation cannot readily be concealed save by surgery that would leave the person in a wheelchair for the remainder of their life, and would leave visible scars, without also wearing a garment such as a burka... so it can be demonstrated that they could not have been recent arrivals to Australia, as no mention has ever been made of people with such a remarkable mutation ever entering the country before the appearance of this individual.\n\nMy question is: How would it be possible for this individual to obtain legal residency, further education and Australian citizenship, in that order of priority. Obviously, this individual would not want to be placed in detention, so avoiding that is also a priority. What obstacles would have to be overcome, and how long might this process be expected to take?\n\nCitizenship is a secondary goal, and may potentially be obtained through marriage to an Australian citizen.\n\nThis question is purely theoretical, and should not be considered to apply to any real person, being research for a work of fiction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, let's be clear.\n\nUnder the relevant Australian law, this person is [an Australian citizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_nationality_law#Citizenship_by_birth),\nThis is for two reasons. First, because he or she is descended from someone who was born in Australia in the time period from January 26, 1949 to August 19, 1986 (or who was a British subject born in Australia prior to January 26, 1949\\), and second, because a child born in Australia after 19 August 1986 (and who is not otherwise an Australian citizen) and who lives in Australia, automatically acquires Australian citizenship on his or her 10th birthday, if the child has not been granted or otherwise acquired Australian citizenship in the meantime. This occurs automatically (by operation of law), and applies irrespective of the immigration status of the child or his/her parents.\n\nSo, the question is not one of status as an Australian citizen, but of proof of status as an Australian citizen. This individual is not truly stateless.\n\nAlso, even if the parents (contrafactually) were stateless rather than being Australian citizens, which they were, children born in Australia whose parents are stateless and not entitled to any other country's citizenship may in some circumstances apply for and be granted Australian citizenship.\n\nOne of the reasons that Australia allows this rule is that in order to deport someone you have to know that the person deported is a citizen of the country to which the person is deported. If you are a stateless person in Australia (as this person is not, but someone might suspect them of being), you can be denied rights the flow from citizenship, rather than merely from being a person or being a resident. But, you can't deport a stateless person because you have no place to deport them to.\n\nRelated to this fact is that Australia is a party to the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness (1961\\), a multilateral international treaty.\n\n> In respect of contracting states:\n> \n> \n> \"Stateless birth\" on their territory attracts the grant of their\n> nationality (article 1\\).\n> \n> \n> Otherwise stateless persons may take the nationality of the place of\n> their birth or of the place where they were found (in the case of a\n> foundling), otherwise they may take the nationality of one of their\n> parents (in each case possibly subject to a qualifying period of\n> residence in that State) (article 2\\).\n> \n> \n> A stateless person has some time beyond attaining adulthood to seek to\n> claim the benefit of the Convention. That time is always at least\n> three years from the age of eighteen (article 1(5\\)).\n> \n> \n> Transfer of territory between states must occur in a manner that\n> avoids the occurrence of statelessness for persons residing in the\n> territory transferred.\n> \n> \n> When a State acquires territory, the inhabitants of that territory\n> presumptively acquire the nationality of that State (article 10\\).\n> \n> \n> Persons otherwise stateless shall be able to take the nationality of\n> one of their parents (possibly subject to a period of prior residence\n> not more than three years) (article 4\\).\n> \n> \n> Absent circumstances of fraudulent application or disloyalty toward\n> the contracting state, deprivations and renunciations of citizenship\n> shall only take effect where a person has or subsequently obtains\n> another nationality in replacement (article 8\\).\n> \n> \n> The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will issue\n> travel documents evidencing nationality to persons, otherwise\n> stateless, having a claim of nationality under the convention.\n> \n> \n> Birth on a sea vessel or aircraft may attract the nationality of the\n> flag of that vessel or craft (article 3\\).\n> \n> \n> Disloyal or certain criminal conduct may limit an individual's ability\n> to avail the benefit of the Convention (article 8\\).\n> \n> \n> The benefit of the Convention may be claimed by guardians on behalf of\n> children (article 1(1\\)).\n> \n> \n> States may impose a period of residence qualification for granting\n> nationality to persons who may be otherwise stateless. That period is\n> a maximum five years immediately prior to application and maximum of\n> ten years overall (article 1(2\\)).\n\nThere is also the question of proof. What suffices as proof sufficient for an immigration and nationality official varies, and there are probably presumptions that would be relevant.\n\nThe fact that you are currently resident in Australia, that you have no recollection of living anywhere else or being told that you live anywhere else, your own testimony under oath regarding your place of birth and ancestry, any documentation that exists of you being in Australia in the past, and the fact that you speak English in an Australian accent fluently and speak no other language, would also be evidence of your citizenship or might trigger a presumption in favor of assuming that you are a citizen unless proven otherwise.\n\nThe government can also change its processes to fit special circumstances.\n\nFor example, during the Vietnam War in which the United States was involved, a significant number of children were born to U.S. soldier fathers and Vietnamese mothers in Vietnam. Ordinarily, under U.S. law, it is necessary to establish that a particular person who is a U.S. citizen was your father. But, in the aftermaths of these births, there was a period of time at least, when anyone born in Vietnam to a Vietnamese mother, who was racially part\\-Vietnamese and part either European or African in ancestry, was presumed based upon appearance alone to be a child of a U.S. citizen present in Vietnam in connection with the war effort and granted citizenship by birth, with their place of birth and mixed race alone sufficing to establish their citizenship.\n\nIt wouldn't be hard to imagine Australia adopting such a rule in the case that you describe.\n\nAlso, even if such a *per se* rule were not adopted, usually the ultimate test in a proceeding to establish citizenship is proof by a preponderance of the evidence that it is more likely than not that this person is an Australian citizen, and that standard could probably be met by any official who was not intentionally inclined to bear ill will to this person or their group. Competent legal representation and expert testimony would likely help the person to establish their citizenship."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An undocumented individual, born in Australia to undocumented parents, is seeking legal residency and citizenship.

But, that isn't the case \"when it's blatantly obvious that there is no infringement.\" There is no benefit from pursuing cases that aren't even colorable infringements.\n\nThe notion is similar to adverse possession. If you let someone openly use your real property without your permission, eventually, the squatter becomes its legal owner.\n\nAlso, as in the case of adverse possession, an alternative to suing someone for infringing is to make their permission non\\-infringing by writing them a letter expressly authorizing them to use your mark. Permissive, licensed use does not dilute a trademark."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company owns a popular trademark for a line of sports equipment.

Is that a valid defense that you were driving at a reasonable speed?\n\nWhat if you mentioned to the officer once stopped that you were simply going with the flow of the traffic, and he didn't really seem to object?\n\nWhat if the speed limit was 70, the flow of the traffic in your lane was 75 to 80, [the citation received was listed for 80, but the officer claims that he has gotten you on his radar at 85](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2060/is-a-speeding-ticket-invalid-if-the-listed-speed-is-not-what-it-was)? Could it be argued that in such instance the actual speed limit was supposed to have been at least 75 (as per the *85th percentile speed*), and thus going 80 (as per the ticket) is less than the 10 miles over the limit, which is what the minimum charge an officer claimed he could give a citation for? Would this be a valid defense in Texas, overthrowing the citation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Texas and California are actually what are called *Presumed Speeding* states, unlike most others which are *Absolute Speeding* states. (There is a little known third category called *Basic*, but this is uncommon). In a *presumed* speeding state, a speed\\-limit violation offers someone in your shoes far more flexibility in building your defense than the more common *absolute* state.\n\nIn states that use this *presumed* system, such as California and Texas, it is *not* illegal to drive over the posted limit as long as you are driving safely and this can be established. For example, if you are driving 50 mph in a 40\\-mph zone, you are \"presumed\" to be speeding, yes. However, despite this *prima facie* evidence (meaning \"on its face\") of speed in excess of the posted limit, if you can show you were driving safely you may be able to mount a pretty decent defense. Just because you got a ticket is *not* prima facie evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that you were speeding. You are presumed innocent. If they *prove* you were speeding this is all they need to make their case, unless you rebut it. But there is a lot of room to rebut this presumption \u2013 and that is *if* they prove it. They must (as with all criminal cases) prove you did what you are accused of *beyond a reasonable doubt* \u2013 the highest standard of proof in the U.S.\n\nSo, if everyone was going 80 MPH in a 70MPH zone, you would argue that the road was (I'm assuming) dry, unmarred, you were traveling in heavy enough traffic that to slow your speed to the posted limit would actually be less safe than traveling with the flow of traffic. You can talk about the state of your vehicle (repair, handling, etc.), how you stayed in one lane, and you can describe your skill at driving \u2013 especially if you have no other tickets and you have been driving for a long time. \n\nIf you were weaving in and out of traffic, riding someone's bumper, if it was pouring rain, the road was bumpy or under construction, or if you *admitted* speeding (if you did this you can still rebut with a showing of safe driving, but ignore all info regarding challenging radar or other means of determining speed), or if any other evidence exists that the officer would testify to that shows you were *not* driving safely, this will not be successful. A successful example of a speeding defense in Texas: on a clear, dry morning with no other cars on a wide, straight road, a man is pulled over for being clocked going 50 mph in a 40 MPH zone. He had a perfect record and had been driving 22 years. He was driving a 2\\-year\\-old car. He convinced a judge that this was driving safely given those conditions and was acquitted. That's because facts presented were sufficient to \"rebut the presumption\" that by going over the posted limit he was driving at an unsafe speed.\n\n**NOTE:** *Never* bring up your driving record unless it is *spotless*. Unless you are a habitual offender it cannot be used against you or be brought into evidence at all, *unless you open the door*. \n\nYou can also mount a defense based on the radar detection device, if one was used. You can seek records as to when the calibration fork was last checked, when the last time it was professionally calibrated (rather than self calibrated). You can ask, in a leading way (only if you know) how close the car behind and in front of you were (you don't want to be too close to the car in front of you, however if the cars were tightly grouped it is more likely the radar detector could have read another vehicle): e.g., \"Isn't it true that the car behind me was only 1\\.5 car lengths behind me?\" Only do this if you know, but if you can get the officer to admit that the car behind you was close, that can be used to rebut the radar detection and goes to the argument that driving slower would have been dangerous and you were driving safely with the flow of traffic. \n\nYou should be prepared to put on an entire trial if you fight the ticket. In Texas, I believe speeding is considered a Class C criminal offense (rather than a civil offense as in most absolute states); hence, they have to build the prima facie case against you and prove it beyond reasonable doubt. If you can afford one, get a good traffic violation attorney. Always choose a jury in this type of case. Everyone speeds a little and you are far more likely to be acquitted by a jury than a judge. You should also ask to have the case assigned to the county seat; request this in writing ASAP.\n\nIf you are trying the case, be prepared to go after the officer. Note any distinguishing marks on your car (if any), recall what you wore, what time of day, the lighting, all that. Even go back to the scene at the same day and time and take video showing the flow of traffic, (hopefully) the straightness of the road, etc. Cross\\-examine him on all facts with confidence and in a leading manner. Always ask for the calibration reports and you will get all evidence against you in discovery.\n\nThis thing about 10mph being the minimum they can give a ticket for: ignore that, it's rubbish! It's meant to get you to admit to him that \"you were only going 8 or 9 over.\" Also, that whole percentile argument is not relevant and will not work at all. You must show that you were driving safely given all the facts and circumstances to rebut the presumption that you were driving unsafely by speeding.\n\nIt is worth fighting as you will also incur surcharges, increased insurance rates, and points on your license that are cumulative and stay for 3 years \u2013 a certain amount of which gets you suspended if you get (or have) more violations."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Texas, which is a \"presumed speeding\" state, you are pulled over for driving 80 mph in a 70 mph zone.

For the cases in which asking ID with no ground is illegal, it seems that the definition of \"ground\" changes according to any police officer, because any police officer can bypass all this thing and just say \"I checked your ID because you look like a drug dealer\", by making it pass as a legit ground while it is not. \n\nIs it correct to say that the laws stating *checking without grounds is illegal*, pragmatically, are just rendered meaningless by how any officer perceives the notion of \"ground\" or can samely make up a new one?

This depends on the jurisdiction. Where such an ability exists, you can use it to legally tell the officer where to get off. In this case \"the laws stating checking without grounds is illegal\" are definitely meaningful.\n\nFor instance, in New Zealand you can file a [judicial review](https://communitylaw.org.nz/community-law-manual/chapter-3-dealing-with-government-agencies/challenging-decisions-and-conduct-of-government-agencies/going-to-the-courts-judicial-review/) of what the officer did.

While officers may attempt to justify their actions with vague or fabricated grounds, the existence of a robust judicial review process allows citizens to challenge these justifications. In jurisdictions with effective judicial review, like New Zealand, officers must convincingly articulate their reasons to a judge, who can then declare the actions illegal if the justification is insufficient. This process gives teeth to laws against groundless ID checks.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while officer interpretation matters, it's the ability to challenge this interpretation that truly enforces the law.

When we say that tobacco, alcohol or marijuana \"are legal\", that means that it is allowed *in some context* to use or have such things. These things are not *completely* lacking in restrictions, for instance they can't be sold to or possessed by minors, their distribution is highly regulated and taxed, and in the case of marijuana, there are limits on how much one can have. A distinct concept of \"being legal\" pertains to rights, such as the right to be gay or black \u2013 there can't be a law punishing a person for being either thing (although there *used* to be such laws). \n\nThe concept of \"rights\" generally describes a limit on what the government can do to you, but it has been extended to cover non\\-governmental relations. It is \"legal\" to be a silly idiot, and it is also legal to refuse to hire a person who is a silly idiot. It is \"legal\" to be female, but it is *not* legal to refuse to hire a person who is female. This is because we have a set of complex civil rights laws that explicitly restrict relations between individuals, especially when business is involved. For various kind of actions, there are \"protected classes\" recognized by law, and in fact you have to look at the specific business relation and the corresponding protected classes (that is, there is no single law that defines the protected classes). \n\nAn employer in the US has complete liberty to impose conditions on employees, *except* those that contravene specific protected class regulations. I have the right to wear a pink shirt in public, but I do *not* have the right to wear a pink shirt at work, unless my employer allows it (or at least doesn't forbid it). \"Being a pink shirt wearer\" is not a protected class in the US. Even though being a smoker or drinker is legal, it is not a protected class. If it were, my employer could not prevent me from showing up drunk.\n\nAn employer has broadest liberty to restrict employee conduct on the job, so that you can't smoke at work (in fact, an employer usually does not have the option to allow it, since workplace smoking is broadly illegal). An employer also has a right to regulate employees off\\-the\\-job conduct to some extent, especially when it potentially affects their work. Drug use is the obvious case. Even if you don't shoot up heroin on the job, your habit will materially affect your ability to do your job, and employers have the legal right to prohibit such activities even off the job. Drinking and smoking have potential to be \"workplace relevant\" since those activities can affect your health, and given the legal connection of health care to employment, the employer has a legal interest in your health. There are untested margins on this right of employers, so we don't know if the courts would allow an employer to fire an employee for wearing a pink shirt off the job. There *are* legal restrictions on \"conduct unbecoming\" which allow an employee to be penalized (sacked) if they behave badly, in a manner that brings disrepute to the business.\n\nIt is unlikely that any jurisdiction would have a law that literally grants marijuana the \"same legal status\" as tobacco.

Even if marijuana becomes legal in a state, employers still retain broad rights to set workplace policies, including drug policies. They can prohibit marijuana use, both on and off the job, and test for it, similar to how they can restrict alcohol use.

Sometimes it comes in, sometimes it doesn't. I'll find a case setting forth the exact test if I have time.\n\nThe fact that evidence is \"irrefutable\" (not that there is any such thing) and widely publicly known is absolutely irrelevant.

The deal was that Bella would make the payments on the car and would keep the car after the loan was paid off.\n\nOf course the inevitable occurred and Bella stopped making payments. Bella also refuses to make the car available so it can be sold off to minimize Abe's losses. Thus the car will end up going into repossession and the cost of the repossession will be added to the loss column for Abe. Bella has terrible credit, so she has nothing to fear in that department.

For example, if the title of a YouTube Video was \"Avocado Sunrise\" could one use those words to create their own logo for their own video promotion to be \"Avocado Sunrise\" but look different? Would an additional word need to included to be more unique?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Avocado Sunrise\" is probably a distinctive mark, and could perhaps be used as a trademark. Short phrases such as \"Avocado Sunrise\" are not subject to copyright protection at all, and so we can ignore copyright here.\n\n(It should be noted that an existing logo, unlike a short phrase such as a title or slogan, will often be protected by copyright, and that using or imitating an existing logo will bring in copyright law. But the question does not suppose any such situation.)\n\nUse of the mark as the title of a YouTube video might or might not interfere with someone else using the mark, depending on the content of the video. If it was advertising the same or a similar sort of product or service that might count as a prior use in commerce, and interfere in a new claim for the mark.\n\nPlease understand that trademarks normally are only protected relative to a type of product or service. Firm A could use \"Avocado Sunrise\" as a trademark for a variety of orchids, say, and firm B use \"Avocado Sunrise\" for a fruit drink, and firm C for a hotel chain, and firm D for a cleaning service, all without infringing on each other.\n\nAlso trademarks are limited by market area. Firm E could use \"Avocado Sunrise\" for a fruit drink sold only in California, and firm F could use \"Avocado Sunrise\" for a similar drink sold only in Florida, with no infringement.\n\nAlso, trademarks are protected separately in different countries. A protected trademark in Canada, say, has no protection in the US unless it separately qualifies for US protection. As YouTube is international, one would need to determine what countries a video was affecting to see what trademark effect, if any it had.\n\nAlso, only use of a mark \"in trade\" or \"in commerce\" is relevant to trademark protection. Use of \"Avocado Sunrise\" as the title of a video showing images of the sun rising out of the ocean to music but not promoting or advertising any product or service, and not itself being sold or rented, would not be 'in trade' and would have no effect on any trademark.\n\nA mark that is similar but not the same may or may not infringe. If firm H had registered \"Avocado Sunrise\", could firm J use \"Avocado Tulip Sunrise\"? The test is whether reasonable consumers might falsely think there was a connection, might believe that Firm J's product came from Firm H or was endorsed or approved by firm H. If confusion is probable, the new mark is an infringement on the old one, otherwise not. This is a somewhat subjective test, of course.\n\nIn the US, simple use of a mark in commerce can confer a degree of protection. In many countries there is no protection at all unless a mark is formally registered with the government of that country. Even in the US, registration gets significantly increased protection.\n\nIf firm G used \"Avocado Sunrise\" as the title of a video which it sold, and promoted that with a YouTube video, say an extract, that would be a use of the mark in commerce. In that case, another firm could not market a different video under the name \"Avocado Sunrise\" to the same market without permission or a legal proceeding to establish that Firm G's mark was invalid.\n\nIn short the issue is a complex one, and use in a YouTube video might or might not be significant. It is often wise to consult a lawyer with trademark expertise before trying to establish trademark protection or to use a mark which someone else has used in a way that might possibly infringe. The exact rules in a particular case are fact dependent."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Sunrise Fruit Co. has been using the phrase \"Avocado Sunrise\" as the title of their popular YouTube cooking show for the past year, but they haven't registered it as a trademark.

[A good definition is](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/speculative_damages)\n\n> Possible financial loss or expenses claimed by a plaintiff that are contingent upon a future occurrence, purely conjectural, or highly improbable. These damages should not be awarded. For example, a plaintiff may claim that in ten years, as he ages, he may begin to feel pain from a healed fracture caused by a defendant (even though no doctor has testified this is likely to happen), and should therefore recover money from the defendant now.\n\nIn order to be awarded compensation, a plaintiff *must* prove that there is a high likelihood that the future event would occur. The required likelihood may be subjective, in part because it is hard to estimate the odds of many claims. In the situation given here, there is a 0\\.1% chance of a payoff. That is most likely far too low to be considered likely.\n\nNow, if the plaintiff argued for [compensatory damages](http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/actual_damages), then s/he might receive an amount of money equivalent to the price of one lottery ticket \\- or the same ticket back.

The plaintiff has not lost any chance to win the million dollars.\n\nBonus question: If you paid $500 or $2,000 dollars and wanted to be awarded compensatory damages, you might receive those sums of money.

The author gets $300,000 and then nothing else, even if the book sells five hundred million copies?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Books are published in several different formats. Traditionally the hardback edition came first, followed by the paperback edition some time later and probably from a different customer. Hardbacks sell at a premium, so you could charge more, and also get more money from impatient readers who couldn't bear to wait for the paperback.\n\nCheaper novels would go straight to paperback. There was also the \"trade paperback\" format, which meant the size of a hardback but with card covers rather than hardback. Now we also have electronic editions.\n\nTypically an author will cut a deal with a publisher for the rights to a book. Usually these are for a particular market (e.g. \"US hardback\") and will have various exclusivity and timing built in to them. The details depend on negotiations between publisher and author (or more usually the author's agent).\n\nThe rights sold to a publisher are a license to print copies under certain conditions. It is not (usually) the whole copyright. An author will want to sell different rights to different people, including movie rights and audiobook rights. Doing it this way gets more money for the author (and every author dreams of the big film deal).\n\nThe two big numbers are the advance and the royalties. For instance a book may be sold for a $10,000 advance and a royalty of $2/copy. The advance is paid to the author up\\-front and is not refundable; in our example if the book sells less than 5,000 copies then the publisher is out of money. Once the advance has been \"earned out\" in book sales then the author starts getting more money. So in our example the author gets $10,000 up front, and then on sale 5,001 the author gets an extra $2, and again for each copy sold after that.\n\n\"*Paperback rights sold for $300,000*\" probably means that the author has been paid a $300,000 advance for a book that is going straight to paperback.\n\nFor more information you might like to read [these essays](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/04/common-misconceptions-about-pu-1.html) by Charles Stross, who gives an author's\\-eye view of the whole publishing world."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author sells the paperback rights of their book for $300,000 with a royalty of $1 per copy.

An advance is paid up-front and is not refundable, even if the book doesn't sell well. Royalties only start to be paid once the advance has been \"earned out\" through book sales.\n\nIn this case, with a royalty of $1 per copy, the author would need to sell 300,000 copies to earn out the $300,000 advance. Since the book sold 500,000 copies, which is more than needed to earn out the advance, one might think the author would receive additional royalties. However, the question specifically asks about paperback rights being sold for $300,000, which implies this is a flat fee for those rights.\n\nTherefore, regardless of how many copies are sold, the author receives only the initial $300,000. This type of deal is sometimes made when a book goes straight to paperback.

Anybody got insight on this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The first step in the judicial process is arraignment. That's where the bail is set. You can plead guilty right there. Either you can get sentence then there or (for more serious crimes) there is a later hearing.\n\nIt's extremely rare to plead guilty at an arraignment. At that point you don't even know the evidence against you.

By their own admission they did not have a method to determine a fair sentence and their solution was to take an average of past sentences. I thought that such solution was too simplistic and I wondered whether there could be a better way.\n\nOne solution could be to study the outcome of past convictions. Someone could take some past cases where the convict has served the entire sentence at least x years ago, group these cases by type of crime, circumstances and the length of the sentence (maybe discretised) count the number of convictions in each group and calculate the percentage of repeated offenders. I guess that, barring some noise, it could be possible to fit a curve to these data that would see the number of repeated offenders inversely proportional to the length of the sentence. In many case a change in the slope of the curve could indicate point that would optimise the trade off between the length of the sentence and the number of repeated offenders.\n\nDid anybody ever make a similar study to determine what could be a fair sentence?

Nor, in view of the methods employed to stamp out the disease of smallpox, can anyone confidently assert that the means prescribed by the State to that end has no real or substantial relation to the protection of the public health and the public safety.\n\nThe above decision was over a vaccination law during a smallpox epidemic, and the background is described in [this \"History Stories\" article](https://www.history.com/news/smallpox-vaccine-supreme-court) and in [the Wikipedia article about the case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts)\n\nGovernments have the authority, in general, to pass laws (or impose regulations) that serve \"compelling governmental interests\" and are of general applicability. Such laws are valid even over most constitutional claims, depending on the claim and the detailed facts.\n\nProtecting the public health is a compelling governmental interest.\n\nSuch laws might have to (and normally do) provide exceptions for people with medical reasons why they cannot safely be vaccinated, or with sincere religious objections to vaccination. In such cases alternate measures of protection, such as frequent testing for infection, might be required.\n\nNote that existing public health laws generally require wearing shoes and shirts in restaurants, and require restaurants to refuse service to those who do not comply.\n\nIn [*Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur v.

This is supported by several Supreme Court decisions, most notably Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), which upheld the constitutionality of mandatory vaccination laws. The Court ruled that states have the authority to enact such laws under their police power to protect public health, even if it means some restriction on individual liberty. The Court emphasized that personal liberty is not absolute and can be subject to reasonable conditions for the common good.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the Constitution does not absolutely prohibit such measures. As evidenced by cases like Jacobson v. Massachusetts and others, the government can impose certain health measures that restrict individual liberty if they serve a compelling governmental interest like protecting public health.\n\nAnswer C is wrong because it misunderstands the scope of governmental authority. While private businesses can indeed set their own policies, government entities are not constitutionally barred from imposing health requirements.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the tenant's ability to terminate the lease based on misrepresentation?\n\nA) The tenant can immediately terminate the lease without penalty, as any verbal misrepresentation is grounds for lease termination in Colorado.\n\nB) The tenant cannot terminate the lease, as verbal representations are not considered part of the lease agreement unless explicitly included in writing.\n\nC) The tenant may be able to terminate the lease, but it depends on whether the lease contains a clause about noise levels or building construction, and if soundproofing can be considered an essential aspect of the agreement.\n\nD) The tenant can only terminate the lease if they can prove the landlord intentionally lied about the soundproofing, regardless of the lease terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it most accurately reflects the nuanced nature of misrepresentation in lease agreements.

Additionally, the wording of the lease itself is crucial. \n\nOption A is incorrect because not all verbal misrepresentations automatically allow for lease termination, especially if they're not considered essential to the agreement. \n\nOption B is too absolute; while it's true that verbal agreements are often difficult to enforce, they're not always entirely disregarded, particularly if they pertain to a major aspect of the living conditions.\n\nOption D introduces an element (proving intentional deception) that wasn't mentioned in the original information and isn't necessarily required for all cases of misrepresentation in lease agreements.\n\nOption C correctly captures the complexity of the situation, highlighting that the ability to terminate depends on both the lease terms and whether soundproofing can be considered an essential aspect of the agreement."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/23568/how-and-how-long-does-a-person-have-to-cure-or-true-a-misrepresentation", "docs_id": 23568, "title": "How and how long does a person have to cure or &quot;true&quot; a misrepresentation?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose a person writes a check that bounces because the account has \"insufficient funds.\" That would be a misrepresentation (of the person's bank balance).

Specifically whether it is \"features\" or \"code\" or something else that is usually copyrighted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Video game copyrights are really not significantly different from book or movie copyrights. One of the most basic principles of copyright is that one cannot copyright an idea only the words and images used to express an idea. The question quotes 17 USC 102(b) which is the US law establishing this distinction. A Similar plot point or device is not a copyright infringement. Such common tropes as \"budding romance obstructed by differing values\" is not protected by copyright. Neither, I would think is this device of auto\\-generated characters in a video game.\n\nOne cannot lawfully copy or closely imitate the actual words or images or sounds in someone else's protected work (without permission). That is the essence of copyright. (There are limited exceptions such as fair use / fair dealing.)\n\nWhat complicates this and confuses many is the concept of a *derivative work*. When a character or setting is described in significant detail, a detailed, point\\-by\\-point imitation of that setting may be enough to make the newer work \"based on\" the older work, and thus a derivative work. Unauthorized sequels are often held to be derivative works, for example, or unauthorized \"guest appearances\" in which a well\\-know or clearly established character from one work is used in another. If a modern detective goes into partnership with Sam Spade, say, or if Spiderman should be an important supporting character in a newly written novel. Similarly a new fantasy set in Tolkien's Middle\\-Earth or a new comic in Gotham City would probably be derivative.\n\nOne of the things protected by copyright is the right to create or authorize derivative works, and courts have held that use of a distinctive character an make a work derivative. But for this to apply the character must be distinctive and recognizable. A general type, such as a detective or superhero (or a large city) is not enough; there must be sufficient imitation to make it clearly the use of a character or setting from a copyrighted work, with a detailed, point\\-by\\-point similarity would be needed.\n\nA game feature such as this \"mercenaries\" concept would not make another work using it a derivative work, or at least I don't think it would. But ultimately such decisions are made by a court when and if a copyright holder sues an alleged infringer. Whether a work is derivative or not is a very fact\\-based decision, and so the exact specifics of the case may well matter.\n\nIf one is considering imitating some general feature of a previous work, it may be wise to consult a lawyer with IP expertise. I am confident that a major game developer or book publisher would have a staff lawyer to review such questions."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of video game copyright law, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Any game feature or mechanic, such as auto-generated characters, is protected by copyright and cannot be used by other developers without permission.\n\nB) Copyright protection extends to the specific code, artwork, and storyline of a game, but not to general concepts or gameplay mechanics.\n\nC) As long as the visual representation is different, any feature or system from one game can be legally copied by another game without concerns.\n\nD) Video game copyright laws are entirely different from those governing books or movies, with special provisions for interactive media.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Copyright in video games, like in other media, protects the specific expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. This means that while the exact code, artwork, and specific storylines are protected, general concepts, gameplay mechanics, or features (like auto-generated characters) are not copyrightable. The law distinguishes between the idea (which is not protected) and the expression of that idea (which is protected). This is why similar features can appear in different games without infringing copyright, as long as the specific implementation (code, visuals, etc.) is original.

However, the regulations allow for deductions from the refund amount if the customer has handled the goods excessively, beyond what would be necessary to establish their nature, characteristics, and functioning. Wearing the shoes outdoors for an hour after removing tags would likely be considered excessive handling.

It also does not protect anyone who personally participates in actionable negligent acts that cause harm. But, employees and officers of a company are not liable for negligence caused by the company simply because of their affiliation with the company, they have to personally participate in the wrongdoing in most cases (there are a handful of exceptions to that rule, but this isn't one of them).\n\n> Is there a legal way of protecting your company from such an attack\n>  without losing client trust? Not sure how this can be done as if you\n>  don't pay, you lose your clients, and if you attempt to pay, you go\n>  bankrupt.\n\nThe legal ways to protect the company are to include a waiver in the contract with the company, or to buy insurance that covers the risk.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure that there would be liability in any case. This is the intentional act of a third party and there is no good reason to believe that the ransomware company will comply if you pay them. In some jurisdictions and under some circumstances, it may even be illegal to pay a ransomware company.\n\nThe bigger concern from your company's perspective (which can also probably be waived) is whether the loss to the client was due to the company's negligence in taking measures to defend against ransomware in the first place before the infection happened. \n\nI know of a case, for example, where the IT provider said they were doing backups and virus protection, but didn't actually do any virus protection and only had one day old backups that were rewritten with the ransomware infected version before it was detected.

While LLP status provides some protection for individual partners, it does not shield the firm itself from liability. Partners who weren't personally negligent are generally protected.

With this particular gift card, one can send it off to the provider to 'redeem the balance', minus a fee. This allowed me to buy the cards and return them and get back more than I paid. (For example, suppose you get 20% off a \u00a3100 card, ie \u00a320 reduction, and the redemption fee is \u00a310\\.

It will be argued that by using the code, you agreed to those terms and conditions.\n\nThe second paragraph of their reply looks like an attempt to scare you, but it has legal merit. By using the unauthorised code you could be considered to have made false representation when you entered into the contract. This could render the contract void, and if they could demonstrate it had been done deliberately to gain money it could meet the threshold for fraud (which is what the police would possibly investigate : if it can be shown that you were aware the discount code didn't apply to you it would constitute making \"a false representation ... to make a gain for himself\" [\\[sub\\-paragraphs 1\\-5, paragraph 2 of the Fraud Act 2006]](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/35)).\n\nYou may be able to argue that the voucher websites misled you (though it sounds like you, I and the retailer already know that's not true), but since the retailer has offered to repay what you paid there are unlikely to be any damages \\- and, unless the voucher site took commission from your transaction, a contract between you and the voucher sites would be difficult (possibly impossible) to establish.\n\nIn the circumstances, returning what you originally paid is a good offer."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A customer uses an unauthorized corporate discount code found online to purchase gift cards from a retailer, intending to redeem them for profit.

These factors must be balanced.\n\nWhether you'll fulfil a data subject access request will generally follow the same criteria as deciding whether you'll reset someone's access credentials, so I'll mostly discuss identity verification in general.\n\nTrying to validate names is generally pointless from a security perspective, since the name on the account might not be real, or because validation documents like scans from a passport can be easily forged. When a service has identity validation measures like requesting a copy of photo ID, or requesting a photo of you holding up a validation code written on paper, that doesn't actually help validating that the person requesting access *is* the account owner, but that the person requesting access *appears* to be a natural person, and now documents about their identity are on file.\n\nA lot of information like names, birthdates, or addresses is also not at all secret and could be easily guessed by a malicious actor.\n\nMost websites work by equating access with control over an email account. If you can receive a password reset code over email, you have access. In effect, this delegates the responsibility of account recovery to the email or OAuth provider.\n\nSo the issue is what happens when someone loses their email account, which is not entirely uncommon for accounts that are multiple years old.\n\nOne reasonable (and likely GDPR\\-compliant solution) is to deny access when someone loses their account. Quite a lot of services operate this way.\n\nA milder form of this is to email the old address that someone is trying to take over the account, and turn over the account only if you have other evidence of ownership *and* there has been no reply over multiple weeks. Since this is part of an identity verification measure, I don't think the GDPR's normal 1 month deadline would apply. However, this approach is very risky: an attack can succeed through the mere *inaction* of the true account holder, and it would arguably be a data breach if you give access to the wrong person \u2013 safer for erasure requests only. Also, emails like \u201cclick here or we'll delete your account\u201d look a lot like spam (I get a lot of those about alleged problems with my Paypal account).\n\nA potentially more reasonable approach is to use questions about the account to verify ownership. When did they create the account? When did they last use it? Can they answer questions about non\\-public content of the account? (But don't let an attacker choose the questions!)\n\nYou see some older sites that ask the user to select a \u201csecurity question\u201d for recovery purposes. But this isn't a best practice \u2013 they are frequently the *weakest link* in an authentication system. If the user answers truthfully, the answer may be easy to guess or discover for an attacker. E.g. the infamous \u201cwhat is your mother's maiden name\u201d question is horrendously insecure in the age of Facebook. If the user provides a more secure answer, that is essentially just another password that's even easier to lose than an email account.\n\nHigh\\-value accounts typically offer a secondary authentication method as a fallback. E.g. my bank can send me new access codes via physical mail. GitHub can optionally link a Facebook account for recovery purposes. But these measures would be overkill for most cases. Especially collecting a physical address for the sole purpose of offering account recovery would likely violate the GDPR's data minimization principle, though it may be fine when the user opts in with freely given consent.\n\n**To summarize:** what you're trying to do is extremely difficult, because you've need to balance different security aspects: keeping malicious actors out, and letting legitimate account owners in. Whereas I'd resolve that by *denying* any account recovery or subject access requests, other approaches exists with other risk profiles. The GDPR requires you to perform reasonable identity verification measures, but what is reasonable depends on the business context and is ultimately an infosec question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner is struggling to balance GDPR compliance with account security and user verification. Which of the following approaches would be the most appropriate and compliant method for handling account recovery and data subject access requests?\n\nA) Collect and store extensive personal information like full name, birthdate, and address for all users to ensure thorough identity verification.\n\nB) Implement a system where users can select personalized security questions during account creation for future account recovery.\n\nC) Rely primarily on email-based verification, with additional measures like asking about non-public account details for cases where email access is lost.\n\nD) Automatically grant all erasure and data portability requests without any identity verification to ensure GDPR compliance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most balanced and compliant approach. Email-based verification is a standard practice that doesn't require storing excessive personal data, aligning with GDPR's data minimization principle. For cases where email access is lost, asking about non-public account details provides an additional layer of verification without compromising user privacy or security.\n\nOption A violates GDPR's data minimization principle by collecting more data than necessary. Option B, while once common, is now considered a security risk as answers to security questions can often be easily guessed or discovered.

Joe says nothing under questioning. At trial, Joe's defense is that at the time of the robbery, he was in Sheffield drinking beer with his brother.\n\nOn the basis of common sense, a jury could think: \"Surely if Joe were really innocent, he would have told the police of his alibi at the time he was questioned, and saved himself a lot of trouble. Since he didn't do that, maybe a more likely explanation is that he wasn't actually in Sheffield, but that sometime between arrest and trial, he came up with the idea of faking an alibi in Sheffield, and convinced people to testify falsely to that effect. Yes, that does seem more plausible. So we are not going to give much credence to Joe's supposed alibi.\"\n\nSo it really would be the case that not mentioning the alibi during questioning would harm Joe's defense at trial.\n\nThe warning, then, is intended to keep Joe from doing this *inadvertently*.

The swearing out of a complaint or rebutting evidence in all Federal civil matters (some states allow for the same) must contain an affidavit or an \"unsworn declaration\" that swears out the facts to be true and accurate, even though not notarized, and is based on fact and not supposition. It is subject to the same penalties of perjury if one lies as if you swear on a bible and testify in court or on a \"sworn\" affidavit. Affidavits need not be sworn before God, or on a bible. You have a right to just \"affirm\" that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth....and not \"so help me God\".

Isn't there a legal loophole that, after the forms are signed and filed, allows the co\\-authors to claim that they did not permit that one (corresponding) author to transfer the copyright?\n\nSo, from the point of view of thoroughly correct legal English, is the said Agreement as dubious as I perceive it, or did I miss something?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The contract is fine (or fine enough)\n-------------------------------------\n\nWhat you are overlooking is [agency law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency). The person who is signing the document is representing to the other party that they are authorized by the other authors to act as their agent. The other party is entitled, through agency law, to rely on that representation unless they have reasonable belief that the agent is not so authorized.\n\nFor example, when you buy your groceries, the cashier is an agent of the supermarket. You are allowed to assume that they have the right to sell the supermarket's product. If you couldn't do that you (and everyone else) would have to ask to see a letter signed by all of the directors of the supermarket giving that particular cashier such authorization. And you'd have to check the cashier's ID and make sure that the directors who signed were the current directors etc. This is clearly unworkable \\- hence agency law.\n\nIf the author who signs does not, in fact, have the authorization of the the other authors that's a problem between them \\- it does not invalidate the contract they signed."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-choice question based on the copyright transfer agreement information:\n\nQuestion: According to the explanation of agency law in relation to the copyright transfer agreement, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) Each co-author must individually sign the copyright transfer agreement for it to be legally binding.\n\nB) The signing author must provide written proof of authorization from all co-authors before signing on their behalf.\n\nC) The publisher is legally required to verify the signing author's authority with all co-authors before accepting the agreement.\n\nD) The signing author's representation of authority is generally sufficient for the publisher to rely on, unless there's reason to doubt it.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The answer is based on the principles of agency law described in the response. The key points are:\n\n1. The signing author acts as an agent for the other authors.\n2. The publisher can rely on the agent's representation of authority.\n3. This reliance is valid unless the publisher has reasonable belief to doubt the authority.\n4.

This approach solves multiple issues:\n\n1. It provides a legitimate UK-based registered office address, which is a legal requirement for UK companies.\n2. It ensures that company records are kept within the UK, addressing the concern about Companies House potentially objecting to records being stored outside the country.\n3.

However, by submitting the code to the instructor as part of the course requirements, the student has willingly provided a copy to the university. Copyright law gives the creator the exclusive right to make copies, but it doesn't allow them to control legally obtained copies. The university's storage of the submitted code doesn't infringe on the student's copyright. The student's status as a paid programmer is irrelevant unless their employment is directly related to the course work.

(If not in the US, it would need to make use if the comparable law in that country. Most nations now have more or less comparable laws, because the modified Berne Copyright treaty required some implementing law.)\n\nThis would mean that the provider of the app, which would be a form of information service, would need to accept and act on DMCA take\\-down notices. When a proper notice by a copyright holder or a holder's authorized agent was submitted, the service would have to investigate, and if it seemed likely that the content specified in the notice was infringing, remove it from the site or disable access to it. The provider would need to notify the user who had uploaded the content that it was being taken down. \n\nThere are many places on the web which describe in detail the process of receiving and responding to DMCA takedown notices. I will not go into detail here.\n\nWhile not strictly required, it would be advisable for the site's terms of service/terms of use to forbid using it to infringe copyrighted works, and to specify that accounts could be canceled for so doing. The site might further require users who upload works to state if the content is their own work, or if it is not, the source and why it is not a copyright infringement. \n\nYouTube's copyright procedures are an example of the sort of thing I am talking about. If a web site allowing user upload of potentially copyrighted content, such as music, follows this sort of procedure, it should be safe from suits for infringement based on content uploaded by users.
