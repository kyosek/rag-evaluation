So I pushed her out of my room, she then proceded to slap and punch me in the face 5\\-10 times which I haven't retaliated to, just kept telling her to stop and that I do no want to harm her. My question is: am I in the wrong for forcefully pushing her out of my room after telling her to leave, in the whole fight I have bruised her wrist by preventing her from bashing my head and also I have bruised her leg by phisically pushing her out of my room. I did not hit her, I only pushed her out. I only need advice based on the laws of Germany, thank you.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An act in [self defense](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html) is legal (StGB \u00a732\\): \"(1\\) Whoever commits an act in self\\-defence does not act unlawfully\". However, \"(2\\)'Self\\-defence' means any defensive action which is necessary to avert a present unlawful attack on oneself or another\" \u2013 removing a trespasser is not necessary to avert an unlawful attack. This does not apply to removing an annoying person. Under \u00a7223, physically assaulting a person is a punishable offense. Pushing a person is one form of assault (so is punching them or pummeling them, perhaps a more severe form depending on the physical damage done).\n\nHowever, the response is also criminal because it goes past that which is necessary to avert the assault (a push is not a license to commit mayhem). Under \u00a7\u00a733\\-35 there are defenses for excessive self\\-defense (\"Whoever exceeds the limits of self\\-defence due to confusion, fear or fright incurs no penalty\"), which don't seem applicable in this situation (rage is not the same as fright).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Germany, a person pushes their roommate out of their room after the roommate refuses to leave. The roommate then retaliates by slapping and punching the person multiple times. Which of the following statements is most accurate according to German law?\n\nA) The initial push is legally justified as self-defense, while the roommate's retaliation is unlawful.\n\nB) Both actions are unlawful, but the roommate's retaliation is considered a more severe offense.\n\nC) The initial push is unlawful, but the person could claim a defense of excessive self-defense due to confusion or fear.\n\nD) Both actions are unlawful, and neither party can claim self-defense for their actions.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to German law, the initial push to remove the roommate from the room is considered a form of assault (\u00a7223 StGB) and is not justified as self-defense, as it was not necessary to avert an unlawful attack (\u00a732 StGB). The roommate's retaliation with slapping and punching is also unlawful and exceeds any potential self-defense claim. The scenario doesn't indicate confusion, fear, or fright that would allow for an excessive self-defense claim (\u00a7\u00a733-35 StGB). Therefore, both actions are unlawful, and neither party can legitimately claim self-defense for their actions in this situation."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Title pretty much says it all, my friend had a kid with a girl at 16 (she was 19\\), and recently, she up and left him. She's still in the state, and their ages are 17 \\& 20 respectively now. Looking through state laws regarding how custody works, I can find no mention of dealing with minors, so my question is if minors do have rights to children they had, to begin with.\n\nThe primary law I'm looking at to try and help is NH RSA 461\\-A:6, some pertinent text from the law is as follows:\n\n> I. In determining parental rights and responsibilities, the court shall be guided by the best interests of the child, and shall consider the following factors:\n>  (a) The relationship of the child with each parent and the ability of each parent to provide the child with nurture, love, affection, and guidance.\n>  (b) The ability of each parent to assure that the child receives adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and a safe environment.\n>  (c) The child's developmental needs and the ability of each parent to meet them, both in the present and in the future.\n>  (d) The quality of the child's adjustment to the child's school and community and the potential effect of any change.\n>  (e) The ability and disposition of each parent to foster a positive relationship and frequent and continuing physical, written, and telephonic contact with the other parent, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.\n>  (f) The support of each parent for the child's contact with the other parent as shown by allowing and promoting such contact, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.\n>  (g) The support of each parent for the child's relationship with the other parent, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.\n>  (h) The relationship of the child with any other person who may significantly affect the child.\n>  (i) The ability of the parents to communicate, cooperate with each other, and make joint decisions concerning the children, including whether contact is likely to result in harm to the child or to a parent.\n>  (j) Any evidence of abuse, as defined in RSA 173\\-B:1, I or RSA 169\\-C:3, II, and the impact of the abuse on the child and on the relationship between the child and the abusing parent.\n>  (k) If a parent is incarcerated, the reason for and the length of the incarceration, and any unique issues that arise as a result of incarceration.\n>  (l) The policy of the state regarding the determination of parental rights and responsibilities described in RSA 461\\-A:2\\.\n>  (m) Any other additional factors the court deems relevant.\n\nI have been unable to find in this law or others how the situation is dealt with if one of the parents is a minor, but my friend mentioned that they had been court ordered for mediation, so I would assume they at least treat a minor somewhat like a non\\-minor in this circumstance. Any further information would be much appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The applicable state law is [here](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xliii/461-a/461-a-mrg.htm). Section 461\\-A:2 guides the interpretation of the chapter:\n\n> I. Because children do best when both parents have a stable and\n>  meaningful involvement in their lives, it is the policy of this state,\n>  unless it is clearly shown that in a particular case it is detrimental\n>  to a child, to:\n> \n> \n> (a) Support frequent and continuing contact between each child and\n>  both parents.\n> \n> \n> (b) Encourage parents to share in the rights and responsibilities of\n>  raising their children after the parents have separated or divorced.\n> \n> \n> (c) Encourage parents to develop their own parenting plan with the\n>  assistance of legal and mediation professionals, unless there is\n>  evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or neglect.\n> \n> \n> (d) Grant parents and courts the widest discretion in developing a\n>  parenting plan.\n> \n> \n> (e) Consider both the best interests of the child in light of the\n>  factors listed in RSA 461\\-A:6 and the safety of the parties in\n>  developing a parenting plan.\n> \n> \n> II. This chapter shall be construed so as to promote the policy stated\n>  in this section.\n\nThe law gets no more specific than to refer to the fact of being a parent. The law does not favor males over females, or vice versa, and the law does not discriminate between a parent who is a minor versus a parent who is a legal adult. The rights of parents are equal, *ab initio*. However, the recognition of the rights of a father does depend on the legal establishment of paternity whereas the law takes maternity to be self\\-evident. This may have been dealt with at birth, or may require a [legal process](https://law.justia.com/codes/new-hampshire/2015/title-liii/chapter-522/section-522-1) if paternity is contested. If that part is sorted out, then disagreements about custody etc. which can't be worked out through agreement possibly with a mediator can be resolved in court. The court will determine what constitutes the \"best interests of the child\".\n\nThat is all there is to it, legally. That does not mean that a judge making a decision is absolutely immune from thinking that the minor father is less able take care of the child. [Starting next year](https://legiscan.com/NH/text/HB574/2019), a minor can seek emancipation, but until then (and until there is emancipation), the minor's parent have veto power over the father's wishes.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding his rights and the custody determination process?\n\nA) The father has no custody rights because he is a minor and cannot legally make decisions for the child.\n\nB) The court will automatically grant full custody to the mother because she is a legal adult.\n\nC) The court will consider the best interests of the child using the factors outlined in NH RSA 461-A:6, regardless of the father's age.\n\nD) The father must wait until he turns 18 to pursue any custody rights.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The New Hampshire law does not discriminate between minor and adult parents when it comes to custody determinations. The court will consider the best interests of the child using the factors outlined in NH RSA 461-A:6, which include the child's relationship with each parent, the ability of each parent to provide for the child's needs, and other relevant factors. The father's age may be considered as part of the overall assessment, but it does not automatically disqualify him from seeking custody. The law aims to support frequent and continuing contact between the child and both parents, unless it is clearly shown to be detrimental to the child. While the minor father's parents may have some influence over his decisions until he is emancipated, this does not negate his right to seek custody or visitation."

According to the information provided, if a shop doesn't participate in the VAT refund scheme, the tourist cannot claim a VAT refund. The shop is the only entity that can refund the VAT, as they are the ones who collected it. Even if the tourist has the receipt and is willing to do the paperwork themselves, they cannot claim the refund if the shop doesn't support it. Options A, B, and D are incorrect because they suggest alternative methods of claiming the refund, which are not possible in this scenario. The VAT refund process is dependent on the retailer's participation in the scheme, and there's no workaround for purchases made from non-participating shops."

In addition to a bunch of static pages, this website will also host a reservation system which is provided by a 3rd party software company in the form of a single page application. You just have to include their javascript snippet that builds up the whole system/website. Then it's basically a **self\\-contained website**, including a footer etc.\n\nThey're using all kinds of technologies that a user would like to be informed about in a privacy policy (Google Analytics, Google Fonts, Social media plugins). The problem is: They're not providing a privacy policy on their own and the support argues that it's the responsibility of the web developer to author this privacy policy themselves.\n\nQuestion: Given that the 3rd party basically provides a **whole website** (including header and footer) aren't they obliged to deliver a privacy policy too?\n\nQuestion: Who would be liable in case the privacy policy is incomplete in respect to the technologies used on the 3rd party software?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unless there's a data processing agreement between the hotel and the third party, both would likely be joint controllers. I.e. the hotel is fully co\\-responsible for any data processing that happens due to any embeds. If there were an Art 28 data processing agreement, the hotel would be fully responsible as well, but would have the primary responsibility for ensuring compliance \u2013 if the third party is a data processor, they don't have to publish their own privacy policy.\n\nThis view is supported by the ECJ C\\-40/17 \u201cFacebook Like\\-Button\u201d case. A fashion retailer included the FB like button on the web page. The court found that the retailer was not a controller of subsequent processing by Facebook (here, Facebook is its own controller). However, the two parties are joint controllers for collecting and transmitting the personal data on the page.\\[1] While the ruling was made under the previous Data Protection Directive, it is entirely transferable to the GDPR. In your scenario the on\\-page processing is even more substantial.\n\n\\[1]: Which means that the website needs a legal basis for sharing data with the embed provider. For like buttons, the typical legal basis is *consent*, and loading the social plug\\-in is deferred until the visitor consents. This is more tricky for a reservation system because service may not be conditional on consent per Art 7(4\\).\n\nThe definition of a data controller is the party \u201cwhich, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data\u201d. The hotel is clearly a controller here because it decides purposes and means. Using the third party embed is a means for the purpose of making reservations. The hotel has a responsibility to ensure that the purposes and means are in compliance with the GDPR.\n\nIt seems like the third party the hotels wants to use is not prepared to act in a GDPR\\-compliant manner, or to enable its customers to achieve GDPR compliance. Another reservation system should be used, or a the hotel should set a link to the reservation system's own web page, to make it clear that they are not responsible.",

The hotel determines the purposes and means of data processing by choosing to implement this system, while the third-party provides the actual processing mechanisms. Both parties share responsibility for GDPR compliance unless there's a specific Article 28 data processing agreement in place. Even with such an agreement, the hotel would still bear primary responsibility for ensuring compliance. The correct approach would be for both parties to collaborate on ensuring GDPR compliance, including providing a comprehensive privacy policy that covers all data processing activities occurring through the reservation system."

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 USC 1030) makes it illegal to access a protected computer without authorization and cause damage, regardless of the computer's location. The definition of a \"protected computer\" effectively includes any computer connected to the Internet worldwide. Colorado state law (C.R.S. 18-5.5-102) also prohibits unauthorized access to or damage of any computer system, without exceptions for foreign targets. The motivation to support Ukraine does not provide any legal exemption under either federal or state law. Therefore, hacking Russian military infrastructure would be illegal under both jurisdictions, making option C the most accurate statement."

An affected individual wants to sue the VEC for damages. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal options available?\n\nA) The individual can sue the VEC for monetary damages under the Virginia Tort Claims Act, as this is a clear case of negligence by state employees.\n\nB) The individual can file a federal lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for monetary damages, as this is a violation of due process rights.\n\nC) The individual cannot sue for damages but can appeal their specific case to a higher court and potentially seek injunctive relief to compel the VEC to correctly interpret the law.\n\nD) The individual can sue the VEC for damages in state court, as sovereign immunity does not apply when a state agency violates its own governing statute.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The Virginia Tort Claims Act specifically excludes claims arising from administrative proceedings, which would include VEC decisions. Additionally, there's no viable claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for money damages unless a federal constitutional right is violated in a non-judicial manner, which isn't clearly the case here. The individual cannot sue the VEC for damages in state court due to sovereign immunity. However, the individual can appeal their specific case to a higher court for review. Furthermore, they could potentially seek injunctive or declaratory relief to compel the VEC (or its officials) to correctly interpret and apply the law in future cases. This approach doesn't provide monetary damages but aims to correct the misinterpretation of the law going forward."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Lets say you're sitting in a fast\\-food parking lot eating the food you just purchased from the establishment. Your windows are rolled up and the vehicle is turned off. A police officer pulls into the lot and stops behind your car and turns on his spot light to view the license plate and also block your view with the light. He exits the vehicle, walks up to your window and starts demanding ID. You show the ID without rolling down the window. He starts ordering you to exit the vehicle. He gives the reason of \"someone called about suspicious vehicle\" or says that you are a \"suspicious person\" but you are not doing anything illegal, you are positive he did not observe you drive the vehicle at any point, and you are eating food with packing, labeling and logo from the location you are parked at. \n\nAre you legally obligated to exit the vehicle upon request? If so, please state the law/statue that gives him standing. \n\nIf not, please explain how a U.S. citizen needs to articulate this fact to let the officer know you are not exiting because you are not legally obligated. \n\nHere is a recent video showing a similar situation: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=JYmpDa1MBdA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYmpDa1MBdA)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Police are authorized by statutes to carry out the functions of law enforcement. I.e., they are granted by law the authority to:\n\n* Investigate alleged or apparent crimes\n* Detain and arrest individuals when there exists \"probable cause\" to believe they have committed a crime.\n\nThere are a plethora of details encompassed by these general descriptions. For related inquiries see also:\n\n* [How can you tell if you have to follow a police officer's instructions?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/360/10)\n* [search\\-and\\-seizure](/questions/tagged/search-and-seizure \"show questions tagged 'search-and-seizure'\")\n\nIn the specific example you cite you are in a public place, albeit on private property. If the property owner asked the police to leave they would have to meet a higher statutory threshold to legally remain and pursue their investigation. In practice, however, they may do whatever they want.\n\nPublicized incidents suggest that the best chance you have of ensuring your rights are protected in a police confrontation are to:\n\n1. Have the incident recorded in audio and video in as detailed a fashion as possible, and seen by as many witnesses as possible.\n2. Avoid actions that could escalate the incident or serve as a pretext for escalation by the police.\n3. Try to get higher\\-ranking police on the scene.\n\nE.g., if you can safely access your phone you may want to both start video recording and call 911 to ask the dispatcher to send the officer's superior to the scene, while making it clear to the dispatcher that you intend to comply with all lawful requests but that you feel threatened or unsafe.",

The best approach is to balance cooperation with protecting your rights. This includes considering the officer's request while also taking precautionary measures such as recording the interaction, clearly stating your intention to comply with lawful requests, and contacting dispatch to request a superior officer if you feel unsafe. This approach aligns with the advice to avoid actions that could escalate the incident while also ensuring that your rights are protected through documentation and witnesses."

In [Goodridge v. Department of Public Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodridge_v._Department_of_Public_Health) the court decided that the Constitution provided for equal protection and due process and that if the state wished to discriminate against people on the basis of sex they needed a good reason. The reasons the state put forward were:\n\n> 1. providing a 'favorable setting for procreation';\n> 2. ensuring the optimal setting for child rearing, which the department defines as 'a two\\-parent family with one parent of each sex'; and\n> 3. preserving scarce State and private financial resources.\n\nOn 1\\. the court said marriage is irrelevant for procreation and vice\\-versa. On 2\\. they said Massachusetts law on child welfare dealt with the \"best interests of the child\" and that it is not in those interests for the state to deprive the child of benefits because it doesn't like the sexual orientation of the parents. On 3\\. they said equal protection means equal protection.\n\nIn a common law legal system like Massachusetts where courts have the power to strike down legislation then that takes effect as soon as the decision is published. The law ceases to exist without the legislature or the executive doing anything.\n\nNow, the people of Massachusetts are free to amend their constitution to outlaw same\\-sex marriage or remove equal protection rights if they want. However, at the time and subsequently, the majority don't want.",

While the duty to mitigate damages is an important principle in contract and tort law, courts also recognize that parties may have legitimate reasons for being unable to mitigate. The existence of conflicting contractual obligations presents such a reason. However, courts are unlikely to simply allow unlimited damages without consideration of mitigation. Instead, they would likely carefully examine the specific circumstances, including the nature and reasonableness of the contractual obligations preventing mitigation, the extent of the damages, and the overall equities of the situation. This balanced approach aligns with general principles of fairness and the court's role in resolving complex legal conflicts."

Since California law does not allow tape recording without all parties consent, so HR said that there was no evidence to support. I have medical record to prove that my depression pill was assigned by doctor and keep taking since I was in that company\n\nMy feeling: I was bullied and kept my mouth close because of the job, I believed that I was under performance also because of them.

However, you could still consult a lawyer with the details of the case and see what they say.\n\nI would say that your obstacles are:\n\n* Proving that the bullying happened\n* Proving that it was significant and not just occasional/mild\n* Proving that it caused the depression\n* Proving that you were fired because of the depression\n\nIf you could overcome all of these, I think you could argue that you were discriminated against due to your mental problem, which might fall under the ADA and related law. But it seems to me like it would be a hard argument to make. It's only realistic if you have been visiting a psychologist who has been treating you for depression over the bullying, and/or if you have the bullying in writing or on record (the latter part is doubtful since in CA it's illegal to record people without consent). Otherwise I don't see how you could convince the court. But once again, don't take my word for it \\- consult a lawyer (and make sure to prepare your evidence beforehand and bring it, because they will definitely ask you).\n\n> Restriction: I have no money, can lawyer get paid if they win?\n\nYes. But consider why lawyers take on cases without pay.\n\n* You are very likely to win and be awarded damages from which the lawyer can get his own pay. (your case doesn't sound very strong)\n* The lawyer would get a lot of prestige from winning the case and attract many more clients, which is more valuable than the fee. (yours doesn't sound like this, but who knows)\n* They want to help people who are suffering from gross injustice due to poverty. (your situation sounds unjust, but not that bad)\n\nSo you are not likely to find a lawyer interested in doing this without pay. If you really think you have a good case, you could borrow money and pay a lawyer \\- but obviously you shouldn't do that unless you know what you're doing. In any case, go look up employment law lawyers in your area that do free consultations, and go talk to them.

Your running software as a whole clearly includes other's components, so you have no right to dedicate the copyright to the running software as a whole into the public domain. In contrast, you're the copyright holder for all the code that you wrote yourself, and can therefore dedicate its copyright into the public domain.\n\nYou mention that your software relies on other components, but I don't think they would be a problem here.\n\n* You are referencing Express, but you are arguably not creating a derived work from Express. If it is not a derived work, then the Express license is irrelevant. It would clearly be a derived work if you were to modify the Express software, or if you incorporate snippets of the Express code into your software. However, this can be argued differently as well, that by using the Express APIs in your code you are copying copyrightable aspects.\n* If the MIT license of Express would matter, it wouldn't be a problem since the MIT license does not impose any restrictions other than keeping the copyright and license notice of the original intact. The MIT license does not enforce that the components written by you use any particular license, or that they shall be covered by copyright at all.\n* The Typescript compiler is not part of your software. Your software is just data to the Typescript compiler. It is common to compile public\\-domain software with copyright\\-covered compilers, for example when compiling the public\\-domain SQLite database with the GPL\\-licensed GCC compiler.\n* If Apache license of the Typescript compiler were to apply, it would have generally similar consequences as the MIT license, though Apache\\-2\\.0 has more complex notice requirements.\n\nA note on NPM licenses: the metadata is not always fully correct. More importantly, the license metadata only relates to a particular package, not to the entire dependency tree. You must comply with the licenses of all your dependencies, even if they are just indirect dependencies. Similarly, if you were to upload your public domain code to NPM, this wouldn't imply that your Express dependency would now be public domain as well.\n\nIn summary, you probably can dedicate your own code into the public domain, if your jurisdiction recognizes this act. The CC0 instrument might be worth looking at, as it includes a public domain dedication (where possible), and an ultra\\-permissive fallback license if a public domain dedication is not possible. However, public domain dedications are not recommended for software since they only indicate the absence of copyright restrictions, but do not indicate a right to use the software. In particular, others might not be able to legally use the software if you hold relevant patents.",

Tom replied with \"Looks good, thanks.\" Two months later, there was a dispute about the terms of their agreement. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The typed notes and email exchange make the verbal agreement legally binding, whereas it wouldn't have been binding otherwise.\n\nB) The typed notes and email exchange have no legal relevance, as only a formal written contract would be considered in court.\n\nC) The verbal agreement is likely legally binding on its own, but the typed notes and email exchange provide strong evidence of the agreed terms.\n\nD) The typed notes create a new written contract that supersedes the verbal agreement, making only the written version legally enforceable.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As stated in the documentation, oral contracts are usually entirely legally binding (with some exceptions like land sales). The verbal agreement between Sarah and Tom would likely be considered legally binding on its own. However, the typed notes Sarah made immediately after the conversation and sent to Tom, along with Tom's acknowledgment, serve as strong contemporaneous evidence of what was agreed upon. This documentation doesn't make the agreement more legally binding, but it provides valuable evidence that a court would likely consider if the dispute went to litigation. It makes the terms of the agreement much harder for either party to challenge later, as it represents a near-immediate record of what was discussed and agreed upon."

The correct response (D) reflects that the legality of leaving work isn't straightforward and depends on multiple factors. These include how long the workplace has been without water, the employer's efforts to address the issue, the impact on work activities, and whether alternative water sources are accessible nearby. Simply leaving work due to a water outage might not be automatically justified, and the circumstances would need to be considered if any legal action were to be taken. Options A, B, and C present overly simplified or incorrect interpretations of the law and the situation."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ownership and rights to the laptop?\n\nA) The laptop legally belongs to Sarah's parents until they complete all payments, so they have the right to keep it if Sarah moves out.\n\nB) Sarah owns the laptop outright as it was a gift, regardless of the ongoing payments her parents are making.\n\nC) Sarah owns the laptop, but her continued possession is contingent on her parents continuing to make the monthly payments.\n\nD) The retailer owns the laptop until all payments are made, so neither Sarah nor her parents have full ownership rights.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario is most similar to the second example provided in the documentation. The gift Sarah received was not the full ownership of the laptop, but rather the initial payment (deposit) and the promise of continued monthly payments. Sarah owns the laptop in the sense that it was gifted to her, but her continued possession depends on the ongoing payments.

Still, I showed the card at the ticket booth for a local museum, the [K20 museum for contemporary art](https://www.duesseldorf-tourismus.de/en/attractions/k20-grabbeplatz-d47daf5d55), not knowing that the card was only valid in the 8 countries the trial is active in and thus wasn't yet in use in Germany. I assumed that given that it was a European project, it would be accepted as proof of disability, and I would get the 10 EUR discount ticket for disabled people instead of the full 12 EUR ticket for adults. The cashier apparently didn't know what to do with the card and waived my ticket price entirely.\n\nThe question I have: is what I did considered a crime, like fraud or theft? or should I just not worry about this?

You can't have committed fraud because you didn't have the *intent* of entering the museum without paying.\n\nFraud is defined in section 263 StGB:\n\n> (1\\) Whoever, **with the intention of obtaining an unlawful pecuniary benefit** for themselves or a third party, damages the assets of another **by causing or maintaining an error under false pretences or distorting or suppressing true facts** \\[\u2026]\n\nYou had no intention of obtaining an unlawful benefit.

They can waive them whenever they want, for whatever reason they want. The museum could have given you the discounted price even without suitable evidence of your disability. Instead, they waived the fee entirely.\n* If anyone is going to have problems here, it is the person at the ticket counter for failing to collect the appropriate fees.

According to German law, both fraud (Section 263 StGB) and obtaining benefits by deception (Section 265a StGB) require intent, which was absent in this case. The visitor genuinely presented their EU Disability Card, believing it might be valid. The cashier's decision to waive the fee was made independently, without any misrepresentation from the visitor. Furthermore, the museum has the discretion to waive fees as they see fit. Therefore, the visitor has not committed any crime due to the lack of intent to deceive or defraud."

(Mothers were allowed to pass on citizenship after 2009, but that was after Begum was born.) Note that registration at a Bangladeshi consulate within 1 year of birth is only necessary in the case where the father is a Bangladeshi citizen by descent. I believe Begum's father was a Bangladeshi citizen otherwise by descent, in which case no registration or other action is necessary for her to be a Bangladeshi citizen at birth. It doesn't matter that she has never been to Bangladesh nor does it matter that she never claimed to be a Bangladeshi citizen.\n\nThere were two men of Bangladeshi descent in a separate case who successfully fought their revocation of British citizenship, but the difference between their cases and Begum's case was that they were over 21, which she was under 21 at the time of revocation. Section 14 of Bangladeshi's Citizenship Act provides that someone with dual citizenship automatically loses Bangladeshi citizenship if they don't renounce their other citizenship, but this provision doesn't apply to those under 21\\. So these two men had Bangladeshi citizenship too, while they were under 21, but they lost it when they turned 21, before their supposed revocation of British citizenship, whereas for Begum, she hadn't lost Bangladeshi citizenship at the time of the revocation of her British citizenship, because she hadn't turned 21\\.\n\n(Perhaps you got the idea of \"claiming\" of citizenship from some report that one can \"claim\" Bangladeshi citizenship by descent while under 21, and these men failed to claim it, but Begum can still \"claim\" it. But if you read the text of the law, that is clearly not the case. For a child born to a father who was a Bangladeshi citizen otherwise than by descent, there is no \"claim\" of citizenship \\-\\- it is automatic and involuntary at birth.)\n\nAs to your question, there are no universal restrictions to how a country can grant or take away citizenship. There is the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, which countries may voluntarily join, but only a minority of countries of the world are party to the convention. Article 8 of the [Convention](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/6_1_1961.pdf) does prohibit countries that are party to the Convention from depriving someone's citizenship if it would \"render him stateless\", though there are several exceptions including if the citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation. The language seems to require that the person already have another citizenship, not just have the ability to acquire one, though I am not sure how much leeway countries have to interpret this.\n\nIn the case of the UK, it is a party to the Convention, and it has largely implemented the provisions of the Convention in its domestic law. With respect to deprivation of citizenship, [section 40](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1981/61/section/40) subsection (4\\) of the British Nationality Act 1981 prohibits a deprivation order if the Secretary \"is satisfied that the order would make a person stateless.\" (Subsection (4A) has a looser restriction where British citizens by naturalization can be deprived of citizenship if the Secretary believes that the person is able to become the national of another country. I am not sure whether this is compatible with the Convention. In any case, this is not relevant to Begum's case as she was not a British citizen by naturalization.) So if the UK were to try to deprive citizenship of a British citizen otherwise than by naturalization like Begum, not on the basis that the person already has another citizenship but on the basis that they are \"eligible\" to \"claim\" one (which as I described above I do not believe is the case for Begum; I am talking hypothetically if such a case were to arise), that can already be challenged as a violation of British law, in British courts, without considering the UK's obligations under the Convention.\n\nIf it's another country that's a party to the Convention, but their law expressly allows deprivation of citizenship for being \"eligible\" to acquire another citizenship even though the person doesn't have one (including, perhaps, British citizens by naturalization deprived citizenship under section 40(4A)), and a person in that situation is deprived of citizenship, they don't really have any recourse. A private party cannot \"sue\" a country over any violations of the Convention in an international court.",

The 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness generally prohibits countries that are party to it from depriving someone of citizenship if it would render them stateless. However, there are exceptions to this rule, including cases where citizenship was obtained through fraud or misrepresentation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the Convention does not allow revocation simply based on eligibility for another citizenship. \n\nOption B is too absolute, as the Convention does allow some exceptions. \n\nOption D is not supported by the Convention's language, which seems to require that the person already have another citizenship, not just the ability to acquire one.\n\nIt's important to note that not all countries are party to this Convention, and private individuals cannot directly sue countries for violations in international courts."

Some say it's compulsory, some say that prisoners *are* able to side\\-step the autopsy afterwards, which leaves me more questions than answers.\n\nWould this be something that they'd be allowed by choice or something that their lawyers could do for them or is it ultimately going to be overruled as a legal requirement for all executed prisoners?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [Florida law](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0900-0999/0922/0922.html) (\u00a7922\\.11\\) does provide that\n\n> The body of the executed person shall be delivered to the medical\n> examiner for an autopsy. After completion of the autopsy, the body\n> shall be prepared for burial and, if requested, released to relatives\n> of the deceased. If a coffin has not been provided by relatives, the\n> body shall be delivered in a plain coffin. If the body is not claimed\n> by relatives, it shall be given to physicians who have requested it\n> for dissection or to be disposed of in the same manner as are bodies\n> of prisoners dying in the state prison.\n\nTennessee, on the other hand, [is reported](https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/breakingnews/story/2020/feb/13/no-autopsies-tennessee-electrocutions/515629/) to have honored requests to not autopsy and autopsied only 1 of 6 executed prisoners. The Tennessee law ([38\\-7\\-106](https://www.tn.gov/health/health-program-areas/oscme/tca-postmortem-examination-act.html)) says that\n\n> A county medical examiner may perform or order an autopsy on the body\n> of any person in a case involving a homicide, suspected homicide, a\n> suicide, a violent, unnatural or suspicious death, an unexpected\n> apparent natural death in an adult, sudden unexpected infant and child\n> deaths, deaths believed to represent a threat to public health or\n> safety, and executed prisoners. When the county medical examiner\n> decides to order an autopsy, the county medical examiner shall notify\n> the district attorney general and the chief medical examiner. The\n> chief medical examiner or the district attorney general may order an\n> autopsy in such cases on the body of a person in the absence of the\n> county medical examiner or if the county medical examiner has not\n> ordered an autopsy. The district attorney general may order an autopsy\n> in such cases on the body of a person in the absence of the county\n> medical examiner or the failure of the county medical examiner to act.\n> The authority ordering the autopsy shall notify the next of kin about\n> the impending autopsy if the next of kin is known or reasonably\n> ascertainable. The sheriff or other law enforcement agency of the\n> jurisdiction shall serve process containing such notice and return\n> such process within twenty\\-four (24\\) hours.\n\nThe medical examiner has discretion (autopsy is not an obligation). [Louisiana law](https://law.justia.com/codes/louisiana/2014/code-revisedstatutes/title-13/rs-13-5713/) is a little unclear at the statutory level, because\n\n> The coroner shall either view the body or make an investigation into\n> the cause and manner of death in all cases involving the following...\n> (2\\) Sudden or violent deaths...(9\\) Deaths due to drowning, hanging,\n> burns, electrocution, gunshot wounds, stabs or cutting, lightning,\n> starvation, radiation, exposure, alcoholism, addiction, tetanus,\n> strangulation, suffocation, or smothering... (12\\) Deaths in prison or\n> while serving a sentence.\n\nThe coroner can discharge that obligation by non\\-invasive means. Lousiana has a religious\\-objection provision:\n\n> If the family of the deceased objects to an autopsy on religious\n> grounds, the autopsy shall not be performed unless the coroner finds\n> that the facts surrounding the death require that an autopsy be\n> performed in the interest of the public safety, public health, or\n> public welfare. In such cases the coroner shall provide the family his\n> written reasons for the necessity of the autopsy.\n\nIt's hard to see how there could be a public interest reason compelling an autopsy in the case of a governmental execution, but this is fiction.\n\nSome states have a law providing for religious exceptions to autopsy. You can [make a request](https://www.sccgov.org/sites/coroner/death-investigation/ReligiousobjectiontoAutopsy/Pages/home.aspx) in S. Carolina, and [here is the law](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/government-code/gov-sect-27491-43.html) in California (moot for the moment since there are no executions in California).\n\nYou could try \"forum shopping\" (changing the state so that you don't get a mandatory autopsy law), but a search of all 50 states is really impractical.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality and practicality of this arrangement?\n\nA) The arrangement is illegal because it involves sharing tax information with a private company.\n\nB) The arrangement is legal, but the IRS can assist the company in verifying and collecting the payments.\n\nC) The arrangement is legal, but the company would face challenges in verifying student incomes without employer cooperation.\n\nD) The arrangement is legal only if the IRS explicitly approves the payment model.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The arrangement itself is legal, as parties can generally make any payment arrangements they agree to. However, the company would face significant challenges in verifying student incomes and tax payments. The IRS cannot disclose an individual's tax information to third parties without explicit authorization, and even then, such disclosures are highly restricted. The company would likely need to rely on students voluntarily providing tax return copies or cooperating with their employers to verify income and calculate payments. Option A is incorrect because the arrangement itself is not illegal. Option B is wrong because the IRS cannot assist private companies in collecting such payments or verifying incomes. Option D is incorrect because IRS approval is not required for private payment arrangements between consenting parties."

So he encourages Rob to plead not guilty by saying they have good chances to win.\n\nWhat would be the best way for Rob to detect that, if any possible?\n\nAre there any working protections in place that would secure Rob from going on trial with unscrupulous lawyers like that? Or can they always get away with it?\n\n(Any jurisdiction)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Such an action by the lawyer is certainly unethical, but there is no automatic or routine mechanism to detect it and give better advice to Rob, at least not in the US. Rob could get a second opinion, but criminal defendants do not often do this, and there is no requirement to do so.\n\nIf the situation is extreme, it might be reported, after the fact, and the lawyer sanctioned. But no one is ever required to do a plea bargain, and there is always a chance, even if only a very small one, that a jury will acquit. Whether to try for a trial is a judgement call. That makes it hard to deal with the unethical intention, which the lawyer presumably did not tell anyone about.\n\nRob's only practical protection is to pick a lawyer with a good reputation for not doing that sort of thing, and reputations can be misleading. If Rob does not have money he may not be able to choose at all, but then the lawyer will not be tempted to go to trial to \"suck money out of\" Rob, because there will be none to suck.

The answer acknowledges that unethical behavior by lawyers regarding plea advice is possible, but it's difficult to detect or prevent due to several factors:\n\n1. The decision to go to trial or accept a plea bargain involves judgment calls and isn't purely objective.\n2. There's always at least a small chance of acquittal in a trial, making it hard to prove definitively that going to trial was against a client's interests.\n3. There are no automatic mechanisms to detect unethical advice about pleas.\n4. The attorney-client relationship and privilege make it challenging to scrutinize lawyers' advice.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lawyers are not legally required to always recommend a plea bargain, even with strong evidence against their client. The decision depends on various factors and the client's wishes.\n\nOption B is incorrect because the documentation explicitly states that there are no automatic or routine mechanisms to detect such unethical behavior.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation emphasizes that the decision to go to trial is a judgment call and not purely objective, making it difficult to easily evaluate for ethical breaches."

I would add a button to it that will be labeled as something like \"Details on this seizure\" or something, and clicking it will display an alert box saying \"APRIL FOOLS\" and redirecting back to the real website homepage.\n\nI also figured out that just for the sake of being sure, the page would visibly include a disclaimer stating that that page isn't real and was only installed for the purpose of a one time April Fools joke and does not intend to misinterprets it as a real domain seizure, and that the artwork is licensed under Public Domain as an official U.S. government agency artwork.\n\nAm I still in trouble if I go with that route? Is it too overboard?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I can't comment on what the legal situation would be in your home country, but as a matter of U.S. law, the hypothetical scenario you've described is not illegal.\n\nFirst, because you aren't a U.S. citizen and because you aren't operating in the United States, the U.S. government probably has no jurisdiction over you, your website, or your conduct.\n\nEven if it did, the most relevant statute, [18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1017](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1017), would not apply. The statute prohibits the \"fraudulent or wrongful\" use of the FBI's seal. But \"fraudulent\" and \"wrongful\" generally refer only to conduct where one uses deception or other means to obtain money, property, etc. to which they have no lawful entitlement. [*United States v. Enmons*, 410 U.S. 396, 399 (1973\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-enmons).\n\nBecause you aren't using the seal to obtain anyone's property through deception, this use would not fall within the statute's proscriptions.\n\nEven if the government sought to prosecute you, you would have a valid First Amendment defense. The First Amendment protects the right to free speech, and it does not allow statements to be criminalized merely because they are false. [*United States v. Alvarez*, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-alvarez).\n\nThis outcome should be unsurprising to most U.S. observers. I think most people would agree that the U.S. obviously cannot prosecute a Hollywood producer for making a movie dramatizing the FBI's efforts to shut down the Pirate Bay, even if it displayed the FBI's seizure message on a monitor in the course of the movie, and even if it showed the seal being used on a completely fictional website.\n\nThe hypothetical you're describing is not materially different. In both cases, the seal is being used to falsely create the impression \\-\\- for entertainment purposes \\-\\- that the FBI has shut down a website. Saying false things for entertainment purposes is not a crime in the United States.",

According to the information provided, using an FBI domain seizure page for an April Fools' joke on a non-U.S. website is likely legal for several reasons:\n\n1. Lack of U.S. jurisdiction: The website is not operated in the U.S. and the owner is not a U.S. citizen, so U.S. law may not apply.\n\n2. No fraudulent intent: The use is not intended to obtain money or property through deception, which is what laws like 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 1017 aim to prevent.\n\n3. First Amendment protection: In the U.S., false statements made for entertainment purposes are generally protected by free speech rights.\n\n4. Similar to fictional portrayals: This use is comparable to showing FBI seals in movies or TV shows, which is not considered illegal.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the legality depends on the context and intent. Option B is incorrect because while a disclaimer may help, it's not the determining factor for legality. Option D is incorrect because explicit FBI permission is not required for this type of use."

Were juries used in Old Testament, Greek, Roman, or Inquisition trials?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The modern jury trial in common law countries (i.e. those with legal systems based upon those of English law) derives from [12th century English practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juries_in_England_and_Wales) as it evolved over time in England, and is frozen in time to some extent in U.S. practice, by the nature of the jury trial as an institution at the time that it became a constitutional right in the United States in 1789\\. The English jury system emerged in the 12th century in the wake of the Norman conquest of 1066 CE, and codified Norman customary law, particularly among its soldiers in courts\\-martial and had some resemblance to modern courts\\-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for the United States military such as the notion that you could be judge's only by your peers in rank or your superiors, although it subsequently evolved in English civil practice.\n\n(England also developed in parallel non\\-jury courts of equity as a division of the tax collection department in England, a set of courts that were merged with courts of law in most places in the U.S. in the 19th century, the remains a distinctive source of U.S. jurisprudence in matters which are decided solely by judges. This short summary also ignores features like the coroners' juries and grand juries of English derived practice.)\n\nThe civil jury is now almost extinct in England itself, and in most common law countries other than the U.S., except for a handful of kinds of cases (e.g. defamation, civil fraud, false imprisonment, and eminent domain cases), and in serious criminal cases. Other cases in England are now handled in the first instance by a single judge at the trial court level in most cases. Outside the common law countries, first instance trials in serious cases are usually conducted by a panel of three or five judges, with a lead judge presiding over the conduct of the matter.\n\nMost jury\\-like systems outside of common law countries are limited to serious criminal matters, and often involve a hybrid of judges and specially selected citizens with exceptional (\"blue ribbon\") qualifications who deliberate together with the judges. These systems were mostly adopted after World War II in imitation of U.S. and English practice, but some as early as the 15th century in Europe.\n\nThe Continental European practices described in an answer by @Geremia, and likewise Greek direct democracy based trial and Sumerian trials come from a tradition that was abandoned no later than the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe as civil codes on the model of the French and German civil codes were adopted, and often much earlier. These practices are not ancestral to the current practice of jury trials in modern legal systems.\n\nJuries were not described as a means of adjudication in the Bible. \n\nIn the ancient democratic Greek city\\-states, some city\\-states had direct democracy of landed males citizens and those citizens met collectively in town meeting style to address both legislative and judicial matters. The governance practice of Caribbean pirates, or some isolated bands and tribes, of small early New England Puritan communities, and of small revolutionary military units, have some similarities to this kind of practice, all of which were small communities organized on a principle of direct democracy and which arose more or less independently of each other.\n\nMostly, in the Roman Empire, judges or regulated private arbitrators resolved the matters that were vested in civil and criminal juries today in places that still have them. Some serious matters [at times in Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial#Rome) were decided by quasi\\-juries in a Greek town meeting like format with hundreds of jurors in a stadium or amphitheater. But this was never a routine means by which justice was metted out.\n\nInquisitorial trials were a subset of canon law, and canon law is generally carried out by deputized clergy, in a process that was more written than oral, and in that involved active investigation by the judges rather than passive consideration of adversary presented evidence (giving rise to the modern inquisitorial judicial systems common in Continental Europe, Latin America, and much of Asia (where Maoist or Islamic legal systems are not primarily influences).\n\nIn Medieval Times, the predominant practice was for decisions to be made by the ranking local feudal lord, or his delegate, and the role of the delegate of a feudal lord is directly ancestral to that of the common law legal system's judges, which is one of the reasons that common law judges have powers such as contempt of court, and immunities from liability not available to judges elsewhere.\n\nSelect institutions in the Holy Roman Empire and what is now Germany in the 15th to 19th centuries appear to have been devised in imitation of the English jury system.",

The copyright symbol \u00a9 is mainly used in copyright notices, not when simply mentioning copyrighted works. Trademark symbols (\u2122, \u00ae, \u2120) are used to indicate that a name is a protected trademark, but their use is not legally required. These symbols are often employed by trademark owners to put others on notice, or by writers to acknowledge the protected status of a name. However, neither copyright nor trademark symbols are legally mandatory in most writing contexts. Their use may be guided by style preferences or specific publication requirements rather than legal obligations."

If an app doesn't come with any sort of agreement, does anyone who possesses a copy have the right to use it? Can they do whatever they want with it?\n\nI'm talking about these sorts of things and don't really get their point. The first sentence after 1\\. is about granting the user the license as long as they follow the agreement, but why is it necessary to have a license at all? If you find a disk on the street, put it in your computer and run a program off it that doesn't have a license, are you breaking the law for using a program without license? \n\n[![software license agreement](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xG9rb.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xG9rb.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Everybody needs a license to use software. A license is permission to make copies, and under copyright law, you can only make copies with permission of the rights holder. You cannot use software on a computer without making a number of copies (most of which are made semi\\-automatically by the computer).\n\nIf you own a copy of the software, you are allowed to do anything with that copy (not make other copies, but otherwise, whatever you want). This is the so\\-called first sale doctrine. However, it is very rare (perhaps nonexistent) that anybody \"buys a copy of the software\", in fact it is not at all clear what that would mean. When you buy a disk that installs software, you are buying two things: (1\\) a physical disk, and (2\\) a license to use the program in a specified way. Without the license, you only have a disk which can be used as an expensive coaster.\n\nFound disks are not an escape hatch that circumvents copyright protection. Suppose you buy a copy of Word, then installed it; then toss the original disk. Someone finds the disk, installs it, and tosses the disk. Ad infinitum: 1 legal and paid copy multiplies into thousands of free copies.\n\nIf you have an installation disk for e.g. MS Word which does not have a license (look for the license file), and somehow (somehow) suppressed the code that shows you the \"you must agree\" box, then you have an illegal copy of Word. If you have software that is supposed to be distributed under some do\\-anything license (e.g. CC\\-0\\) and there is no actual license on the disk (or similar means of distributing a license along with the software), they you don't know what you have. If you can locate the author, they may say \"I put the license file on my web page, I guess the other guy didn't include the file, but as you can see, everybody has permission to use it, and you don't even have to include the license\". In other words, there *is* permission, you just didn't know it. The same author might have even thought \"If I put the software out there for all to download and don't restrict access, then I've licensed it\". Or, the original author licensed the software as long as it is used non\\-commercially. \n\nThe problem is that the honest user cannot distinguish between pirated software and sloppily\\-distributed software, where the original author or the re\\-distributor has failed to include explicit permission to use. This is why software does and should have an explicit license, so that you know what you can legally do with the software.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software developer creates a free program and posts it online for anyone to download, but forgets to include a license file with the software. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal use of this software?\n\nA) Users can freely use, modify, and distribute the software without any restrictions since no license was provided.\n\nB) The software is in the public domain and can be used for any purpose, including commercial use.\n\nC) Users cannot legally use the software at all, as they don't have explicit permission from the copyright holder.\n\nD) Users may be able to use the software, but the extent of their rights is unclear without an explicit license, potentially leading to legal ambiguity.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate response. Without an explicit license, the legal status of the software use is ambiguous. While the developer's intent may have been to allow free use, copyright law automatically protects created works, and users need permission to copy and use software. The absence of a license doesn't automatically place the software in the public domain (ruling out B), nor does it grant unrestricted use (ruling out A). At the same time, the developer's act of posting it publicly implies some level of permission, so completely prohibiting use (as in C) may be too extreme. The situation creates legal uncertainty, highlighting the importance of clear licensing for both developers and users."

I was standing outside of my apartment next door. I do have a key for that building and stated that I did but when he asked me to use it, I refused stating that I am not supposed to. He stated that I could be cited for refusing to assist him. He said he was there to talk to a sex offender. I did not ask if he had a warrant and he did not say he had one. I left after providing the contact info for the building's landlord.\n\nAfter some googling I found that it is a crime to not assist an officer but it seems to be limited to when that officer is making an arrest:\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refusing\\_to\\_assist\\_a\\_police\\_officer\\#Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refusing_to_assist_a_police_officer#Colorado)\n\n* Country: United States\n* State: Colorado\n* City: Denver\n\nMy Question: since the officer did not state he was making an arrest and did not provide a warrant, was I legally required to assist him in opening the door?\n\nSide Note: the officer was nocking on several people's windows and even tried to jimmy the lock with one of his keys. I also looked at the sex offender registry afterwards and did not find anyone in that building or near by. He also asked for my name and apartment number and wrote them down. The situation seemed shady.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This all depends upon where you are. I am a landlord and I am answering based upon the laws of the U.S. and the states that I operate in.\n\nFirst things first. You are not the property owner. While this does not limit the answer, it is a factor. You do not have the right to the property even if you have a key and the permission of the tenant. You are not the property owner, do not represent the property owner nor the tenant, and by contract do not have legal rights to the apartment. It does put you in a different situation.\n\nAs a landlord, it is against the law for me to provide access to a tenants apartment to anyone without authorization. This, of course, precludes emergencies such as welfare checks. In the case of the police, a warrant is required or a form that the police fill out that allows the police to gain access. This would be used in cases such as when a spouse requires the recovery of personal property during a domestic dispute. A judges order is not always possible in these cases. These are often limited cases and the form absolves the landlord of liability even in cases where the police act incorrectly.\n\nSo without a warrant or a form that certifies any lawful request, anyone including the landlord can be arrested for a crime.\n\nFor your situation, a quick call to the landlord would have been appropriate. Without a warrant or certification, the police still had options including waiting for the person in question to either leave or return to the apartment or even request a warrant by phone. Often, the warrant, once signed by the judge, can be read over the phone. Any landlord should always have a paper copy provided within minutes since some cruisers will have a printer and can print the warrant.\n\nYour refusal appears to be legal. However, in the future, you can ask for a copy of the warrant that you provide the landlord.\n\nI do not wish to paint a negative image of the police who do the hard work that most people will never take on, they are after all heros, however, some do not know the law perfectly well especially tenant landlord law. As well, some will try and get away with skirting the law trying to get an important job done. It does happen. I hired a lawyer just last week for an illegal request unrelated to the question here.\n\nAddressing the OPs comment:\n\n> Hello, I believe I misstated the situation a bit in that the locked\n>  door in question was for the apartment building and not a tenet's\n>  apartment itself. I have edited my question. Does this change\n>  anything?\n\nTechnically, this does not change much of anything, however, the request by the police can be seen as a reasonable one. They just may want to talk to the individual which is reasonable. In this case, I might have let them in if the access I was giving them was to a common space such as a hallway. In this case, the outer door locks are only to keep Intruders from entering the building and not meant to restrict access for valid purposes.\n\nAre you in trouble? I would say no. If anyone asks, you can give reasonable arguments for your situation. However, the next time, consider what I have written here. The police have a tough enough time doing their jobs. If you can help and stay within the proper boundaries of what the law allows, that would be best.",

Since the officer did not state he was making an arrest and did not provide a warrant, the neighbor was not legally obligated to assist in opening the door. Option A is incorrect as the obligation to assist is not universal. Option B overstates the protection, as there are some situations where assistance is required. Option D, while potentially a reasonable action, is not legally required in this situation. Option C most accurately reflects the legal standing based on Colorado law and the given circumstances."

For example, if a face resembling the creepy little girl's face from **Game\\#1** is featured in various screens on the app? What if a generic looking little girl is used? I guess I'm asking broadly speaking how far can I go and which particular things would be illegal. Cheers\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> I assume this is perfectly fine if I don't use imagery or artistic inspiration from the show?\n\nYou are correct. The idea of an elimination context is an old one, going back at least to the late Roman Republic. In can case ideas, methods and procedures are never protected by copyright.\n\n> \\[What] if a face resembling the creepy little girl's face from Game\\#1 is featured in various screens on the app?\n\nThat image is almost surely protected by copyright. Any use of it without permission from the copyright owner (whoever that might be, quite possibly the production company for the show) would be unlawful, specifically copyright infringement, unless an exception to copyright applies.\n\nIn the US that would be ***fair use***, which is a highly fact\\-driven determination. But it this case it seems unlikely that fair use would apply if you are in the US. See [Is this copyright infringement? Is it fair use? What if I don't make any money off it?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) for more on fair use\n\nThe exceptions to copyright in non\\-US law are generally narrower and more specific than fair use, and it is rather less likely that any such exception would apply. (see [What is the practical difference between \"fair use\" and \"fair dealing\" in Copyright law?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48359/what-is-the-practical-difference-between-fair-use-and-fair-dealing-in-copyri) for more on this.) In short you may not lawfully use that image without permission from the copyright holder.\n\nIn addition, the person whose face is shown in the image may well have \"personality rights\" or \"rights of publicity\" separate from any copyright, depending on your jurisdiction (such rights are recognized differently in different places, and some jurisdictions do not recognize them at all.) She could possibly sue if her image was used without her permission.\n\nIf a game developer creates a more generic image, not directly based on any image from the show, or gets someone else to create such an image and buys or is given the copyright or a license to use the image, there should be no legal issue with regard to any image copyright.\n\nTrademark issues\n----------------\n\nIn addition to copyright issues, there could be trademark issues here.\n\nIf you use the actual name of the show \"Squid Game\", that might seem to be trading off the reputation of the show, and implying that your game is authorized or sponsored or endorsed by the show's creators. That might well be trademark infringement, unless you get permission from the trademark owner.\n\nHowever, what is a protected trademark is specific to a country. What is protected in one country is often not protected in another. Only a relative few very popular products are protected in every country.\n\nIn addition \"Squid Game\" is a rather descriptive, generic name. In the US, and in other countries with similar laws, it would probably receive only limited protection. Still it is safer to use a different and unique name.\n\nA different name, such as perhaps \"Squid Battle\" which does not invite confusion with the TV show or imply endorsement by the show's creators is less likely to result in a trademark suit.\n\nAny images or logos used to identify the show could also cause trademark claims if copied or imitated.\n\nNote that in the US one can claim protection for a trademark in actual use, even if it has never been registered. In some other countries only registered marks are legally protected.",

That is clear from the fact that the party seeking to rely on the strict legal position must be the same party that is required to provide reasonable notice, as the passage suggests. Strict legal position cannot mean promissory estoppel and is used to distinguish the (equitable) estoppel position. The requirement of court action is obviously a good practical point, should the promisee deny any obligation to revert to the strict position. \u201cProbably\u201d is appropriate because, of course, it may be that the promisee does consent to reverting to the strict position, but given that it is likely to perceive that it has an agreement with the promisor as to the amended payment or other obligation (whatever the subject of the promise), in practical terms it is often unwilling to do so. High Trees supports this point (and, tellingly, it is High Trees, not Tool Metal, cited in support). But the passage makes clear that court action is not *necessary* as a matter of law and that reasonable notice will suffice.",

Furthermore, upon receiving the request, would any third parties with which the screening company shares the data also be obliged to purge it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Intro\n=====\n\nI assume that the background screening you are referring to is made in connection with applying for a job. If so, it would generally be the applicant's (prospect) employer that is primarily responsible for the processing of the personal data in relation to the applicant. The employer outsources the background screening to a service provider, which in GDPR terms is considered a controller\\-processor relationship (the service provider processes personal data about the applicant on behalf of the employer/the controller). \n\nThe same principles generally apply irrespective of whether the data is collected prior to or during the screening. However, depending on the content of such data, different safeguarding requirements may apply.\n\nConsent possibly not reliable\n=============================\n\nThe employer must identify legal grounds for processing the data that a background screening collects (see [Article 6 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)). It could be argued whether consent is valid ground for background screening considering the imbalance between the parties. In many jurisdictions within the EU, consent in an employment context has generally been very difficult to rely on. If consent could not be relied on, the employer would typically have to argue for that there is a legitimate interest to process the data. (See also [Article 88 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-88-gdpr/).)\n\nStorage time\n============\n\nA general principle in GDPR is storage limitation ([Article 5(1\\)(e)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/)). It means that a controller (or a processor) may not store personal data for a longer period than necessary. Hence, once the background screening is completed, the employer is not likely allowed to store the data for a longer period than is necessary for completion of the recruitment process. The background screening company should likely not have any use of the data after having provided the background screening report to the employer. The employer may however argue that the information must be stored for some time to be able to manage the recruitment.\n\nDeletion upon request\n=====================\n\nThe applicant has no absolute right to request a deletion of data (which is a common misunderstanding of GDPR). The \"right to be forgotten\" is a bit different depending on the context of the processing (see [Article 17 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/)):\n\n* If the processing is based on **consent**, the applicant may request a deletion, which in general must be complied with, but the employer might find other grounds for keeping the data.\n* If the processing is based on **legitimate interest**, the applicant may request a deletion, and the employer will have to re\\-assess its grounds for keeping the data. If the grounds are still valid, the employer is not obliged to remove the data.\n\nSharing with third parties\n==========================\n\nYour question touches upon the issue of parties with which the screening company would share the screening information. Except for with the employer (which has a direct relationship with the applicant), it should be noted that there is very little room in GDPR for the screening company (or the employer) to share the data with any other party, unless the applicant has explicitly consented thereto. Such a third party would then likely be a controller in itself, and the third party would then have a direct responsibility and liability towards the applicant. It would then likely be possible to withdraw the consent, which triggers an obligation to purge the data.\n\nThird party deletion\n====================\n\nIf the employer is obliged to purge the data (e.g. if consent is withdrawn or there is no remaining legal ground for continuing the processing/storing of data), the background screening service provider should also delete the data. Although also the service provider is bound by GDPR, some responsibility falls upon the employer to stipulate the conditions for such deletion in a contract between the parties (see [Article 28(3\\)(e) GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/)).\n\nConcluding remarks\n==================\n\nThis area is a bit tricky and disputed, see for instance [here](https://www.sterlingtalentsolutions.com/blog/2018/04/gdpr-impact-background-screening-program/), [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pre-employment-background-screening-under-gdpr-frivaldszky-dr-llm-/) and [here](http://www.scesolicitors.co.uk/news/background-screening-and-gdpr#.Wz3V19UzaUk). A good advice is therefore to review the privacy notices that the employer must provide along with any request to provide information for a background check. \n\nIt could also be worth mentioning that a background screening company is generally prohibited from dealing with data relating to criminal convictions and offences ([Article 10 GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-10-gdpr/)), which to my experience is quite common.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Under GDPR, when a background screening for employment is completed, what are the data subject's rights regarding the deletion of their personal data?\n\nA) The data subject has an absolute right to demand immediate deletion of all personal data from both the employer and the screening company.\n\nB) The data subject can request deletion, but the employer may keep the data if they can demonstrate a legitimate interest in retaining it.\n\nC) The data subject has no right to request deletion of data collected during a background check.\n\nD) The data subject can only request deletion if they initially provided consent for the background check.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation, the data subject (applicant) does not have an absolute right to demand deletion of their personal data after a background check. If the processing is based on legitimate interest, the applicant may request deletion, but the employer can reassess its grounds for keeping the data. If the employer still has valid reasons, they are not obliged to remove the data. The right to deletion depends on the legal basis for processing and is not automatic or absolute. Additionally, while consent-based processing generally requires compliance with deletion requests, the employer might find other grounds for retaining the data even in such cases."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Many companies list \"positive attitude\" as a requirement for the candidates, including job positions that have nothing to do with customer service or management (for which jobs it could be reasonably justified).\n\nHowever, some people have major depression or an anxiety disorder that makes it impossible to maintain a positive attitude due to the mere nature of the illness. Would it violate the Americans With Disabilities Act or any other law to discriminate against such a person for their failure to maintain a positive attitude, **given that the disability doesn't prevent the employee from doing their job**? (I have to emphasize this part, as many answers simply ignore it).\n\nPositive attitude, from the top definition in Google:\n\"In general, having a positive attitude means being optimistic about situations, interactions, and yourself.\"\n\nA few things that I have to clarify due to common misconceptions:\n\n* having major depression isn't same thing as \"being grumpy\", as some people here suggested. Both major depression and anxiety disorders are among the most severe mental disorders and often result in a disability to some extent.\n* not having having positive attitude doesn't necessarily mean having negative attitude; there is the third case in this false dichotomy \\- maintaining the neutral point of view\n* even when someone's attitude is negative (i.e. pessimistic), that doesn't mean that they tend to be quarrelsome or unable to get along well with their coworkers\n* about 3\\-4% of people in the U.S. have had more than one major depressive episode in their lives, but with proper treatment the illness can be successfully managed in some 60\\-70% cases (don't think of curing it completely, though. usually it's more like treating type 1 diabetes with insulin, or the ability to move around using crutches for a person with limited mobility), or at least well enough to be employed.\n* the point above proves that there are at least 5 million people in the U.S. who have major depression (and even more who have anxiety disorders), but are able to get their job done without having \"positive attitude\".\n* answers that imply that the candidate can't perform the job or doesn't have a disability are irrelevant, as ADA does require both.\n* summing all this up: I think that the requirement for \"positive attitude\" is simply a pretext for discrimination.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Almost certainly not. See, e.g., [Lopez\\-Mendez v. Lexmark Intern., Inc., 680 F.Supp.2d 357, 375 (D.P.R. 2010\\)](https://www.casemine.com/judgement/us/5914b0eaadd7b04934755e02)\n\n> \"This incident, however, is not sufficient to constitute direct evidence of discriminatory animus...**\\[Defendant's agent]'s anecdote could be interpreted as emphasizing the importance of a positive attitude, rather than plaintiff's interpretation that it expressed a preference for younger male employees...This benign interpretation** seems more plausible...In light of these facts, there does not appear to be any evidence on the record that gives a 'high degree of assurance' that discriminatory animus was behind the decision to terminate plaintiff\" (emphasis added).\n\n**NOTE**: OP's original question was simply whether listing 'positive attitude' on a job description was illegal. OP has now changed the question to whether making employment decisions based on a depressed individual's lack of a positive attitude is illegal. Although I have great sympathy for those with mental illness and personally wish the law were different, my answer is still that this is almost certainly legal.\n\nAnother example of a court finding attitude to be a legitimate reason upon which to base employment decisions is: Martin v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., 126 F.Supp.2d 809 (M.D. Pa 2000\\). In this case, the court accepted as a legitimate reason for promoting one individual over another that the promoted individual \"demonstrated good interpersonal skills.\" *Id*. at 817\\.\n\nA third example is Lloyd v. Swifty Transp., Inc., 552 F.3d 594 (7th Cir. 2009\\). In this case, the Seventh Circuit explicitly noted that \"\\[t]he employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and we will not second\\-guess that decision.\" *Id*. at 601\\. It then went on to affirm dismissal of the plaintiff's ADA claim because the employer \"said that lead drivers must have knowledge of the mechanics of the trucks and **be able to manage the other drivers on the truck through a positive attitude and ability to get along well with others. But the supervisors in charge of hiring lead drivers testified without contradiction that \\[the plaintiff] had a negative attitude that drew complaints from other drivers**.\" *Id*. at 601\\-602 (emphasis added).\n\nAfter a relatively exhaustive search, I've found no case to counter these pretty clear statements that basing employment decisions on 'attitude' is legal.\n\n**FURTHER NOTE**: OP has now modified the question again to add the qualification that the lack of a positive attitude \"doesn't prevent the employee from doing their job.\" IF this were actually true, then the answer likely becomes that illegal discrimination has occurred because then the employee would be 'otherwise qualified' (a key phrase in employment law litigation). BUT, there is an inherent contradiction in premises in OP's question now because if X is a requirement of a job, and Y employee cannot do X because of Z, then Z is preventing Y employee from doing that job. In other words, if a job requires a positive attitude, then one can't do that job without a positive attitude. Ultimately, what OP's question is really trying to get at is 'what if the employer makes 'positive attitude' a job requirement, but I don't think it should be a job requirement?' Unfortunately, there's almost certainly no legal recourse for this *as long as it's a legal job requirement* because, to reiterate the 7th Circuit, \"\\[t]he employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and \\[a court] will not second\\-guess that decision.\" *Id*. at 601\\.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company lists \"positive attitude\" as a job requirement for a backend developer position. An applicant with diagnosed major depression, who can perform all technical aspects of the job but struggles to maintain an optimistic outlook due to their condition, is rejected solely based on their perceived lack of a positive attitude. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this decision under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?\n\nA) The company's decision is clearly illegal under the ADA, as the applicant's depression is a protected disability that doesn't impact their ability to perform the core technical functions of the job.\n\nB) The company's decision is likely legal, as courts have consistently upheld an employer's right to determine essential job functions, which can include attitude requirements.\n\nC) The company's decision is illegal only if they failed to engage in an interactive process to determine reasonable accommodations for the applicant's depression.\n\nD) The company's decision is legal only if they can prove that a positive attitude is objectively necessary for successful performance in this specific role.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the provided legal precedents, courts have generally sided with employers in cases involving attitude requirements, even when disability is a factor. The Seventh Circuit in Lloyd v. Swifty Transp., Inc. stated that \"The employer, not a court, determines what functions are essential, and we will not second-guess that decision.\" Additionally, other cases like Lopez-Mendez v. Lexmark Intern., Inc. have interpreted emphasis on positive attitude as a legitimate job requirement rather than discrimination. While the situation may seem unfair, current legal interpretations suggest that the company's decision would likely be considered legal, as long as \"positive attitude\" is genuinely considered an essential function of the job by the employer."

So, simply incorrectly stating your future income is not fraud.\n\nBut, you are affirming when you make such a statement that you presently sincerely believe that you will have a future income of approximately the amount stated. And, if you make a statement about your future income when you do not actually believe that you will have that future income, then you have still committed fraud.\n\nIn practice, there are lots of gray areas where a judge or jury considering the case would have to weigh the facts and your credibility.\n\nIf you represented that you predicted that you would have an income of $1,000,000 in the next year, when you had never done so before and didn't even have any plausible plan other than playing the lottery for doing so, this would almost surely be credit card application fraud.\n\nOn the other hand, if you represented that you predicted that you would have an income of $50,000 in the next year, when your income in past years had ranged from $30,000 to $45,000 from self\\-employment, and you believed sincerely that improvements in your marketing efforts and current economic trends were going to make the coming year your best year ever for income from self\\-employment that would give you a $50,000 income in the coming year, that would not be fraud.\n\nWhere exactly the line between not fraud and fraud is drawn would be for the tier of fact to decide when and if the case went to trial.",

A few permanent residents don't have passports, maybe because they don't need to travel abroad, or they are stateless or fear their country of nationality or otherwise unable to get a passport from their country of nationality in which case they may travel with a Re\\-entry Permit or Refugee Travel Document. Either way is fine as far as the US is concerned.\n\nThe US doesn't actually require that permanent residents have a passport to enter the US; but practically no airline will board you on an international flight without a passport or equivalent travel document (except maybe to Canada).\n\nThe only situation in which getting a foreign passport is potentially problematic is if you are an asylee, in which case getting a passport from your country of nationality can be viewed as availing yourself of that country's protection again, so you don't really need asylum anymore.

Converting these legally created CDs to MP3s afterwards does not circumvent DRM, as CDs cannot contain copy protection that interferes with legal use.\n\nC is incorrect because Apple Music does not provide a direct MP3 download option that would allow retention after subscription expiration.\n\nD is incorrect because DRM-protected files from Apple Music are designed to become inaccessible once the subscription expires.\n\nThe key is that burning to CD and then converting to MP3 is a legal \"workaround\" within the terms of service, while direct DRM removal is not permitted."

There are lots of videos online of people being stopped in their cars and then going on for 30 minutes to \"plead the fifth\" while the cop asks the same question over and over again. For example, in the U.S., the key words seem to be \"am I detained, am I free to go\"; and by the way they are *always* used exactly like this, I assume they are not just randomly used, but with some kind of precedent.\n\nQuestion: What kind of information is a police officer in Germany allowed to ask, in random situations on the street, e.g., during a traffic check? Presumably name and address, and whatever is on the Personalausweis? Is there a particular (verbatim) sentence that can be used in German if you do not wish to answer a question, without making yourself suspicious?\n\nAs a very concrete example: I was stopped in a generic traffic check once, late at night, in a very peaceful area where *nothing* ever happens, and was asked where I just came from. I truthfully answered \"from the gym\" or something like that and that was it. At the time, it seemed simply like small talk; they were friendly, I was friendly, they had a look at my documents, and we were done with it. But it certainly *was* the kind of situation those U.S. videos seem to be about; i.e. I *could* pretty easily have been forced into a situation where I had to lie or implicate myself, without even knowing.\n\nI know that there are political groups with very strong opinions in Germany who will tell us to not utter a single word to an officer, but would prefer to know what the judicative has to say on this. Are there well\\-known precedent cases? Are there official formulations which are recognizable to an officer to mean \"I am aware of my rights, and would prefer not to make an issue of this, but don't want to keel over right away\"? Or is this more of a cat\\-and\\-mouse game, usually?

From the sound of it, this means that you would be able to represent this person \"pro se\" or through other means.\n\nIs this true? Or is it a case where \"power of attorney\" doesn't confer the right to act as a lawyer for someone who is incompetent, even though it sounds like it does (to a layman).\n\nAre there at least some forums, such as small claims court, where the \"power of attorney\" gives you the right to act as someone's \"lawyer?\"\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For most civil matters the answer is \"no\". Small claims court is special since there are restrictions on using attorneys, and in that context, it depends on the rules. In [Indiana](http://www.in.gov/judiciary/files/small-claims-manual.pdf), the answer in their manual is no\n\n> [Small Claims Rule 8](http://www.in.gov/judiciary/rules/small_claims/#_Toc414969481) allows a person to appear at trial and, if he or\n>  she chooses, represent himself or herself and avoid the cost of hiring\n>  an attorney.

A person who has\n>  power of attorney for another person may not represent that person in\n>  court.\n\n\"Have the attorney appear with him or her at the trial\" is pretty unclear, since it doesn't say whether the attorney can *represent* them. Rule 8(C)(1\\) states that \"A natural person may appear pro se or by counsel in any small claims proceeding\", which clarifies that they don't just mean \"have at your side\". In [Minnesota](http://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/PublicForms/Conciliation%20-%20Small%20Claims%20Court/CCT101_Information-about-Conciliation-Court.pdf), the answer is more emphatic \"no\":\n\n> **A power of attorney does not authorize a nonlawyer to file a claim, appear, or in any other way \u201crepresent\u201d a natural person in \n>  conciliation court.**\n\nAs for allowing attorneys in small claims court,\n\n> Attorneys are only allowed to represent parties in conciliation court\n>  *with permission of the court*\n\n(emphasis added). The situation in California is somewhat of a hybrid, but as I read it, it means that the incapacitated person is out of luck, which strikes me as surprising. [They say](http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/small_claims/small_claims.pdf)\n\n> Self\\-representation is usually required.

Also, the image is a photo which appears to have been taken to document normal conditions at a particular location which appears to be more or less generally accessible to the public. It does not appear especially artistic nor are the contents depicted unique enough to be visibly recognizable as a particular point in time. \n\nAlice contacts organization B requesting permission for use of the image.

Use the image, on the grounds that probably nobody will claim copyright, because the most obvious potential copyright holders expressly disclaim ownership, and an individual might be unlikely to care (and in this particular case, possibly unlikely to recognize the image as uniquely theirs).

I'm asking this question because the editor in my team needs to point to our clients when some stuff shouldn't be published to avoid issues.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Bottom line**\n\nI'd tread pretty carefully here. If you paid $2000 for the photo, you might want to check to see if it came with a licensing agreement.\n\n**Background**\n\nOne way to view this is through the lens of privacy. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652A subjects privacy invaders to liability for the resulting harm to the *interests* of the other. Because you mention public personas and your facts don't involve disclosing private details, negative publicity, or interfering with seclusion, one might think appropriation of name or likeness applies.\n\n> [Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652C](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/privacy/Privacy_R2d_Torts_Sections.htm)\n> \n> \n> One who appropriates to his own use or benefit the name or likeness of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy.\n\nComment (a) to this section explains that a person's identity is in the nature of a property right. Courts have tended to recognize an individual's interest in the exclusive use of his or her own identity, going so far as to require licensing for usage.\n\nThe most common way to violate this \"property right\" is by appropriating someone's name or likeness to promote a business or product. Cases abound on the subject, but a classic one is [*White v. Samsung Electronics America, Inc.*, 971 F.2d 1395 (9th Cir. 1992\\)](http://www.law.uh.edu/faculty/mburke/Classes/Property_Current_Year/White_v_Samsung.pdf). To summarize, Samsung ran a [picture\\-based ad](http://legalstudiesclassroom.blogspot.com/2011/03/featured-case-white-v-samsung.html) featuring a futuristic robot dressed in an evening gown and turning \"Wheel of Fortune\"\\-styled letters. Vanna White was nonplussed and brought suit, which she won on appeal. In its opinion, the Ninth Circuit argued the operative question wasn't *how* Samsung appropriated her likeness, but *whether* they had done so. The point of citing *White* here is simply to observe that a person's \"likeness\" probably extends even further than mere photo reproduction.\n\nBack to your facts: posting actual images of celebrities for a commercial purpose appears a much more clear cut appropriation of likeness than *White*. While it may seem similar, I'd distinguish your situation from that of restaurant \"Walls of Fame\"\\-\\-\\-which showcase signed photos of celebrities with the owner\\-\\-\\-in that the celebrities you mention weren't using your product or service at the time of the photograph.\n\nYou might argue the photos aren't being used for advertising, but the plaintiff would counter that you posted them on a client\\-facing business website. In the Ninth Circuit this would be a question of *whether* there was an appropriation, not the way in which it was accomplished.\n\nFor argument's sake, assume the court agrees your usage isn't commercial. Even that doesn't necessarily mean you're in the clear. In \u00a7 652C, and varying state\\-by\\-state, non\\-commercial purposes are also subject to scrutiny:\n\n> Comment (b). Apart from statute, however, the rule stated is not limited to commercial appropriation. It applies also when the defendant makes use of the plaintiff's name or likeness for his own purposes and benefit, even though the use is not a commercial one, and even though the benefit sought to be obtained is not a pecuniary one. Statutes in some states have, however, limited the liability to commercial uses of the name or likeness.\n\nIt's important to remember the Restatement isn't binding: it simply attempts to \"restate\" what courts (which are binding) have had to say on the topic. If you paid a lot of money for the photo, it might pay to see if it came with a licensing agreement.",

Please help me understand what this means:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tuN18.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tuN18.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a special type of law enforcement officer, called a \"bailiff\" who is charged with maintaining order in a courtroom, and often, a bailiff is a direct subordinate of a judge who must follow the judge's orders.\n\nJudges can also issue special kinds of court orders, called \"writs\" which are a direction to a law enforcement agency generally to take certain action. But, in these cases, the law enforcement agency is effectively an \"independent contractor\" in relationship to the judge with considerable discretion regarding precisely how and when a writ is carried out. Somebody in the law enforcement agency to which a writ is directed is required to take action, but no individual law enforcement officer is personally compelled to comply with this order.\n\nThe quote in question is not a statement about the legal authority of a judge, however. It is a statement of \"realpolitik\". The judge can't physically force or threaten law enforcement to do what they are told to do by a judge. The cops have the guns, not the judges.\n\nInstead, the judge relies upon law enforcement obeying the judge's orders because that is what law enforcement officers do. It's right in the job title. But, if law enforcement chose to ignore judges, in general, there is very little that judges could do about that (and in some countries, law enforcement does routinely ignore judicial directions).\n\nSome forms of executive branch authority to defy judicial orders is even legally codified, most starkly in the case of the pardon power.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A judge issues a writ directing local law enforcement to evict a tenant from a property. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal relationship between the judge and the law enforcement agency in this situation?\n\nA) The law enforcement agency is directly subordinate to the judge and must follow the order exactly as specified.\n\nB) Individual officers are personally compelled to comply with the judge's order.\n\nC) The law enforcement agency acts as an \"independent contractor\" with discretion in how and when to execute the writ.\n\nD) The judge has the authority to physically force law enforcement to carry out the eviction if they refuse.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage indicates that when judges issue writs, the law enforcement agency acts as an \"independent contractor\" in relation to the judge. This means they have considerable discretion regarding precisely how and when the writ is carried out. While the agency is required to take action on the writ, they are not directly subordinate to the judge (ruling out A), individual officers are not personally compelled to comply (ruling out B), and judges do not have the authority to physically force law enforcement to act (ruling out D). This question tests understanding of the nuanced relationship between judicial orders and law enforcement execution, as well as the concept of discretion in carrying out court orders."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Originalism is a method for interpreting law by enforcing what the text meant to the people who originally wrote it.\n\nFollowing originalism rights are adjusted to the current values of people by passing laws, which seems to be reasonable in practice. However from what I've read of it the Constitution is very broad. It rarely dives into specifics but rather gives a high level statement, seemingly to be carried out by legislation and the judicial process.\n\nFor example \"cruel and unusual\" in the 8th amendment. Justice Anthony Scalia, one of the biggest proponents of originalism, [stated](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2016/02/13/scalia-on-death-penalty-torture-piers-intv.cnn) that the death penalty wasn't included under it because it was legal at the time the text was written. Under originalism modern society needs to amend the Constitution if it wants to include the death penalty or anything else under \"cruel and unusual\".\n\nDo proponents of originalism suggest the new amendment use the phrase \"cruel and unusual\" but with the understanding that those words now mean something different? Or that it specifically call out the death penalty and everything else?\n\nI wonder because the former would be strange and possibly confusing, and the latter greatly restricts amendments by not allowing them to paint with a broad stroke as the original text did.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The actual method of amending the Constition is spelled out in Article V \u2013 originalism would reject the position that there are other ways to amend it. We can see the result in the [ratified amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution). Originalism is a theory of interpretation, not a theory of drafting, and it hold that the words of the law, be it the Constitution or a particular statute, are to be understood as would be understood by people originally. (There are numerous versions of originalism, so one can't be more precise than than until you decide whether you mean original understanding or original intent, the latter now being a minority viewpoint). It does not hold that new laws should be drafted in the language as it existed in the 18th century, as indeed they are not. Thus the [26th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text) is written in contemporary style befitting the fact that it was drafted recently, and the [27th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text) is written in older style befitting the fact that it was drafted in 1789\\.\n\nAs for \"changing values\", each ratified amendment represents some change of values, whereby originally a right was not recognized (or was), and by the amendment, that value changes. The 18th Amendment represents on change in values, and the 21st reflects a change in *that* value, though not back to the status quo.",

The documentation clearly states that originalism is a theory of interpretation, not drafting. It does not require new amendments to be written in old-fashioned language. Instead, amendments can and do reflect the language of their time, as evidenced by the 26th Amendment being written in a contemporary style. Option A is incorrect because originalism doesn't mandate using 18th-century language for new amendments. Option C is false because originalism recognizes the amendment process as outlined in Article V of the Constitution. Option D is not supported by the text and would likely cause confusion in interpretation."

First, what is better for you? You usually start an LLC to protect yourself (the person) from liability in case things go wrong. Worst case, you lose all the assets of the LLC. So if the LLC owns the copyright, that is an asset, which can be lost if the LLC goes bankrupt. So I'd say it's better for your protection if you own the copyright personally. \n\nIf you created the software in your own time, before the LLC was started, then you own the copyright. You should create a proper contract saying that the LLC has the non\\-exclusive right to market the software and keep profits from the sale of the software, and that this agreement can be cancelled by you at any time. Signed by you, as a private citizen, and by the director of the LLC, which happens to be you as well, on behalf of the LLC. \n\nThat will give you maximum personal protection. On the other hand, investors won't be willing to invest in your LLC, because it basically owns nothing of any value. So if you want investments, then you may be less able to protect your assets, because the investors want to protect their assets as well.",

It\u2019s a First Amendment issue, specifically: *\u201cCongress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\u201d* We\u2019ll presume that it is settled law that state and local governments are held to these standards.\n\nIn East Lumbago, any organizer who wants to stage a group demonstration must apply for an assembly permit. The organizer must show a certificate that they have taken an East Lumbago\\-approved course in Safe Public Assembly and pass a background check that confirms that they have never been convicted of riot or other serious crimes related to demonstrations. All common\\-sense restrictions to protect the public. Any person who organizes a demonstration without a valid assembly permit is subject to arrest and imprisonment.\n\nBut here\u2019s the kicker: under state law, East Lumbago assembly permits are only issued to residents of East Lumbago. If you live in West Lumbago or any other state, you can\u2019t get an East Lumbago assembly permit, so if you go ahead and organize a demonstration, you\u2019ll be arrested and prosecuted.\n\nThere have been grumbles about East Lumbago\u2019s assembly permits, but the state makes a convincing argument that in the interest of public safety, the government must know about a demonstration in advance and take steps to prepare for it, and known, convicted troublemakers must lose the right to organize demonstrations for life. And the residency requirement? East Lumbago\u2019s legislature, in the preamble to their public assembly law, spoke of the need to end the scourge on society of outside agitators and rabble rousers coming to their fair state and causing trouble, and for this reason, only East Lumbago residents are eligible to organize a demonstration.\n\nWest Lumbago activists and organizers feel that due solely to their residence in a state other than East Lumbago, they suffer unequal protection of their First Amendment right of assembly / petition by being denied assembly permits in East Lumbago. They ask their Attorney General to take the case directly to the Supreme Court on their behalf, since the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction in all disputes between the states.\n\nDoes West Lumbago have standing? Is the abridgement of the civil rights of its residents when they travel to East Lumbago a sufficient cause of action for the Supreme Court to take up the case directly rather than going through the usual district court / circuit court / Supreme Court routine?\n\nI'm aware that a state may act as *parens patriae* for its citizens by suing another state on environmental grounds or on economic grounds when the state has a demonstrable interest distinguishable from the interests of individual citizens for whom it is suing. But for a civil rights case? I'm just not sure and I'd like to know.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No.\n\nThe original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court for disputes between states applies only to disputes between the state entities themselves, not suits on behalf of their citizens.\n\nSomething like this [was attempted, and failed](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/why-texass-election-suit-failed-to-reach-first-base-in-the-supreme-court), in the litigation following the 2020 election producing a ruling in December 2020:\n\n> \\[In] *Texas v.

As demonstrated in the Texas v. Pennsylvania case following the 2020 election, the Court has established that states do not have standing to sue other states on behalf of their citizens in matters related to how those other states govern their internal affairs, even when constitutional rights are allegedly being violated. The Court would likely view this as a matter for individual West Lumbago residents to pursue through normal federal court channels, starting at the district court level, rather than a dispute between the states themselves. The case does not present a justiciable controversy between the states as entities, but rather a disagreement over how one state's laws affect the other state's residents. This aligns with the Court's interpretation of its original jurisdiction as being limited to disputes between the state entities themselves, not suits on behalf of their citizens."
