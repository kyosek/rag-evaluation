Otherwise, you might think that because the material was initially recorded on WhatsApp (I surmise), there might be a requirement to get permission. So you turn to the [WhatsApp terms of service](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/terms-of-service/?lang=en), in the section on licenses.

These organizations may have policies or agreements in place regarding the distribution of work-related materials. The correct approach is to review any existing contracts or policies and, if necessary, consult with supervisors or administrators before publishing the video.

Building anything on common HOA property without HOA permission probably violates the HOA governing documents. The HOA could probably fine you or enjoin you from doing so.

This said, if it is a limited common element serving one unit, rather than a general common element serving all units, the HOA might be more tolerant.\n2. But, frequently there is a statute of limitations that is fairly short to complain about building a structure without permission or without a proper permit.\n3. Not all construction work requires building permits or contractor's licenses. A simple patio or deck might not require one. Typically, a local government enacts a version of the Uniform Building Code and you'd have to check municipal ordinances.\n4. Building permits are usually administered by local government, rather than state government officials.\n5. A local government that becomes aware of a structure that required a permit but was built without one, when the statute of limitations has run on insisting that it be destroyed, might still deny further permits for the relevant property until the non\\-conforming structure is removed.\n\nThe legal analysis would depend to some extent on how the issue presented itself.

The answer mentions that there's often a \"statute of limitations that is fairly short to complain about building a structure without permission or without a proper permit.\" This suggests that after five years, the HOA might be limited in its ability to force removal of the deck.

Due to government legislation related to the Coronavirus outbreak, the hotel was forced to close and cancel all bookings. The hotel offered a voucher for future bookings instead of a refund. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the traveler's legal rights in this situation?\n\nA) The traveler is entitled to a full refund under UK consumer protection laws.\nB) The traveler can claim a refund through their credit card company using Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act.\nC) The hotel is legally obligated to provide a full refund since they cancelled the booking.\nD) The traveler may not be entitled to any compensation if the cancellation is considered a force majeure event.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. Spanish law likely applies to this contract, not UK consumer protection laws, as the hotel does not \"do business\" in the UK.\n2. Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act only applies if the retailer breached their contract, which may not be the case in a force majeure event.\n3.

The appropriate severity of professional discipline for particular kinds of conduct is largely a matter of case law and separate law provides for the procedural framework for administering the Rules of Professional Conduct. The Rules themselves specifically disavow the task of decided what kind if professional discipline is appropriate for any particular kind of conduct of an attorney.\n\nPersonal ethics and behavior are governed primarily by rules 8\\.02 (defamatory speech about judges and other legal officials), and 8\\.04 (various kinds of misconduct including personal misconduct), although there are some stray bits that can come up in connection with other rules.\n\nRule 1\\.08 involves improper conduct in transactions with clients that do not pertain to the matter in which the client is represented (e.g. unfair business deals with clients). Texas is among a minority of states that does not automatically treat having sex with client that commences only after the attorney\\-client relationship is formed as a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nRule 8\\.04 is sometimes called the \"officer and a gentleman\" clause of attorney professional ethics after an analogous provision, [Article 113](https://www.armfor.uscourts.gov/digest/IIIA59.htm), of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that applies to members of the United States armed forces. It is a residual misconduct provision that covers lots of misconduct in a lawyer's personal affairs that isn't otherwise regulated by the Rules of Professional Conduct.\n\nRule 8,04 and its official comments are as follows:\n\n> Rule 8\\.04\\.

The\n> same is true of abuse of positions of private trust.\n\nWith respect to the portion of the question asking:\n\n> What personal kinds of personal misconduct might result in such\n> penalties?\n\nSome of the most serious violations of the rules that are likely to lead to disbarment include misappropriation of client property, abandonment of a legal practice with active clients, revealing highly prejudicial client confidences with no color of justification for doing so, committing a crime involving fraud or a felony, or failure to cooperate with a disciplinary investigation.\n\nOf those, committing of a crime involving fraud or a felony would be the one most likely to result in disbarment that involves *personal conduct*, as opposed to professional conduct. Other kinds of personal conduct might result in a lesser sanction, however, as noted in Rule 8\\.4\\. Of course, it isn't all that hard to imagine some circumstance \"involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\" (think \"[George Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santos)\" absent any criminal conduct) that isn't strictly speaking a crime, or \"conduct constituting obstruction of justice\" in a matter unrelated to client matters (e.g. obstructing an investigation of a family member of the lawyer in connection with an academic institution's investigation) that could rise to this level as well.\n\nBut, again, the matching of punishment to particular conduct is rooted in case law. Also, a pattern of various kinds of misconduct or repeat offenses are often treatment more seriously than a single instance of misconduct by a first offender would be in isolation.\n\nIncidentally, every U.S. jurisdiction has a set of Rules of Professional Conduct with the same numbering system, although the substantive content of different states' rules with the same number is not always the same.\n\nSo, for example, Rule 8\\.4 covers the same subject\\-matter in every U.S. state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and every other U.S. territory, even though there may be important substantive differences between the versions of Rule 8\\.4 adopted in different states."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A Texas lawyer engages in personal conduct outside of their professional duties that involves:\n\n1. Committing a misdemeanor for reckless driving\n2. Making a false statement on a mortgage application\n3. Having a consensual sexual relationship with a current client\n4.

This falls under conduct \"involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation\" which is explicitly prohibited by Rule 8.04(a)(3). It also potentially constitutes a crime involving fraud, which is considered a \"serious crime\" under Rule 8.04(b) and can lead to severe disciplinary action.\n\nOption A, while a criminal act, is less likely to be considered as severely unless it's part of a pattern of repeated offenses.\n\nOption C, while potentially unethical, is not automatically treated as a violation in Texas, unlike in some other states.\n\nOption D, while serious, might not necessarily lead to disbarment on its own, especially if rectified, though it could lead to disciplinary action.\n\nThe false statement on a mortgage application most directly challenges a lawyer's honesty and trustworthiness, which are fundamental to the profession, making it the most likely to result in disbarment among these options."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7272/is-the-benchmarking-clause-in-vmwares-eula-actually-valid", "docs_id": 7272, "title": "Is the Benchmarking clause in VMware&#39;s EULA actually valid?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The [VMware End User License Agreement](https://www.vmware.com/download/eula/universal_eula.html) reads as follows: \n\n> **2\\.4 Benchmarking.** You may use the Software to conduct internal performance testing and benchmarking studies.

I do not see the WSJ TOS mentioning a license required to summarize or rewrite their material.\n\nIt is fundamental that copyright protects the expression of ideas (among other things) but *not* ideas or information. The subtlety with \"information\" is that, in some places like most of Europe a collection of organized information of non\\-copyrightable material can be copyrighted as a whole.\n\nThat is not the case in the U.S. although there was an unsuccessful attempt in the Database and Collections of Information Misappropriation Act of 2003/4\\.\n\nAlso, plagiarism, appropriation of ideas without attribution, is an academic integrity issue, not a legal issue."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to U.S. copyright law, which of the following actions would most likely be considered legal without obtaining permission or paying a licensing fee?\n\nA) Copying and republishing entire articles from the Wall Street Journal website on your own website\nB) Paraphrasing articles from the Wall Street Journal, using different wording but conveying the same information and ideas\nC) Reproducing select sentences and paragraphs from Wall Street Journal articles, with attribution\nD) Creating a database of Wall Street Journal article headlines and publication dates\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct according to U.S. copyright law. The law, specifically 17 U.S.C. 102(b), states that copyright protection does not extend to ideas, concepts, or information, regardless of the form in which they are described. Paraphrasing articles using different wording but conveying the same information and ideas would likely be legal, as long as the specific expression (wording) is not copied.\n\nOption A is illegal as it involves directly copying copyrighted material without permission. \nOption C would likely infringe on copyright as it involves reproducing portions of the original text. \nOption D, while not directly infringing copyright, could potentially be problematic in the U.S. if it's considered a substantial collection of factual information, though this is less clear-cut than the other options.\n\nIt's important to note that while paraphrasing may avoid copyright issues, it could still be considered plagiarism in academic or professional contexts if proper attribution is not given."}, "18": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/45195/im-owed-compensation-for-assault-its-been-almost-8-years-and-i-havent-seen-a", "docs_id": 45195, "title": "I&#39;m owed compensation for assault.

However you can sue him for damages. Usually a claim for damages is time\\-barred after six years (and it is now seven years). However you weren't able to sue him yourself until you were 18, so you may have a couple of years left. However the clock may have started ticking immediately after the attack, on the grounds your parents or guardians could have sued. Talk to a solictor about this possibility; they should give you a free 30 minute consultation, and would probably take a case on a contigency fee (no\\-win no\\-fee) basis if it has any chance.\n\nIn principle, you could have applied to the [Criminal Injuries Compensation Board](https://www.gov.uk/claim-compensation-criminal-injury/eligibility) for compensation \\- but you are too late for that; you have to apply within two years (there are some exceptions, but none seem to apply to you).\n\nAssuming it was compensation\n----------------------------\n\nHe owes you \u00a3200\\. Now you need to enforce that payment \\- and again, the problem may be the six year clock.

While there is typically a six-year limitation period for civil claims, the clock may not have started ticking until the victim turned 18, potentially giving them a couple more years to pursue legal action. This is because minors are generally not able to sue on their own behalf.

While bicycles are not motor vehicles, they can pose a safety risk to pedestrians and potentially cause noise, aligning with the council's intentions.\n\nOption C (electric wheelchair) would likely be exempt due to accessibility considerations, even under a purposive approach.\n\nOption D (lawn mower) might technically fit the definition of a \"vehicle,\" but its use is essential for park maintenance and would likely be considered an exception.\n\nThe question highlights how the purposive approach can lead to interpretations that may not strictly adhere to the literal wording of a law, but instead focus on achieving the law's intended purpose."}, "20": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/58761/in-florida-can-a-home-defense-weapon-and-use-of-castle-doctrine-deadly-force", "docs_id": 58761, "title": "In Florida, can a home defense weapon and use of &quot;Castle Doctrine&quot; (deadly force) transfer to a house of a friend that I visit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I am entitled to use a weapon for home defense in the state of Florida.

The friends house is also in Florida.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally, yes. Castle doctrine generally applies to anyone who is not trespassing on the property, not just the property owner. So long as you have permission from the property owner to be there, you can invoke Castle Doctrine.\n\nIt should be noted that Castle Doctrine is not a law, but rather a legal theory of a narrow self\\-defense claim. In general, Self\\-Defense in the United States breaks down to \"Duty to Flee\" vs. \"Stand Your Ground\" with the latter being much more common in the U.S. while all 50 states have Castle Doctrine in a private space (three do not have it codified but rely on state laws). Castle Doctrine simply means you have a legal right to \"stand your ground\" on your own private property regardless of the state's \"Duty to Flee\" stance in public spaces.\n\nFlorida is a \"Stand Your Ground\" state for purposes of self\\-defense, which means that, so long as you have a legal right to be in a space, you have the right to use deadly force in self\\-defense even if you can retreat from the situation. And it's not something Floridians are shy about either. The concept of the \"Stand your Ground\" vs. \"Duty to Retreat\" entered into public debate a few years back during the Zimmerman case, where it was used successfully for Zimmerman to be found not guilty of murder of a teenage African American boy.\n\nAs a personal annecdote I like to tell, when I live in Florida, my boss walked into work the other day and was discussing his recent purchase of a gun and how, when asked by the police what the purpose of his gun purchase was, he answered to defend his home.

As long as a visitor has permission from the property owner to be there, they can invoke the Castle Doctrine if faced with an imminent threat from an intruder. Florida is also a \"Stand Your Ground\" state, which means that individuals have the right to use deadly force in self-defense if they have a legal right to be in a space, even if retreat is possible. This applies not only to one's own home but also to places where one is staying as a guest, such as a friend's house.
