All questions can be boiled down into questions of law and questions of fact. This is opposed to an inquisitorial system, where the prosecutor, defense, and judge are working to answer these questions in a fact finding forum.\n\nBecause of this, in Common law, the judge takes the role of \"Trier of Law\", i.e. he is the arbiter of what the law says. The Jury will talk the role of \"Trier of Fact\". Essentially, if the prosecutor and defense attorneys are in a competition against each other, the judge will serve as the referee and decide whether something is allowed to be discussed in trial and whether the jury should count it. Because of this, the judge cannot call out objectional behavior by one side or the other as it would call into question his/her ability to be neutral in his assessment of the law. Thus it is the burden of the opposing party to object to something that is objectional.\n\nFailure to object means that the the side that should object is okay with this activity by opposing counsel, so the judge must allow it. Sometimes, objections are raised at trial for the sole reason that they will be part of the appeal of the case. Appeals can only call raise Questions of Law, which again, is the judge's domain. Thus the judge can't object, since we operate on the fact that the judge is neutral. If the judge is not neutral, than the case can be overturned easily by an appellant court.\n\nEssentially, the \"Objection\" is similar to a coach playing sportsball asking a ref to review a play on the sportsball field. Under this game rule, however, the judge is there to make the call if and only if he/she is asked to make it. Otherwise the objectionable action is permitted to stand.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a common law legal system, why can't a judge object to questionable evidence or testimony on their own initiative?\n\nA) Judges lack the legal expertise to identify objectionable material without prompting from attorneys.\nB) The adversarial nature of the system requires opposing counsel to raise objections to maintain the judge's neutrality.\nC) Judges are only responsible for questions of fact, not questions of law.\nD) Allowing judges to object would unfairly advantage the prosecution in criminal cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In a common law system, courts operate on an adversarial model where the prosecution and defense are pitted against each other. The judge serves as a neutral arbiter, acting as the \"Trier of Law.\" If judges were to object on their own initiative, it could call into question their impartiality and neutrality in assessing the law. The burden of objecting falls on the opposing party to maintain the integrity of this system.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because judges typically have extensive legal expertise; their restraint in objecting is not due to lack of knowledge.\n\nAnswer C is actually the reverse of the truth. In common law systems, judges are responsible for questions of law, while juries typically handle questions of fact.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because judicial neutrality is meant to ensure fairness for both sides, not to advantage one party over another.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the adversarial nature of common law systems and the specific roles of judges, attorneys, and juries within that system."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19113/can-a-california-berkeley-landlord-ask-for-an-extra-security-deposit", "docs_id": 19113, "title": "Can a California (Berkeley) landlord ask for an extra security deposit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Just got an email from a non\\-residential garage space landlord stating that our current yearly rent increase is due.\n\nBut it struck me as odd that they also added in a line that says\n\n> \"The security deposit you paid when you first leased space in the\n>  building was based on a percentage of the monthly rent paid.

([America, A Concise History](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0312643276))\n\n*Emphasis mine.*\n\nThis does not make much sense to me. \n\nThis decision is in the context of the (very violent) intimidation of blacks especially by ex\\-Confederates followed by a Democratic political coup. From what I understand, the Democrats disenfranchised African Americans. The Supreme Court then ruled that it was the state's responsibility to ensure that its citizen's rights were not infringed upon. \n\n### First contention\n\nFirstly, why would it be the state's responsibility to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment, which is part of the Constitution? The Fourteenth Amendment states,\n\n> The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article. ([Section 5 of the 14th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution))\n\nDoes this, not to mention that it is a Constitutional amendment, not imply that issues pertaining to the Fourteenth Amendment, such as equal access to voting ([Section 2 of the 14th Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)), are under federal jurisdiction?\n\n### Second contention\n\nIf \"private groups\" like the KKK took *political* power, would the governments that they became part of not be violating former slaves' civil rights (as opposed to just private individuals)? Therefore, it would be that state's duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to address the illegal actions of actors within its jurisdiction. However, if the state fails to address these actions, would it not then become the federal government's jurisdiction since the state failed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment within its borders? \n\nWould the plaintiff have needed to sue the state for failing to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in order for it to be under federal jurisdiction?\n\n### Closing\n\nI am not very fluent in law things, so please excuse me for any misused vocabulary (like \"jurisdiction\"), nor do I have a thorough understanding of federal vs. state jurisdiction or Constitutional law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the \"state action\" requirement is the norm for most civil rights violations. The U.S. Constitution is structured in such a way that it is designed solely to protect people from government overreach. Statutes engaged by legislative bodies at the state and federal level protect people from misconduct by private parties.\n\nFor example, ordinary state criminal laws would ordinarily forbid private parties from acting as armed vigilantes to prevent people from doing pretty much anything. And, if armed vigilantes were doing something that government officials and politically powerful people in the state didn't approve of, they would have been arrested, charged and convicted of crimes by the police.\n\nThe trouble is that in the U.S. legal system, if the government decides not to enforce its criminal laws, you are limited to bringing civil lawsuits against the offenders for damages or injunctive relief (e.g. a court order ordering the vigilantes to stop misbehaving). But, as a practical matter, private lawsuits are not very effective when the courts and government officials are determined to thwart you and so are a significant share of the members of any jury pool. (This is one of the reasons, as a matter of logic, for the Second Amendment, because you need some way to protect yourself from crimes if the government exercises its right to do nothing to protect you from criminals even when it is capable of doing so.)\n\nThe U.S. Constitutional and legal system requires the good faith of the elected officials in state and federal government to work properly. But, if majorities of voters under whatever flawed electoral system is currently in place are bound and determined to suppress a political minority, the democratic features of our political system make it very hard to intervene to protect that political minority.\n\nAs you note, the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution (collectively, the Civil Rights Amendments) all empower Congress to enact legislation enforcing those provisions in addition to any self\\-executing effect that they have, although the exact scope of that enforcement power was at the time a matter of some legal debate and in any event often wasn't exercised by Congress (which by then had white, anti\\-civil rights members in many House and Senate seats). But, in *U.S. v. Cruikshank* a very racist U.S. Supreme Court held that the state action requirement applied not just to self\\-executing aspects of the Civil Rights Amendments, but also to the 1870 Enforcement Act adopted by Congress during Reconstruction with an intent to stop precisely the kind of armed private action that occurred. It held that the 1870 Enforcement Act as applied to private parties was unconstitutional.\n\n(Around the same time the *Slaughterhouse* cases gutted the privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution, and *Plessy v. Ferguson* gutted the 14th Amendment with the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.)\n\n> However, if the state fails to address these actions, would it not\n> then become the federal government's jurisdiction since the state\n> failed to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment within its borders?\n\nNo. The U.S. Constitution doesn't provide much protection at all against state inaction. (The human rights tribunal for the Americas has faulted the U.S. for violating human rights by not having protections against this kind of conduct which all Latin American countries do have.)\n\n> Would the plaintiff have needed to sue the state for failing to\n> enforce the Fourteenth Amendment in order for it to be under federal\n> jurisdiction?\n\nNo. The plaintiff would have no remedy, which was basically the intended and expected effect of *U.S. v. Cruikshank*. The justice of the U.S. Supreme Court weren't any more stupid then than they are now. They just had different values and part of those values was the belief that it wasn't the place of the federal government to curb the acts of groups like the KKK and Jim Crow laws (in part to prevent a re\\-ignition of the Civil War in a post\\-Reconstruction period when white supremacists were more powerful than ever in the states that had previously fought a war with overwhelming support from majorities of people entitled to vote to preserve slavery). The Civil Rights Amendments were shoved down the throats of the Southern states as a condition for readmission to equal standing in the Union free of military law and civil disabilities during Reconstruction. So, they ratified those amendments under duress and then did everything they could to reinstate the pre\\-civil war system as completely as possible which they had still believed in despite losing the Civil War (and indeed, [modern political figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore) like [Roy Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore), a previous Alabama Supreme Court Justice, still want to return their states and the nation to the ante\\-bellum South, and argue that slavery was as much good as it was bad for the slaves and for the South).\n\nIt took a century and two World Wars and the Korean War, in which African\\-Americans served in the military for the U.S., and a thriving post\\-war economy, for those attitudes to change.\n\nUltimately, in light of this ruling, in the 1960s, the Civil Rights Acts were adopted by Congress to regulate discriminatory conduct by private parties, not with the justification and authority of enforcement powers of the Civil Rights Amendments, but instead based upon the interstate commerce clause whose scope had been dramatically expanded during the Great Depression in cases like *Wickard v. Filburn*, a choice which a pro\\-civil rights U.S. Supreme Court gave its stamp of approval in the *Heart of Atlanta Motel* case.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the Supreme Court's ruling in U.S. v.

Cruikshank significantly limited federal power to protect civil rights by holding that the Fourteenth Amendment only applied to state actions, not to actions by private individuals or groups. This meant that even if private groups like the KKK violated citizens' rights, it was considered a state responsibility to address, not a federal one. The Court effectively \"gutted\" the Fourteenth Amendment by ruling that it did not protect citizens from armed vigilantes, even if those vigilantes seized political power. This interpretation left the enforcement of civil rights largely to state jurisdictions, which often failed to protect minority rights, especially in the South during the post-Reconstruction era."}, "13": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/16547/what-do-we-call-the-rules-written-in-an-act-laws", "docs_id": 16547, "title": "What do we call the rules written in an Act, laws?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: From CHAPTER III of Wildlife protection **act**,1972 (India)\n\n> 9.

When the body makes a formal decision to adopt the written document (by a vote, for example), it is deciding to do the thing described in the document; that is, it is deciding to act. Typically, for a legislature, the thing it's doing is to create, modify, or repeal a law.\n\nIt's not very difficult to see how a document that describes a legislature's desire *to* act came to be called *an* act. In some contexts, however, it can also be called a law.\n\nSo the word *law* can refer to the entire system (as in *law school*), to a particular act (as in *the legislature passed a law today called the XYZ Act*), or indeed to a particular rule or section of an act (as in *the law in question is subparagraph 2(B)(ii)(b) of the XYZ Act*).\n\n*Law* can also refer to *case law,* of course, or *regulatory law,* so we tend to use *statutory law* or *statute* to denote the laws created through the legislative process.\n\nIn conclusion, the word \"law\" has several related meanings, so its use can be imprecise. When speaking about specific paragraphs, precision may be in order. In a case like this, where a paragraph create exceptions to rules laid out in a preceding paragraph, it doesn't make a lot of sense to describe each paragraph as a \"law.\" The numbered items in statutory text can be called many things, and usually have different names depending on the level at which they are found. So I would not know whether these are sections, subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, or something else.

WotC bought TSR and all its assets, including copyrights. There were at least two other RPGs that tried to use Beholders and other original creatures from the *Monster Manual* of D\\&D and dropped them after a cease and desist order from the copyright holders. I believe one was from TSR, and one from WotC after they purchased TSR. To the best of my knowledge there was no actual copyright suit, so the validity of the copyright was never tested in court, but it is probably valid.\n\nMerely calling a creature a \"Beholder\" is not enough to violate the copyright, there would need to be actual copying of the description, or a sufficiently detailed similarity to make the use an infringement. That is always a matter of judgement, ultimately for a court in a copyright suit (or an appeals court).\n\nSo, while all the possibilities mentioned in [the answer by @Dale M](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/64375/10) are valid, it is additional possible that the version used by HOMM3 is not sufficiently close to the one copyrighted as part of AD\\&D for a copyright claim to prevail, or the WotC fears that it would not prevail, and so does not spend the money to try.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best explains why Heroes of Might and Magic 3 (HOMM3) was able to use \"beholders\" in their game without apparent legal consequences, while Tibia had to change the name to \"bonelord\" after a copyright claim?\n\nA) HOMM3 obtained a license from Wizards of the Coast to use beholders\nB) The copyright on beholders had expired before HOMM3 was released\nC) HOMM3's version of beholders may not be sufficiently similar to the copyrighted D&D version to constitute infringement\nD) Wizards of the Coast only enforces its copyright on beholders against smaller game companies\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, merely using the name \"beholder\" is not enough to violate copyright. There needs to be a sufficiently detailed similarity to the copyrighted version for it to be considered infringement. It's possible that HOMM3's version of beholders was different enough from the D&D version to avoid copyright issues, or that Wizards of the Coast believed their claim wouldn't prevail if challenged.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there's no mention of HOMM3 obtaining a license. \nOption B is incorrect because the copyright on beholders is still held by Wizards of the Coast. \nOption D is speculation and not supported by the given information. Additionally, selective enforcement could potentially weaken copyright claims.\n\nThis question tests understanding of copyright law concepts, particularly the idea that copyright protects specific expressions rather than general ideas, and that similarity is a key factor in determining infringement."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37891/capturing-photos-of-a-book", "docs_id": 37891, "title": "Capturing photos of a book", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have taken a book from my university's library and it states in the second page :\n\n> The law of March 11, 1957 authorizes only \"copies or reproductions strictly reserved for the private use of the copier and not intended for collective use\".\n>  Any representation or reproduction, in whole or in part, made without the consent of the publisher, is unlawful.\n\nIt is a book written in french and a french address containing \"Paris\" figures in the same page so this is probably a french law.\nAny of you have an idea on whether this law is still up or not?  \n\nThis allows me to take photos I guess but I am not sure on the validity of the law as I stated in the last phrase.\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6kw6E.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/6kw6E.jpg)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume the question is about what the law allows, and not what the history of that part of the 1957 law is.

The UK GDPR was necessary because after Brexit, the UK was no longer an EU member state, and its citizens were no longer EU citizens.

In other words, what does this \u201cor other\u201d clause refer to?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The cited provision is:\n\n> A person has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment if the person is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the person's sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex.\n\nThis language originates in the [Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/1102/made). This statutory instrument was made in response to a 1996 decision of the European Court of Justice ([*P v S and Cornwall County Council*, C\\-13/94](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A61994CJ0013)) that [Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A31976L0207) , regarding equal treatment of men and women, also covered discrimination on the grounds of gender reassignment. The regulations were made in order to bring domestic law up to date with the EU requirement, by amending the Sex Discrimination Act 1975\\. The definition at the time, found in the amended [section 82](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1975/65/section/82/1999-05-01), was:\n\n> \"gender reassignment\" means a process which is undertaken under medical supervision for the purpose of reassigning a person\u2019s sex by changing physiological or other characteristics of sex, and includes any part of such a process\n\nSo the idea of \"other characteristics\" or \"other attributes\" comes from the 1999 version of the law. I expect that the change to \"attributes\" is simply because the Equality Act 2010 uses the term \"characteristic\" to mean something else, as it consolidates many different regimes about discrimination on the basis of sex, race, disability, etc., all of which are called \"characteristics\".\n\nThe more recent text removes the part about \"medical supervision\", and explicitly includes people at any stage of transition. [Explanatory Notes](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/notes/division/3/2/1/4) to the 2010 Act give the example:\n\n> A person who was born physically female decides to spend the rest of her life as a man. He starts and continues to live as a man. He decides not to seek medical advice as he successfully \u2018passes\u2019 as a man without the need for any medical intervention. He would have the protected characteristic of gender reassignment for the purposes of the Act.\n\n(These notes are not binding in law but they do give a good idea of what the drafters meant to say. The concept of 'passes' is also not the most sensitive language to bring in, since trans people do not necessarily want to measure themselves by their ability to pass undetected, and may present differently in different contexts.)\n\nThe example shows that someone can have the protected characteristic without having, or contemplating, any change to their body. So from this example, the other attributes of sex would include all those ways in which the man \"continues to live as a man\". From general knowledge of trans men, that could include using a masculine name and pronouns; wearing traditionally\\-male clothes; wearing a binder, baggy clothing, padding in the crotch, or other ways to suggest a more masculine than feminine body; having a traditionally\\-male haircut; using traditionally\\-masculine body language; pitching the voice lower; and so on. The situation for trans women would be parallel. These things are all attributes of sex, in that our society abounds in stereotypes of what is a \"manly handshake\", or a \"girly drink\", or otherwise associated with a particular sex.

However, the feedback we've gathered so far suggests that this officer not only wasn't terminated or adequately punished, but that they've continued to retain full access to these systems that were abused.\n\nWe're suspicious that there may be quite a few people in cahoots that is allowing this officer to avoid necessary punishment. Some of this suspicion comes from numerous contradictory claims in their communication compared to the documentation we received; the lack of transparency and effort when they were forced to report to other agencies (even ones above them); and that they have repeatedly went well beyond the deadlines of numerous statutes, resulting in some opportunities of tort to be impossible (we found these out afterwards, of course).\n\nIt's worth noting that we've contacted a few lawyers.

An individual would be prudent to be able to continually ask the attorney pertinent questions relevant to their prospective course of action, and, if possible, establish the course that the attorney will take themselves. \n\nThe decision of whether to pursue a local complaint or civil action in state or federal court challenging any action of a governmental agency should be analyzed from a cost\\-benefit perspective. \n\n* Are the individuals prepared for years of litigation?\n* What is the primary objective of the complaint or civil action?\n\n\t1.

The documentation suggests that before pursuing a civil action in court, it's generally advisable to go through the agency's internal complaint process first. This approach allows for the possibility of resolving the issue at the administrative level without immediately resorting to costly and time-consuming litigation. Options A and D are premature at this stage, as legal action should typically be a last resort after exhausting internal procedures.

The basis for that suit would be negligence, that is, they had a duty of care to you, but they failed to act in a reasonable manner to prevent the harm. A prominent question in such a case would be whether the damage was a foreseeable outcome (if not, there is no negligence), or one\\-time while foreseeable (if this is a repeat offense, the consequences to them of deliberately ignoring the problem could be worse). There is also the consideration of comparative liability, since you might have been able to avoid the situation by doing something else. In some states, any fault assignable to you means you lose, but in California they follow the pure comparative fault rule, where your portion of the liability is deducted from an award (but you can still collect something if it was 99% your fault).\n\n[Here](https://www.eater.com/2017/5/19/15662790/starbucks-hot-coffee-lawsuit-florida-100k) is an incident involving Starbucks (lids) where the plaintiff won, [here](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2015/05/11/starbucks-lawsuit-hot-coffee-cop-police-officer/27148147/) is one where the plaintiff lost", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer at a Starbucks coffee shop is injured when a wobbly table causes hot coffee to spill on their arm.

I'm not sure if I need to contact the person in the image directly, or the owner of the image, not even sure how to find that out.\n\n[I've read that](https://blog.printsome.com/printing-fan-art/) as long as I make it clear that the image is not official or linked to the person it should be ok.

From the description, the modified images are *derivative works*. Making or distributing derivative works requires the permission of the holder of the copyright on the original (source) work. Some open source licenses (such as the Creative Commons licenses that do not include an ND clause) grant such permission in advance. Otherwise permission must be requested from, and granted by, the copyright holder or the holder's agent.\n\nIn the absence of permission this is copyright infringement. If advertised widely for a fee, a copyright suit is more likely, and might result in sizable damages. The holder might not grant permission, or might charge a fee. A lack of any answer from the holder must be treated as a \"no\".\n\nRight of Publicity\n------------------\n\nIn some jurisdictions a person has a \"right of publicity\" in his or her own image or likeness. This generally means that photos or images of the person cannot be used commercially without permission from the subject. In some places this right is limited to the use of such images in advertising, not as art subjects themselves.\n\nI don't know the extent of such rights in England and Wales, or elsewhere in the UK. In the US this varies by state. But if such rights apply, use of such images without permission can result in a suit and significant damages.\n\nDefamation\n----------\n\nIf showing an image of a person with added tattoos would tend to bring that person into disrepute, or make others think badly of that person, for example if the added tattoos were Nazi or gang symbols, then distributing such an altered image **might** be defamation. This would only apply if people actually thoguht the tattoos indicated that person's choice or attitude, or if reasonable people might think so.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nBefore making this a business, even a hobby business, one would do well to consult a lawyer with IP expertise. There are significant legal risks here, which are increased by doing this for profit, and advertising it on the net.

The designer needs to consider:\n\n1. Copyright: Permission is required from the copyright holder of the original image to create and distribute derivative works.\n\n2. Right of Publicity: In some jurisdictions, permission may be needed from the celebrity to use their image commercially.\n\n3.

Even with verbatim quotes and equations copied from the book, some amount of that is allowed under the [fair use doctrine](https://law.stackexchange.com/tags/fair-use/info). There is not much (any) clarity in the law when it comes to educational\\-use quote\\-copying. However, based on your description, I would not conclude that this work counts as \"fair use\": but a judge or jury might decide it is, depending on the exact facts.\n\nIf you reduce a 600 page book to 200 pages, that sounds like \"copying\" while creating a derivative work. This would be especially the case if the structure of your book strongly resembled the structure of the original book, and what you did was omit some sentences and reword some sentences. On the other hand if you wrote an independent book on the topic, happened to reflect the original author's ideas, and even copied a small amount of text by way of illustrative quotes, then that resembles an independent creation rather than copying.\n\nThere are [4 plus factors](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/7683/in-the-us-when-is-fair-use-a-defense-to-copyright-infringement) recognized in the fair use defense, where the fact\\-finder would somehow \"take into consideration\" these factors: purpose and character (non\\-profit, teaching, exegesis all in your favor), nature of the work (equations implies science hence facts, being factual favors fair use), amount and substantiality (not in your favor, if you're paraphrasing a whole book), and effect on market. As a first approximation, your work might have a devastating effect if your work is good and the original is expensive plus popular \u2013 you created a free competitor. Framed in terms of your intended original use, probably not so significant, limited to the size of your class (assuming that your work was a replacement for, and not a supplement to, the original \u2013 which may be what you did). The law isn't stated in terms of your intent in creating the work, it's stated in terms of what you did. Still, the fact\\-finders might be influenced by innocent intent. Then finally, there is \"transformativeness\" as a unifying consideration, so that copying that substantially transforms a work into a new work fares better under a fair use analysis \u2013 this would appear to be a quite transformative work.\n\nWhether or not the rights\\-holder is likely to go after you depends on many unknowables, especially whether there would be any point in suing you, and how much the publisher and author care.\n\nRegardless of the relationship between the original book and your version, you have created a work that is also protected by copyright. That means that it is illegal to upload your work to Scribd, Slideshare, or anywhere else, without your permission. When someone illegally uploads a work to a server, if you learn about it, you as author can file a [DMCA takedown notice](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/24057/how-can-i-legally-protect-my-website-from-users-who-upload-copyrighted-material/24060#24060). A law\\-abiding service will then take the work down (unless the uploader officially claims he has the right to upload it). If they do claim they have the right, you have to sue them.

That depends on how Congress intends the hypothetical law to apply to them. In the law in question in *Golan v. Holder*, Congress planned ahead for this, and included provisions for it in the law (quoting from *Golan v. Holder*):\n\n> Reliance parties may continue to exploit a restored work until the owner of the restored copyright gives notice of intent to enforce\u2014either by filing with the U. S. Copyright Office within two years of restoration, or by actually notifying the reliance party. After that, reliance parties may continue to exploit existing copies for a grace period of one year. Finally, anyone who, before the URAA\u2019s enactment, created a \u201cderivative work\u201d based on a restored work may indefinitely exploit the derivation upon payment to the copyright holder of \u201creasonable compensation,\u201d to be set by a district judge if the parties cannot agree.\n\nLast, could Congress extend copyright for 10,000 years?

Holder and Eldred v. Ashcroft, has not explicitly set a limit on copyright terms. However, it has hinted that there might be a constitutional issue with extremely long or perpetual copyright terms. In Golan v. Holder, the Court referred to hypothetical successive re-applications of copyright as \"legislative misbehavior,\" and in Eldred v.

They also state that \"Religious discrimination also includes discrimination against someone because s/he is an atheist\". The wording there is of some significance, since it does not say that an atheist organization is a \"religious organization\" which would be entitled to discriminate in favor of atheists in hiring practices. The statutory [definitions section of the law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e) tells us that \"religion\"\n\n> includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as\n>  belief, unless an employer demonstrates that he is unable to\n>  reasonably accommodate to an employee\u2019s or prospective employee\u2019s\n>  religious observance or practice without undue hardship on the conduct\n>  of the employer\u2019s business\n\nwhich doesn't actually support the commission's decision to extend coverage to atheist employees. That interpretation comes from post\\-statutory case law, such as [Shapolia v. Los Alamos Nat'l Lab., 773 F. Supp. 304, 305](https://casetext.com/case/shapolia-v-los-alamos-nat-laboratory-2).\n\nWhat is unclear is what a \"religious organization\" is. The exemption comes from [42 USC 2000e\u20131(a)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2000e%E2%80%931):\n\n> This subchapter shall not apply to an employer with respect to the\n>  employment of aliens outside any State, or to a religious corporation,\n>  association, educational institution, or society with respect to the\n>  employment of individuals of a particular religion to perform work\n>  connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association,\n>  educational institution, or society of its activities\n\nbut the definitions do not clearly state that an organization dedicates to denying religious beliefs is legally subsumed under the exemption.

One of the principles of statutory interpretation is that all words are interpreted in their context. For your example, that means we look at the title of 1464, \"Broadcasting obscene language\". From this it becomes apparent that radio is used in its common meaning of AM and FM radio broadcasts.\n\nStatutory interpretation is broader than that single rule, though. Legislative intent is another important factor, and that is rather effective in eliminating absurd arguments. Via the link above, from New Mexico's State Court: words have their ordinary meaning *\"as long as the ordinary meaning does not render the statute's application absurd, unreasonable, or unjust.\"* In other words, absurdity is so bad that the court will prefer an alternative interpretation of the offending words.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following best describes the principle that prevents literal interpretations of laws from leading to absurd or unreasonable applications?\n\nA) The Absurdity Doctrine, which allows courts to ignore the plain meaning of a statute to avoid an absurd result\nB) The Plain Meaning Rule, which states that the words in a statute must always be interpreted literally\nC) The Legislative Intent Principle, which focuses solely on the original intent of the lawmakers\nD) The Contextual Interpretation Approach, which considers the overall context, title, and purpose of the law in addition to the literal text\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The Absurdity Doctrine is the principle that best addresses the concern raised in the question.

Prior to leaving the country, she had planned to renew her lease, until the landlord indicated the rent would be increasing $100 per month.\n\nThe Landlord has made it clear that they have the right to show the premises at any time, and no intention of relinquishing that right, and therefore my daughter must find someplace else to reside during her 14 day quarantine. This would seem to meet the definition of a Frustrated Contract.\n\n\u201cA frustrated contract is a contract that, subsequent to its formation, and without fault of either party, is incapable of being performed due to an unforeseen event (or events), resulting in the obligations under the contract being radically different from those contemplated by the parties to the contract.\u201d Cut and pasted from Google.\n\nRealizing that my daughter would not be allowed to quarantine in her rented premises, we moved all her belongings into storage, cleaned the suite and turned in the keys a week ago.\n\nWe have also noticed a very strange clause in her lease:\n\n2\\.(c ) The Terms and Conditions and all Schedules of this Lease continue with the Occupancy of the Owner\u2019s property by the Tenant until the Tenant either signs a new lease with the Owner or vacates the premises, which ever occurs first.\n\nThis seems very strange to me, but it appears that the Terms and Conditions of the lease have no effect after the Tenant vacates the premises.\n\nSo the question is, do we file a claim for Frustration or simply that the Tenant has vacated the premises and rent is no longer payable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The contract is not frustrated\n------------------------------\n\nThe fact that your daughter cannot reside in the premises for a period or that the landlord cannot show the premises does not amount to frustration. If the property had burned down \\- that might be frustration (if the lease didn\u2019t contemplate that \\- most do).\n\nUnfortunately, your daughter is obliged to comply with her obligations under the lease or she will be in breach. This includes paying rent until it ends and allowing the landlord to show the property as the lease permits.\n\nShe has correctly identified that if she quarantines in the property she will be preventing the landlord from showing it. She has two options:\n\n1. Quarantine elsewhere and comply with the lease,\n2. Quarantine at home, break the lease and pay damages to the landlord. The landlord would need to demonstrate that the breach had caused damage. That is, they would need to prove that being unable to show the property during the 2 week period had caused them to not be able to relet it and, probably, the maximum damage would be two weeks at the new rent \\- this would be full compensation for the two week delay in their ability to show the property.\n\nYour daughter chose 1\\., possibly without being aware that 2\\. was an option.\n\nIn common law jurisdictions, parties must comply with their contractural obligations even if extraneous factors (like government regulations) make that more difficult. Civil law jurisdictions have the doctrine in law of [force majeure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure) but in common law jurisdictions, that concept is a creature of contract. That is, a party is only released from an obligation hindered by an external factor if the contract deals with it. For example, if a government mandate shuts down a construction site, the builder must still complete by the date for completion notwithstanding. Or, remember the ship stuck in the Suez Canal? Other ships delayed by that event would still be required to pay if they were late unless the contract released them (common law), but could claim force majeure if the contract was under civil law.\n\nThe narrower doctrine of [frustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustration_of_purpose) requires that the *principal purpose* of the contract be impossible or radically altered by the extraneous event. The principal purpose of a residential lease is for the landlord to provide the dwelling and the tenant to pay rent: neither of these are affected so there is no frustration.

Is it illegal for her to keep my possessions without my consent?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, this is illegal. If by \"across the state\" you mean some distance away but in the same state then the exact law will depend on which state you are in, but as a rule any \"conversion\" of property to the use of another counts as theft. In this case your aunt has \"converted\" the property to the use of your Nan (funny legal phrase). The fact that the people doing this are your relatives makes no difference.\n\n(When asking about the law here you should always say which state you are in.)\n\nAlthough theft is a crime, you could also start a civil case to get your property back without involving the police. The details depend on where you are, but try googling \"(your state) small claims court\". Many states have a process for collecting low\\-value debts or other property without needing lawyers.\n\nYou need to have a firm conversation with your aunt about this. Tell her that you want your property back, and don't back down. Also call your Nan and explain this to her as well; she may not have realised that she is in possession of stolen property, which is usually a separate crime.\n\nIf you want more advice on how to get your property back without starting a family row then you might ask on the Interpersonal Skills SE, but it might be better to start with \"When are you planning to return my property?\" and leave \"You are a thief\" as a last resort.\n\n**Edit:** As Eric Nolan points out in the comments, you may be a minor. If you are under 18 then your aunt has authority over you that she wouldn't have if you were older. For instance, if she is concerned about your use of video games impacting school\\-work then confiscating your console and putting it out of your reach would be perfectly legal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: John, a 19-year-old college student, lives with his aunt. While he's away at school, his aunt takes his gaming console and expensive headphones to his grandmother's house in another city without his permission. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) This is a family matter and not a legal issue, so John has no recourse.\nB) John's aunt has committed theft by converting his property without permission, regardless of family ties.\nC) As John's guardian, his aunt has the legal right to move his possessions as she sees fit.\nD) John can only pursue legal action if the value of the items exceeds $5000.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the documentation, taking someone's property without their consent and converting it to another's use counts as theft, even when done by family members. The fact that John is 19 years old means he is not a minor, so his aunt does not have authority over his possessions. Answer A is incorrect because this is indeed a legal issue, not just a family matter. Answer C would only be applicable if John were a minor, which he is not at 19. Answer D is incorrect because there is no such value threshold mentioned in the documentation for pursuing legal action in this case."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/91722/why-do-blatant-copyright-infringements-not-get-prosecuted", "docs_id": 91722, "title": "Why do blatant copyright infringements not get prosecuted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I feel like everywhere you go you'll see copyright infringement. When I open social media, people post copyrighted videos and photos all the time. I suppose I'm assuming they've not got permission \\- but what 30 follower account is able to get permission from big movie studios etc?\n\nMy question \\- Why is this kind of infringement not acted on more, and prosecuted? For example:\n\n1. There are so many YouTube Shorts that just blatantly post clips of Movies, Football games, TV Programmes, etc. Why do these never get in trouble? Perhaps they get a copyright strike, but surely they would be prosecuted/sued?\n2. There are 'Leak' sites for mods of games, which operate under the proviso of having all content that is uploaded copyright free and not owned by a single entity. Enough so that newer users may not be aware that they're downloading pirated items/stolen source code. Why do those who upload to these sites, or even host these sites, not get in trouble, and prosecuted/sued, or even those that download from these sites?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: * You are wrong that they never get into legal trouble. It isn't terribly common but it certainly happens to those that get relatively prominent.\n* Many of the folks doing the copyright infringement are judgement proof. It makes little sense for Disney, for example, to sue some guy living in his parents' basement for uploading a clip of their movie when that guy has no assets. Financially, it wouldn't be worth the cost of a lawyer.\n* Many of the folks doing the copyright infringement are in jurisdictions that look the other way. If you're a Russian citizen pirating content owned by American companies, the Russian authorities aren't going to cooperate and arrest you and the American companies likely can't recover any judgement they'd get because you don't have any assets in America.\n* There is a whack\\-a\\-mole problem. If there are hundreds of people posting pirated content to Facebook and each one is running hundreds of pages, that's tens of thousands of pages posting content. By the time you identify and close all of them, the pirates will have created tens of thousands of new pages.\n* There is a cat\\-and\\-mouse problem. Copyright owners have automated tools to scan for their IP to issue takedown notices. Piraters know this so they modify the video (posting it as a mirror image or adding some additional video elements) in order to evade the automated tools. If copyright owners have to manually identify pirated content, it's realistically not cost effective to do so. The humans finding that content would cost more than the business loses in revenue to pirates.\n* Tracking down the actual human/ business behind the copyright infringement is often a fair amount of work and may involve motions in courts in multiple countries. That work tends not to be highly prioritized by law enforcement.

You might register a name as a trademark, but you would need to clarify with examples what you mean by \"prefix\" and a \"suffix\" (these have specific technical meanings in linguistics, and grammatical parts of a language \u2013 e.g. \"un\\-\", \"dis\\-\", \"\\-able\", \"\\-ation\") cannot be protected as trademarks. But straying from the technical meaning of prefix and suffix, as [USPTO points out](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/BasicFacts.pdf), \"A trademark is generally a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a **combination thereof**\". If \"Apple\" can be registered and \"\\-tini\" can be registered, then the combination \"Appletini\" can be protected. \n\nWhether or not \"Apple\" can be registered as a trademark depends on whether there is a likelihood of confusion. In the domain of computers, it clearly would be, but not in the domain of trucks. A further consideration in trademark protection is whether it is \"descriptive\" versus \"fanciful\". A term like \"Flimptang\" does not at all describe a product, whereas \"Carwax\" effectively describes car wax.

The full game title (prefix + suffix) could potentially be trademarked if it meets other trademark requirements.\nC is incorrect because simply trademarking a prefix alone may not be possible, especially if it's descriptive or not unique enough to identify the brand.\nD is incorrect because while grammatical prefixes themselves cannot be trademarked, the question likely refers to a word or phrase at the beginning of a title, which could potentially be part of a trademark if combined with other elements.\n\nThe key is that trademarks protect brand identifiers, and a full game title combining a consistent prefix with unique suffixes could potentially serve this purpose, while individual parts or common words may not be protectable on their own."}}
