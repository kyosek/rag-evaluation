            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Normally UK mortgages are fixed to a person, but portable/transferable between properties.\n\nDisregarding the 80\\+% of flats which are leasehold with no share of the freehold, is there anything in law preventing the opposite?\n\n(Motivation/curiosity: I have seen this in other countries where 20\\-30 year fixed rate mortgages are popular at the current low rates and don't give problems if people want to sell up, because they transfer the mortgage to the buyer of their property.\n\nThe only time a short/medium term mortgage would make sense there would be if interest rates were high and you expect them to drop \u2013 or to make up the price increase between the previous purchase price/mortgage and the current purchase price of a house if it is affordable and sensible to pay that off faster to pay less interest.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A little looking around, for example, [here](http://www.mortgage-finder.co.uk/how-a-mortgage-works/how-a-mortgage-works.html), seem to indicate that the mortgage products currently on offer in the U.K. are primarily and in principle, at least, a matter of banking custom and practice (i.e. primarily economic decisions made by banks rather than a system mandated by regulators), rather than being mandated in all cases (and [porting is not always possible](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/mortgages/porting-your-mortgage)). \n\nBut, it also appears that there are [regulatory safe harbors](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/borrowing/mortgages/11336328/Now-millions-face-mortgage-porting-woes-when-moving.html) and [institutional arrangements](https://www.cml.org.uk/news/news-and-views/378/) that make it hard to change that depart from a pure freedom of contract regime. \n\nFor example, in the U.K., some loan underwriting standards are mandated by banking regulators who recently made those regulations more strict with the express mandate (ignored by the major banks for the most part) that these standards could not be applied to existing customers porting their mortgages to new properties.\n\nAn example of how customary practice can make it hard to change is that, while U.K. law permits fixed rate loans for the 10 to 30 year periods that are common in the U.S., when combined with portability, the economic risk faced by U.K. banks is much greater than in the U.S. where mortgages must be paid off when the property is sold and generally cannot be either assigned to the existing owner or ported with the seller. Because U.S. mortgages generally can't be ported or assumed by new owners, U.S. fixed rate mortgages are paid off, on average, every ten years, even though the home owner could choose to live in the same home and keep the mortgage for thirty years. This limits, in practice, the risk that U.S. banks face when they allow customers to lock into a low thirty year fixed interest rate. (U.S. reformers tend to focus on making loans assumable and limiting the availability of prepayment penalties and wouldn't even dream of trying to establish portable mortgages.)\n\nSimilarly, while U.K. law does not require pre\\-payment penalties, the economic bargain involved in a U.K. mortgage has banks relying on people not pre\\-paying their loans or paying pre\\-payment penalties in order to establish the creditworthiness of the bank to regulators and third parties.\n\nSo, while it might be possible in theory to allow an assignable version of a U.S. mortgage which is tied to the property and not the person, in the U.K., one would have to simultaneously change other aspects of the transaction and the way that banks estimate their cash flow to meet their own obligations, for this change to work, something that would probably require regulatory cooperation to work in practice.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK mortgage market, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the nature of mortgage products and their transferability?\n\nA) UK mortgage products are entirely regulated by law, with no flexibility for banks to offer different terms.\n\nB) UK mortgages are always portable between properties due to strict regulatory requirements.\n\nC) UK mortgage products are primarily determined by banking custom and practice, with some regulatory influence.\n\nD) UK mortgages cannot be transferred or ported under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided indicates that UK mortgage products are primarily determined by banking custom and practice, rather than being strictly mandated by regulators. However, there are regulatory safe harbors and institutional arrangements that influence these products. This means banks have some flexibility in their offerings, but are also constrained by regulatory frameworks and industry norms.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because UK mortgage products are not entirely regulated by law. There is room for banks to make economic decisions about their offerings.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while portability is a common feature of UK mortgages, it is not always possible or guaranteed due to various factors including regulatory changes and bank policies.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because UK mortgages can often be ported or transferred, although this is not universally true for all mortgage products or situations."

The outcome often depends on how arguments are presented in court, which is why both sides in a legal dispute might believe they can win.\n\nOption A is incorrect because legal interpretations are often not clear-cut, as evidenced by the conflicting answers in the example.\n\nOption B is false because expert opinions do matter in legal cases, whether they go to court or not.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while a judge's opinion is crucial, legal experts' opinions are important in shaping arguments and understanding complex legal issues.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nature of legal interpretation and the uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings."

But I thought I don't need to do this, because my project is completely private. I will not publish this project whatsoever.\n\nOnly me and 2 friends use my software.\n\nDo I really have to Open Source my project?\n\nAnd if yes, is it enough to just publish the code parts using the software?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You need to know two things about the GPL:\n\n* The GPL is a license which requires that when you distribute binaries, you distribute the source code with them (binaries being the things you can directly run)\n* The GPL is *copyleft* \\- any project using something licensed under the GPL must also be licensed under the GPL\n\nThe easiest way to comply with the first point is to simply make the software open source by making it available to all online. Many, if not all, large projects licensed under the GPL do this.\n\nThe other way of complying is to simply give anyone else who has a copy of the binaries, or who makes use of them, a copy of the source code. In your case, all you need to do is send your friends a copy of the source. As long as no one else uses this project, I think you satisfy the requirements of the license.\n\nYou must, however, also license your code under the GPL. This means, as mentioned in the comments, that you must somehow make your friends aware that if they redistribute your code, they must also do so under the terms of the GPL. This can be as simple as including a file called `LICENSE` in the root directory of the source code, containing a copy of the text of the GPL.\n\nThis further means that your friends will be able to share your code with other people without letting you know. You could politely ask them not to, but you can't stop them.\n\n(That said, you have no reason to be worried \\- only big breaches of license misuse by large companies ever tend to get chased up. However, it's great that you want to be careful about this! Software licensing, especially FOSS licensing, is very important.)",

Additionally, the copyleft nature of GPL means that any project using GPL-licensed code must also be licensed under GPL. The developer doesn't need to make the project publicly available online, but must provide the source code to the two friends who use it and license the entire project under GPL. This ensures that if the friends decide to redistribute the code, they must do so under the terms of the GPL."

Does re\\-domiciliation imply a retroactive breach of US laws with regards to said equity raise ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The question does not provide all of the necessary information.\n\nThe sale of securities not registered with the SEC that are issued by a foreign company to a non\\-accredited investor in the U.S. are a violation of the Securities Act of 1933 which governs public offerings of securities under U.S. law. There are exceptions to this rule, that don't obviously apply in the circumstances describe by the original post, but the mere fact that the issuer is not organized or based in the U.S. does not mean that it is exempt from the '33 Act.\n\nOn the other hand, if the non\\-accredited investors of the foreign issuer were all non\\-U.S. persons, there would be no securities fraud violations under U.S. law or the law of any U.S. state when the securities were issued.\n\n> what happens if the aforementioned offshore company re\\-domiciliates to\n>  U.S., specifically Delaware? Does re\\-domiciliation imply a\n>  retroactive breach of US laws with regards to said equity raise?\n\nThe re\\-incorporation of the foreign issuer in the State of Delaware in the United States would not be a retroactive violation of the Securities Act of 1933, which governs public offerings of securities in the United States, because a change in a corporation's place of organization does not constitute a public offering under the '33 Act.\n\nBut, as noted above, if the foreign issuer of the securities sold securities to U.S. investors prior to the relocation and without registering the sale with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, those sales could have been '33 Act violations in the first instance, despite the fact that it was a foreign issuer. And, re\\-incorporation of the foreign issuer in Delaware might very well bring the company's previous '33 Act violations, if any, to the attention of the SEC even if the SEC had not previously been aware of those violations.\n\nBut, upon relocation to Delaware, the formerly foreign issuer would, going forward, be subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\\. This act requires companies that are listed on a U.S. stock exchange, or are organized in the U.S. with [more than $10 million in assets whose securities are held by more than 500 owners](https://www.sec.gov/answers/about-lawsshtml.html) to file annual and other periodic reports, and to comply with other regulatory requirements applicable only to publicly held companies.",

The company is now considering re-domiciling to Delaware. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The company's previous share sales to non-accredited U.S. investors were legal because the company was foreign at the time, and re-domiciling to Delaware will have no impact on the legality of those sales.\n\nB) Re-domiciling to Delaware will automatically make the previous share sales to non-accredited U.S. investors illegal, exposing the company to immediate SEC penalties.\n\nC) The previous share sales to non-accredited U.S. investors may have violated the Securities Act of 1933, regardless of the company's foreign status, and re-domiciling to Delaware could bring these potential violations to the SEC's attention.\n\nD) Re-domiciling to Delaware will retroactively legalize any previous share sales to non-accredited U.S. investors, protecting the company from SEC scrutiny.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The sale of securities to non-accredited U.S. investors by a foreign company, without proper SEC registration, may violate the Securities Act of 1933, even if the company is foreign. Re-domiciling to Delaware doesn't create a retroactive violation, but it could draw the SEC's attention to any existing violations. Additionally, once re-domiciled, the company would become subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, requiring it to comply with U.S. reporting and regulatory requirements for public companies going forward."

Alice clearly owns the copyright to the lyrics as they are solely her creation. However, the music copyright is less straightforward.

Under Section 91FA a \"child\" means a person who is *under* the age of 16 years \\- the situation you describe would be between consenting adults in NSW. \u201cChild abuse material\u201d can be text or images that are sexually explicit and would be \u201coffensive\u201d to a normal person (which means offensive to the particular jury)\n\nAssuming Jane is 15 or less, however, *prima facie* the image would be child abuse material and under Section 91H \"A person who produces, disseminates or possesses child abuse material is guilty of an offence.\" The punishment is up to 10 years in jail.\n\nSection 91H provides a number of defences, the most relevant to the circumstances you describe being:\n\n1. that the defendant did not know, and could not reasonably be expected to have known, that he or she produced, disseminated or possessed (as the case requires) child abuse material.\n2. that the material concerned came into the defendant\u2019s possession unsolicited and the defendant, as soon as he or she became aware of its nature, took reasonable steps to get rid of it. (for possession only)\n\nIf, considering **all** the circumstances of the relationship, Joe doesn't know and could not reasonably be expected to know Jane's age then he can use the defence under S91H(1\\). If he did not request the picture and as soon as he was aware of Jane's age, deleted it, then he can use the defence under S91H(2\\).\n\nThe outcome is not so rosy for Jane: she is guilty of both production and dissemination of child abuse material and (assuming she knows how old she is) faces up to 10 years in jail (14 if she is under 14\\) and registration on the Sex Offenders List for life. It is admittedly unlikely in the circumstances that the state would prosecute her and, if they did, it is very likely that the judge would rule that no conviction be recorded.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In NSW, Australia, 20-year-old Alex receives an unsolicited sexually explicit image from 15-year-old Sam through a messaging app. Sam had previously told Alex they were 18. Alex is shocked upon learning Sam's real age and immediately deletes the image. Under the NSW Crimes Act 1900, what is Alex's legal situation?\n\nA) Alex is automatically guilty of possessing child abuse material and faces up to 10 years in jail.\nB) Alex has no legal liability as long as they can prove Sam lied about their age.\nC) Alex may have a valid defense under Section 91H if they can demonstrate they couldn't reasonably have known Sam's age and took immediate action to delete the image.\nD) Alex is required to report the incident to authorities or face charges of failing to report child abuse.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the NSW Crimes Act 1900, Alex may have a valid defense under Section 91H. This section provides two relevant defenses:\n1. The defendant did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known they possessed child abuse material.\n2. The material came into the defendant's possession unsolicited, and they took reasonable steps to get rid of it as soon as they became aware of its nature.\n\nIn this scenario, Alex meets both these criteria:\n- They were led to believe Sam was 18, so they couldn't reasonably have known they were receiving material from a minor.\n- The image was unsolicited, and Alex deleted it immediately upon learning Sam's real age.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because mere possession of such material is prima facie an offense, but defenses are available. Option D is incorrect as there's no mandatory reporting requirement in this situation for individuals not in positions of authority or care."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: What is (if any) the offense for claiming a piece of collaborative work as an individual work.\n\nMore concretely, if a thesis was the collaborative effort of multiple personnel but one decided to claim that it was his/her own work, what offense did he/she commit? (copyright? theft?)\n\nFurthermore, say said person contributed vastly more than the others, will his claim be justified / more justifiable?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: One possibility is that the person submitting the thesis can have their degree revoked. This is not strictly a legal matter, rather it is a matter between the student and their university, where the university can, after a process, revoke the degree. The grounds would be a violation of university rules pertaining to requirements for the degree, specifically the part where the student must submit a thesis representing \"independent research\". The exact wording of the requirement is obviously institution\\-dependent, and of course no university requires completely autonomous and isolated research and writing in the production of a thesis. It would be rather off\\-topic though fascinating to collects anecdotes on variation between institutions on what degree of collaboration is deemed acceptable. From the legal perspective, the student whose degree is revoked could attempt to sue the university for the revocation, since the student has a property interest in the degree, but generally university proceedings are held by the courts to be valid.\n\nAnother way to \"claim\" a work as your own is with respect to copyright. In that case, though, there has to be more than vague collaboration, there has to be actual co\\-authorship. The basic legal idea is that when multiple authors write a work, they jointly own the work (the work is called a \"joint work\"). The basic definition of a joint work under 17 USC 101 is \"a work prepared by two or more authors with the intention that their contributions be merged into inseparable or interdependent parts of a unitary whole\". Sharing of ideas or lab results doesn't make something a joint work, there has to be actual co\\-writing.\n\nThe US Copyright Office interprets that as meaning that authors have equal rights to the work (an undivided ownership share): in other words, any author can grant permission to publish, and a copyright license of transfer of rights does not have to be agreed on by both authors. However, profits are to be shared equally among the authors, in the same way that joint partners in a business venture share the profits of their business. This is so even if one author writes 90% of the work and the other one writes 10%.\n\nThis can then lead to a legal problem between the publisher and the non\\-signatory author. Typically, when a work is published, the publisher obtains from the contributor either a license to reproduce, or else a transfer of copyright, which allows the publisher to reproduce the work. Such agreements typically contain a clause where the contributor warrants that they have the right to transfer / license and that they are the sole author, or else the co\\-authors have been identified in the agreement (in which case the publisher pursues each author to get a signature on an agreement form). And there is almost surely an indemnification clause, saying that the contributor will indemnify the publisher against any infringement claims. Which is another way of saying, if it turns out that the contributor does not have the right to fully assign copyright to the work and the publisher gets sued, the contributor must cover the publisher's legal costs and possible losses from a judgment. As a co\\-author, you cannot grant an exclusive license (as some publishers will require).",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A graduate student, Alex, submits a thesis that was largely a collaborative effort with two other students, but Alex claims it as entirely their own work. The university discovers this and revokes Alex's degree. Alex decides to sue the university. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The university's decision will likely be overturned because Alex has absolute ownership of the degree once it's granted.\n\nB) The court will likely side with Alex if they can prove they contributed more than 50% of the work.\n\nC) The university's decision will likely be upheld by the court, as academic institutions have broad discretion in enforcing their own rules.\n\nD) Alex can claim copyright infringement against the university for revoking the degree based on joint authorship laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Courts generally respect the autonomy of academic institutions to enforce their own rules and standards, including those related to academic integrity. The revocation of a degree for misrepresenting collaborative work as individual work would likely be seen as within the university's purview. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while a degree does represent a property interest, it's not absolute and can be revoked for valid reasons.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the proportion of work contributed doesn't justify misrepresenting collaborative work as individual, especially in an academic context where proper attribution is crucial.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because copyright infringement is not applicable in this scenario. The issue at hand is academic misconduct, not a copyright dispute."

Simply using it gives rise to common law trademark rights without any filing in many countries in the places and markets where you use it, and you can't obtain a trademark until you are using it in commerce in a country or imminently about to do so. \n\nBut, unlike a patent which goes into the public domain if you don't timely perfect it with a patent filing, a trademark can be obtained at any time before someone else is granted the same trademark in the some geographic area in which you seek one, in the market for goods or services of the same type as you are seeking.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company has been using its trademark in the United States for 2 years and now wants to expand internationally. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding international trademark protection?\n\nA) The company has a 12-month grace period from the US filing date to file for international trademark protection.\n\nB) The company can file for a global trademark that will protect their mark in all countries simultaneously.\n\nC) The company can obtain trademark protection in other countries at any time, as long as no one else has already been granted the same trademark in those countries for similar goods or services.\n\nD) The company must wait until they have been using the trademark in a foreign country for at least 1 year before applying for protection there.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Unlike patents, there is no specific grace period for filing international trademarks. Companies can seek trademark protection in other countries at any time, provided that no one else has already been granted the same trademark in those countries for similar goods or services. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it confuses trademark rules with patent rules. The 12-month grace period applies to patents, not trademarks.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because there is no such thing as a global trademark. Trademarks must be obtained separately in each country where protection is sought.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there is no requirement to use a trademark in a foreign country for a specific period before applying for protection. In fact, many countries allow you to file for trademark protection based on intent to use."

This is because the landlord cannot legally take possession of the apartment or re-rent it until they have confirmation that the tenant has moved out.

This obligation can extend beyond the original lease expiration date if the tenant fails to properly communicate their departure and return the keys."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: \n> **tl/dr:** My property manager (PM) states that I'm responsible for all maintenance under $200 in the home, regardless of whether it is the result of damage I\n>  cause. This is on the basis of a clause in the lease that I find very\n>  ambiguous. This also is at odds with my (admittedly non\\-expert)\n>  understanding of real estate law. Is it possible I'm actually on the\n>  hook for repairs clearly caused by standard wear\\-and\\-tear, and which\n>  are not at all my fault?\n\nI just moved into a new rental home and there have been a number of maintenance items that have needed repair, which the owner has paid for. However the property manager has recently stated that we are responsible for *all* maintenance items under $200\\. That sounds very much at odds with my understanding of \"real estate law\" (aka the landlord is always responsible for basic wear and tear), and didn't sound like anything I read in the lease so I looked it over. There are two clauses in the lease related to maintenance:\n\n> **TENANT TO MAINTAIN; USE OF PREMISES;**\n> \n> \n> TENANT shall be responsible for the cost of all minor repairs and\n>  damages to the PREMISES due to the default, negligence, or willful\n>  misconduct of TENANT or TENANT'S family or guests, including \\[long\n>  list of perfectly reasonable things]. TENANT to alert the LANDLORD to\n>  any declining conditions inside and outside of the PREMISES included\n>  but not limited to \\[another list of things].\n\nThis seems perfectly normal and reasonable to me. Farther down it says:\n\n> **Maintenance:** The Tenant agrees to properly maintain the home and complete, at his own expense, all daily maintenance EXCLUDING furnace/AC, water heater, appliance replacement and major repairs. The tenant is responsible for the cleaning of all clogged drain lines. If the home is located within a community governed by a Homeowners Association, Tenant does hereby agree to abide by the rules and bylaws of said Association (*Exceeding $200 maintenance threshold contact owner/landlord*)\n\n(emphasis mine). That last bit \\- `Exceeding $200 maintenance threshold contact owner/landlord` \\- is what the PM pointed to as establishing that I am responsible for *all* maintenance under $200\\. That is not at all how I understood that sentence. The reason is because this is a section talking about *daily maintenance*, i.e. the regular things that need to happen to keep a house running \\- changing air filters, light bulbs, snow removal, etc... and that the $200 threshold only applies to items such as these. However the PM believes this means that I'm instead responsible for any maintenance under $200\\.\n\nTo pick a specific example, the basement just lost all power. An electrician just left and determined that there is a wiring issue in the walls and a new wire needs to be run. From the perspective of the PM, if the electrician charges less than $200 it is my responsibility because of this clause in the lease.\n\nI can't decide if I simply misread this lease because of my own expectations on the division of duties between tenant and landlord (aka the landlord is *always* responsible for all normal wear and tear \\- such as a wire breaking somewhere in the walls), or if the PMs understanding of this clause is completely at odds with basic property management law and therefore incorrect. Obviously though I need to figure out which is the case so I know how to respond. If I signed a lease I shouldn't have because I misread an important clause, then I'm going to have to eat this one and let it be the cost of learning an important lesson... So...\n\n**Is my PMs understanding of the situation correct?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Bizarrely, it depends on where you live in Kentucky. There is [a law](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/chapter.aspx?id=39159), the Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (KRS 383\\.500 to 383\\.705\\) which states limits on residential leases (otherwise, the matter would be governed by the terms of the contract and common law). The state didn't enact those laws as enforceable in the state, it \"made them available\" for cities, counties and urban\\-county governments to adopt unmodified (or not). So it depends in part on whether your locale adopted the law. Assuming it did, in the [definitions](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=35726), \n\n> (13\\)\"Security deposit\" means an escrow payment made to the landlord\n>  under the rental agreement for the purpose of securing the \n>  landlord against financial loss due to damage to the premises \n>  occasioned by the tenant's occupancy **other than ordinary wear\n>  and tear**.\n\n(emphasis added)\nThat would mean that they can't take the cost of carpet cleaning, painting etc. out of your security deposit.\n\n[\u00a7383\\.595](https://apps.legislature.ky.gov/law/statutes/statute.aspx?id=35736) (again, if applicable) states the obligations of the landlord, so he must\n\n> Maintain in good and safe working order and condition \n>  all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, \n>  air\\-conditioning, and other facilities and appliances, including \n>  elevators, supplied or required to be supplied by him\n\nSo it depends on whether the URLTA was enacted in your jurisdiction. [This page](http://kyjustice.org/node/708) indicates where that is the law, and also urges you to read the lease.",

The Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (URLTA) was made available for cities, counties, and urban-county governments to adopt, but it's not uniformly enforced across the state. In areas where URLTA has been adopted, it would typically require landlords to maintain electrical systems and other essential facilities, potentially overriding lease clauses that attempt to shift those costs to tenants. However, in areas where URLTA hasn't been adopted, the lease terms might have more weight.\n\nA is incorrect because the lease terms are not always binding if they contradict applicable local laws.\n\nB is incorrect because there is no state-wide law that universally overrides such lease terms; it depends on local adoption of URLTA.\n\nD is incorrect because while this might be a reasonable interpretation of the lease clause, the question is about legal enforceability, not just lease interpretation."

Further, if you do not give attribution to or deal in a derogatory way with the holder of any moral copyright, you are breaching their rights as well. The commercial and moral copyright holder(s) may or may not be the same people.\n\nIf you are alleged to have infringed copyright you may be able to avail yourself of a fair dealing/use defense, however, in the circumstances you describe this is unlikely to be successful. Basically, what you are describing is **not** fair dealing/use.\n\nIt is unlikely that what you are proposing would be considered *criminal* infringement so you would not be subject to criminal sanctions like gaol time or fines.\n\nYou are open to being sued by the copyright (commercial and/or moral) holder. If you can prove innocent infringement (i.e. that you made all reasonable efforts to determine who the copyright holders are and sought their permission) then your damages are limited to an accounting of profits (i.e. you have to pay them the profit you made by breaching their copyright).\n\nIn the contract with your client you can require them to provide you with an indemnity against defense costs and damages: this means you can sue them if you get sued. Of course, if they have no money this doesn't really help. You can also take out insurance against this, however, their liability will be excluded if you breach the terms of your insurance contract.\n\nWhat you need to do\n-------------------\n\n1. Find the copyright owner. For photos, the commercial copyright holder is usually the photographer or the photographer's employer: **it is not the subject of the photograph!** For text, the commercial copyright holder is usually the author or their employer. The moral copyright is usually held by the photographer/author unless they have assigned their right to someone else.\n2. Get and document their permission and publish in accordance with the permission given (including attribution etc.).\n3. If you cannot determine the copyright owner, you may be able to determine if the works are public domain. In general, anything created before the 20th century is public domain: things more recent than that are harder to be definitive about.

Which of the following actions would BEST protect the designer from potential copyright infringement claims?\n\nA) Having the client sign a contract stating they own all copyrights to the provided materials and will indemnify the designer against any claims\nB) Assuming all materials provided by the client are copyright-free and proceeding with the work\nC) Independently verifying the copyright status of all materials, obtaining necessary permissions, and documenting the process\nD) Only using materials that were created before the 20th century to ensure they are in the public domain\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A, while providing some protection through indemnification, does not actually prevent copyright infringement. The client may not actually own the copyrights they claim to.\nOption B is dangerous as it assumes copyright ownership without verification, which could lead to infringement.\nOption D severely limits the usable materials and is not practical for a modern Facebook page.\nOption C is the best approach as it involves due diligence in verifying copyright status, obtaining necessary permissions, and maintaining documentation. This process helps ensure that the designer is not unknowingly infringing on copyrights and provides the strongest protection against potential claims."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An employee left their job two years ago and is now trying to withdraw funds from their 401(k) plan. The ex-employer, who is also the plan administrator, has denied signing the distribution papers. Additionally, a police report was filed against the former employee a month after leaving the company, possibly related to embezzlement. What is the most accurate statement regarding the ex-employer's ability to withhold the 401(k) funds?\n\nA) The ex-employer can indefinitely withhold the 401(k) funds due to the pending police investigation.\nB) The ex-employer has no right to withhold the 401(k) funds under any circumstances.\nC) The ex-employer can withhold the 401(k) funds, but only for a maximum of one year after the employee's departure.\nD) As a general rule, the 401(k) funds should not be withheld due to disputes with the former employer, but legal counsel may be needed to facilitate the distribution.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the documentation, as a general rule, a 401(k) is not held up by pending disputes with the former employer. However, the situation is complex due to the potential criminal charge, and the employee may need legal counsel to handle communications with the plan administrator and possibly the ex-employer. While the funds should not be withheld indefinitely, resolving the distribution may require professional legal assistance. Options A, B, and C are incorrect as they either overstate or understate the ex-employer's ability to withhold the funds, or provide specific time frames not mentioned in the original text."

According to the America Invents Act (AIA) of 2012, if a company keeps an invention as a trade secret rather than patenting it, they risk someone else independently inventing and patenting the same technology. In this case, Company X's secret development doesn't count as published prior art, which is what's typically considered in patent examinations.

Company X may have limited rights to continue using their process to the extent they were using it before, but they cannot prevent Company Y from obtaining a patent on the independently developed technology.

The fact that Alex is the director doesn't grant him the right to forge others' signatures. The use of forged signatures to obtain tax exemptions is particularly problematic and could be seen as deliberate fraud against the government.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A software company releases a product with a license stating it is \"free for non-commercial use only.\" A freelance graphic designer downloads and uses this software for client projects without purchasing a commercial license. The software company discovers this and decides to take legal action. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal proceedings?\n\nA) International law will automatically rule in favor of the software company, regardless of where the case is filed.\n\nB) The case will be decided based on the laws of the country where the software was developed, regardless of where the designer is located.\n\nC) The outcome will depend on the jurisdiction where the claim is filed, the court's interpretation of the license terms, and any relevant local legislation.\n\nD) Since the software was offered for free initially, the company has no legal grounds to pursue action against the designer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because, as stated in the documentation, international law has little direct influence on private contracts like software licenses. Instead, the case would be decided based on the laws and interpretation of the court in the jurisdiction where the claim is filed. The court would consider the specific wording of the license agreement, any applicable local laws, and how these apply to the designer's use of the software. Options A and B are incorrect because they oversimplify the legal process and ignore the importance of local jurisdiction. Option D is incorrect because offering a free version for non-commercial use doesn't negate the company's right to enforce its license terms for commercial usage."

You do not make any financial transactions or impersonate anyone (you use the name John Doe for example), and you are old enough to use the site in real life. Aside from permanently banning you from using their services (for violation of Terms of Service), can they legally do anything else? Are they likely to legally do anything else?\n\nWhat if you were not old enough to use the site originally, but are now (say, you created an account at age 12, which is generally not old enough to use websites, but are now eligible)? What if your use of false information allows you to create multiple accounts in violation of the Terms of Service, but this does not lead to any damages? For example, suppose a social media site wants to prevent duplicate accounts, so it searches for users with the same name, birthdate, and IP address, but since you used your real name and birthdate on one and false information on the other, the social media site assumes these are different users.\n\nAssume that this process never required making a fake ID.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are three main aspects to this:\n\n1. **Its their website, and their terms of service**. They can enforce those terms, or change them (in some appropriate manner). **You have no recourse if they remove you, block you, or delete your account, for example**. That's the measure that you would probably have, virtually every time.\n2. **To claim damages, or litigate beyond just website access control**, requires a legal claim. But there's a catch there. To claim damages, **they need to show *actual damage*, which they wish to be compensated for**. If you misused their website but no actual harm can be shown, the total damage claimable is zero, whether or not you followed their rules. Merely entering dishonest information isn't by itself harm. So they would have to show they suffered damage/harm because of that, which is directly attributable to your behaviour, was foreseeably harmful etc, or similar. They also need to consider legal costs, and ability to enforce, especially if you are in a different country.\n3. **If for some reason the computer use was also illegal**, then a criminal act could be committed and they could notify law enforcement. For example suppose you did this in the little known country of Honestania, where the law says that to prevent trolling and online abuse, anything posted on social media under any but your own legal name is a crime. Or suppose you'd been banned from the system and ignoring/evading such a ban was criminal computer use or criminal trespass due to the forbidden/unauthorised access (which can happen in several places). But this is purely for completeness; I guess you'd know if you were taking it further, into criminal computer use.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John, aged 17, creates an account on SocialConnect using a fake name and birthdate, claiming to be 21 years old. He uses this account for a year without engaging in any financial transactions or impersonating a real person. Upon turning 18, John creates another account using his real information. SocialConnect's terms of service prohibit users under 18 and multiple accounts per person. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal consequences for John?\n\nA) SocialConnect can sue John for damages caused by his fake account, even without proof of financial loss.\nB) John has committed a criminal offense by violating SocialConnect's terms of service and can be prosecuted.\nC) SocialConnect's only recourse is to ban John's accounts and prevent him from using the service in the future.\nD) John can be held legally liable for identity theft since he used a fake name and birthdate.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, SocialConnect's primary recourse would be to ban John's accounts and prevent him from using the service in the future. This is because:\n\n1. Websites have the right to enforce their terms of service, which includes removing users or deleting accounts that violate these terms.\n2. To pursue legal action or claim damages, SocialConnect would need to demonstrate actual harm caused by John's actions, which is not evident in this scenario.\n3. Simply providing false information or creating multiple accounts, while against the terms of service, does not automatically constitute a criminal offense.\n4. John did not engage in identity theft as he did not impersonate a real person or use the fake identity for financial gain.\n\nOptions A, B, and D are incorrect because they overstate the potential legal consequences in this situation. Without proof of actual damages or criminal intent, SocialConnect's options are generally limited to enforcing their own platform rules."

(There may be some specific exclusions, especially at lower levels). In fact, it does compete with private industry in multiple fields.\n\nIn general, however, government does not compete with private industry, as a policy, because the government does not care about making money (insert comment about budget deficits here).\n\nA small, and incomplete, list of ways government competes with private industry in the US:\n\n1. Unemployment, Disability, and (low income) Medical Insurance, with the added bonus of the government forces you to participate (e.g. SSI).\n2.

According to the information provided, it is generally not illegal for the US government to compete with private industry. However, as a matter of policy, the government often chooses not to compete, primarily because it doesn't prioritize profit-making. Despite this general approach, there are several areas where the government does compete with private industry, including unemployment insurance, subsidized housing, postal services, security services, and public transportation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no blanket law prohibiting government competition with private industry. Answer B is also incorrect, as there's no specific prohibition just for software and technology sectors. Answer D is incorrect because the Freedom from Government Competition Act has not been enacted into law; it's only been proposed by Senator Thune."

Now Pence is prevented from completing the count \u201cin the presence of\u201d the House, as the Constitution requires. \\[\u2026]\n\nHowever, the Electoral Count Act has the following language in Sec. 7:\n\n> \\[\u2026] Such joint meeting shall not be dissolved until the count of electoral votes shall be completed and the result declared; \\[\u2026]\n\nThe language of the Act is rather dense, so maybe I'm missing something, but to me this sounds that the Speaker of the House is not entitled to act as laid out in the Atlantic scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: That scenario is a bit fanciful. Under the law, the president of the Senate presides and maintains order for this joint session, so any expulsion declaration from the floor would be out of order.

However, merely meeting the time requirement doesn't automatically transfer legal title. The adverse possessor can include the property in their will, but their heir (in this case, the child) would need to complete the legal process of claiming adverse possession to secure the title. This process involves proving continuous, open, and exclusive possession for the required period.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: According to [this](http://www.ffuk.no/about-the-fund-for-performing-artists.70865.en.html), Norway has a \"joint collecting society in Norway for musicians, performing artists and phonogram producers\", Gramo, that performing artists must pay a levy to Gramo when publicly performing works that are in the public domain.\n\nAccording to [this](http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-community/2014-October/008866.html), there are \"legal provisions\" in place that ensure this.\n\nWhat exactly are these legal provisions?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While it's hard to prove a negative, it looks to me like the claim is false and arises from a misunderstanding of who pays the levy and who receives it. \n\nReference text\n==============\n\nFor reference, I'm going to cite the relevant passage of your first link from FFUK, the Norwegian fund for performing artists:\n\n> Changes in legislation entail that users must pay remuneration to Gramo (joint collecting society in Norway for musicians, performing artists and phonogram producers) for the use of copyright\\-protected recordings, and a levy to the Fund for the use of non\\-protected recordings. This applies both to broadcasting and to other public use.\n\nThe basis for this appears to come from \u00a7\u00a045b of the [Copyright Act](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=248181)\\*:\n\n> Sound fixations of the performances of performing artists can, within the period of time specified in section 45, against remuneration, be made available to the pubic \\[sic] through public performance. \\[...] Both the producer of the fixation and the performing artists whose performances are\n>  reproduced are entitled to remuneration. \\[...] For public performance of sound fixations that are not protected under the copyright act, the [Act No. 4 of 14 December 1956](http://app.uio.no/ub/ujur/oversatte-lover/data/lov-19561214-004-eng.pdf) relating to a levy on the public performance of performing artists\u2019 performances, etc. applies.\n\nExplanation\n===========\n\nFFUK is a fund *for* performing artists, not one that takes from performing artists. In this situation, it is not the performing artist that pays the levy, but rather those who make use of a \"sound fixation\" (recording) of a performance of the performing artist.\n\nAn example would be a TV network that wishes to broadcast a pre\\-recorded orchestra performance. If this performance is a song under copyright, then that TV network must pay remuneration to Gramo so that the songwriters, producers, performers etc. can receive compensation. \n\nHowever, if that song is in the public domain then Gramo has no claim to any remuneration. This is where FFUK is involved. The Act No 4\\. of 14 December 1956 authorizes levies for these performances of public domain songs, and it is under this act that FFUK operates. The TV network must pay them a levy so that the performers may still be compensated as they still have rights over the performance of a public domain song.\n\nWhile all this explains the first link you cite, I realize that I'm not directly addressing the claims in the second link. I simply can't find a legal basis for those claims, and still think it's more likely that it's confusing levies for the performance of public domain works (non\\-existant as far as I can tell) with levies for *using* performances of public domain works. I would be happy to be corrected if I'm wrong though.\n\n---\n\n\\*Linked are unofficial translations of the law because I do not speak Norwegian. The linked Copyright Act is a consolidated version from 2007, the most recent for which WIPO had an English translation. There was a small [amendment in 2009](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=11086), which with the help of Google Translate, does not affect the analysis. There were more extensive [amendments in 2015](http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/details.jsp?id=15949), but those only came into force October 1, 2015, after the date of your question.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In Norway, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal provisions regarding levies on public performances of recordings?\n\nA) Performing artists must pay a levy to Gramo when publicly performing works that are in the public domain.\n\nB) Users must pay a levy to FFUK for the use of copyright-protected recordings in public performances.\n\nC) Users must pay remuneration to Gramo for the use of copyright-protected recordings and a levy to FFUK for the use of non-protected recordings in public performances.\n\nD) Performing artists receive remuneration from Gramo for public performances of their copyrighted works, but not for public domain works.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. According to the information provided, users (such as broadcasters or venues) must pay remuneration to Gramo for the use of copyright-protected recordings in public performances. This is based on \u00a7 45b of the Copyright Act. For non-protected recordings (those in the public domain), users must pay a levy to the Fund for Performing Artists (FFUK) based on Act No. 4 of 14 December 1956.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it mistakenly states that performing artists pay the levy, when in fact it's the users of the recordings who pay.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct but incomplete, as it only mentions FFUK and copyright-protected works, when in fact Gramo handles copyright-protected works and FFUK handles public domain works.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it doesn't address the levy system at all and mistakenly suggests that artists don't receive compensation for public domain works, when in fact they do through FFUK.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the complex system of remuneration and levies in Norway for public performances of recordings, distinguishing between copyright-protected and public domain works, and identifying the correct parties responsible for payments and those who receive compensation."

According to the information provided, emails are considered legally valid forms of written communication, and receipt of such an email triggers any legal obligations contained within it. However, while the police can request information, they have limited power to compel the production of data without a court order. This means that the email request is legally binding in the sense that it's a valid form of communication, but the company still has the right to refuse to provide the data unless the police obtain a court order. Option A is incorrect because email requests are generally considered valid. Option C is incorrect because the validity of the email doesn't typically depend on specific legislation allowing electronic communication. Option D is incorrect as there's no requirement for a follow-up phone call to validate an email request."

The crime or offence doesn't have to be the one before the court.\n\nAn example from TV: A man is asked how he was in a position to witness the assault.

Before turning the lights off I noted a bug on the nightstand but that did not trigger alarms in my mind for some reason. \n\nThe next morning I noted swelling, red skin on my neck but did not look into why it was so as I was in hurry to pack my things and leave the hotel. An hour later when the affected area was itching and sore I finally understood that I had been bitten by bed bugs.\n\nAccording to [this article](http://blogs.findlaw.com/injured/2011/11/how-to-sue-a-hotel-for-bed-bugs.html), to be successful in suing a hotel for bed bugs one needs \"*to show that the hotel either failed to properly deal with a known infestation, or that it didn\u2019t appropriately inspect the premises*\".\n\nI have done some research and found a few reviews of that hotel where people reported bed bugs and the hotel staff responded, which, in my opinion, should be sufficient proof that the infestation was known to the hotel. Also I have taken photos of the affected areas of my body.\n\nNow, according to [this manual](http://consumer.georgia.gov/consumer-topics/magistrate-court) on filing a small/magistrate court claim in Georgia:\n\n> *The plaintiff must appear in court on the day of the hearing, or the\n>  judge may ... Allow the defendant to present testimony and give a\n>  judgment, without hearing from the plaintiff.*\n\nThat night in the hotel was the last one on my trip to the US \u2014 now I am home far away. I am therefore trying to weight the practical likelyhood of winning this case without appearing in court in person and instead doing all communication remotely. What I would like to claim is a compensation for pain and suffering, and the expenses for inspecting and washing my clothes and bed linen at home. A live bug fell off my wallet on arrival home:\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yo0ST.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yo0ST.jpg)\n\nSo, the question is: **how feasible is it for a foreigner to win a magistrate/small court case in Georgia, US without appearing in court because of being home far away?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It would be difficult, but it doesn't seem impossible. \"Allow the defendant to present testimony and give a judgment, without hearing from the plaintiff\" gives the defendant a huge advantage, but at least you should be able to give your side in your complaint.\n\nAnd I don't see anything in the [magistrate court rules](http://georgiacourts.org/sites/default/files/Court%20Rules/UNIFORM%20MAGISTRATE%20COURT%20RULES%20-%2003_13_14.pdf) that says you can't hire a local attorney to represent you.

Which of the following statements best describes the employee's potential legal situation?\n\nA) The employee is completely protected from any legal consequences due to the doctrine of respondeat superior.\n\nB) The employee should immediately quit the job to avoid any potential legal ramifications.\n\nC) The employee may have some protection under respondeat superior, but could still potentially face legal consequences depending on the specifics of their employment agreement and the situation.\n\nD) The employee is solely responsible for any copyright infringement and will definitely face legal action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the doctrine of respondeat superior generally protects employees from personal liability for actions carried out at the direction of their employer, copyright infringement can still lead to legal troubles even when unintentional or non-profitable. The extent of the employee's protection depends on various factors, including the nature of their employment relationship and the specifics of their employment agreement. Only a lawyer could determine if the employee has adequate personal indemnification in this potentially perilous legal situation. Therefore, while some protection exists, the employee could still face legal consequences depending on the specific circumstances."

Copyright on at least some of them have expired; they are in the public domain, and are being widely republished.\n\nHowever, the descendants of the author have trademarked the names of the main characters. This trademark can effectively be renewed forever.\n\nHow much control does the trademark give them? I'm interested in whether they can stop the publishing of any derivative works. Would an \"(X) character is a legal registered trademark of (Y)\" disclaimer head that off? Would the setting and story with the trademarked characters stripped out be permissible?\n\nOf course, there's a specific series of books that I'm interested in, but I wanted the general answer because I think this situation is not unique.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Character names can be trademarked in connection with the sale of books. For example, both \"Harry Potter\" and \"Gandalf\" are so trademarked. \n\nHowever, any trademark required continuing use. If the trademark is not actually being used to sell goods or services (currently, within a reasonable past period, or with demonstrable future plans to do so) then an action to enforce the trademark will fail. If the name of the character is part of the title or sub\\-title of the book, for example \"Joe Hero and the evil Empire\" or 'The Evil Empire: a Joe Hero book\" or is used in marketing the book, that would make the case for applying the trademark stronger. \n\nHowever, details on just how the name has been used, both by the trademark holders and by others, would make a difference. Anyone seriously interested should consult an experienced Trademark/IP lawyer in the appropriate jurisdiction (which you don't mention, and which may matter).\n\nAlso, if some but not all of the works in the series are still protected by copyright, new works featuring the characters from the series might be considered derivative works of the protected originals, and as such require permission from the copyright holder(s).

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The trademark holders can prevent any publication or use of the characters' names in any context.\n\nB) The trademark only applies if the character names are being used to sell goods or services, and requires continuous use to remain valid.\n\nC) A simple disclaimer stating the trademark ownership is sufficient to allow unrestricted use of the characters' names in any new works.\n\nD) The trademark gives the holders complete control over all derivative works, regardless of copyright status.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Trademarks on character names are specifically tied to their use in selling goods or services, such as books. The trademark must be continuously used to remain valid - if it's not being used to sell goods or services currently, within a recent period, or with clear future plans, attempts to enforce the trademark would likely fail. This answer accurately reflects the limited scope and ongoing use requirements of trademarks.\n\nOption A is incorrect because trademark protection doesn't prevent all uses of the names, only uses related to selling goods or services in a way that might confuse consumers.\n\nOption C is oversimplified. While a disclaimer might help in some situations, it doesn't automatically allow unrestricted use of trademarked names.\n\nOption D overstates the power of trademarks. They don't give control over all derivative works, especially if the original works are in the public domain. Copyright, not trademark, generally governs derivative works."

A person who is currently dependent on illegal drugs cannot be denied healthcare based on their dependency for illegal drugs.\n\n\\[Complexmathmaticsmeme.gif]\n\nA person can be discriminated against for a mental health problem, in every area except healthcare.\n\nDoesn't that obligate society to acknowledge that they need mental healthcare, and for the system to facilitate that care to avoid discrimination?\n\nThe objective of this legislation was to end discrimination against Americans with disabilities. Any exceptions to this fact seem to undermine the founding objective. Addiction is a disability, as stated within the documentation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nA person who is suffering from addiction needs immediate, trauma informed therapy, and treatment. The law points this out as the only option.\n\nI asked this question on every sub I could think of on Reddit, and the best explanation I got was that the ADA specifically exempts people from all but healthcare, so the process of discrimination must also maintain a narrow scope of obligation... This answer is unsatisfactory because the law is written to end discrimination against disabled citizens. Drug addiction is an academically established disability acknowledged by the law itself.\n\nCould anyone give me a rational explanation for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Doesn't that obligate society to acknowledge that they need mental\n> healthcare, and for the system to facilitate that care to avoid\n> discrimination?\n\nNo. Generally not.\n\nBut, there is some obligation on the part of wardens of jails and prisons to provide enough mental healthcare to avoid the very low standard of showing deliberate indifference to the health of convicted inmates (the standard is somewhat higher for people detained awaiting trial and not convicted).\n\nThere is a fairly substantial case law of civil rights lawsuits against wardens for ignoring the symptoms of addiction withdrawal that ultimately causes death or suicide. The cases go both ways in a highly fact\\-specific, case by case analysis that isn't entirely consistent.\n\n> Could anyone give me a rational explanation for this?\n\nWhat made you think that the law has to be rational? It is frequently irrational and/or inconsistent. Law is not math.\n\nBut, generally speaking, U.S. law creates far fewer positive obligations, especially on the part of government, than it does prohibitions. Providing healthcare is a positive obligation which the law has been loathe to impose on government without a clear and specific statutory authorization which hasn't been passed by legislators outside emergency medical treatment, Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid, and an obligation to provide minimal healthcare to inmates.\n\nThe law is not required to be fair, even though the law that is adopted must be applied fairly to some very limited degree.",

While the ADA generally considers addiction a disability, it specifically exempts individuals currently using illegal drugs from protections in areas such as employment, housing, legal matters, and social services. The one exception is healthcare - a person cannot be denied healthcare based on their dependency on illegal drugs.

The relevant U.S. laws (18 USC 471, 472, and 514) all begin with \"Whoever, with the intent to defraud...\" Creating counterfeit money as a burglar decoy doesn't clearly demonstrate an intent to defraud, making it questionable whether this specific use would be prosecuted or result in conviction.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In a legal proceeding a couple of months ago, I was unfortunately at the disadvantage of not being represented by my attorney. (There is a reason which is unrelated to this question.)\n\nI'm not a lawyer; I have no idea how things are supposed to proceed in court. I'm also a CEO of a startup which was pre\\-revenue and at the time of this event, had not yet closed our current round. As is the way of startups, our owners' draw was less than $500 a month for both myself and my co\\-founder for the entire preceding year; neither of us had been paid in a very long time.\n\nI am not the only managing member of our company, and while technically I could access any aspect of the company I demand, our CFO has authority over all of our financial concerns and my co\\-founder, our COO, manages our day\\-to\\-day operations. Of the money in the business bank account, every last dime came from accredited angel investors on convertible promissory notes (preferred \\- all the investors have repayment preference.) At the time of this event, our company was still formed as an LLC.\n\nMy question is this: the judge asserted that simply because technically I have access to do so, I could be expected to clean out the business bank account to address whatever individual, personal matters were at hand. \n\n* Surely I can't be ordered to steal from our investors? Cleaning out the business bank account would be embezzling or fraud or both?\n* Is there a remedy for a judge who \"orders\" you to break the law? (Not\nasking if the order would be tossed out \\- asking if any kind of\nrebuke exists)\n\n> Noteworthy: Since no circumstances exist under which I will be compelled to rip off my investors, I simply proposed a settlement that leveraged an inheritance, hence this question is not an issue of my personal circumstances; I'm just curious.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Judges often issue orders and warrants that require people or entities to transfer property from one party to another. For example, a search warrant allows law enforcement to seize personal property. A garnishment requires an employer to transfer a worker's wages to someone else. A judgment can affirm that property was stolen and thereby invalidate what was previously good title to the property.\n\nLike any judicial order, such judgments can be found to be invalid and/or illegal. But unless and until they are modified, a judicial order is presumed to be lawful. In fact, it has the force of law. (It is not inaccurate to say a judgment *is* \"law.\")\n\nThere are a few remedies for unfair, improper, or illegal judgments. The most common include:\n\n1. Motions for reconsideration. If a court makes a mistake of fact or law, this is the most expedient way to bring that to its attention and ask for an appropriate modification to the judgment.\n2. Appeals. Any party adversely affected by a judgment can usually find grounds to appeal it to a higher court.\n\n---\n\nOf course, things can get messy for affected parties in scenarios like you describe. If a court *orders* you to transfer money from one person to another, then you cannot be found guilty of a *crime* for complying with the letter of that order. But depending on the broader circumstances you could later be found personally liable to the proper owners of the money. E.g., they might assert any number of legal claims that result in a court granting another judgment against you for restitution to them.",

As stated in the documentation, a judicial order is presumed lawful and has the force of law unless modified or overturned. Complying with the order would protect the CEO from criminal charges for the transfer itself. However, the CEO could potentially face civil liability to the investors later, as they might pursue legal claims for restitution of their funds.\n\nOption A is incorrect because refusing to comply with a court order can result in contempt charges, even if the order seems improper.\n\nOption B is too absolute. While the CEO must comply with valid court orders, there are legal remedies to challenge improper orders.\n\nOption D is incorrect because ignoring a court order can have serious legal consequences, regardless of the order's perceived legality."

When that was repealed by the 21st Amendment, it was assumed that the Volstead Act was no longer Constitutional and therefore not in force. \n\nHowever, today the Supreme Court recognizes broad Congressional power to regulate economic activity, and in particular we have the Controlled Substances Act. This seems to imply that the Volstead Act is within the modern boundaries of the Commerce Clause.\n\nI have found no law that explicitly repeals the Volstead Act, except in part the Cullen\u2013Harrison Act.

Has the Volstead Act been repealed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Volstead Act](http://legisworks.org/congress/66/publaw-66.pdf) was partially [repealed](http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=49&page=872) by the 74th Congress: \"Titles I and II of the National Prohibition Act...are hereby repealed\". You can see the relevant law passed in 1935 via [these links](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title27/chapter7&edition=prelim). Title III of the Volstead Act pertains to industrial alcohol, and was not repealed.\n\nSection 2 of the 21st Amendment states:\n\n> The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or\n>  possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of\n>  intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby\n>  prohibited.\n\nThis grants *states* (territories, possessions) the power to prohibit or otherwise regulate importation of alcohol, despite the Commerce Clause (only *Congress* may regulate interstate commerce). But this is okay: [Craig v. Boren](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/429/190/case.html) 429 U.S. 190 \"resolves\" the seeming contradiction, saying\n\n> The wording of \u00a72 of the Twenty\\-first Amendment closely follows the\n>  Webb\\-Kenyon and Wilson Acts, expressing the framers' clear intention\n>  of constitutionalizing the Commerce Clause framework established under\n>  those statutes. This Court's decisions since have confirmed that the\n>  Amendment primarily created an exception to the normal operation of\n>  the Commerce Clause.\n\nThe federal government can impose all sorts of limits, and there are [200 pages of federal regulations](https://www.ttb.gov/pdf/ttbp51008_laws_regs_act052007.pdf) on alcohol which instantiate the power via the Commerce Clause to control alcohol. An outright ban on production / consumption / sale would probably fail, not passing [strict scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny), but it's hard to know what might be seen as a fundamental right calling for strict scrutiny, some time in the future. See [Wickard v. Filburn](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/317/111/case.html), 317 U.S. 111 for an example of how the power to regulate interstate commerce doesn't actually have to involve interstate commerce.",

The Volstead Act was partially repealed by Congress in 1935, with Titles I and II being repealed while Title III (pertaining to industrial alcohol) remained. The 21st Amendment, while repealing Prohibition, granted states authority over alcohol importation. However, this did not eliminate federal power over alcohol regulation. Through the Commerce Clause, the federal government maintains significant regulatory authority, as evidenced by extensive federal regulations on alcohol. The Supreme Court, in cases like Craig v. Boren, has interpreted the 21st Amendment as creating an exception to the normal operation of the Commerce Clause, rather than completely nullifying federal authority. This results in a system where both federal and state governments have roles in alcohol regulation, with the federal government's power stemming primarily from its authority to regulate interstate commerce."

If one of 12 plaintiffs is a Maryland resident and one of 15 defendants is also a Maryland resident, that tiny overlap means the entire lawsuit is kicked back to state court.\n\nIn this case, the defendants are an Ohio fraternity, an Illinois resident, a Wyoming company, and a person whose residence is unclear. Defendant Smith might be a Wyoming resident, a Utah resident, or a Washington resident. The plaintiffs aren\u2019t sure. However, as long as the plaintiffs aren\u2019t residents of any of those states, there\u2019s complete diversity of citizenship.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A customer of a FINRA-regulated financial institution discovers that the company has unlawfully deprived them of assets, violating several statutory regulations. The customer's service agreement contains a binding arbitration clause. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the customer's options for legal recourse?\n\nA) The customer can file a civil lawsuit in court, as violations of statutory regulations automatically void arbitration clauses.\n\nB) The customer must pursue arbitration for civil claims, but can also file a criminal complaint with law enforcement.\n\nC) The customer can choose between arbitration and a civil lawsuit, as FINRA regulations always allow this option.\n\nD) The arbitration clause is invalid because it attempts to contract away statutory rights, allowing the customer to sue in court.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: Based on the information provided, arbitration clauses are generally binding even when a company violates statutory regulations or parameters for lawful operation. The customer would be required to pursue arbitration for any civil claims against the company. However, the arbitration clause does not prevent criminal prosecutions or administrative agency actions. Therefore, while the customer must use arbitration for civil matters, they retain the right to file a criminal complaint if the company's actions were illegal. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they misstate the binding nature of arbitration clauses in this context or incorrectly suggest that statutory violations automatically invalidate such clauses."

My gut tells me it is just another way of referring to the reasonable/prudent person test but I am not sure. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Case to look at:**\n\nThe case you want to look at is [*MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.*, 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916\\)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacPherson_v._Buick_Motor_Co). Prior to this case, privity of contract was required to impose duty on a defendant. This case held that a carmaker's liability for a defective product reached beyond the immediate purchaser of that car.\n\nJudge Cardozo eliminated that privity barrier to recovery and stated:\n\n> If the nature of a thing is such that it is reasonably certain to place life and limb in peril when negligently made, it is then a thing of danger. Its nature gives warning of the consequence to be expected. If to the element of danger there is added knowledge that the thing will be used by persons other than the purchaser, and used without new tests, then, irrespective of contract, the manufacturer of this thing of danger is under a duty to make it carefully. That is as far as we need to go for the decision of this case. ... If he is negligent, where danger is to be foreseen, a liability will follow.\n\n**What does the duty of care refer to?**\n\nThe [duty of care](https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/introduction-to-negligence) requires you to act as a reasonable person, acting under similar circumstances, would act. This is the *general* duty applicable in all negligence cases. Sometimes, however, there is a *special* duty imposed on a defendant by case law or statute in place of or in addition to the general duty (one simple example is a law requiring all residents of a city to shovel the snow on the sidewalk in front of their house after snowfall). Other variations to the level of care a duty imposes may include common carriers, doctors, etc.\n\nTo find a duty of care, a few states simply consider whether harming the plaintiff was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions. Many more use some sort of multi\\-factor test to determine this. A California case, *Rowland v Christian*, 69 Cal. 2d 108 (1968\\) laid out this set of factors:\n\n* the foreseeability of harm to the injured party;\n* the degree of certainty he or she suffered injury;\n* the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered;\n* the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct;\n* the policy of preventing future harm;\n* the extent of the burden to the defendant and the consequences to the community of imposing a duty of care with resulting liability for breach;\n* and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved\n\n[As of about 8 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty_of_care), \"43 states used a multifactor analysis in 23 various incarnations.\"",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the landmark case MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., Judge Cardozo established a new principle regarding the duty of care. Which of the following best describes the key change brought about by this ruling?\n\nA) It introduced the concept of strict liability for all product manufacturers.\nB) It eliminated the need for negligence in product liability cases.\nC) It extended the manufacturer's duty of care beyond the immediate purchaser to foreseeable users of the product.\nD) It established a multi-factor test for determining duty of care in all negligence cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because the case did not introduce strict liability; it still required negligence to be proven.\nB) is incorrect as the case maintained the requirement for negligence in product liability cases.\nC) is correct. The key change in MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. was extending the manufacturer's duty of care beyond the immediate purchaser to foreseeable users of the product, eliminating the privity barrier.\nD) is incorrect. While multi-factor tests for duty of care exist, they were not established by this specific case. The Rowland v Christian case later introduced a multi-factor test, but this wasn't part of the MacPherson ruling."

This is because:\n\n1. The company owns valid trademarks for the name \"Example\" in multiple countries, including the USA where the domain owner is located.\n2. The domain name being listed for sale at a high price could be seen as evidence of bad faith on the part of the domain owner, potentially strengthening Example Ltd's case.\n3.

The UDRP process is designed specifically for these types of trademark-related domain disputes and can be a more cost-effective solution than immediate purchase or legal threats.\n5. Filing the claim quickly alerts ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) to the dispute, which is advisable in such situations.\n\nWhile there is a hearing fee if the case progresses, initiating the UDRP process is the most strategic first step for Example Ltd to potentially recover the domain name based on their trademark rights."

That said I would like to specify that I am not searching for a legal advice, but instead I am just curious to hear your thoughts on this matter. Thank you in advance!\n\nNow back to the main topic, which I will start with a brief introduction just so you can get familiar with my case. The backstory of my current situation is that back in 2016 when I was choosing between different web hosting providers I found one, which was offering (and I quote) \"Free Domain For Life\" if you sign up for their most expensive shared hosting plan, which at that time was priced at roughly $13\\.00 per month.\n\nI never had any problems or complaints with the company, even in times when they would slightly rise their prices. Therefore, even dough now I am paying roughly $21\\.00 per month I am still using the same shared web hosting plan, which I signed up for in 2016\\. \n\nDuring the years, I have never paid a single penny for my domain name, which was renewed for free on yearly basis by the company until two weeks when I noticed a strange invoice from them. After opening it, I saw that I need to pay $12\\.00 dollars for my domain name if I want to renew it for another year.\n\nI was deeply consufed and thought it is some sort of a technical error. That is why I immediatelly decided to contact their sale team, but they responded that they had cancled this practice a few months back and according to their terms and services, the company has the right to change their conditions of the services they offer. In order for the employee to end on a more positive note, he started explaining improvements and features added that I was getting for free. \n\nI am curios to see what a more experience person than me thinks about this case and if he or she share their thought on the following quesitons I would be really grateful.\n\n1\\) Do you think that this can be considered as false advertisement?\n\n2\\) Due to the fact that I live in Europe and the company is based in the US, would that make it more complicate it for me to search for my legal rights?\n\n3\\) If I actually decide to search for my legal rights, go through the whole process and end up winning, what compensation possibly I could get from it?\n\n4\\) In this case, what kind of a laywer would represent my case the best? Should I contact a lawyer in my home country or search for one who practice law in the state of the company?\n\nPS: I would like to end this topic by saying that I am not planning to sue the company. I am just curious to hear your opinions about who is right and who is wrong. I am happy with the quality of services that I am getting in exchange for my money and I do not mind paying $12\\.00 per year for a domain. Last but not least, I would like to thank in advance everyone who decides to join this discussion and I look forward to hearing what you think about it. \n\nYours faithfully,\nGeorge\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends which law applies\n----------------------------\n\n**Contract law**\n\nA contract is interpreted under someone\u2019s law. For a competent internet company the contract will usually specify which law applies, if not, the court must decide where the contract was entered into \\- this may be where you are or where they are.\n\nWhile clauses allowing unilateral changes are legal, the power must be used either reasonably or in good faith depending on which law applies. It is certainly arguable that imposing a charge on something for which there was a promise that there would never be a charge is not reasonable and almost certainly not in good faith.\n\n**Consumer protection law**\n\nMost country\u2019s consumer protection laws cannot be excluded by contract and apply based on where the consumer is, as well as where the business is. So, if the service is offered in the UK and a UK consumer buys it, then UK consumer protection law applies irrespective of the nationality of the business.\n\nAlmost all such laws prohibit deceptive and misleading conduct \\- offering something for \u201cfree\u201d when bundled with something else and then reneging is clearly that. \n\nThere is usually a statutory body responsible for dealing with complaints so you might get you issue resolved without needing to go to a court.\n\nTry doing a little research in your country.",

While clauses allowing unilateral changes can be legal, they must be used reasonably or in good faith, depending on the applicable law.\n3.

Its first sentence identifies the parties, and there are only two.

As long as the parties can be clearly identified and their roles ascertained, such minor inconsistencies do not invalidate the contract.

The project will come with a bundled version of an open source component which is licensed under the MIT license.\n\nCan I bundle MIT licensed components in a Apache 2\\.0 licensed project?\n\nI would also be interested in an explanation on why the answer is yes or no.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I realize there's already an answer, but I'd like to go into more detail.\n\nThere are generally two kinds of open source software licenses: *[permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence)* and *[copyleft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft)* (the latter sometimes called *viral*).\n\nBoth are intended to allow people to freely use, modify, and redistribute a work while ensuring the original author gets credit. This contrasts with releasing your work into the public domain, which would allow anyone do literally anything, even claim to be the author.\n\nThe difference is that permissive licenses allow you to re\\-license your derivative works however you like, while copyleft licenses require your derivatives to be licensed under the same license (hence the term viral). The reasons you'd choose either one are philosophical and political and beyond the scope of this answer.\n\nBoth the Apache License and the MIT license are permissive, so incorporating MIT licensed code into your Apache licensed project is certainly allowed. Just be sure to attribute the original author for the parts your incorporated and include a copy of the MIT License terms, as required by the license. Go ahead and read it to make sure you get all the details right; it's fairly short and easy for a layperson to comprehend.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software developer is creating an open-source project and wants to license it under the Apache 2.0 License. The project includes a component licensed under the MIT license. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the licensing of this project?\n\nA) The developer cannot use the MIT-licensed component in an Apache 2.0-licensed project due to license incompatibility.\n\nB) The developer can use the MIT-licensed component but must relicense the entire project under the MIT license.\n\nC) The developer can use the MIT-licensed component in the Apache 2.0-licensed project, but must remove all attribution to the original MIT-licensed component.\n\nD) The developer can use the MIT-licensed component in the Apache 2.0-licensed project, ensuring proper attribution and including a copy of the MIT license terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Both the Apache 2.0 and MIT licenses are permissive open-source licenses. This means they allow for the incorporation of code under one license into projects using the other license. The key requirements are to provide proper attribution to the original authors and include the license terms of the incorporated component. Option D correctly states that the developer can use the MIT-licensed component in the Apache 2.0-licensed project, as long as they ensure proper attribution and include a copy of the MIT license terms. Options A and B are incorrect because there is no incompatibility between these licenses, and relicensing the entire project is unnecessary. Option C is incorrect because removing attribution would violate the terms of the MIT license."

The only problem is, I just recently started the process of creating/registering the Sole Propietorship. The contract I set up mentions my (not yet founded) company and the client. The thing is, I cannot sign the contract, because if I were to sign it now I would be doing that in the name of a company that technically does not exist yet.\n\nMy client wants to see the product prototype and we agreed in the contract (which we cannot sign) on an upfront payment, so the contract would prevent anything shady from happening. \n\nIs there any way I can still secure that contract and payment, while not breaking the law ? \n\nI thought about setting up a private contract to bind the client to signing the actual collaboration contract (which would be added as an exhibit to the contract) as soon as my actual company exists, is that legally reasonable ? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, there is no general restraint on signing a contract that incorporates conditions on future events. Most contracts are of that form \u2013 \"For consideration *X* from Party *A*, Party *B* will (or will not) do *Y*.\"\n\nYou could certainly say, \"If I establish entity *A* in timeframe *B* then the counterparty agrees to *C*.\"\n\nOf course: You should consult a qualified lawyer to draft or review the terms if you want to ensure that the contract will have the desired effect *and* be enforceable.",

Which of the following approaches is legally sound and recommended?\n\nA) Sign the contract using the unregistered company name, as it will become valid once the company is officially formed.\n\nB) Create a private contract binding the client to sign the actual collaboration contract once the company is formed, without consulting a lawyer.\n\nC) Refuse to proceed with any work or agreements until the company is officially registered, to avoid any legal complications.\n\nD) Draft a contract that includes conditions based on future events, such as the formation of the company, and have it reviewed by a qualified lawyer.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because signing a contract in the name of a non-existent company could lead to legal issues and may not be enforceable.\n\nOption B, while on the right track, is not the best approach as it lacks the crucial step of consulting a legal professional to ensure the contract's enforceability and effectiveness.\n\nOption C is overly cautious and may unnecessarily delay the project, potentially risking the business opportunity.\n\nOption D is the correct answer because it allows for the creation of a legally sound contract that accounts for future events (like the company's formation) while also emphasizing the importance of having a qualified lawyer review the terms. This approach ensures that the contract will have the desired effect and be enforceable, protecting both parties' interests."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am curious about the apparent success of ethnically restrictive laws on residence or property ownership after the fourteenth amendment was ratified.\n\nHansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940\\) ruled that a restrictive covenant violated due process.\u00a0 But that was a covenant, not a law, and the ruling only protected sellers, not buyers, and only those who had not signed the covenant.\n\nShelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948\\) had similar limitations.\n\nOregon for a time had laws prohibiting blacks from living in the territory, and I've heard rumors of laws prohibiting Chinese from owning property. **What (if any) were the court challenges to such laws on the basis of \u201cequal protection\u201d?**\u00a0 (Particularly interested in any prior to 1940\\.)\n\nIn section one, \u201dno State shall \u2026 deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\u201c would seem to me to prevent disallowing Chinese from applying for naturalization or buying property (unless they are **outside** the jurisdiction).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Prior to [Shelley v. Kramer](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/334/1/), racial covenants were considered to be outside the scope of the 14th Amendment, because as stated in [Corrigan v. Buckley](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/271/323/), \"the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment 'have reference to state action exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals'\". Therefore, a private agreement to exclude blacks does not run afoul of the 14th Amendment. The Shelley court also noted:\n\n> But here there was more. These are cases in which the purposes of the\n> agreements were secured only by judicial enforcement by state courts\n> of the restrictive terms of the agreements.\n\nThis leads to the primary holding of this case:\n\n> We hold that, in granting judicial enforcement of the restrictive\n> agreements in these cases, the States have denied petitioners the\n> equal protection of the laws, and that, therefore, the action of the\n> state courts cannot stand.\n\nThat is, the racially\\-restrictive agreements are not themselves forbidden by the 14th Amendment, but *enforcement* of such agreements is forbidden. An obvious question is, why had nobody advanced that argument before, but legal arguments often suffer from the forest / trees disability.\n\nAs far as I have been able to determine, that part of the Oregon Constitution excluding blacks became a legal nullity when the 14th Amendment was ratified, though it remained in the Constitution until 1926\\. The various anti\\-Chinese laws which were enforced were not enforced against Chinese who were citizens, see [US v. Wong Kim Ark](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1850-1900/169us649).",

Kraemer decision. Before this ruling, such covenants were considered private agreements outside the scope of the 14th Amendment (as stated in Corrigan v. Buckley). However, Shelley v. Kraemer established that while the covenants themselves were not forbidden by the 14th Amendment, their enforcement by state courts violated equal protection.\n\nOption A is incorrect because racially restrictive covenants were not considered unconstitutional prior to 1948. Option B is incorrect because while some discriminatory laws persisted, they were not consistently upheld, especially after the 14th Amendment. Option D is incorrect because the 14th Amendment did not immediately nullify all racially restrictive measures; many persisted and required further legal challenges to be overturned."
