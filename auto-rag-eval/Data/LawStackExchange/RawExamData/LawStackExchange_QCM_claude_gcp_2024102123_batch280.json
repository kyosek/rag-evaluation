Now those computers have begun to automatically upgrade themselves to Windows 10 against the wishes of their owners. This strikes me as a clear case of the common understanding of unauthorized access, but I don't know if it meets the legal criteria for unauthorized access.\n\n**Is Microsoft breaking any laws by forcing computer owners to upgrade to Windows 10 against their will?**\n\nI'm in the U.S.A., so I'm primarily interested in U.S. law but curious about other jurisdictions.\n\nSome related articles:\n\n* [Microsoft Denies That It Has Made The Windows 10 Upgrade Impossible To Block](http://www.windows10update.com/2016/06/microsoft-denies-made-windows-10-upgrade-impossible-block/)\n* [Don\u2019t blink, or your PC might upgrade itself to Windows 10](http://bgr.com/2016/05/17/windows-10-upgrade-problem-popup-schedule/)\n* [Microsoft\u2019s Windows 10 push comes to shove for some angry users](http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/microsofts-windows-10-push-comes-to-shove-for-some-angry-users?__lsa=c5a0-65fd)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You asked about other jurisdictions. As you'll probably be aware (from cases like EU vs Microsoft and EU vs Google) European countries and culture tend to have much stronger protection laws for consumer and employee rights than the US does. \n\nIn the UK you could make a strong case, although such cases are not often undertaken. The current legislation is Part 2 of the\u00a0Consumer Rights Act 2015, but the unfair contract terms clause goes back to at least the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999\\. Basically the law protects a person in a situation where disparity of size and bargaining power have led to unfair terms in a contract (typically a large company offering \"take it or leave it\" standard terms) \\- and specifically if they create a significant disparity in the parties rights and obligations. In such a situation the company which drafted the terms alleged to be unfair must show they are reasonable. A list of common terms likely to be seen as unfair is provided. (Employment terms are covered by other laws but also aim to prevent abuses due to inequality of contracting power)\n\nA company which sold a product like Windows 7/8/8\\.1 and then later said \"we are changing our terms of support and forcing you to upgrade\" (especially to a different product the user may not want, or a product that is maintained in a different way),would almost certainly be at substantial risk of falling foul of this. \n\nIt wouldn't matter if it was done by not providing the support/patches as originally implied (by custom or normal expectation) or as agreed in an explicit statement of support life cycle, or by saying \"we have the right under the contract to do this\", or by forcing what is essentially a change of product to get the updates. It also wouldnt matter how big they are, nor whether or not the user had *already* agreed \"because I felt I had no choice\". The law is there specifically to protect against abuses like this, so it is drafted to catch companies who try to find \"wriggle room\"."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the information provided about consumer protection laws in the UK, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding Microsoft's forced Windows 10 upgrades?\n\nA) Microsoft's actions would likely be considered legal under UK consumer protection laws because users agreed to the terms of service when installing Windows.\n\nB) The Consumer Rights Act 2015 would not apply to this situation because software upgrades are not considered consumer products.\n\nC) Microsoft's forced upgrades would likely be considered a violation of UK consumer protection laws due to the disparity in bargaining power and potential unfair contract terms.\n\nD) UK consumer protection laws only apply to physical products, not digital services or software, so Microsoft's actions would not be covered.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer is C because the information provided explicitly states that under UK consumer protection laws, particularly the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and previous regulations, there are strong protections against unfair contract terms, especially when there is a disparity in size and bargaining power between parties. The document mentions that a company changing terms of support and forcing upgrades, particularly to a different product, would \"almost certainly be at substantial risk of falling foul of this.\" The law is designed to protect consumers against such practices, regardless of the size of the company or whether the user had previously agreed due to feeling they had no choice.

As outlined in the provided information, when faced with parallel civil and criminal proceedings, a defendant will typically seek a stay of the civil litigation until the completion of the criminal trial. This approach addresses several concerns:\n\n1. It helps protect the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, which could be compromised in civil proceedings.\n2.

An employer can determine that someone is unsuitable for a position based on their past actions and associations if they believe it could make the person a liability. This is not considered discrimination, but rather a determination of fact regarding suitability for the position.

One of the U.S. statutes imposing criminal liability is [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 798](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798) (others are 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793 and 50 USC \u00a7 421 (the Intelligence Identities Protection Act)), which applies to secrets of both the U.S. and those of foreign governments that are detrimental to the U.S. if released.*See also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information_in_the_United_States)*. As an aside, under U.S. law, a person with a duty to preserve classified information as classified has a duty to do so even if the information is already widely available in the new media (in part, on the theory that releasing the information would give credibility to the information which otherwise might only have an anonymous source).\n\nI do not know what would be legal under Belgian law.

In a civil court, arrests are not typically made for the issues being litigated. However, testimony given under oath in civil court can be used as evidence in a criminal case if the statute of limitations hasn't expired. The civil court itself doesn't have the authority to arrest individuals for crimes discussed during testimony (eliminating options A and D).

There are certainly scenarios where Alice might have startled Bob without even breaching a duty, but in that case the analysis would end there.\n\n### A startle reaction will almost never sever the chain of legal causation\n\nIn negligence, Alice is held liable for harm that is reasonably foreseeable as a result of Alice's breach of a duty. One of the elements of a successful negligence claim is *causation*: Alice is not liable for harm that is too *remote* from her breach.\n\n> On its own, proof by an injured plaintiff that a defendant was negligent does not make that defendant liable for the loss. The plaintiff must also establish that the defendant\u2019s negligence (breach of the standard of care) caused the injury. That link is causation.1\n> \n> \n> ([Clements v. Clements, 2012 SCC 32, paragraph 6](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/9992/index.do))\n\nBob's startle response would almost certainly be considered a foreseeable reaction, and thus, not sufficient to separate Alice from the breaking of the television.\n\n> An *instinctive human reaction*, or any non\\-negligent human action in the chain of causation will almost never break the chain of causation, because such reactions will be held foreseeable; and even if they are not, the precise chain of events leading to an accident need not be foreseeable.\n> \n> \n> (Ken Cooper\u2011Stephenson, Personal Injury Damages in Canada (Carswell, 1996\\))\n\nSee also The Restatement of Torts (Second), \u00a7 447, which says that an intervening act does not remove the defendant's liability if: \"(a) the actor at the time of his negligent conduct should have realized that a third person might so act, or (b) a reasonable man knowing the situation existing when the act of the third person was done would not regard it as highly extraordinary that the third person had so acted, or (c) the intervening act is a normal consequence of a situation created by the actor's conduct and the manner in which it is done is not extraordinarily negligent.\"\n\n\"\\[I]t is the general nature of the intervening acts and the accompanying risk of harm that needs to be reasonably foreseeable. Legal causation does not require that the accused must objectively foresee the precise future consequences of their conduct.\" ([*R. v. Maybin*, 2012 SCC 24](https://canlii.ca/t/frczg#par38)).\n\nForeseeability does not require that the intervening action be *probable*; it only requires that it would not be brushed aside as \"far\\-fetched.\"\n\n> The degree of probability that would satisfy the reasonable foreseeability requirement was described in *The Wagon Mound (No. 2\\)* as a \"real risk\", i.e. \"one which would occur to the mind of a reasonable man in the position of the defendan\\[t] ... and which **he would not brush aside as far\\-fetched**\"\n> \n> \n> ([*Mustapha v. Culligan of Canada Ltd.*, 2008 SCC 27, paragraph 13](https://canlii.ca/t/1wz6f#par13)).\n\nExamples of intervening acts held to be reasonably foreseeable:\n\n* *Haynes v. Harwood* \\[1935] 1 K.B. 146\\. A carriage owner had left a two\\-horse carriage unattended on a busy street. The judge accepted evidence from an independent observer that two boys had come along and one of them threw a stone at the horses and the horses bolted along the street (these boys were not before the court as co\\-defendants; nothing more is said of them). A constable managed to stop the horses, but was injured in the process. The carriage owner was liable in negligence: a reasonable person should have foreseen that the horses might get loose and someone be injured while trying to stop them. The court said, \"**it is not necessary to show that this particular accident and this particular damage were probable**; it is sufficient if the accident is of a class that might well be anticipated as one of the reasonable and probable results of the wrongful act.\"\n\n### Foreseeability here does not have its colloquial meaning\n\n[Greendrake's answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/92946/46948) says that \"whereas Bob's shock is foreseeable, I pretty much doubt that him breaking the TV is.\" In my view, this takes too colloquial a view of foreseeability. As Hart and Honor\u00e9 say in *Causation in the Law*, 2nd Ed. (1985\\):\n\n> ... in one sense everything is foreseeable, in another nothing. The consequences of negligence are almost invariably surprises. All depends on the detail with which the harm is described. ... there will always be some details of the recoverable harm which are not foreseeable.\n> \n> \n> ... the fact that harm described by reference to certain details is not foreseeable does not render the harm, *more broadly described*, unforeseeable. ... If we have learned from experience to expect a 'rainstorm' on seeing dark clouds, then the rainstorm was foreseeable even if, when it occurs, it has other characteristics (e.g. lasted two hours, covered an area of 40 sq. miles) which we could not foresee but which might appear, *ex post facto*, in a more specific description of it.\n\nOf course, foreseeability is a question of fact, and I acknowledge that a finder of fact might very well conclude that swinging a vacuum is not within a class of actions that might be anticipated by a reasonable person. While I disagree with Greendrake's analysis and conclusion, the contrast with my answer helps highlight precisely where the issue would be if this were to be litigated.\n\n---\n\n1\\. Note the terminology. The *breach* of the standard of care is the *negligence*. But *liability* only follows when the negligence causes harm. This is contrary to the framing in [Dale M's answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/92939/46948), which says, \"Alice was negligent if her actions caused damage to Bob\u2019s TV,\" and that \"\\[i]f we are talking about Alice\u2019s TV then there is no negligence because Bob has suffered no damage.\" That language conflates negligence (the breach) with liability (breach plus causation)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario where Alice startles Bob, causing him to accidentally break a TV with a vacuum cleaner, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal principle of foreseeability in determining Alice's liability?\n\nA) Alice is only liable if she could have specifically foreseen that Bob would break a TV as a result of being startled.\n\nB) Alice is not liable because Bob's action of swinging the vacuum is an intervening act that breaks the chain of causation.\n\nC) Alice may be liable if a reasonable person could foresee that startling someone could lead to some form of accidental damage, even if the specific outcome wasn't predictable.\n\nD) Alice is automatically liable for any damage that occurs as a direct result of her startling Bob, regardless of foreseeability.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it best reflects the legal principle of foreseeability as described in the documentation. The law doesn't require that the exact sequence of events or specific outcome be foreseeable. Instead, it considers whether the general nature of the harm falls within a class of consequences that a reasonable person might anticipate. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it sets too high a standard for foreseeability, requiring specific prediction of outcomes. Option B is wrong because a startle reaction is typically considered foreseeable and doesn't break the chain of causation.

However, an attempt to address the question in terms of existing, known statutory and case law has been made.\n\nThe default position of in\\-person non\\-defective returns in law\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default position in law for the return of non\\-defective purchases made in person is that the retailer is not obliged to accept the return. The retailer is only required to accept the return if:\n\n1. It was made online or the customer did not have a chance to inspect the item before purchasing it. The customer has up to 14 days to return the item for any or no reason under [Part 3 of the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/3134/part/3)\n2. The customer has the right to return the item according to [Section 20 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/section/20/enacted)\n\nThe retailer may choose to have a more generous, extensive returns policy but that is not required by law.\n\n### Does Alice have a statutory right to return the item?\n\nNo. She did not purchase it online and she was able to inspect it as she made the purchase in\\-store. The item appears to conform to the contract in terms of quality, being as described, non\\-defective, etc. Therefore Part 3 of the Regulations does not apply and she does not seem to have the right to return under Section 20 of the Act.\n\nWhat was the contract?\n----------------------\n\nThe contract appears to be the following:\n\n1. The price set out as part of the invitation to treat\n2. All of the implied terms as required by the Consumer Rights Act 2015 (such as the item to be of sufficient quality, fit for purpose, and so on)\n\n### Does the verbal dialogue amount to a term or representation?\n\nThe verbal dialogue is unlikely to amount to a term. This is because a term is a promise as to the truth of a statement. When considering whether the verbal dialogue amounts to a term, the Court will consider the following non\\-exhaustive factors:\n\n1. Whether the term was in writing\n2. Is there any specialist skill or knowledge from one party?\n3. Is there reliance or importance placed on the statement?\n4. How long was the lapse of time between the statement and the contract being made?\n5. Could the party relying on the statement have verified it?\n\nTaking each factor in turn:\n\n1. The term was not in writing. It was an oral exchange. The Court will examine the conduct of the parties from start to end of the contract formation. The parol evidence rule (the rule that excludes other documents and oral agreements, instead preferring to focus solely on the written agreement) can be circumvented on this basis per *J. Evans \\& Son (Portsmouth) Ltd v Andrea Merzario* \\[1976] 1 WLR 1078\\.\n2. There may be some specialist knowledge involved. Alice could argue that the cashier would be expected to be familiar with the store's return policy whereas Alice wouldn't. The store could try and rely on *Oscar Whell Ltd v Williams* \\[1957] 1 WLR 370 which held that the seller had no specialist knowledge and so the statement did not form a contractual term. In contrast, Alice could try and rely on *Dick Bentley Productions Ltd v Harold Smith (Motors) Ltd* \\[1965] 1 WLR 623 which held that the position one party (being a car dealer) was in conveyed specialist knowledge that the other party lacked. On the basis that the returns policy was available at the customer service desk and readable by anyone without any specialist knowledge or training, it seems likely that the Court would hold that no specialist knowledge was possessed.\n3. There may be some reliance or importance placed on the statement. This is a two\\-part test: is the statement so important that Alice would not have entered the contract if the statement had never been made, and separately, is the importance of the statement clear to the cashier at the time the statement was made, either expressly or by conduct? Part 1 will be up for Alice to demonstrate, while part 2 will probably be \"no\" because the cashier is not taking personal responsibility for the statement, arguably simply relaying (mistakenly) what they believed the policy was (per *Pritchard v Cook \\& Red Ltd* unreported, 4 June 1998\\).\n4. There would only have been a few seconds or minutes between the cashier making the statement and the conclusion of the contract. While the presumption is that the greater the time between the statement and the conclusion of the contract, the less likely it is held to be a term, per *Inntrepreneur Pub Co v East Crown Ltd* \\[2000] 2 Lloyd\u2019s Rep 611, it is not clear on the facts that the statement necessarily became a term.\n5. It is arguable that Alice could have verified the statement by checking the returns policy herself or double\\-checking with another member of staff or the customer service desk.\n\nOn consideration of the factors above, it is unlikely that the statement would form a term of the contract. It is possible that the Court would hold the statement is a representation, but it is fact\\-specific.\n\n### What is the effect of the statement being a representation?\n\nThe statement does not form a contractual term, so it is not possible for Alice to bring a claim for breach of contract. It may be possible for Alice to claim for misrepresentation.\n\nShe might be able to claim for:\n\n1. Negligent misstatement or\n2. Negligent misrepresentation contrary to [S2(1\\) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/7/section/2)\n3. Fraudulent misrepresentation\n\n#### Negligent misstatement\n\nThis claim would require the existence of a \"special relationship\" between the cashier and Alice, per *Hedley Byrne \\& Co Ltd v Heller \\& Partners Ltd* \\[1964] AC 465\\. In this case, it is unlikely Alice will be able to establish the existence of a \"special relationship\" as she is transacting with a general cashier rather than, e.g. a specialist expert. Since there is no \"special relationship\", this claim would fail.\n\n#### Negligent misrepresentation\n\nThis claim would be likely to succeed, provided Alice can demonstrate some form of loss (e.g. the loss of the right to return the item), unless the cashier can prove on the balance of probabilities that they had reasonable grounds to believe, and did believe (up until the contract was made) that the facts represented were true.\n\n#### Fraudulent misrepresentation\n\nThis would require clear evidence of fraud per *Smith New Court Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd* \\[1996] UKHL 3\\. There is no evidence of fraud on the facts, so this claim is unlikely to succeed.\n\n### Likelihood of success and available remedies\n\nIt is likely that Alice would prevail by making the case that the statement was a misrepresentation contrary to S2(1\\) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967\\.\n\nIf the item was worth more than \u00a3100 and less than \u00a330,000 and she paid for it on a credit card, the most expedient way would be to do a Section 75 (Consumer Credit Act 1975\\) chargeback against the credit card provider.\n\nAlternatively, if she proceeded with her S2(1\\) Misrepresentation Act 1967 claim, she is likely to get damages rather than recission under S2(2\\) of the Act, which would operate to put her back into the position she was in prior to buying the item. In other words, she would get a full refund.\n\nWhether it is *worth* her pursuing all this is another matter entirely. Upon reflection around actual/apparent authority, I have decided that is an interesting tangent but the answer can be best tackled by reference to existing contract law (and the question of actual/apparent authority is likely to be answered in the negative)."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the case of Alice's retail purchase and attempted return, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of the cashier's verbal statement about the return policy?\n\nA) The cashier's statement definitely forms a binding contractual term, overriding the store's written policy.\n\nB) Alice has a strong case for fraudulent misrepresentation against the store.\n\nC) Alice likely has a valid claim for negligent misrepresentation under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, but may face challenges in proving damages.\n\nD) The cashier's statement is legally irrelevant as the written policy always takes precedence in retail transactions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate statement. The cashier's verbal statement about the return policy is unlikely to form a binding contractual term due to factors such as lack of specialist knowledge and the availability of the written policy. However, Alice likely has a valid claim for negligent misrepresentation under Section 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967. The challenge lies in proving damages, as Alice would need to demonstrate some form of loss, such as the loss of the right to return the item. This option acknowledges both the potential legal recourse available to Alice and the practical difficulties she might face in pursuing it.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the verbal statement is unlikely to override the written policy or form a binding contractual term. Option B is incorrect as there's no evidence of fraud in this scenario. Option D is incorrect because while the written policy is important, verbal statements can still have legal implications, particularly in cases of misrepresentation."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/72966/what-do-i-need-to-do-after-being-shipped-a-wrong-order", "docs_id": 72966, "title": "What do I need to do after being shipped a wrong order?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I recently ordered a book online, which is print\\-on\\-demand.\nOn arrival I noticed that they printed the wrong book.

Or is every case where a warrant isn't obtainable *also* a case where trash evidence isn't allowed ?\n\nAnd what about anyone ? I can think of a few queasy things someone can do with your DNA like finding out details about you that you don't want them to know. In 2006, the UK made it illegal to sequence another person's DNA without permission.

Let's say I follow someone into a barber shop and leave with some clippings of their hair, am I doing something illegal ? I'd expect this to vary from state to state, right ?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I don't know what you mean by \"own a person's DNA\", but analogous to owning a car or picture, you can't own a person, which is what would be required to have complete ownership of all of a person's DNA. You can legally own a sample of a person's DNA, for example by buying or bartering tissue, or if you are given tissue. If you grab a handful of hair from a person and pull it out, it is not legally yours, and you can be required to return it. If you lose, misplace or abandon tissue (or a knife), then the finder could end up owning it, depending on the circumstances. Tissue in the trash is more complicated since there may be municipal laws preventing dumpster\\-diving. Setting aside any such municipal codes, if you abandon your property, someone else can claim it. Hair on the floor of a barbershop, or in the trash, is a good example abandonment: it could also be an example of trespassing, in case the barber objects to you gathering samples from his floor.\n\nThe 4th Amendment cannot be used to secure your DNA: it could be used to *prevent* securing DNA, if the intended application is compelled blood drawing. The ruling in [Maryland v. King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_v._King) did *not* say that \"your DNA can be taken and entered into a national database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason\", since that was an objection to the majority ruling given in the dissent, not part of the actual ruling. Maybe that will end up being true, but that hasn't been determined to be the law yet. With a warrant, the police can take a tissue sample, and not wait for you to throw a tissue sample in the trash. They can *also* take a cheek swab from an arrestee just like they can take a photo or fingerprints (that's what Maryland v. King says).\n\nOnce we've settled the matter of obtaining a DNA sample, the concept of ownership might be relevant if a party could restrict others from using that DNA pattern. But DNA is not subject to patent or copyright, so once I know your DNA pattern, you cannot legally prevent me from using that information. However, you *might*, if I gave you a sample as part of a contract, and there is a clause in that contract that prevents the other party from ever using that information."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John suspects his neighbor, Sarah, of having a rare genetic condition.

I'll restate the analysis in a different way in this answer in the hope of providing greater clarity.\n\nThe key to understanding that question is that the question presented there was: \"Are DAs and other prosecutors prohibited from being defense attorneys, such as in a pro bono fashion?\" Having a prosecutor do criminal defense work presents conflicts that other types of *pro bono* work frequently would not.\n\n> Does this mean that public attorneys can engage in pro bono work in\n> Texas? If so, are there strings attached? For example, would a public\n> attorney be able to represent their friends and family so long as they\n> don't charge for the work?\n\nThese questions don't have a single global answer and must be analyzed on a case by case basis. It depends upon whether the *pro bono* work constitutes a conflict of interest with the public attorneys' regular work (i.e. what kind of legal work is done *pro bono* and for whom) and it depends upon the policies of the lawyer's particular employer.\n\nThere are two distinct questions presented, neither of which are materially different in Texas than they were in the previous question.\n\nOne is when doing so would violate the professional ethical obligations of a lawyer, which is what the Texas Bar Association statement is talking about.\n\nThe other is whether it is permissible in a manner consistent with the contractual employer\\-employee relationship of any particular Texas attorney working on a full time salaried basis for a particular employer. This is a subject upon which the Texas Bar Association statement is silent.\n\n**Professional Ethics Considerations**\n\nAs noted above, one question is whether *pro bono* work by a prosecutor in the specific subject matter of criminal defense would constitute a conflict of interest. The answer to that question is \"usually yes\" for the reasons explained in the linked question.\n\nOne can also easily imagine other circumstances where *pro bono* work could pit a salaried government lawyer against his employer, such as a state attorney general's office lawyer doing *pro bono* civil rights litigation against the state government.\n\nBut, not all *pro bono* legal work constitutes a conflict of interest.\n\nFor example, a prosecutor doing *pro bono* work helping low income people prepare documents naming legal guardians for their children in the event that they predecease their children (the very first *pro bono* case I took on as a Colorado attorney) would be very unlikely to be conflict of interest for the prosecutor, even though a *pro bono* criminal defense case in the county where the prosecutor practices would be an obvious and direct unethical conflict of interest.\n\nSimilarly, judges frequently do *pro bono* work, where authorized to do so by the court systems in which they work, in the areas of legal education for non\\-lawyers (like High School Mock Trial competitions or lectures to school students) and by providing mediation services to indigent parties outside the judicial district where they practice, that are specifically calculated to avoid conflicts of interests, or appearance of bias or impropriety.\n\n**Employment Relationship Considerations**\n\nThe second issue is whether \"public attorneys can engage in *pro bono* work in Texas?\" in a case with a subject matter that does not otherwise present a conflict of interest.\n\nPublic sector attorneys are not prohibited from doing so as a matter of professional ethics. But, that isn't the only consideration. The other consideration is whether doing that *pro bono* work violates the employment policies of a public sector employer of a lawyer in the usual case when a public sector lawyer is employed on a salaried basis for the *full efforts* or something similar, of the lawyer. This is basically an issue of contract law, not of professional ethics.\n\nThe way this is usually dealt with in private law practice when a salaried attorney works for a law firm is that the private salaried lawyer needs to obtain law firm permission to do *pro bono* work and that *pro bono* work is often structured so that the *pro bono* client's lawyer is the law firm itself and the lawyer in that firm doing the actual *pro bono* work is often just one agent of the firm as a whole that actual represents the *pro bono* client. Frequently, salaried lawyers in private law firms have quotas of billable hours which they have to meet as a condition of employment each year at the law firm, and frequently a private law firm's *pro bono* program allows the salaried lawyer to count hours working for the law firm's *pro bono* clients towards that annual billable hour quota.\n\nIncidentally, there is nothing magic in the absence of a conflict of interest, about limiting \"moonlighting work\" to unpaid *pro bono* work.\n\nFor example, many U.S. law schools expressly authorize salaried full time law professors who are admitted to the practice of law to have a paid private practice up to a certain number of hours per year as a fringe benefit in addition to the salary, akin to the common practice of allowing professors to retain for themselves textbook royalties for textbooks written while the professors were being paid a salary to do scholarly work including writing textbooks.\n\nThe *pro bono* program structure used in private law firms for their salaried employers isn't as workable for a salaried attorney working full time for a governmental employer. This is because allowing a government salaried employee to work for free for a private citizen on something that doesn't involve public business of the government would functionally be an indirect appropriation of legal salary funds from the governmental entity to the *pro bono* client without receiving authorization from the elected representatives of the government in question.\n\nSo, in the public sector, a more common arrangement would be to provide that every salaried public sector lawyer working for that government is permitted to do up to X billable hours of *pro bono* work per year for their own, personal moonlighting private practice clients as a fringe benefit of employment, much like paid time off, if it is permitted at all. And, other public sector employers, which are not so generous, simply prohibit their salaried attorney employees from doing *pro bono* work at all in order to avoid having to deal with and think about the issue.\n\nThis doesn't arise very often in the case of lawyers hired by small local governments or on a contract basis by a larger government for a particular specialized task, as they have their own practices and have not agreed to provide substantially all of their professional legal work to their employer the way that a salaried lawyer would. So they are more akin to private sector law firm lawyers who simply have an additional set of conflict of interest considerations as a result of having a particular local government as an employer."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A full-time salaried prosecutor in Texas is considering doing pro bono work.

Would there be\n>  civil or criminal penalties if, some but not all, documents (like bank\n>  statements or property assessments) were accidentally lost?\n\nThere isn't enough context in this question to know.\n\nAn executor is a fiduciary who has a duty to account, so if the fiduciary can not provide a report that tells where all of the assets of the estate went, the fiduciary is deemed to have converted the assets unaccounted for and this could even give rise to theft charges.\n\nBut, losing supporting documents for an accounting, particularly documents like bank statements and property assessments which can be recreated from third\\-party sources is neither a crime nor a tort. No one is harmed because they are lost.\n\nA fiduciary has a duty to keep beneficiaries informed of what happened in an estate, not to preserve records supporting those communications *per se*. \n\nAlso, in the probate process, it isn't uncommon for interim accountings to be filed quarterly or annually before the estate is officially closed. And, in many states, when an executor files an interim accounting it can often be contested for only a short time period after it is filed (frequently a matter of weeks or a few months). So, a lack of supporting documentation would only be legally relevant to the time period since the last interim accounting in many cases.\n\nFurther, frequently in a probate estate, to receive a distribution without a court order, a beneficiary will sign a waiver of all liability of the executor and the estate arising prior to the distribution. So, if there are multiple distributions made in a probate estate, only acts since the last waiver was signed could be contested.\n\nSimilarly, if losing documents that help prove that the executor is innocent of improper action makes it harder for the executor to defend himself or herself or itself against claims that the executor acted improperly, the executor may have a harder time defending against those claims.\n\nBut, losing relevant documents during the course of a contested litigation or in anticipation of contested litigation is only sanctionable as spoliation of evidence if the impact on the litigation is material because there is no other source of the evidence, and is intentional.\n\nAlso, with narrow exceptions, usually involving physical injury, accidents don't give rise to criminal liability (which is usually based on reckless or intentional acts).\n\nCivil liability almost never arises unless someone is actually economically or physically harmed by an act.\n\nNow, if the executor lost a \"real\" document like a live check that for some reason can't be reissued due, or a bearer bond that is subsequently sold by a unknown person who finds it to a bona fide purchaser for value, resulting in an economic loss to the estate, and this loss is due to negligence, the executor is legally responsible for indemnifying the estate from this harm. \n\nBut, this would not apply in a case where the document is mere evidence of a legal obligation rather than embodying the legal obligation, or having intrinsic value (e.g. if the document was an original copy of the Declaration of Independence), unless the loss of the document was negligent and losing it causes physical or economic harm (which would rarely be the case).\n\nAs a concluding caveat, it bears mentioning that the relevant parts of the criminal law are predominantly a matter of state law, and that probate law is almost entirely state law, so the law is not perfectly uniform within the United States on this issue. But, these are issues upon which there would be little variation between U.S. states."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An executor of an insolvent estate accidentally loses some original bank statements and property assessments before the estate is settled.

While accidentally losing recreatable documents like bank statements or property assessments is generally not a crime or tort, the executor has a fiduciary duty to account for all estate assets. If the lost documents cannot be recreated and their absence materially impacts the ability to account for assets in an insolvent estate, the executor could potentially face civil penalties.

Todd Horsley*, 117 Idaho 920, 792 P.2d 945 (Idaho 1990\\) is the first reported appellate case in Idaho involving DNA evidence (which was only a conditional plea bargain, reserving the appellate issue of the admissibility of the DNA evidence). The trial court judge was James R. Michaud in a trial in Bonner County. The conditional plea was entered sometime between February 8, 1988 and May 10, 1988, followed by an appeal to the Idaho Supreme Court argued on April 5, 1989 (the opinion contains a typo that in one instance states that the oral argument was on April 5, 1988 rather than April 5, 1989\\). The ruling was delayed due to the death of one of the justices who heard the oral argument and the resignation of another justice who heard to oral argument. The ruling was deferred until those two vacancies were filled and was made by the full reconstituted court on the basis of the briefing and a recording of the oral argument that was conducted on April 5, 1989\\.\n\nAnother early appellate case involving a plea bargain was *State of Idaho v. Roy R. Garcia*, 126 Idaho 836, 892 P.2d 903 (Idaho App. 1995\\). This case was charged as a rape case with DNA evidence, but downgraded to a battery conviction in connection with a plea bargain entered mid\\-trial during a trial commenced on October 12, 1993 after two previous continuances were granted on speedy trial grounds. The court of appeals held that the speed trial objection was waived by the plea bargain.\n\nThe first reported appellate case involving DNA evidence where the defendant was convicted following an evidentiary trial on the merits (in this case to a jury) was *State of Idaho v. Gene Allen Faught*, 127 Idaho 873, 908 P.2d 566 (Idaho 1995\\). The jury trial took place in March of 1994 and involved the defendant's alleged rape of his fourteen year old step\\-daughter (a conviction affirmed on appeal with the admission of the DNA evidence upheld as proper). The trial court judge was Judge George D. Carey presiding over a trial in Ada County.\n\nThe underlying trial in the appellate case *State of Idaho v. Robert Andrew Amerson*, 129 Idaho 395, 925 P.2d 399 (Idaho App. 1996\\), however, commenced September 13, 1993 in Lincoln County before Judge Phillip M. Becker, and resulted in a conviction for the crimes of rape and robbery. The convictions were affirmed although the sentence was modified on appeal. This conviction took place in the trial court about six months before the conviction in *Fraught*.\n\nIt is possible that there was an earlier case than either of these two cases in Idaho that did not result in an appeal because the defendant did not appeal the conviction. There is no good database with that kind of information, other than media reports. Unreported appellate decisions are also not always available. But given the novelty of DNA evidence at the time, the severity of the kind of charges typically proven with DNA evidence in its early days, and the right of a defendant to an appeal at state expense on a novel legal issue, it is fairly unlikely that the appellate cases listed overlook a trial court conviction following a trial that was based upon DNA evidence in Idaho.\n\nI included the full name of the defendant in these cases and other information not customarily mentioned in a summarized case report or citation in order to assist in the search for additional media reports, even though customary citation practice is to include only the surname of the defendant in the citation.

If there were a time for the investor to retreat his money without penalties, then the profits should only be accounted after that period. Or Rickstarter could apply a 5% rate to the money directed at projects that get enough funds, and in that case it could only write his profits in the book the moment the project gets that limit. In case that Rickstarter allowed people just to pledge the money, it would be unwise to count the profits before people had actually paid the money....3\n\nNow, direct taxes4 on business are almost always directly linked to profits, not to the size of assets, so Rickstarter's taxes would be linked to its cut of the money (minus all expenses, of course) and not related to the size of assets that it keeps in scrow.\n\nA different (and a lot more complicated) issue would come from regulatory obligations: there could be laws mandating that if Rickstarter manages more than $X assets then it has to start making audits and comply with other rules. But, while following those rules can have a cost, that would not make them \"taxes\".\n\n1The specific details of which kind of account would be convenient to reflect this obligation is beyond my knowledge of accounting.\n\n2Here [the prudence concept](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/what-is-the-prudence-concept-in-accounting.html) comes into play, you cannot consider that you got your cut until you are reasonably sure that you have earned it.\n\n3This can become very complex. For example, in the case of a pledge RS would probably write as an asset \"the $1000 SJuan76 owes us\", but at the same time if there are doubts about SJuan76 ability or willingness to pay it should also anotate a liability of \"the $1000 (or $500\\) SJuan76 might default\" so it would not be count (at least totally) towards profits.\n\n4There may be taxes based on activity (e.g. sales tax) or related to some assets (for example property taxes on the buildings owned by the company), but I think you are not asking about those."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Rickstarter, a crowdfunding platform, holds $50,000 in its account for a project aiming to raise $100,000 by April.

Can i get sued for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Your factual claims are a bit unclear, specifically where you say that you don't know them but you use their code. I take it you mean that you are not personally acquainted with the other party, but you did somehow acquire his code, and then you used it in your own work.\n\nThis is copyright infringement, and you can easily get sued. Anytime you copy someone else's code without their permission, you have infringed their copyright. It is not a defense that you didn't know they you're required to have permission, and it is not a defense that you changed the code (since copyright is about copying, not verbatim copying). It would be particularly difficult to maintain that you didn't know that permission is required since you say that their code has a license. (If your code has no license, that means nobody other than yourself can legally use it).\n\nOn the off chance that you did not actually mean to say that you used their code, and you meant to say that you accidentally or coincidentally wrote similar\\-looking code, then the legal question is more complicated (essentially unanswerable in a useful way, at least here). One way to establish violation of copyright law is to prove actual copying (eyewitness accounts, confessions, etc.). Alternatively, the fact\\-finders (jury or judge) would have to look at the degree of similarity between the works, to determine whether the similarity is so great that it could not be coincidence or functionally necessary. For example, all examples of bubble sort have a certain necessary similarity. All music with a certain genre is somewhat similar, given the nature of the genre. You would then need to hire an attorney (one experienced in software copyright and substantial similarity doctrines) to assess the particular facts. The point is that even if you did not in fact copy, you could be found guilty of having copied based on such similarity."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer creates an app that notifies users about Steam game discounts. Unknown to them, their code closely resembles that of another developer's licensed app for Steam market notifications.

Even without direct evidence of copying, the first developer can potentially be sued for copyright infringement. This is because:\n\n1. Copyright infringement doesn't require intent. Accidental or unintentional copying can still be infringing.\n2. Substantial similarity between the codes can be used as evidence of copyright infringement, even without direct proof of copying.\n3. The lack of a license on the first developer's app doesn't protect them; it actually means no one else can legally use their code.\n4. The fact that the apps serve slightly different purposes doesn't negate potential copyright infringement if the code is substantially similar.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because intent is not required for copyright infringement.

The latter usually is obvious enough in that it does not attempt to mislead others as to the source or authorship of statements. Was person A's impersonation of B a parody that made truthful but uncomfortable disclosures?\n\nIn the case of parody, what matters is whether the *import* is defamatory.

The parody simulates as if felon Kuhnke wrote a letter to the assistant who for years was sexually harassed by Kuhnke's judicial buddy.\n\nThe parody\\-letter obviously **does not** intend to deceive others as to its authorship: you will notice that the line preceding the parody letter presents it as a *plausible adaptation* of Kuhnke's statements in court.

Since the famous case of **NY Times vs Sullivan**, a President who wished to sue for alleged defamation about any aspect of his official conduct or fitness for office would need to prove \"actual malice\" which is a high (but not impossible) bar to clear.\n\nAs described in [This article](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/can-presidential-candidates-sue-media-outlets-for-defamation/) *Goldwater v. Ginzburg* (1969\\) was a case of losing candidate Barry Goldwater suing *Fact* magazine and its editor Ralph Ginzburg, over a published statement that Goldwater had a \u201cseverely paranoid personality and was psychologically unfit for the high office to which he aspired\u201d. Goldwater won the suit, although he got much less than he sought. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the verdict, finding that the \"actual malice\" standard had been clearly met. The US Supreme Court did not accept the case for review, but Justice Black wrote:\n\n> I cannot subscribe to the result the Court reaches today because I firmly believe that the First Amendment guarantees to each person in this country the unconditional right to print what he pleases about public affairs ...\n> \n> \n> The public has an unqualified right to have the character and fitness of anyone who aspires to the presidency held up for the closest scrutiny. Extravagant, reckless statements and even claims which may not be true seem to me an inevitable and perhaps essential part of the process by which the voting public informs itself of the qualities of a man who would be president.\n\naccording to Black. But the Court did not so hold.\n\nIn the article [\"If the President Is Libeled, Can He Sue? Should He?\"](https://supreme.findlaw.com/legal-commentary/if-the-president-is-libeled-can-he-sue-should-he.html) Julie Hilden discussed a then\\-possible suit by President George W.

A quitclaim deed does not convey after\\-acquired property except when an exception to the general rule applies.\n\nA bargain and sale deed conveys what is described with a promise that the person executing the deed had not encumbered (e.g. mortgaged) or sold the property at any time after it came to be titled in their name that are not described in the deed, but does not promise that the person that they obtained the property from had good title or that their title was free of liens or encumbrances. A bargain and sale deed preserves title insurance policy protections from the previous owner, while a quitclaim deed does not. I don't know what affect a bargain and sale deed has with respect to after\\-acquired property.\n\nWarranty deeds are not normally used for this purpose. Warranty deeds are normally used in arms\\-length sales for fair market value between unrelated parties and are normally processed by title insurance companies who insure the buyer and anyone financing the buyer's purchase of the property with a mortgage against the possibility that the seller didn't have good title to the property sold or had undisclosed liens or encumbrances. A warranty deed contains a promise that the seller owns all real property described in the deed subject only to the liens and encumbrances stated in the deed. A warranty deed also conveys after\\-acquired property.\n\n### ACRIS\n\nYou [don't have to use the ACRIS system](https://www.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-recording-documents.page). You can bring the document to the appropriate city office and have it recorded there on paper in person, rather than electronically.\n\n### Other forms you must file\n\n> Quitclaim deeds filed in New York City use Real Property Transfer\n> Report (Form RP\\-5217NYC) and a Combined Real Estate Transfer Tax\n> Return, Credit Line Mortgage Certificate, and Certification of\n> Exemption from the Payment of Estimated Personal Income Tax (Form\n> TP\\-584\\), both of which are filed with the county clerk.\n\n([Source](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/new-york-state-requirements-for-a-quitclaim-deed#:%7E:text=owns%20the%20property.-,How%20to%20file%20a%20quitclaim%20deed%20in%20New%20York,where%20the%20property%20is%20located.))\n\nTax form 584 has a box to check for transfers such as this one that result in no tax being owed. You check box \"f\" in two places and attach Schedule F. You may also need to fill out Schedule A.\n\n> [Section 1409(a) of the New York Tax Law](https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&bn=S01730&term=2019&Summary=Y&Actions=Y&Text=Y&Committee&nbspVotes=Y&Floor&nbspVotes=Y) has been amended, effective\n> September 13, 2019, in relation to real property transfer tax returns\n> of limited liability companies (LLC). . . .\n> \n> \n> The amended legislation \u201crequires the real property transfer tax\n> return relating to residential property sold or purchased by a limited\n> liability company to include information on the ownership of such\n> company.\u201d S1730 Sponsor Memo\n> \n> \n> The amendment only applies to the conveyance of residential real\n> property containing one\\- to four\\-family dwelling units when the\n> grantor or grantee is an LLC.\n> \n> \n> If you are recording a deed:\n> \n> \n> of a residential real property containing a one\\- to four\\- family\n> dwelling unit, and\n> \n> \n> a grantor or a grantee is an LLC\n> \n> \n> If the grantor or grantee is an LLC and the member of the grantor or\n> grantee LLC is not a single natural person, then all members,\n> managers, or any other authorized persons must be listed and included\n> on a separate page behind the TP\\-584\\. \u201cOther\u201d should be chosen as\n> Grantor or Grantee type on the TP\\-584 in Schedule A.\n> \n> \n> If a member of the LLC is another LLC or other business entity, all\n> shareholders, directors, officers, members, managers, partners and\n> authorized persons of said LLC or business entity must be listed by\n> name and business address until \u201cfull disclosure of ultimate ownership\n> by natural persons is achieved.\u201d\n\n([Source](https://www.westchesterclerk.com/news/2019-news/396-notice-re-conveyances-with-llcs-as-grantors-or-grantees)) The language of the amended statute makes clear that the form must be used even when no tax is actually due in the transaction. See also a discussion of the impact of the 2019 law [here](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/amendment-to-nys-tax-law-affects-36462/).\n\nIncidentally, you do not need to file with the IRS Form 709, a gift tax form, because a transfer from the owners of real property to an LLC that they own is not a taxable gift. Instead it is considered to be a contribution to the capital of the LLC.\n\n### Questions left unanswered\n\nI omit from this answer (for lack of time) the bottom line of all other forms, if any, must be completed and filed when a deed is recorded in New York City in a transfer of real estate for no consideration from its owners to an LLC owned by the owners. In particular, I leave unanswered the questions of whether you need to file the following forms:\n\n* Affidavit of smoke detector\n* Tax form IT\\-2663 (for non\\-residents in our case)\n* Water utility form\n\nI suspect, but do not know that the smoke detector and water utility forms may be New York City specific.\n\nI also do not analyze the filing fees due, but *see* [this chart](https://www.tax.ny.gov/research/property/assess/sales/deedevents.htm). The basic fee for filing a quitclaim deed to residential real estate is $125\\.\n\n(FWIW, for comparison's sake, [in Colorado](https://www.arapahoegov.com/1423/Recording-Fees), the filing fee is $13 plus $5 per page, LLC ownership does not have to be disclosed, one information form similar to Form 584 in NY has to be filed, but doesn't prevent a deed from being recorded and isn't a matter of public record, affidavits related to smoke detectors don't have to be filed, and utility transfers are handled outside the real estate recording system. Prior to a transfer out of an LLC, in Colorado, one has to file a \"Statement of Authority\" which states under oath who is allowed to sign a deed from the LLC but not who owns the LLC.)"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A married couple in New York City wants to transfer their apartment, which they own in fee simple, to a multi-member LLC where they are the only members.

A Quitclaim Deed is typically used for related party transfers to an LLC, rather than a Warranty Deed.\n2. Tax form 584 with Schedule F is required, as it has a box to check for transfers resulting in no tax owed.\n3.

The general rule is that the person who owns the property must maintain the property. There are often local ordinances that explicitly say that, [for example this](https://www.codepublishing.com/WA/Shoreline/html/Shoreline12/Shoreline1205.html) which is the legal mechanism behind [this](https://www.shorelinewa.gov/services/street-maintenance/brush-tree-trimming-for-sight-distance) guidance on tree\\-trimming. A municipality can do the trimming, or they can send official letters to property owners telling them to trim the bushes. It does not matter whether the sign is on your property via an easement, what matters is where the tree is. You are not responsible for trimming your neighbor's tree if the stop sign is on your property."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the town of Greenville, a property owner named John has a large oak tree on his land. The tree's branches have grown to obstruct a stop sign located on the edge of his property. The stop sign is on an easement granted to the town. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the responsibility for maintaining visibility of the stop sign?\n\nA) The town is solely responsible for trimming John's tree to keep the stop sign visible, as the sign is on a town easement.\n\nB) John has no responsibility to maintain the stop sign's visibility, as the easement transfers all maintenance duties to the town.\n\nC) John is responsible for trimming his tree to ensure the stop sign remains visible, even though the sign is on a town easement.\n\nD) The responsibility is shared equally between John and the town, with each required to perform 50% of the necessary trimming.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the general rule across many U.S. jurisdictions, property owners are responsible for maintaining their property, including trees, even when they impact public infrastructure like stop signs. The presence of an easement for the stop sign doesn't typically transfer the responsibility of tree maintenance to the town. The property owner (John in this case) is usually required to ensure that his tree does not obstruct public signs or create safety hazards, regardless of whether the sign is on an easement or not. Many local ordinances explicitly state this responsibility, and towns often have the authority to require property owners to trim trees that obstruct public signs or pose safety risks."}, "49": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77900/to-what-extent-are-us-state-laws-enforceable-across-state-lines", "docs_id": 77900, "title": "To what extent are US state laws enforceable across state lines?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Can laws enacted by a state legislature be enforced on people or organizations that are not strictly within that state?\n\nA notable example is Texas' S.B. 8 bill which essentially criminalizes anyone who aids in an abortion by providing funding, transportation, etc. If an individual or organization located in another state provides such funding, or in the case of a doctor located in another state provides an abortion, can a lawsuit be brought against them within the Texas state legal system?\n\nAnother example might be with regards to labor laws.

The dictates of the constitution itself.\n2. The will of the people.\n\nThe first one, however, has only the force that each branch and its constituent members give it. If the Executive branch collectively decides to selectively (or wholly) ignore the constitutional dictates of the judicial branch (as in your case), then the constitution itself has no force to stop the Executive branch. The branches willfully imposing upon themselves the dictates of the constitution, even when it seems inconvenient or undesirable, falls under the concept of \"respect for the rule of law\". The belief being that it is better to be guided by (democratic) laws and constitutions than to allow particular governments or individuals to dictate things according to their whims. Otherwise we end up with things like dictatorships, which have historically proven themselves to be undesirable for all but the few people in power (and even they sometimes meet an awful end).\n\nThis then pulls us into the second point, which is the will of the people. If one branch of a (democratic) government starts ignoring and disrespecting the rule of law, it then falls to the people to make them pay the consequences: demand rectifying legislation or other measures, elect new officials, recall existing ones, engage in protests, and in extreme situations outright rebellion. Of course, if the people by and large don't mind what's happening, or have too little power to effect change, then the offending branch can continue to do as it pleases. \n\nChina, for example, is considered by many, including its own people, to have a corrupt government. But the people are either too powerless or too unwilling to stop it. Keep in mind that before the current style of government the country was under significant duress from overpopulation, including widespread food shortages, and economic underdevelopment. This rendered many of the people desperate and willing to accept a certain degree of corruption and non\\-democratic rule provided the government solved and prevented such problems; it also led them to essentially accept the [One Child policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-child_policy).

Commit a \"victimless\" crime, e.g. an officer induces someone to pay for a prostitute.\n\nWould that officer be committing a crime or doing something illegal? The officer could be charged for e.g. coercion or as an abettor. But, is entrapment itself illegal for the officer?

The US has a great legal corpus and I enjoy reading about precedent, especially from the SCOTUS.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends on where you are. In the US, [entrapment is a defense](https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-645-entrapment-elements) to a criminal charge. There is a threshold question: is \"solicitation\" sufficient encouragement, there must be \"inducement\" by the government agent which is\n\n> at least persuasion or mild coercion... pleas based on need, sympathy,\n> or friendship... extraordinary promises of the sort 'that would blind\n> the ordinary person to his legal duties' such that 'a law\\-abiding\n> citizen's will to obey the law could have been overborne', or that the\n> government created 'a substantial risk that an offense would be\n> committed by a person other than one ready to commit it'\"\n\nAny person can be charged with the crime of [\"solicitation\"](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9a.28.030) (RCW 9a.28\\.030 in Washington), which however pairs some sort of request with a reward (money or other valuable thing). In Nevada, [solicitation](https://www.leg.state.nv.us/nrs/nrs-199.html#NRS199Sec500) refers to a person who \"counsels, hires, commands or otherwise solicits another\", but also the crimes are limited to kidnapping, arson and murder. A police officer is not rendered immune from criminal prosecution just because he intended the criminal act to have a \"good outcome\" such as leading to the criminal conviction of a bad person. But whether what he said is a crime depends on what the officer said, and what the laws of that state are."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A police officer in Washington state attempts to induce a citizen to commit a crime by making extraordinary promises and appealing to the citizen's sympathy.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal consequences for the police officer?\n\nA) The officer cannot be charged with any crime because entrapment is only a defense for the induced party.\n\nB) The officer can be charged with solicitation under Washington state law, regardless of the type of crime they were attempting to induce.\n\nC) The officer's actions do not constitute a crime because no illegal act was actually committed by the citizen.\n\nD) The officer may face internal disciplinary action but cannot be criminally charged unless the induced crime was kidnapping, arson, or murder.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the officer's actions are ethically questionable and may result in disciplinary action, they do not necessarily constitute a crime under the given circumstances. In Washington state, solicitation requires a request paired with a reward, which is not mentioned in this scenario. Additionally, no crime was actually committed by the citizen. The entrapment defense is typically used by defendants who actually committed a crime due to law enforcement inducement, which didn't occur here.

The main challenge is defining the excluded classes of usage. That is why you should engage an attorney to draft this for you.\n\nI don't think there is any point in adding a $5M penalty clause. You offer a separate paid license for individuals who do not want to comply with the particular terms of your license, and set the fee to whatever you want. Saying that you're gonna fine violators is a bad idea because penalty clauses are illegal. Instead, the standard approach is a liquidated damages clause, where you state what a reasonable estimate of your damages would be.

The North Carolina Supreme Court in Banks v.

This use of the Bible falls under the category of citation for scholarly or historical context, rather than as a source of law itself.

Option A is incorrect because both conditions that would prevent the recording from being used are met. Option B is partially correct, as one-party consent would make the recording legal, but it doesn't account for the exclusionary rule. Option D introduces a condition not mentioned in the original information and is incorrect. Option C is correct because if the exclusionary rule does not apply in a state, then even illegally obtained evidence (such as a recording without proper consent) can be used in court.
