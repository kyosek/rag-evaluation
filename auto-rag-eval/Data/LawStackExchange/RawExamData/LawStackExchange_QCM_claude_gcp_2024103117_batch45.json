For example, suppose a state had a law that says employers can't discriminate against people with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). This doesn't directly conflict with federal law, since TPS people have an immigration status that allows them to work for any employer. However, I am not sure whether the concept of field preemption would apply here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is well established that the federal government has complete control over immigration. See especially [Arizona v. US](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/11-182b5e1.pdf) which holds that\n\n> States are precluded from regulating conduct in a field that Congress\n> has determined must be regulated by its exclusive governance.\n\n[De Canas v. Bica](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/424/351/) (1976\\), 424 U.S. 351 is also relevant to the application of field preemption to INA. In this case, the courts found that Congress had *not* (at that point) entered the field of employment of unauthorized workers, so state laws were not preempted by federal law. Laws can change, and with them, potential state powers.\n\nIn Arizona the court held that\n\n> Intent can be inferred from a framework of regulation \u201cso pervasive .\n> . . that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it\u201d or\n> where a \u201cfederal interest is so dominant that the federal system will\n> be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject\u201d\n\nand with respect to issues of immigration,\n\n> Because Congress has occupied the field, even complementary state\n> regulation is impermissible.\n\nThe [Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-100/pdf/STATUTE-100-Pg3445.pdf) adds provisions to the Immigration and Nationality Act, including employment\\-related law, thus Congress has entered the field of regulating immigration with respect to employment. Current 8 USC \u00a71324b arises from various amendments to the INA, where the present expression \"protected individual\" was inserted, by [Public Law 101\\-649](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-104/pdf/STATUTE-104-Pg4978.pdf#page=77), to replace earlier \"citizen or intended citizen\". Congress also introduced Temporary Protected Status in \u00a7302 of the law, which has specific (more restricted) provisions regarding employment.\n\nThe evidence clearly indicates that Congress intended to include employment issues w.r.t. their supreme power regarding immigration. These discrimination provisions are in the field of immigration, and not discrimination legislation (where Congress has not preempted the field). Congressional silence must, in the light of what Congress *did* say, be interpreted to mean that the US immigration policy only offers certain specific protections, and states cannot add to or subtract from those protections.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Based on federal preemption principles and immigration law, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding state laws on employment discrimination against individuals with different immigration statuses?\n\nA) States can freely enact laws providing additional protections against employment discrimination for individuals with any immigration status, as long as these laws don't conflict with federal law.\n\nB) States are completely prohibited from enacting any laws related to employment discrimination based on immigration status, regardless of the specific protections offered.\n\nC) States can enact laws providing additional protections against employment discrimination, but only for the same categories of individuals protected under 8 USC \u00a71324b.\n\nD) States are preempted from enacting laws that expand employment discrimination protections based on immigration status beyond those specifically outlined in federal law, due to field preemption in immigration matters.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. This answer accurately reflects the principle of field preemption in immigration law, as established by cases like Arizona v.

The most recent order from Florida is [here](https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2021/EO_21-81.pdf). As usual, the order includes relevant citations, viz.\n\n> Article IV, Section 1 (a) of the Florida Constitution and by the\n> [Florida Emergency Management Act](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0200-0299/0252/0252.html), as amended, and all other applicable\n> laws\n\nThe section numbers and act names differ between the 50 states, but it reduces to the same logic as was employed to mandate different degrees of shut\\-down and mask\\-wearing. The emergency powers granted to the governor are very broad, and nothing within \u00a7252\\.36 hints that he overstepped his authority. Such powers might (rarely) be limited under a strict scrutiny judicial review, though such reviews in the age of covid have had limited success. There is no construal of \"fundamental rights\" whereby a limit on what government agencies can do could be called into question.\n\nGovernments have a well\\-established power to regulate businesses, which this order does. The order addresses a compelling government interest (assuring the privacy of individuals, and their ability to live their lives without discrimination, etc.), and it is narrowly tailored (temperature screening is still allowed). Perhaps a business can file a lawsuit, advancing a non\\-obvious argument that the order infringes on the liberty of businesses, but I doubt that it would gain judicial traction.\n\nThis is not to say that the Florida legislature could not pass a mandatory vaccination law coupled with a mandate to prove one's compliance: but they have not done so.

Massachusetts Supreme Court decision, which allows for mandatory vaccinations.\n\nD) The order cannot be challenged in court because it falls under the governor's absolute authority during a state of emergency.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is B. The governor's order is likely legal under emergency powers granted by state constitutions and emergency management acts. These powers are typically broad and allow governors to issue various orders during declared emergencies. However, the state legislature could potentially pass a law that contradicts this order, which would take precedence if enacted (especially if a gubernatorial veto is overridden).\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because existing vaccine requirements for schools don't necessarily conflict with this order, which specifically addresses COVID-19 vaccine passports.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because while Jacobson v. Massachusetts allows for mandatory vaccinations, it doesn't require them. States can choose whether to mandate vaccines or not.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because gubernatorial orders can be challenged in court, even during emergencies.

If I go into a restaurant and order hundreds of dollars of food, then leave before it arrives, I would imagine there is some recourse that the proprietor could take. However, if I order a single item and it doesn't show up for over an hour, despite me inquiring about it's status, would I be compelled to pay?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In placing an order (for anything, not just in a restaurant) and in the supplier accepting it then a legally binding verbal contract has been created. There are terms that come into being implicitly: some come from statute law and some from common law.\n\nFor example, in most jurisdictions there will be either a common law or specific statute that requires the product to be of merchantable quality and fit for the purpose the customer explicitly or implicitly made known to the vendor. In a restaurant, this means that the food must be presented in a way that enables you to eat it and it must be fit for human consumption.\n\nIt also means that, in the absence of a time for delivery being specified, that the meal must be delivered within a reasonable time. Reasonable has a specific legal meaning and is an objective test: what an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person would expect in the specific circumstances.\n\nIt is clear that a reasonable time varies with the circumstances. Reasonable in McDonalds is different from reasonable in a 3 Michelin star restaurant and also different from the same McDonald's when it is obvious to the customer that they are currently insanely busy.\n\nIf the supplier does not supply the goods and services within a reasonable time then they have breached a term of the contract. The customer has several options: \n\n* repudiate the contract and sue for damages if this is a breach of a condition of the contract (a condition is a term that is fundamental to the contract; late delivery of food probably isn't a condition),\n* repudiate the contract and sue for damages if this is a major breach of a term of the contract (late delivery probably is),\n* sue for damages if this is an intermediate breach of a term or a breach of a warranty.\n\nEnough generalities, for your specific queries:\n\n> What law in involved in restaurant orders?\n\nContract law, consumer protection law, health and safety law, business law, food hygiene laws, tax laws etc. etc.\n\n> If I go into a restaurant and order hundreds of dollars of food, then leave before it arrives, I would imagine there is some recourse that the proprietor could take.\n\nSure, there is a contract, you breached it, the restaurant can sue for damages. In addition, they could make a complaint to the police that you have acted fraudulently by ordering food you never intended to pay for.\n\n> However, if I order a single item and it doesn't show up for over an hour, despite me inquiring about it's status, would I be compelled to pay?\n\nIt depends on if an hour is a reasonable time or not. By inquiring you have demonstrated that you don't believe that it is but you may not be \"an ordinary, reasonable and prudent person\". If the breach is actual and egregious enough then you probably have the right to repudiate the contract; that means the contract is at an end and neither of you have any further obligations under it including an obligation to pay.\n\nThat said, you would be on surer ground if you attempted to renegotiate the contract to make time a condition. \"Look, if the meal is not here in 15 minutes, I'm leaving\"; if the restaurateur accepts this renegotiation by, for example, saying \"I'm terribly sorry, we will sort it out\" then your position is much clearer.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John enters a busy restaurant and orders a steak dinner.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) John is legally obligated to pay for the meal he ordered, regardless of the delay.\nB) The restaurant has breached the contract by not delivering the meal within a reasonable time, so John can leave without any legal consequences.\nC) John should have explicitly renegotiated the contract with a time condition before leaving to be on legally safer ground.\nD) The restaurant can sue John for damages, but cannot involve the police as this is purely a civil matter.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While the restaurant's delay might be considered unreasonable, what constitutes a \"reasonable time\" can vary based on circumstances (e.g., how busy the restaurant is). John's safest legal option would have been to explicitly renegotiate the contract by stating a specific time condition (e.g., \"If my meal isn't here in 15 minutes, I'm leaving\"), and getting the restaurant's agreement. This would make the time a clear condition of the contract, giving John a stronger legal position to leave without paying if the condition wasn't met. \n\nOption A is incorrect because unreasonable delay can be grounds for contract repudiation. Option B is problematic because what's \"reasonable\" is subjective and depends on circumstances. Option D is incorrect because if the restaurant believed John never intended to pay, they could potentially involve police for fraud, though this would be hard to prove in this scenario."}, "4": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80772/comments-on-rafaela-espinal-v-new-york-city-department-of-education-et-al", "docs_id": 80772, "title": "Comments on Rafaela Espinal v.

But so can a trained and experienced judge. Or police officer. Or surgeon.\n\nIn countries where [jury trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial#Pros_and_cons) are an embedded part of the legal system, they are seen as providing an important balance to government power, an egalitarian measure that places judgement in the hands of lay members of the public rather than a judicial elite and a defence against bias since they require unanimous or near\\-unanimous (10 of 12 is common) verdicts.\n\nIn countries where they are not part of legal\\-social culture they are often regarded as stupid.\n\nBoth positions are arguable.\n\nAt the end of the day, juries can be biased and arbitrary. So can judges. The protection against this for judges is they have to give reasons for their decision and that is subject to appeal. The protection against this for juries is that their decisions have to be unanimous or, where majority verdicts are accepted, they have to be a super\\-majority \\- usually 10 from 12\\. However, the decision of the jury is typically not subject to review and they are usually prohibited from discussing their reasons: what happens in the jury room stays in the jury room.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status of this situation?\n\nA) The original text agreement is not legally binding because it was not formalized in a written contract.\n\nB) The party attempting to modify the agreement has the right to do so until all terms are fully executed.\n\nC) The original text agreement is likely enforceable, and the attempt to unilaterally modify its terms may not be valid.\n\nD) Text message agreements are never considered legally binding in California courts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Text agreements can be legally binding if they meet the requirements of a contract, which typically include offer, acceptance, consideration, and the intention to create legal relations. In this case, there was a clear offer and acceptance via text messages, and partial performance of the agreement (signature of escrow papers) further strengthens its enforceability. The attempt to unilaterally modify the terms after reaching an agreement and partial performance is likely not valid without the other party's consent. \n\nOption A is incorrect because text agreements can be legally binding if they meet contract requirements. Option B is incorrect because once an agreement is reached, one party cannot unilaterally change the terms without the other's consent.

Since this is fairly likely is there a de facto restriction on the content?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The U.S. Supreme Court has held time and time again that all restrictions on Speech must be \"content neutral\" and using the least restricted means available. Furthermore, Speech is presumed to be \"protected political speech\" until proven other wise in a court of law.\n\nThis means that the specific nature of the hacked content (a pro Nazi ad) is no more illegal than the [1987 Max Headroom Broadcast Signal Intrusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Headroom_broadcast_signal_intrusion). Wikipedia lists the maximum legal fine as a $1000 fine and a year in jail (although no one has ever been prosecuted for the incident.). While the incident did include several obscene gestures that would not be allowed on Television, these restrictions are part of the deal for a broadcast signal licenses with the FCC and are not applicable in this case due to the crime being that the parties involved didn't have a broadcast liscense for that channel to begin with.\n\nIn the hypothetical where the unexpected interruption lead to a Jewish Man having a fatal arguement, again, the law is constructed in a manner to charge with a crime, specifically \"Felony Murder\". Felony Murder is said to occur when a person, in the commission of a felony, is responsible for the death of another person, be it a co\\-conspirator or an innocent bystander. The typical hypothetical case used for this is if a bank robber with a non\\-functional gun (clearly intending to not hurt anyone) and the little old lady bank patron has a fatal heart attack when the robber brandishes the weapon and yells \"Nobody move, this is a stick up.\" Because robbing a bank is illegal, it doesn't matter that she was susceptible to heart attacks because she's an old lady, but that the robber chose to break the law and in doing so, directly caused the fatal heart attack. If the crime in question is a misdemeanor that leads to someone's death, then the charge is Manslaughter, not Murder (i.e. If you are speeding going into a green light, and a kid runs into your path and is killed in the car crash, this could result in a manslaughter charge. Even though the kid was Jaywalking, which is a crime, you were speeding, which is also a crime, and thus responsible for the fatality, but not to the level of murder, due to reckless disregard.).\n\nIn your scenario, the Jewish Man's death can be prosecuted, but is not specifically because of the content of the message broadcast (the Nazi ad) but the underlying crime of the broadcast hijacking a signal which he is not licensed to broadcast on by the FCC. Given that the penalty includes a possible year in jail, this means the crime is a felony offense (and a Federal one at that, but that speaks more to the certainty of conviction on charges brought against the accused party. The Feds are very very good at making sure they get their man).\n\nAgain, it is not specifically because content discussing conspiracies about the Nazis was broadcast (we're not arresting the History channel for all their Nazi conspiracy theories) but because the event violated a law that is content neutral. If the hacker interrupted the signal to broadcast Martin Luther King Jr's. \"I have a dream\" Speech, causing a Klan member to die in shock, he'd be no less guilty of the same crimes as he would be in your scenario. He did something illegal which resulted in someone's death. The law doesn't care about the specific details of the content of the death in determining the charge. Certainly the fact that the content was Nazi propaganda would matter, but only in establishing this particular case. If a similar incident occurs and no one dies, then the second hacker wouldn't be charged with \"attempted murder\".\n\nEven in the very limited restrictions on speech, context is critical and will be judged more then content. The classic \"You can't shout fire in a crowded theater\" is not universal. I can in fact shout \"Fire in a Crowded Theater\" if there is in fact a fire... or I am speaking to the audience on matters of U.S. Free Speech and am pointing out a case where my shout is still protected because I am discussing an oft cited example case of speech that has reasonable restrictions but narrowly so and in certain contexts is still protected political speech (Deadpool eat your heart out on that meta).\n\nFinally, since you bizzarely tagged this as copyright, the Supreme Court also held that trademarks are not government endorsement of speech and thus the government cannot with hold any registration of copyright's, trademarks, or patents because of the use of offensive language. The case stems from an all Asian American band being denied the trademark for the act's name, which was a slur for Asian people that the band was trying to reclaim (aka using an offensive slur in a positive way to take it back from the bigots). The court found in favor of the band as the government was using it's interpretation of the band's name as offensive to deny them equal protection under the law (in this case, the Trademark that would allow the Band the exclusive use of the stylized name in merchandise).\n\nIt's also very rare that a First Amendment case will be decided on a 5\\-4 decision margin by SCOTUS, and most justices tend to rule on the side that the First Amendment protects \"the speech I do not like.\" In fact, in the vast majority of cases dealing with the First Amendment, the justices tend to be 9\\-0 more often then not.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A hacker interrupts the Super Bowl broadcast to air a Holocaust denial advertisement.

According to the information provided, the hacker could be charged with felony murder. This is because the death occurred during the commission of a felony (unauthorized broadcasting, which is a federal offense potentially punishable by jail time). The law doesn't consider the specific content of the broadcast when determining charges, but rather focuses on the illegal act itself and its consequences.\n\nOption A is incorrect because in the U.S., restrictions on speech must be content-neutral, and the offensive nature of the message itself is not grounds for additional charges.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while the hacker would be charged for the unauthorized broadcasting, they could also face additional charges related to the death that occurred as a result of their illegal actions.\n\nOption D is incorrect because under the felony murder rule, a person can be held responsible for deaths that occur during the commission of a felony, even if the death was not directly caused by the perpetrator's actions."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37284/am-i-a-taxable-business", "docs_id": 37284, "title": "Am I a taxable business?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I work for a company based in Massachusetts but I work off site in Connecticut.

And if so, how would I approach this problem in the right manner?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is going to depend on whether those services act as independent controllers, or as your data processors.\n\nIf they are separate controllers, then you need a legal basis for sharing your user's personal data with them, which happens e.g. by loading content from their services. This legal basis will typically be consent, and will typically be implemented in a click\\-to\\-load fashion, where the functionality initially has a placeholder that asks for consent, and is later replaced with the embedded content if consent is given. You are not responsible for the independent controller's privacy practices, though. You are not the data controller for the services' logfiles.\n\nIf they are your data processors, then things are very different. You are not sharing your users personal data with another service, you are processing personal data under your authority, and have merely outsourced some aspects of these activities. If a data processor maintains logfiles, these are your logfiles that they just maintain on your behalf. You would be fully responsible for them, including, if appropriate, by facilitating the exercise of data subject rights like access or erasure.\n\nSince you cannot delegate responsibility for compliance to your data processors, you should only engage data processors where you are confident that using their services allows you to be fully GDPR\\-compliant. Before integrating their services, you might evaluate what data will actually be processed, whether this is necessary for your purposes, how you can configure the data processing activities, and how you can fulfil data subject rights with regards to these processing activities. For example, a service provider might offer a data protection dashboard where you can export or delete user data, if that service provider wants to make it easy to use their services in a GDPR\\-compliant manner.\n\nEven if engaging the service as a data processor, you will need a legal basis for the actual processing activity. This might be consent (opt\\-in), or a different legal basis like a legitimate interest, in which case an opt\\-out may be required. When consent is revoked or a legitimate interest is objected to, past processing activities remain lawful. Whether past data will have to be deleted depends on context.\n\nWhether or not an \"account\" was created on your backend is a red herring. If you can identify the data subject's information on the backend, they can exercise their data subject rights. This is possible without an account e.g. if pseudonymous client IDs are used. However, you are not required to keep identifying data just for GDPR purposes (see Art 11\\). If it is not possible for you to locate the data subject's records, then the data subject rights like access and erasure don't apply.\n\nPersonal tip for Google services: Google offers a wide variety of services under very different terms. You will have to investigate those services on a case by case basis. For some such as Maps, Google will be the data controller. For other such as Crashlytics, Google will act as a processor. But as of 2023, Google does not guarantee for most of its services that personal data will only be processed in the EU or in countries with an adequate level of data protection. This can make it extremely tricky (or outright impossible) to use their services in a GDPR\\-compliant manner. Sometimes the use of such possibly\\-noncompliant services can still be a valid business decision, but the safer approach would be to avoid Google services whenever possible.

A narrow interpretation of the word \"sign\" is some physical object with appropriate words like \"Road closed for parade\", but a broader interpretation is \"an indication\", such as a person saying \"Road closed for parade\".

However, [ORS 811\\.535](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_811.535) which is the general \"failure to obey\" law only applies to disobeying uniformed police officers displaying a badge. The difference between the two offenses is that violating \"use when prohibited\" is only a class D infraction while disobeying a uniformed police officer is a class B infraction.\n\nState law does not say what kind of person can direct traffic, it frames restrictions in terms of what a traffic authority can regulate (such as parades). County or municipal ordinances might then specifically say who is authorized to direct traffic. I assume it was not unknowable that there was a parade then and there, so the driver was already on notice that the road was closed to regular traffic. Nevertheless, state law does require that there be a \"sign\", so if you had called the police to ticket a person, they might have made a federal or at least state case out of it, and we could learn what, in Oregon, the word \"sign\" means in the context of that law.\n\nA crucial question is whether the road was closed by a competent traffic authority.

In all likelihood, no. Community property state laws generally state that property (not just real property) acquired during a marriage becomes part of the \"community\" (the community of the two spouses) and is usually divided 50/50 in the instance of a divorce. Laws may vary by state on how that property is divided, though. For example, California does 50/50, equally, whereas Texas does it \"equitably.\" \n\n**Factors Used in Equitable Distribution:**\n\nIf you live in a state using the equitable distribution doctrine, the [main factors](http://family.findlaw.com/divorce/community-property-overview.html) are each spouses earning capacity on their own, if and which parent is the legal caretaker of the children if there are children, and whether there are any examples of specific fault for the divorce, such as adultery, abuse, etc. \n\nMore granular factors related to the main ones include whether someone would lose a benefit or mode of compensation they would have been entitled to if the marriage continued; health matters; age differences and how they may relate to ability to maintain employment or receive benefits; what size inheritance, if any, a spouse may be positioned to receive; and the size of the estate itself.\n\n**Community Property or Not:**\n\nIf the property is acquired while you are married, it is generally considered community property (this is true often in states that don't have community property statutes, but especially so in those that do). This [includes](https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/the-ins-and-outs-of-community-property-law) income, real or personal property acquired with income earned during the marriage (cars, houses, luxury items, appliances, etc.), as well as debts. \n\nConversely, property you had before you got married, property you acquired after you and your spouse became legally separated, and any property received as a gift or as an inheritance *from a third party* remains separate after divorce. On the latter item, the party that received the gift or inheritance must keep it separate during the marriage in order for it to remain separate. If you receive a cash inheritance, don't dump it into your joint bank account, or you will likely have waived your separate claim to it. \n\nThis website provides some common examples and their dispositions as separate property or community property toward the bottom of the page: [http://www.nolo.com/legal\\-encyclopedia/separate\\-community\\-property\\-during\\-marriage\\-29921\\.html](http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/separate-community-property-during-marriage-29921.html). \n\n**Addition:**\n\nAfter @ohwilleke's helpful comment below about the post\\-nup, I'm adding the following.\n\nA couple may create a [transmutation agreement](http://www.assetprotectionattorneys.com/Asset_Protection_Blog/2013/April/How_can_we_protect_our_assets_if_we_live_in_a_co.aspx), which is a type of post\\-nuptial agreement. A transmutation agreement operates in a community property state to keep the two spouse's property separate despite the state law (it is worth noting, this is similar to the principle of contract law where parties to a contract usually are able to waive certain rights guaranteed them in statute assuming the waiver was made knowingly and willingly).

While inheritance is typically considered separate property, how it's managed during the marriage can affect its status. Simply titling the property in John's name (A) or using only inheritance money (B) may not be sufficient to keep it separate in a community property state like Texas. Option D is incorrect because there are ways to keep property separate, even in community property states. The most secure method is for John and Mary to create a transmutation agreement, which is a type of post-nuptial agreement. This agreement can keep the property separate despite state law, but it's crucial that both spouses have separate legal counsel to ensure the agreement is fair and less likely to be challenged later.

It is legal for medicinal use in 36 states, yet it remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law, which means it's considered to have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. This situation is not shared by other substances, except those with narrow religious exemptions like peyote.\n\nOption A is incorrect because marijuana is a Schedule I substance, not Schedule II. Schedule II substances can be prescribed by medical professionals consistent with state law.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation indicates that medical marijuana is essentially the only substance with this particular legal dissonance between state and federal law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because states cannot simply legalize all Schedule I substances for medicinal use.

However, uploading recordings in which copyrighted music is played so that others, even a small invited group, could download copies and could, if they choose, distribute them further would be copyright infringement if done without the permission of the copyright holder. In the US such permission could be obtained with a \"mechanical\" license, which requires payment of a statutory fee. Or it could be requested directly from the holder or holder's agent, in which case the terms would be whatever the holder will agree to.\n\nMaking recordings of a copyrighted musical work, even if they are not distributed, also requires permission (which can be obtained through a compulsory \"mechanical\" license or directly).\n\nCites to US Copyright Law\n-------------------------\n\n[17 USC 101](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#101) says:\n\n> To perform or display a work \u201cpublicly\u201d means\u2014\n\n> (1\\) to perform or display it at a place open to the public or at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered; or\n\n> (2\\) to transmit or otherwise communicate a performance or display of the work to a place specified by clause (1\\) or to the public, by means of any device or process, whether the members of the public capable of receiving the performance or display receive it in the same place or in separate places and at the same time or at different times.\n\n[17 USC 106](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#106) lists as among of the rights which a copyright holder has:\n\n> (1\\) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords;\n\n> (4\\) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly;\n\n[17 USC 115](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115) covers \"mechanical\" or \"cover\" compulsory licenses.\n\nPractical Considerations\n------------------------\n\nGiven that the web site will be on an invite\\-only basis, it is likely that the copyright holder would never learn of it. Even if the copyright holder does learn, many holders would not consider filing suit, which would involve court fees and legal expenses, in such a case. If no fees are being charged, and the market for the copyrighted work is not harmed. the likely damages even if a suit is filed and won, are relatively small, so a suit might well not pay off.\n\nBut some holders would sue on principle, and there is no way to know in advance who would or would not. There would be an element of legal risk in putting up such a web site.\n\nOther countries\n---------------\n\nThe above is all based on [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") law.

(But there are limits; arguing that you're a sovereign citizen \\- or that you're the second coming of Christ \\- and laws don't apply to you might get you jailed for contempt).\n\nI can argue that I'm entitled to take food from the grocery store without paying because I am entitled to it because I am, well, **I am me**, the greatest person in the history of mankind, and as such, I don't have to buy food. Because I am me.\n\n> Would that argument just be discarded?\n\nBut the \"I am me\" argument isn't going to fly in court (and possibly very quickly because the court will not be happy about a frivolous argument not based in the law) against a charge of theft because we're talking about the rule of law, which is established and adopted as a framework of justice in the interest of a legal system fair to all, and not a speculative framework, such as philosophy, or a religious framework based on concepts of faith. The rule of law is a general agreement (subject to change, of course; see below) that certain things are wrong, and there is a price to pay, and that price to pay is written down and established as a norm and formalized through the lawmaking arm of the government, which can change that rule of law in a lawful way. See [Rule of law \\- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law).\n\n> Could a jury be forced to consider the question?\n\nA jury can't be forced to consider a philosophical (or religious) idea. A judge might encourage a jury to consider a philosophical or religious theory as a way to arrive at a verdict, but to arrive at verdict based in the law, not based on that philosophy or religion. A jury can certainly take a defendants' arguments into consideration; that's the basis of their debates. The members of jury may talk among itself about theories and philosophies in order to debate and arrive at a verdict based in the law. Some members of the jury may only refer to philosophy or relgion, and solely and hold out and prevent a verdict from being arrived at, because that juror(s) are pursuing something based in ideology, or they are confused about the rule of law. Those jurors could be removed from the jury (under the rule of law) in order to arrive at a verdict.\n\n> Or does each legal system have pre\\-specified philosophical ground\n>  rules within which trials are held?\n\nIt could be argued that our rule of law is derived from a set of philosophical (and arguably religious, too) ground rules that began with the [United States Constitution \\- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution), and the rule of law as codified as a necessity excludes other philosophical ground rules in the interest of even\\-handed and fair justice for all.\n\nThere are many other rules of law which are based in other legal, philosophical and religious traditions. And those rules of law may include written \"ground rules\" that are referred to as objective and based on something like a Constitution; or they may include judgements derived from the warm entrails of animals.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a court of law, a defendant argues that he is not guilty of premeditated murder because he philosophically believes that premeditation is impossible.

The writ of certiorari then was an attempt to get SCOTUS to overturn that, correct?

You question the ability of organisations to have intent. A corporation can be fully responsible for negligent behaviour when multiple employees knowingly acted against the interest of their customers/clients because Corporations are separate legal entities meaning they are kept separate from their owner/s liability wise. \n\nYes the actions of many employees give rise to business operations and hence, the employees act on behalf of their organisation as one. Whilst ceos can be sued individually for bad company direction, it often comes down to the type of claim and who by.\n\nAs for other issues faced by corporations as legal persons.\nIn private law there have been cases brought forward about a companies right to privacy as a legal person, this has not been upheld in Australia where the media have a right to post and companies must be transparent in their actions. The ability for a corporation to be fully viewed as a legal person is in question here.\n\nIn another issue, land can be declared a legal person. It cannot be said it has intention and it is unlikely it would be sued by anyone, however, the governing authority responsible for the land can take action on behalf of the land to protect \u2018its interests\u2019 \\- interests being an objective point of view as to obligations of the governing body rather than a subjective point of view from the actual land itself.\n\nIn short, yes corporations have leaders and governing owners that put forth actions, but they are a legal person in the sense that they act as one body rather than many individuals with different subjective intentions and views. It makes it easier to claim legal issues this way. For example the intention of Bob as marketing chief would be more subjective and harder to determine than the intention of the actions of the whole company in a misleading advertising claim.

Corporations are treated as separate legal entities, distinct from their owners and executives. This means that a corporation can be held liable for its actions, even if individual leaders like the CEO claim lack of knowledge. The concept of corporate personhood allows for the company to be sued and held responsible as a whole, rather than just targeting individual employees or executives. This approach makes it easier to pursue legal action and potential compensation, as the corporation typically has more resources than any individual employee.

I doubt it would be necessary to rewrite the code as `import math as m` when `import math` works just fine.\n\nIn other words, I am wondering if the originality requirement implies that some code snippets on Stack Overflow may not be original enough to be copyrightable in the U.S. Please let me know your thoughts.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n1. I do not believe that [this FAQ post](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12527/do-i-have-to-worry-about-copyright-issues-for-code-posted-on-stack-overflow), while informative, addresses this specific question, since that post does not make any reference to the originality requirement for U.S. copyright. The answer to that post states, in part, that \"Anything that you post to Stack Overflow will be under the terms of the Creative Commons license.\" However, I believe there are cases (such as the one in my example above) where a code snippet may not qualify for a Creative Commons copyright because it fails to meet the originality requirement. In fact, such cases may be substantial, especially for beginner\\-level questions that address general programming conventions.\n2. tpg2114 pointed out in the Meta forum (where this question had originally been posted) that a detailed explanation \\+ import math or similarly non\\-original code block \\+ detailed explanation as a whole would qualify for a CC license. I think my main concern is about situations where the code provided is the widely accepted best practice for a particular language, rather than someone's original creative work. In other words, if the line of code reflects how thousands of programmers around the world would accomplish a task because it's the best way to do so, I'm just doubtful whether a copyright license would apply.\n3. tpg2114 also helped me realize that a relevant question here is: if something can't be copyrighted, does it qualify for a Creative Commons license? The following quotes from the Creative Commons website indicate that material that can't be copyrighted also can't have a Creative Commons license applied to it:\n\n> 1. \"CC licenses do not contractually impose restrictions on uses of a work where there is no underlying copyright.\"\n\n> 2. \"CC licenses are operative only when applied to material in which a copyright exists, and even then only when a particular use would otherwise not be permitted by copyright.\"\n\n> 3. \"You should also not apply Creative Commons licenses to works that are no longer protected by copyright or are otherwise in the public domain.\"  \n> \n> Source for all 3 quotes\n\n4. This raises a new question: even if a post \\+ code snippet as a whole are eligible for Creative Commons (due to the originality expressed in the text, for instance), if the code snippet by itself does not qualify for copyright because it's similar to import math, would I be able to use that without releasing my own program under Creative Commons?\n\nI believe the following quote may help answer this question:\n\n> \"To constitute an adaptation \\[which would need to be licensed under CC\\-BY\\-SA as well if the source was CC\\-BY\\-SA], the resulting work itself must be considered based on or derived from the original. This means that if you use a few lines from a poem to illustrate a poetry technique in an article you\u2019re writing, your article is not an adaptation because your article is not derived from or based on the poem from which you took a few lines.\" [Source](https://certificates.creativecommons.org/cccertedu/chapter/4-4-remixing-cc-licensed-work/)\n\nSo in other words, if I take an excerpt like import math from a CC\\-BY\\-SA post on Stack Overflow and incorporate it into a larger project, my project may not be an adaptation of the Stack Overflow post, and therefore I may not need to release my project under CC\\-BY\\-SA as well. I say \"may not\" because (1\\) I'm not a lawyer, and (2\\) the code snippet isn't just an illustration or an example, but rather plays an important role in the functioning of my actual program.\n\n5. I also found [this helpful article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/do-code-snippets-violate-copyright-law-russ-pearlman/) from an attorney that addresses whether simple code snippets can be copyrighted: However, this article states that Stack Overflow posts are covered by CC\\-BY, when in fact they're covered under CC\\-BY\\-SA.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You are in general correct, KBurchfiel. A code snippet such as\n\n```\nimport math;\n\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nFor i := 1 to 10  \n  print i;\n\n```\n\nhas no originality, and is not protected by copyright. A post eplaining the meaning an usage of such a snippet might well be original enough to be protected by US copyright, indeed it probably would. But the code on its own would not be. Anyone could read such a post, and if s/he understood it, use the code snippet and not be in violation of copyright, not compelled to place the entire program in which such a snippet was used under a CC\\-\\=BY\\-SA license.\n\nThe creative commons people would prefer that a CC license not be applied to a publication that is not protected by copyright, and if it is so applied it is legally meaningless. But they have no legal way to enforce such a preference.\n\nA stack exchange post that consisted of **nothing** but such an uncopyrightable code snippet, with no explanation r discussion, might well be downvoted or even deleted. But that is a matter of site policy on what is a useful answer, not a matter of copyright.\n\nUsing an excerpt from a copyrighted work so small that the excerpt alone would be uncopyrightable, would probably be fair use under US law, and might well be fair dealing in UK law.\n\nSomething that is fair use does not compel the reuser to abide by the terms of a CC license, because those terms apply **only** when the content could not be reused without the CC license's permission.\n\nHowever, a code snippet does not need to be very much more original than the above examples before it becomes copyrightable. Whether it can be used via fair use rather than via the CC\\-BY\\-SA license is a very fact\\-based decision (the usual four\\-factor analysis is spelled out in 17 USC 107\\).. But if the snippet can be rewritten to express the same concepts but in a different expression, then there is no copyright issue, and again the CC license will not apply.\n\nIf the snippet is complex and original enough to be copyrightable (a fairly low bar) and it is re\\-used unchanged, under conditions where fair use does not apply, then the CC\\-BY\\-SA license's terms must be complied with for the use to be legal.

The copyrightability of a code snippet depends on its level of originality and creativity, which is assessed on a case-by-case basis. While very simple snippets (like \"import math\" alone) may not be copyrightable due to lack of originality, slightly more complex snippets could potentially be protected by copyright.\n\nEven if a snippet is copyrightable, the fair use doctrine in U.S. copyright law may allow for its use without invoking the CC-BY-SA license terms, depending on factors such as the purpose of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the potential market for the original work.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it overgeneralizes, assuming all snippets are copyrightable.

Instead, it is done mostly piecemeal. Some of the more important laws in Massachusetts are:\n\n* In Massachusetts, the age of majority is eighteen.

Massachusetts recognizes a few exceptions for necessaries and education, motor vehicle liability insurance (if age sixteen or older), and life insurance (for age 15 or older). (Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 175 sections 113K and 128 and court decisions).\n* A minor may file a lawsuit against another party though a \u201cnext friend,\u201d representative, or guardian ad litem (Rules of Civil Procedure 17(b)).\n\nOther state statutes govern the voting age, tobacco purchasing age, the age at which one can work at particular kinds of jobs, consent to medical treatment, the age of consent for purposes of statutory rape laws (which are generally below age eighteen), the ages for which marriage is possible (without parental or court consent, with court consent, and with parental consent), status as a child for purposes of child support and custody cases, status as a child for purposes of tolling statutes of limitations during minority, statutes of limitations in paternity cases, and ages at which school attendance is mandatory.\n\nFederal law sets an age limit of eighteen years old to act in pornographic material and for moving someone across state lines for the purpose of having sex with them, even though the age of consent in a non\\-commercial, private context is lower.\n\nAlso, for some purposes, an eighteen year old is not an adult.

These are the rights that a software developer may grant for software they have developed. Unfortunately the exclusive rights were drafted long before software was invented and it's hard to understand how they directly relate to software.\n\nTwo of the exclusive rights are the right to `publicly perform` the work and the right to `publicly display` the work.\n\nIn the context of a source code and binary code software license what do each of these two rights convey and how are they different from each other? \n\nCitations to third party sources that address this would also be greatly appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [17 USC 101](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/101), \"perform\" is defined as:\n\n> To \u201cperform\u201d a work means to recite, render, play, dance, or act it,\n>  either directly or by means of any device or process or, in the case\n>  of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, to show its images in\n>  any sequence or to make the sounds accompanying it audible.\n\nTo display is:\n\n> To \u201cdisplay\u201d a work means to show a copy of it, either directly or by\n>  means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or\n>  process or, in the case of a motion picture or other audiovis\u00adual\n>  work, to show individual images nonsequentially.\n\nThe terms \"display\" and \"perform\" do not apply to what one ordinarily does with software. Software isn't an audiovisual work so the second half of the definition of \"perform\" is inapplicable. You also can't recite, render, play, dance, or act software \\-\\- you can run / execute it, and that isn't part of what \"perform\" means. Likewise you don't display software when you execute it \u2013 you might display a thing created by software, but you don't (usually) display the software itself.\n\nThere are competing legal theories (held by judges) about how to interpret laws. One approach pays attention to the literal meaning of words, and in that approach one cannot say that running software constitutes \"performance\" or \"display\". Another approach is to decide what the outcome is supposed to be in a given case, and then stretch the meaning of words (or not) to fit that end. You might guess I don't like the latter approach: I mention this because it's not inconceivable that the meaning of \"perform\" could be stretched to mean \"execute\", given a bit more shift in judicial philosophy.\n\nBut notice that [section 106](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) (4\\)\\-(6\\) specifically ties \"performance\" to literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works\" as well as sound recordings, and ties \"display\" to \"literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work\". In other words, we don't need to care about \"perform\" and \"display\" because performing softward and displaying software is not a protected right anyhow, at least by the letter of the law.\n\nUsing software at all without permission is prohibited, even in the privacy of your own home. To use software, it has to be copied (which you can't legally do without permission). Copyright law is mostly irrelevant to questions of software, and what really controls what you can and cannot do is the license agreement. Because of copyright law, you can't say \"But this was an unlicensed usage so I'm not bound by those terms\", so copyright law provides the Scylla and the license provides the Charybdis.\n\n[17 USC 117](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/117) says:\n\n> it is not an infringement for the owner of a copy of a computer\n>  program to make or authorize the making of another copy or adaptation\n>  of that computer program provided:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) that *such a new copy or adaptation is created as an essential step\n>  in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a\n>  machine and that it is used in no other manner*\n\nInstalling (copying) sure enough is an essential step in utilization. This slice of code suggests that you can use the software, given copyright law. But that would be so only if you are the *owner* of a copy of the program, and one often does not buy a copy of the program, one buys a license, if you are to believe what the license says.\n\nIn [Vernor v. Autodesk](http://www.citizen.org/documents/Vernor_Autodesk_Ninth_Circuit_Opinion.pdf), the court held that customers are \"licensees of their copies of the software rather than owners\" (so Vernor did not buy his copy from an owner). One reason why Autodesk ultimately prevailed is that they asserted in the license that they retain title (they lost in the lower court, [Vernor v. Autodesk, 555 F. Supp. 2d 1164](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1457201/vernor-v-autodesk-inc/)). Similarly, the Office 2007 license says \"The software is licensed, not sold\", thus closing any arguments that you can do things not permitted by the license. The point being, if you don't own the software, you can't execute it in public, unless the license allows it.\n\nIf you do own the software, then we can turn to questions of what copyright law might allow. In order to prevent you from publicly running software, the act would have to be something prohibited by copyright law \\-\\- like making a copy. the degree of copying involved in installing / executing software would be allowed by section 107, and there is no statutory restriction on public \"use\" except that which is limited to literary, musical etc. works. At present, software is not considered to be a \"literary work\" or similar, therefore there is no statutory basis for prohibiting the public execution of a piece of software.

According to the information provided, copyright law does not specifically address the public execution of software. The rights of public performance and public display in Section 106 were not designed with software in mind and don't directly apply to software execution. The definitions of \"perform\" and \"display\" in copyright law don't encompass running software. Additionally, these rights are tied to specific types of works (like literary or audiovisual works) that don't typically include software.\n\nTherefore, to restrict public use of their software, the company would need to rely on the terms of their license agreements rather than copyright law itself. License agreements can specify how and where the software can be used, and courts have upheld the validity of software licenses (as in Vernor v. Autodesk).\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because the public performance and public display rights don't apply to software execution.

Again, I think most courts would ignore such a clause and instead apply the local consumer laws for the same reasons as in the previous example.\n\nA third example could be parents and their minor children. I have some difficulties coming up with a good example but say that a grandparent willed a large amount of money to a minor grand child and that in the current jurisdiction A, the parent's aren't allowed to access this money. The parents therefore decide to move to another country B that allows them free access to their children's money (and waste it while the child still is a minor).\n\nFinally the child returns to A and seeks compensation. I reckon a court in A would apply A's laws to the situation and conclude that the move to B benefited the parents in an extremely one\\-sided and unfair way since the child had no means to object to the decision to move, and as a consequnce was robbed on her/his money.\n\nIf the situation had been a married couple (or soon\\-to\\-be married couple) where one party X had a lot of money that the other party Y had no access to in A but free access to in B and the couple voluntarily and consensually moved from A to B, I doubt that X could seek compensation from Y for spending the money because they are both adults with full legal rights and responsibilities and if they decide to marry and live in B rather than A, X can't afterwards return to A and demand that the courts in A should overrule the laws in B.\n\nThe third example(s) is quite artificial so no need to nitpick on details...\n\nBut back to the question. If I generalize the examples above there is one strong party and one weak party. The strong party, more or less, forces the weak party to enter an agreement that heavily benefits the strong party. Such a contract would in many cases not be upheld by a court because it is considered unfair. Is this \"principle\" called something?\n\nI am interested in answers that go all the way back to the Roman legal system and up to current \"Western\" legal systems.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You're thinking of \"unconscionability.\"\n\nIn the United States, the general rule is that a contract provision will not be deemed unenforceable for unconscionability unless it is both procedurally and substantively unfair.\n\nA provision is considered procedurally unfair if it results from some sort of unfair asymmetry in bargaining positions. This could include situations where a party was acting under duress, had a diminished mental capacity, or unequal experience in the .\n\nA provision may be considered substantively unfair if it imposes disproportinately unfavorable terms on one party, perhaps by imposing costs far out of line with market prices, or by allocating all risk to that party.\n\nIf the agreement is not both procedurally and substantively unconscionable, it won't be voided. So the Google TOS may be procedurally unfair because Google's market position gives it disproportionate bargaining power, but because they don't really impose any serious costs on you, they aren't unconscionable.

This legal principle is used to void contract provisions that are deemed excessively unfair to one party, typically involving a significant imbalance in bargaining power between the parties.\n\nUnconscionability generally requires both procedural and substantive unfairness:\n\n- Procedural unfairness relates to the process of forming the contract, such as unequal bargaining power or lack of meaningful choice.\n- Substantive unfairness refers to the actual terms of the contract being unreasonably favorable to the stronger party.\n\nB) Unilateral mistake is incorrect. This refers to a situation where only one party is mistaken about a material fact of the contract, which is different from unconscionability.\n\nC) Duress is incorrect. While duress can be a factor in procedural unconscionability, it is a separate legal concept referring to threats or coercion used to force someone into a contract.\n\nD) Consideration is incorrect. This refers to something of value exchanged between parties in a contract, which is unrelated to the concept of unconscionability."}, "43": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/53631/should-i-worry-about-code-plagiarism-if-its-my-code", "docs_id": 53631, "title": "Should I worry about code plagiarism if it&#39;s my code?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I wrote a code by myself, which I know is my code because I myself have thought about the logic and code while developing it.\n\nBut if the same logic and code was thought by somebody else and is used by somebody else, what am I supposed to do if a plagiarism check happens?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If it's patented then it doesn't matter that you independently came up with it.

It says:\n\n> Overview: What Is a K\\-1 Visa?\n> \n> \n> The fianc\u00e9(e) K\\-1 nonimmigrant visa is for the foreign\\-citizen fianc\u00e9(e) of a United States (U.S.) citizen. The K\\-1 visa permits the foreign\\-citizen fianc\u00e9(e) to travel to the United States and marry his or her U.S. citizen sponsor within 90 days of arrival. The foreign\\-citizen will then apply for adjustment of status to a permanent resident (LPR) with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Because a fianc\u00e9(e) visa permits the holder to immigrate to the U.S. and marry a U.S. citizen shortly after arrival in the United States, the fianc\u00e9(e) must meet some of the requirements of an immigrant visa. Eligible children of K\\-1 visa applicants receive K\\-2 visas.\n\nLater, it says:\n\n> Does My U.S. Citizen Fianc\u00e9(e) Need to File Separate Petitions for My Children?\n> \n> \n> No. Your eligible children may apply for K\\-2 visas based on the approval of Form I\\-129F, Petition for Alien Fianc\u00e9(e), that your U.S. citizen fianc\u00e9(e) filed on your behalf, but your U.S. citizen fianc\u00e9(e) must list the children on the petition.

I *assume* this will follow the same rules as photography, but would like to confirm that is indeed the case.\n\nAdditionally, \"commercial use\" seems to be subjective.

There is no such right in Oregon, there is a [statutory right in Washington](https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/7/v2/27932/01-09-2013-WA-Publicity-Laws.pdf), and a common law right in Idaho. California has both. Cross\\-jurisdictional generalizations are thus highly perilous.\n\nThat said, I am aware of no jurisdiction that treats still photographs different from moving pictures. The right centers around \"identifiable characteristics\" of an individual. Under the \"incidental use\" doctrine, permission may not be required. Hence in Washington, under [RCW 63\\.60\\.070](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=63.60.070), consent is not required if the use \"is an insignificant, de minimis, or incidental use\".\n\nUnder Washington's scheme, the conversation about your example ends before it starts because the right of publicity doe not exist for corporations, see [RCW 63\\.60\\.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.010), [63\\.60\\.010](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.040) (individuals and personalities, not corporations). \"Commercial use\" is irrelevant, see [\u00a750](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=63.60.050) \"An infringement may occur under this section without regard to whether the use or activity is for profit or not for profit\". [\u00a770](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=63.60.070) states exceptions, which include things that are conceptually similar to \"fair use\" (in particular, \"comment\"). The legislature did not draw a bright line, leaving that to the courts.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this situation?\n\nA) This is clearly illegal as it constitutes commercial use without consent.\nB) This is definitely legal as corporations have no right of publicity.\nC) This may be legal under the \"incidental use\" doctrine, but would require careful legal analysis.\nD) This is always legal as long as the company posting the video didn't film it themselves.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The situation described is complex and falls into a gray area of publicity rights law. While California does have strong right of publicity laws, there are several factors to consider:\n\n1. The \"incidental use\" doctrine may apply, which could make the use permissible without explicit consent.\n2. The use appears to be more congratulatory than overtly commercial, which could affect how it's viewed legally.\n3. California law recognizes both common law and statutory right of publicity, making the analysis more complex.\n4.

Publicly disclosed inventions, even if protected by copyright, are part of the \"prior art\" and can't be protected by patents.\n\nSecond, you have to disclose the material ideas in an invention in order to patent it, in your patent application. The bargain of a patent is that you get protection for about two decades in exchange for contributing your idea to the public domain when it expires.\n\nThird, usually people protect software with copyright rather than patent, although there are pros and cons to each approach.\n\nFourth, if someone knows enough about your invention to subpoena the place where you store it, you have probably disclosed too much information pre\\-application to patent it.\n\nFifth, usually the \"real\" target of a subpoena gets notice of it and an opportunity to defend against the subpoena (e.g. for improperly disclosing a trade secret) before it is carried out, but the same does not apply, for example, to National Security Letters under the Patriot Act (which are supposed to be used only in national security investigations or counter\\-terrrorism operations, but might be abused). Certainly, an ordinary person can't issue a National Security Letter for private commercial gain without corrupt government assistance.\n\nSixth, to issue a subpoena, there must be some pending case to which someone can claim the subpoena is relevant. A random person can't just subpoena information because they want to.\n\nSeventh, even if a server host isn't based in the United States, that doesn't mean that there isn't some means by which a court might assert subpoena power over information on server host. There are many legal \"hooks\" that could apply.\n\nEighth, defending an isolated subpoena isn't terribly expensive. Typically, you'd be looking at a legal fee in the $1000 to $5,000 (U.S.) range, which is much, much less than the dollar cost of patenting an invention in any country.\n\nIn short, while there are pros and cons of using a U.S. based server host, people in the IT industry routinely attach far too much importance to this fact which is only very rarely an important one legally.

The location of data storage isn't the primary factor in determining legal jurisdiction or discovery rights.\n\nOption A is incorrect because storing code on GitHub doesn't automatically void patent rights or put the invention in the public domain.

The court explores various *scienter* requirements, and concludes that there is a mens rea component to the crime (this is not a strict liability crime). The basis for the appeal is that defendant wanted an jury instruction read saying that \"the government must prove that he intended to communicate a true threat\", and what the jury was told was that\n\n> A statement is a true threat when a defendant intentionally makes a\n> statement in a context or under such circumstances wherein a\n> reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be\n> interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a\n> serious expression of an intention to inflict bodily injury or take\n> the life of an individual\n\nThe court rejected importation of the negligence\\-law \"reasonable person\" standard, when the question for criminal law should be \"awareness\". The standard for conviction is that \"wrongdoing must be conscious to be\ncriminal\".\n\nAs for investigations, law enforcement can investigate the *possibility* that a literal threat corresponds to an awareness in the utterer's mind that this is a real threat.

A EULA isn't a law. If we assume that the EULA is part of a contract, then you may not be understanding part of a contract, but that has nothing to do with not understanding the law. \n\nIf you are a consumer, there are plenty of laws in most countries that protect you from your own stupidity when entering a contract to some degree. So \"punishing\" you for doing something against the EULA will be difficult. It is a civil contract, things might go to a civil court. But terms that you cannot understand may very well be interpreted in your favour. If the court decides that someone created a 50 page EULA to trick you into violating it, there's a good chance it will be thrown out altogether. \n\nIf there are terms that only a lawyer can understand and not a normal consumer, they will likely be thrown out. If there are terms hidden in a 50 page EULA that nobody is every going to read, they will likely be thrown it. However, that's because you couldn't be expected to understand things. If the company in question explains relevant parts of the EULA to you, then after getting the explanation you'd be unlikely to be protected by your ignorance. \n\nAnd as a last measure: For software the situation is usually that you are asked to accept a EULA in order to be allowed to install and use the software. You can always claim that you didn't accept the EULA (and nobody can prove otherwise) and be guilty of copyright infringement, so that is the absolutely worst that can happen to you. \n\nIf you are a company, things are different.

Consumer protection laws in many jurisdictions offer some safeguards against unreasonable or incomprehensible terms in EULAs, especially for consumers like teenagers.

Are\n> there examples of such behavior?\n\nIn the United States, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy is frequently used as a way to cancel equity investments and to reduce or eliminate long term bond debt (especially subordinated bond investments) by senior management, in an effort to keep the business operating as a going concern and keep their elite senior executive jobs, and the jobs of many subordinate employees and contractors of the business.\n\nPretty much every single business bankruptcy reduces the amount of return that investors in the company can receive from it (although there are rare cases when investors can be compensated in full in an orderly disposition of a company's assets but bankruptcy is filed to prevent a fire sale of assets in a disorderly fashion that would hurt investors, or hurt them more than the alternative outcome).\n\nA key factor here is the segregation of ownership and management in most big businesses. A large equity owner in a company is in a poor position to defraud other equity owners in bankruptcy, however, and equity owners are behind debt investors in priority in bankruptcy, so it is also hard for the equity owner to use bankruptcy to defraud debt investors without hurting the large equity owner.\n\nIn some ways, this is a variant on a [leveraged buy\\-out by management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leveragedbuyout.asp), because usually, in a big business bankruptcy, a key step is for management to secure a third\\-party lender to the bankruptcy debtor (G.E. Capital was the dominant lender in this market for many years), to finance the continued operations of the business until a plan could be put in the place to reorganize the company with less debt and none of its old equity investors.\n\nThis is almost never a strategy of the company at the outset. It is one that is chosen once it becomes clear that its business model has ceased to be viable with the amount of leverage that the business has. Often, in such a plan, some long term debt that is not subordinated is converted to equity, although that equity is usually worth less than the original equity investment of the investors in the firm.\n\nTypically, this strategy is used when a company with a large initial capital investment is in a market where it can still make a profit relative to its variable operating costs from the revenues it can secure in current market conditions, but can no longer afford to service its long term debt that was used to make that large initial capital investment (e.g. in a building or factory) that has decreased in value because the products made with that investment are no longer as valuable as they used to be, or because, for example, patents expired but the long term debt wasn't paid off during the terms of the patents.\n\nFor example, many U.S. coal mining companies in the U.S. have recently had Chapter 11 bankruptcies. These companies made large investments in coal mining operations that were economically sensible when coal was worth more and alternatives to coal were not economically viable. But, when renewable energy became cheaper with changes in technology, and environmental requirements made coal fired power plants more expensive, the market price for coal collapsed and those companies could no longer support the debt that made it possible to conduct the mining operations that these companies had incurred. In a reorganized fashion, some of these companies could continue to be viable with lower sales volume and lower coal prices since they now only had to pay current operating costs and not obligations to investors in those companies.\n\n> What are the mechanisms in place in US law to prevent people from\n> creating a company to attract investors with the intent of filing for\n> bankruptcy as a strategy to not repay their debt?\n\nThis strategy doesn't really make sense as a plan from the issuing company's point of view, it only makes sense if the person promoting the scheme has some way to extract value from the investment made by the investors.\n\nThe company itself that issued the securities (typically stock or corporate bonds) in which the investor invested also isn't a suitable target of litigation because the company that issued the securities simply doesn't have the assets to pay damages to the investors.\n\nIf one can show that the company incurred debt with an intent not to repay it, and is followed by transfers out of the company without receiving substantially equivalent value in exchange to some third party behind the scheme, this can be regulated by [fraudulent transfer laws](https://www.uniformlaws.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=992ea8e4-9d59-a6f9-acf2-210781e76a14&forceDialog=0). *See* Section 4(a)(2\\) in the Uniform Act numbering although individual states adopting the act as state law invariably number the sections differently).\n\nThis conduct can also be used to seek securities fraud liability or common law fraud liability from the persons other than the company itself (such as its officers or brokers or promoters of some other kind) involved in promoting the company.\n\n**Footnote Re Importance Of A Formal Bankruptcy**\n\nThe bankruptcy code component of this analysis isn't a particularly important part of the strategy.\n\nA limited liability entity can dissolve itself, or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors of all of its assets, or be placed in a receivership, outside of bankruptcy, with similar effect, since the discharge of debts is not relief associated with a Chapter 7 liquidation of a limited liability entity (although debts can be reduced or eliminated as part of a Chapter 11 plan so long as the creditors are at least as well off as they would be in a Chapter 7 liquidation or otherwise consent to the plan).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A large manufacturing company, FabriCorp, has been struggling with declining sales due to cheaper alternatives in the market. The CEO and senior management team are considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Which of the following statements most accurately describes a potential outcome of this strategy?\n\nA) The CEO and senior management will likely be forced to resign immediately upon filing for bankruptcy.\n\nB) FabriCorp will be required to liquidate all assets and cease operations entirely.\n\nC) Equity investors may lose their investments, while the company continues to operate with reduced debt.\n\nD) Debt investors will be prioritized over all other creditors and will receive full repayment.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate description of a potential outcome in this scenario. As explained in the provided information, Chapter 11 bankruptcy is often used by companies to continue operating while restructuring their debt and equity obligations. In this process, equity investments are frequently cancelled or significantly reduced in value, and long-term debt (especially subordinated debt) may be reduced or eliminated. This allows the company to continue operating as a going concern, often with the existing management team still in place. The goal is to emerge from bankruptcy with a more sustainable financial structure, even though this typically results in losses for existing investors, particularly equity holders. Options A and B describe more extreme outcomes that are not typical of Chapter 11 bankruptcies, while option D incorrectly suggests that debt investors would be fully repaid, which is often not the case in such restructurings."}}
