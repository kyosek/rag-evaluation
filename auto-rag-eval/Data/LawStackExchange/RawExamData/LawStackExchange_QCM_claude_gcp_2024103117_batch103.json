[Roe v. Wade](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113) asserts a right to privacy, discussed in \u00a7VIII. Granting that there is no explicit enumeration of a right to privacy in the Constitution, its implicit presence is discerned via a long series of constitutional rulings of a diverse nature. It is not clear what is the extent of\n\n> This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth\n>  Amendment's concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state\n>  action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the\n>  Ninth Amendment's reservation of rights to the people...\n\nHowever, even in the case of explicitly recognized rights, they are not absolute: you cannot commit fraud or threaten a person with death and escape punishment by citing the 1st Amendment, you cannot own a machine gun and cite the 2nd in your defense. Fundamental rights are strongly protected, but they may be limited in a fashion that survives [strict scrutiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny). This means that the encroachment is necessary to a \"compelling state interest\", it is \"narrowly tailored\" towards that end, and is the \"least restrictive means\" to achieve that end.\n\nThe question arose in [Jacobson v. Massachusetts](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/197/11), 197 U. S. 11 where Jacobson was criminally arraigned for refusing to comply with a mandatory vaccination law (applicable to all persons over 21\\). The court noted that\n\n> the liberty secured by the Constitution of the United States to every\n>  person within its jurisdiction does not import an absolute right in\n>  each person to be, at all times and in all circumstances, wholly freed\n>  from restraint. There are manifold restraints to which every person is\n>  necessarily subject for the common good.\n> \n> \n> The liberty secured by the 14th Amendment, this court has said,\n>  consists, in part, in the right of a person 'to live and work where he\n>  will'...; and yet he may be compelled, by force if need be, against\n>  his will and without regard to his personal wishes or his pecuniary\n>  interests, or even his religious or political convictions, to take his\n>  place in the ranks of the army of his country, and risk the chance of\n>  being shot down in its defense...\n> \n> \n> According to settled principles, the police power of a state must be\n>  held to embrace, at least, such reasonable regulations established\n>  directly by legislative enactment as will protect the public health\n>  and the public safety.\n\nThe right to compel vaccination is reaffirmed in [Zucht v. King](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/260/174), 260 U.S. 174\\. \n\nThere is currently no mandatory vaccination law applicable to adults; were such a law to be created (analogous to the earlier Mass. law regarding smallpox vaccination), it could easily pass judicial review as long as it is \"minimalist\". The question of \"compelling government interest\" would distinguish between mandatory Ebola or zombie\\-fever vaccinations vs. shingles or (ordinary) flu.

Massachusetts and Zucht v. King regarding mandatory vaccination laws, which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The right to privacy under the Bill of Rights provides absolute protection against any form of mandatory medical treatment, including vaccinations.\n\nB) Mandatory vaccination laws are always constitutional as long as they apply to all adults over 21 years of age.\n\nC) A mandatory vaccination law for adults could potentially be constitutional if it passes strict scrutiny by being narrowly tailored, serving a compelling state interest, and using the least restrictive means.\n\nD) The Supreme Court has ruled that mandatory vaccination laws are unconstitutional for adults but can be applied to children for school attendance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The cases of Jacobson v. Massachusetts and Zucht v. King established that mandatory vaccination laws can be constitutional, but they are subject to certain limitations. While the right to privacy and personal liberty is recognized, it is not absolute and can be limited for the common good, particularly in matters of public health. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the right to privacy is not absolute and can be limited under certain circumstances, as demonstrated by these cases.\n\nAnswer B is overly broad. While Jacobson v. Massachusetts upheld a mandatory vaccination law for adults over 21, this doesn't mean all such laws are automatically constitutional. They would still need to meet the criteria of strict scrutiny.\n\nAnswer C is correct because it accurately reflects the current legal understanding. A mandatory vaccination law for adults could potentially be constitutional, but it would need to serve a compelling state interest (such as preventing a serious epidemic), be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, and use the least restrictive means possible.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it misrepresents the Supreme Court's rulings. The Court has not ruled that mandatory vaccination laws are unconstitutional for adults. In fact, Jacobson v.

(I said might, I did not say is: let's first determine if POTUS *is* one). That section also says\n\n> For the purpose of this section\u2014 (1\\) the term \u201cpublic official\u201d means\n> Member of Congress, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner, either before\n> or after such official has qualified, or an officer or employee or\n> person acting for or on behalf of the United States, or any\n> department, agency or branch of Government thereof, including the\n> District of Columbia, in any official function, under or by authority\n> of any such department, agency, or branch of Government, or a juror;\n> (2\\) the term \u201cperson who has been selected to be a public official\u201d\n> means any person who has been nominated or appointed to be a public\n> official, or has been officially informed that such person will be so\n> nominated or appointed\n\nPOTUS is not a Member or Congress, etc: is POTUS \"an officer or employee or\nperson acting for or on behalf of the United States, or any\ndepartment, agency or branch of Government thereof\". Is POTUS \"an officer\", or \"an employee\"? [18 USC 202](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/202) gives a terminological flow chart for specific sections of 18 USC Ch. 11, stating that\n\n> Except as otherwise provided in such sections, the terms \u201cofficer\u201d and\n> \u201cemployee\u201d in sections 203, 205, 207 through 209, and 218 of this\n> title shall not include the President...\n\n\u00a7201 is not included in this list of exclusions; but it is also not explicitly included: the law simply does not say.\n\nThe problem is that this chapter treats POTUS in three ways. For some sections, he is explicitly not an officer or employee; for one section he is explicitly a covered government person; and for \u00a7201, the law does not do not say. Regarding the second term \"covered government employee\", [18 USC 227](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/227) uses a different term that does include POTUS:\n\n> In this section, the term \u201ccovered government person\u201d means\u2014 (1\\) a\n> Senator or Representative in, or a Delegate or Resident Commissioner\n> to, the Congress; (2\\) an employee of either House of Congress; or (3\\)\n> **the President**, Vice President, an employee of the United States Postal\n> Service or the Postal Regulatory Commission, or any other executive\n> branch employee (as such term is defined under section [2105 of title\n> 5](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/5/2105), United States Code).\n\nThat law, btw, says\n\n> (a) Whoever, being a covered government person, with the intent to\n> influence, solely on the basis of partisan political affiliation, an\n> employment decision or employment practice of any private entity\u2014 (1\\)\n> takes or withholds, or offers or threatens to take or withhold, an\n> official act, or (2\\) influences, or offers or threatens to influence,\n> the official act of another, shall be fined under this title or\n> imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both, and may be\n> disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under\n> the United States.\n\nThis law applies to POTUS, not Kodak Black. And the scope of the law is limited to influencing employment decisions of a private entity \u2013 so this law is not applicable.\n\nWhat SCOTUS would have to rule on is how to interpret the *lack* of definition w.r.t. \u00a7201\\.

As indicated in the subsection on the DoJ's interpretation of the law, it's not a difficult stretch to conclude that POTUS is capable of being bribed, but that's not really the final word on the matter, since that conclusion is influenced by the fact that bribery is constitutionally enumerated as a high crime triggering impeachment.

The federal crime of bribery (18 USC 201) does not explicitly state whether the President of the United States (POTUS) is considered an \"officer\" or \"employee\" for the purposes of this specific statute. While other sections of the U.S. Code (like 18 USC 202) exclude POTUS from certain definitions of \"officer\" and \"employee,\" and others (like 18 USC 227) explicitly include POTUS as a \"covered government person,\" 18 USC 201 is silent on the matter.

In that case, would you be eligible for Portuguese citizenship without the residency requirements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [current law](https://dre.pt/application/conteudo/69889521) does suggest so. The law does not actually contrast \"nationality\" and \"citizenship\" as the translation suggests: it says that the grandparent \"n\u00e3o tenha perdido essa nacionalidade\" (has not his his/her nationality). The part that would remain to be determined is whether both grandparents lost their Portuguese nationality somehow. The most likely reason for that would be renouncing Portuguese citizenship, for example to take US citizenship. That matter could probably be resolved by researching the law of Portugal and the US at the time the grandparents became US citizens (if they did). Both countries currently allow dual citizenship and as far as I know the US has never *required* a person to formally renounce their other citizenship to be naturalized. The verbiage in the current US naturalization oath that resembles a renunciation of citizenship:\n\n> I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and\n>  abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate,\n>  state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a\n>  subject or citizen...\n\nmight suffice.

(\"Those who,\n>  being nationals of another state, declare that they do not want to be\n>  Portuguese lose Portuguese nationality\")\n\nSome other countries make it much more difficult to renounce citizenship. One would need a Portuguese con\\-law attorney to know whether this legally means that you must *first* become a national of another state, *and then* declare that you don't want to be Portugese (or, can the renunciation precede the moment of naturalization?).

The current Portuguese law allows grandchildren of Portuguese nationals to acquire citizenship, but only if the grandparent \"has not lost his/her nationality.\" The key factor is whether the U.S. naturalization process in 1960 required Jo\u00e3o's grandparents to formally renounce their Portuguese citizenship, and whether Portuguese law at that time considered such a declaration as a loss of nationality. This would require research into both U.S. and Portuguese laws from 1960.

Signing something means you accept it and it becomes legally binding. However if signatures are to have more than a symbolic meaning, they must be verifiable. Otherwise I can always claim that I didn't really sign that document when it becomes convenient for me.\n\nBut how can this be done with any degree of confidence? It feels to me like signatures could be faked too easily, and the process for verifying them is more art than science (as far as I understand it, it just involves a supposed \"expert\" looking at them and judging how \"similar\" it is to some other example).\n\nSo, why are they used *everywhere*?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DR: You have to do something to accept a document; a signature is often used because it is simple and permanent; signature alone is often not enough (e.g. wills); claiming a false signature annuls the contract for both parties and you cannot keep the accrued benefits.\n\n> Signing something means you accept it and it becomes legally binding.\n\nMany things can become binding without signature (including your usage of this website) and signatures alone are not considered trustworthy in many circumstances.\n\nImportant documents (e.g. wills, marriages, real estate transactions) in many jurisdictions require a public official (notaries, marriage commissioners etc.) or a trustworthy person (lawyers, doctors, professional engineers, etc.), who will often require rigourous identification documents, and/or witnesses to be involved for the documents to be legally effective.\n\nSome high\\-value commercial transactions will also involve witnesses for signature, or require witnesses for executions of certain articles.\n\n> Otherwise I can always claim that I didn't really sign that document when it becomes convenient for me.\n\nYou can and people do. Then the parties go to court or other dispute resolution mechanism, and the judge will consider all relevant evidences to decide (often on a balance of probabilities, i.e. more likely than not) if you consented to a document. Particularly, \"when it becomes convenient for me\" is often after some elements of the contract having been executed, which is evidence in favour of the existence of the contract **and nonexistence of a contract removes obligations and rights for both supposed parties, as such the executed part could be undone**. If for a sales contract the other party has sent you a computer, you cannot claim that you did not sign that contract *and* keep the computer they sent. Without the contract, the computer is not rightfully yours.\n\nAlso, claiming false statements for benefit or under oath is fraud/perjury and can be criminally prosecuted.\n\n> So, why are they used everywhere?\n\nYou have to do *something* to affirm your consent to a document.\nIt is symbolic but symbolic does not mean meaningless and a symbol of your consent is often desirable.\n\nA signature is simple *and*:\n\n* affirmative of your intention, unlike a simple visual inspection of document (perhaps eventually someone will argue your eye movement can be used, e.g. for VR)\n* permanent, unlike oral declarations (which can still be legally valid, even if hard to prove)1\n\nwhich is enough for most purposes. As a bonus, it is also *somewhat* unique and can be compared *to certain extent*.\n\nFor purposes demanding higher level of confidence, ID documents can be demanded and more complex procedures (e.g. with notaries and witnesses) can be undertaken.\n\n---\n\n1.

While signatures are widely used to indicate consent and can have legal significance, they are not infallible or universally binding. The documentation notes that for important documents like wills or high-value transactions, additional measures such as witnesses or notarization may be required. It also mentions that signature alone is often not considered trustworthy enough for certain circumstances.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it overstates the power of signatures. Not all signed documents become legally binding, and there are exceptions and additional requirements for certain types of agreements.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because it understates the importance of signatures.

And what happens to weaker cases, do they result in an acquittal or do they generally not get cleared at all?\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction_rate>\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Japan's justice system is sometimes called [hostage justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage_justice)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn general, the Japanese justice system has a more than 99% conviction rate! In part, this is because the number of state attorneys is super low \\- on about half the population of the US, there were only 2000 State attorneys out of 35000 lawyers in Japan, whereas the USA has a five\\-to\\-six digit number of state/district/... attorneys and 1\\.5 million lawyers in total. Or in other words: each state\\-employed attorney is responsible for more than 10 times the people and the caseload they create, and lawyers are prohibitively expensive.\n\nThis leads to a [two\\-pronged result](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/82077/10334): on the one hand, only the best cases should be followed up on and brought to court. Depending on the statistics, **about every other case (\\~50%) that the police investigators hand to the prosecution is not followed up on by the prosecution**. The other result is, that **the Japanese justice system relies heavily on confessions** obtained from the defendants.\n\nAs I elaborated when comparing the [detention time without charges](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/84030/10334), the Japanese justice system is unlike almost any other modern justice system in the world in some regards, even though it is a civil law system and most of the same principles can be found. The Japanese prosecution can detain people for up to 23 days without bringing the case, you can't have your lawyer present when talking to the police, and by clever tactic, the prosecution can hold a person nigh\\-indefinitely without even filing a case. As a result, the prosecution can often get confessions, and with a confession, the actual court case can become super fast: charges are brought, the confession is read, a little extra evidence is presented, and to *spare the victim a lengthy trial* with the confession in the room, the judge comes down with a guilty verdict.\n\nThis is compounded by how the rules of evidence are laid out: investigation and the court case are allowed to happen at the same time! As a result, the case of the prosecutor tends to become *better* the longer the case drags on, resulting in the defendant either settling or giving a (partial) confession to some of the charges just to get it over because lawyers are crazy expensive. By giving a confession, they *throw themselves at the mercy of the court* for a mild verdict.\n\n### And it's very much stacked\n\nAs shown above, the Japanese justice system is already stacked against the defendant. But it is even more stacked than what is shown up there.\nAs [ohwilke](https://law.stackexchange.com/users/9517/ohwilleke) noted in excellent comments, I want to preserve them here:\n\n> Also the vast majority of Japanese criminal cases are tried without lay judges,\n\nThis is by the way a result of the Japanese legal system that was set up in the Meiji era being based on the Prussian branch of the [german](/questions/tagged/german \"show questions tagged 'german'\") Civil Law school. That was one of the dominant systems of the Meiji era next to the French and Spanish schools of Civil Legal Systems \\- and after WW2 they did not swap to a Common Law system but stayed with their own take on this Prusso\\-German branch of the Civil Legal System. This means there are no juries like in the common law system, and since 2009 [lay judges in japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lay_judges_in_Japan) are increasingly used, but not in every case. Those lay judges are very much akin to the Sch\u00f6ffen in Germany, being allowed to question the evidence and such \\- the German school is based on an inquisitorial system after all \\- but it is not used in every case. And the whole system is lived *extremely* differently from the inspiring Prussian system, such as this part of the comment shows:\n\n> and from my experiences talking with several Japanese judges at length about the issue (back in the early 1990s, maybe it is different now), the institutional mindset is for judges to believe that all of the prosecution evidence is true and all of the defense evidence is lies unless the evidence to the contrary is overwhelming and unshakable. The level of judicial bias towards the prosecution is greater than in any other common law or civil law legal system, that is not in an authoritarian regime, in the world.\n\nThis for example shows in the 23 days without charge. Technically, 23 days is not the initial time, but the police has 72 hours. But they can extend this time by 10 days with a judge's order, and then again by another 10 days on the same charge offered on the paperwork. According to a statistic, 99\\.8% of these requests are granted, meaning they are almost rubberstamped. Legally, people that are detained are not yet defendants, they are *suspects* and kept in [*Substitute Prisons*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiy%C5%8D_kangoku) which are located in police districts \\- which further helps to get confessions.\n\nAnd this plays directly into another factor that differentiates the Japanese system from other countries: There's a huge cultural factor, which is what makes the Japanese system so different from others.\n\n> Additional factors are that police officers in Japan have much more authority to handle minor cases outside the court system and routinely do so, that a certain level of criminal conduct from organized crime and by authority figures is tolerated, that there is much less crime per capita in Japan than most places, and that Confucian values re deference to hierarchy and the Japanese specific high cultural obligation to apologize influences how Japanese people interact with the criminal justice system as defendants and as implementers of that system.\n\nThis has its problems too: Because the prosecution is notoriously overworked, citizens with problems are often more reluctant to bring cases to their attention. Further, the shame culture works against not just the perpetrators, but also the victims and the people that report certain crimes \\- for example, [a female police officer was groped on a train, and when she reported it, **she** became the target of shunning.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dajKNczCPRs)\n\n### Further reading \\& Research papers\n\n* US Department of Justice: [Toward a Balancing Approach: The Use of Apology in Japanese Society](https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/toward-balancing-approach-use-apology-japanese-society).\n* US Department of Justice: [Confession, Apology, Repentance and Settlement Out\\-of\\-Court in the Japanese Criminal Justice System \\-\\- is Japan a Model of Restortative Justice?

As a minor, the courts *could* allow your parents to change from Dweezil to William without involving you, until you are old enough that the judge thinks you might be able to have reasonable input into the matter. Once you're over 18, your parents can't change your name \u2013 you would have to do that, at least if you are mentally competent.\n\nIn Washington, the courts juggle the wishes of the child, the wishes of the parents, how long the child has had the name, and the social advantages or disadvantages of the name change, and permission from the minor is required if over 14 (child input would be solicited for a child over 7\\). Since this involves a court order, in principle this information is available to the child.

Also bear in mind that the initial filing of a birth certificate may well not have a child's name, which may not be supplied until the parents make up their minds.\n\nChanges to the birth certificate are knowable (they don't erase anything), but can only be revealed to the subject of the record, or in case of court order.

That being said, you should have paid only the estimate in order to preempt the dentist's possible allegation that you just belatedly regretted paying that amount.\n\nYour post does not specify whether the unsigned estimate has a disclaimer akin to \"*this estimate is not binding if unsigned*\". Nor is it clear whether the estimate is based on the premise that exactly two posts are required from the surgeon.

(Some, but not all, jurisdictions, allow a law enforcement officer to directly submit a warrant request without the prosecutor's intervention.) The judge can ask that a hearing be held, but is authorized to issue a warrant on the basis of the written affidavit alone. Usually, an affidavit can be issued with the prosecutor appearing by telephone or on the basis of a written submission that is e\\-filed, rather than in person. But, local practice varies and the technology available to judges in different localities varies a great deal.\n\n> Or, do officers/prosecutors instead have a system to submit their\n>  documents into a \"pool\" that eventually gets to a judge?\n\nAbsent the most extraordinary and exigent circumstances, the documents are submitted to the clerk of the court who forwards the documents (electronically or on paper as the case may be) to the appropriate judge's personal court clerks who in turn forward it to the judge (often with a recommendation). Usually a judge has the authority to sign a warrant anywhere (on a golf course, at his home, etc.) without clerk intervention, but that would be unusual if not entirely unprecedented (e.g. it might happen a few times a year for a given judge with the right kind of docket).\n\n> How is the judge chosen? Is it random? Whoever is available to look\n>  over the case?\n\nThe default rule is random assignment, but it isn't uncommon for one or a few judges to be the on call judges to handle warrant requests at any given time. Usually, other judges have the authority to sign a warrant if the on call judges are not available but this is very uncommon.\n\n> How fast are warrants typically approved by a judge? (from the moment\n>  the request is made until it is approved)\n\nThis is entirely up to the judge (once the judge receives it). It can be as little as ten or fifteen minutes (a recent U.S. Supreme Court case discussed this), to a matter of days. If the judge is skeptical and wants in person testimony before issuing the warrant and is considering requiring a modification of the warrant, it might take several days. A judge receiving what is flagged as an \"urgent\" request, that the judge finds to be less than urgent might very well intentionally delay issuing the warrant to discourage prosecutors from crying wolf.\n\n> Are warrants given on a first\\-come\\-first\\-served basis? (e.g., an\n>  officer submits a request to have a hearing and his request is put in\n>  a queue until a judge gets to it)\n\nNot necessarily.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys don't testify or provide evidence themselves.\n\nThe judge is usually not told what evidence will be offered at trial in advance, although sometimes a pre\\-trial hearing is held to consider a particularly important piece of evidence's admissibility prior to trial, in a hearing on what is called a \"motion in limine\" or a \"motion to suppress\". If that happens, the judge's decision made in advance will be honored by the judge when anyone tries to introduce the evidence at trial.\n\nBut those are the exception and not the rule. Usually, any witnesses can be asked any questions at trial and the judge does not consider the admissibility of the answer to the question until it is asked and objected to by the other side's lawyer at trial.\n\nA defendant can choose to be, but is not required to be, a witness in his or her own case.\n\nIn a trial, when it is their turn, the prosecution and defense, respectively, ask witnesses to sit at the witness stand one by one and ask them questions, which the witness answers under oath, absent an evidence objection from the other side's attorney. While a witness is on the stand, exhibits such as documents or physical objects can also be introduced into evidence in connection with the authenticating testimony of the witness (except in cases where both sides stipulate to the admission of the documents or other non\\-testimonial evidence).\n\nAs the lawyers try to introduce evidence by asking a question to a witness on the stand, or by asking the judge for permission to introduce non\\-testimonial evidence, the other side's attorney can say, \"I object\". If that happens, the witness on the stand is not allowed to answer the question and the non\\-testimonial evidence (e.g. documents, or a knife allegedly used in a crime) is not made available to the jury until the judge rules on whether it is admissible or not in accordance with the rules of evidence.\n\nUsually, the judge rules on the evidence objection immediately in the moment, although in rare cases, the judge will let the jury have a break for a few minutes while hearing arguments from the lawyers for both sides on about the relevant evidence rules and/or researching the legal issue, before ruling on the evidence issue. Once the judge rules on the evidence issue, the trial continues immediately.\n\nIf the judge \"sustains\" the objection to the evidence, then the question doesn't get asked and/or the jury doesn't get to see the non\\-testimonial evidence. The lawyer whose question or offer to introduce evidence was successfully objected to moves on to their next question (if any) for the witness instead.\n\nIf the judge \"overrules\" the objection to the evidence, then the witness answer the question and/or the jury gets to see the non\\-testimonial evidence which is \"received\" into evidence by the judge.\n\nThis process continues continuously, for as many business days as it takes, until all witness testimony and all non\\-testimonial evidence has been presented to the court and both sides have told the court that they have presented all of their evidence. Then each side makes closing arguments to the jury, the judge reads the jury instructions of law on how to resolve the case, and the jury is sent to closed room to discuss the case and decide whether to say \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\" with respect to each charge brought by the prosecution in the trial. This decision is called a \"verdict\" and when the jury has made up its mind on all charges present to it, the jury lets the judge know that it has made up its mind, and the judge calls everyone back to the courtroom, and the jury tells the judge what they decided in open court.\n\nIf the verdict is \"not guilty\" on all criminal charges in the case, then the case is over, with no post\\-trial motions and no appeals. If the verdict is \"guilty\" the defendant is convicted, subject to post\\-trial motions to declare a mistrial and appeals by the convicted defendant.\n\nIf the convicted defendant appeals the case, and the judge abused his discretion in overruling an objection to the evidence that is made by the lawyer for the defendant (or the defendant personally if the defendant is not represented by a lawyer), because no reasonable judge could have found that the evidence was admissible under the circumstances, then the appellate court rules that the judge has made an \"error\". The appellate court will not find that the judge's ruling is an \"error\" if the judge made the correct decision for the wrong reason.\n\nIf it is reasonably possible that \"error\" possibly in combination with other errors made by the trial court judge could have caused a convicted criminal defendant to have been acquitted by the jury if the errors weren't made by the judge, then the defendant gets a new trial.\n\nThe new trial usually before the same judge with a new jury. But the new trial is before a different judge and a new jury if the judge is no longer a judge on the court for any reason, or if the judge has been so defiant of the appellate court (typically ignoring its instructions in a retrial after a first appeal) that the appellate court decides it must remove the judge from the case.\n\nA criminal defendant is only acquitted by an appellate court if the appellate court finds that it would be impossible under any circumstances for the defendant to be convicted in a new trial, possibly with different evidence presented by the prosecution.\n\n> What happens if a private citizen does the above?\n\nThis doesn't make sense. Private citizens don't rule on the admissibility of evidence in a criminal trial, and can't introduce evidence in a criminal trial except at the request of a prosecuting attorney or defendant's attorney by being called as a witness and asking the questions that the lawyers (and sometimes the judge as well) asks the witness.\n\nWitnesses are not allowed to volunteer testimony or provide documents to a jury unless asked to do so by a lawyer in the case.\n\n> What happens if someone provides evidence in court without the\n> knowledge of the judge?\n\nAs the process described above should make clear, this is basically impossible absent some extremely irregular event on the same level of irregularity as someone bribing a jury or threatening a jury with harm if he votes the wrong way.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In a criminal jury trial in the United States, how is evidence typically introduced and what role does the judge play in this process?\n\nA) The judge reviews all evidence before the trial and decides what will be admitted, with no objections allowed during the trial.\n\nB) Lawyers can freely present any evidence they choose during the trial, and the judge's role is simply to maintain order in the courtroom.\n\nC) Evidence is introduced through witness testimony and exhibits, with lawyers asking questions and the judge ruling on objections in real-time during the trial.\n\nD) Private citizens can approach the judge directly to introduce evidence they believe is relevant to the case.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In a U.S. criminal jury trial, evidence is typically introduced through witness testimony, with lawyers asking questions of witnesses on the stand. Exhibits such as documents or physical objects can also be introduced in connection with witness testimony. As evidence is presented, the opposing attorney can object, and the judge must immediately rule on these objections, either sustaining them (disallowing the evidence) or overruling them (allowing the evidence). \n\nOption A is incorrect because judges don't typically review all evidence before the trial, and objections are a crucial part of the trial process. \n\nOption B is wrong because lawyers cannot freely present any evidence; it must be admissible under the rules of evidence, and the judge plays an active role in determining admissibility. \n\nOption D is incorrect because private citizens cannot directly introduce evidence; all evidence must be presented through the proper legal channels, typically by being called as a witness by one of the attorneys in the case."}, "21": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/37078/is-it-common-to-have-both-a-criminal-case-and-a-civil-case-for-the-same-incident", "docs_id": 37078, "title": "Is it common to have both a criminal case and a civil case for the same incident?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Sometimes for the same incident there will be two seperated court cases.\n\nA famous example is the [Simpson's case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case).

So if you are the victim of a crime, and the perpetrator is capable of paying compensation, you would go for a civil case to get compensation. There's also the fact that in a civil case, there is less evidence required, so the perpetrator may win the criminal case (not found \"guilty beyond reasonable doubt\"), but lose the civil case. \n\nIn many cases, the perpetrator is not wealthy enough to make a civil case worthwhile.

Criminal cases require proof \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" while civil cases operate on a \"preponderance of evidence\" standard. This means that even if a defendant is acquitted in a criminal trial, they may still be found liable in a civil case related to the same incident.\n\nOption A is incorrect because criminal and civil cases can proceed independently, and the outcome of one does not necessarily determine the other.\n\nOption B is false because criminal cases actually require a higher burden of proof (beyond a reasonable doubt) compared to civil cases (preponderance of evidence).\n\nOption C is incorrect as it reverses the purposes of criminal and civil cases.

I never thought about it until now, but is Arcane, or Arcane magic, a copyrighted word/phrase/term?\n\nTo clarify, the spells in my work aren't direct copies of any from those other games, it's simply the usage of what I at first considered a generic word.

A word can be protected, in a certain context, by trademark. To take one example, the word \"Apple\" is protected in the domain of computer products, because Apple computers has registered \"Apple\" as their trademark, and you can't then start selling a line of computers named \"Apple\". You can however sell fruits called \"apples\", or you could sell knives with that name (unless someone has registered \"apple\" as a brand of knife). There are currently 45 [\"classes\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_(Nice)_Classification_of_Goods_and_Services) for trademark protection.\n\n\"Arcane\" is a normal word of everyday language (YMMV), which means that there is relatively little protection for the word, as contrasted with \"Microsoft\", a word created by that company. It is unlikely that the courts would recognize \"Arcane\" as being distinctive. You can search the trademark database [here](http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=searchss&state=4806:rml4r1.1.1): there is nothing for \"arcane magic\", and little for \"arcane\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author is writing a fantasy novel and wants to use the term \"Arcane magic\" to describe a type of magic in their fictional world.

The US Patent and Trademark Office database shows no trademark for \"arcane magic\".

The film studio is primarily seeking the right to create a derivative work based on the article's specific presentation of the story. While the factual events themselves are not copyrightable (anyone can make a film about true events), the article's particular organization, phrasing, and presentation of those facts are protected by copyright.

Can it not be called original (even if it is), if it's not a work (fixed)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") copyright law, anything that is of one of the broad general categories that can be protected by copyright is said to be a \"work\" whether or not it has been \"fixed in a tangible form\". If a person sings a song, never having written it down or recorded it, the song is a \"work\" but has not been fixed, and is therefore not protected by copyright. The same would apply to a speech or a poem that has been recited but never written down or recorded, or a dance performed but never notated or recorded. They are all works, but none have (yet) been fixed, and so there is no copyright protection.\n\nAll this will also be true in any country that adheres to the Berne Copyright convention, although the word \"work\" might be translated into another language.\n\nIf someone later writes the work down, or records it, then it will have been \"fixed\", and copyright protection will be available provided the other conditions are met.\n\nWhether a work is original is a separate issue from whether a work has been fixed. If person A makes up a song and sings it without recording it, it is original but not fixed. If person B hears it and writes it down, it is now fixed, but not original to B. A will then have the copyright.\n\nIn copyright law \"originality\" usually means that a work is the separate creation of a person, not copied from the work of some other person. Note that a work may quote or imitate previous works, or use portions of them in some way, and still be sufficiently original for copyright protection.\n\nHowever the term \"original\" is sometimes used to mean \"creative\". A mere list of numbers in numerical order is not creative, and will not be protected by copyright (in the US and countries with similar laws). A list of all the names of people in a given town or area, in alphabetical order, is not creative enough to be protected by copyright (see *Feist vs Rural*). Courts and other writers on copyright sometimes express this by saying the work is not \"original\". Similarly, a simple geometric design, such as a white square on a black background, is not creative enough for protection, and again this is sometimes expressed by saying that it is not original.\n\nA work must be both original and creative to be protected by copyright, although it need not be **very** creative nor **totally** original. The rules on originality and creativity vary by country. I am here following US law, but the law of quite a few other countries is similar on these points. The term to look for what is counted as original and protectable is often referred to as [threshold of originality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality). This is what I have referred to as \"creativity\" above.\n\nThis is related to the question and answer at [Is a work copyrighted on fixation or publication? What's the difference?

It is also original, assuming the musician created it independently. However, it is not yet protected by copyright because it has not been \"fixed in a tangible form\" - it has not been written down, recorded, or otherwise preserved in a physical medium.

This man has had rape allegations made against him by at least 5 women that I know of, potentially more. Some of these women spoke to me in private, sharing their stories so I could warn others about him, but refuse to come forward in public to make the claim, those who work with rape victims will know how hard it can be on women to come forward after a rape, and the circumstances of these rapes likely make it even harder for these women.\n\nI have, and plan to continue to, warned women in danger to avoid him when I see the chance due to these allegations, as I don't want him to harm anyone else. However, I respect the privacy of the women who have shared their stories with me and, while I don't legally count as one, I try to treat them with the same right of privacy anyone speaking to a psychiatrist would receive. I would not share their identities without their permission no matter what.\n\nThus I'm wondering if Joe were to be foolish enough to try suing for libel or slander when I inform women to avoid him due to multiple rape allegations that I'm aware of (I've warned people through both mediums so either could apply) and I refused to produce the women who shared with me in private about the rapes rather the lack of proof would make me guilty of the crime even though these individuals exist? Realistically I'm sure I could get them to come forward in such a situation, but for this question lets pretend that they refused to and I would not reveal their identities without their choosing to come forward.\n\nSecondly, of the 5 rape allegations I'm aware of I could provide proof that others have heard the allegations, without producing the original women making the allegation, for 3 of them.

Hearsay and second-hand information are not considered sufficient evidence in court. To defend against a defamation lawsuit, you would need to prove the truth of your statements, which would likely require the testimony of the alleged victims or other concrete evidence.

In the context of security screening at government buildings, private security guards acting on behalf of the government can typically conduct reasonable searches as a condition of entry.

The guard's actions in the given scenario (turning on the phone and briefly examining it) are consistent with a security check rather than a content search.

In these cases, does the original YouTuber still have any copyrights over a mirrored version of their video? Can they still make a claim against the uploader for using their content without permission?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, taking a video made by someone else, making alterations and then distributing the resulting work is probably already a copyright violation. There are exemptions like fair use (check the comments for an example), but just taking a whole video, mirroring it and reposting it without any own contribution very likely does not constitute fair use. The people who do that don't avoid copyright infingement. They just try to avoid getting caught by any automatic system YouTube has in place to detect copyright infringements. But avoiding automatic filters does not mean to avoid DMCA takedown notices, cease\\&desist letters or lawsuits from real humans who find a mirrored version of their video and feel that their copyright was violated.\n\nHowever, alterations to a creative work can be a creative work in itself. So regardless of the fact that one violated copyright in creating a derivative work, that derivative work might still be eligible for copyright in its own right. That means someone who reposts a video originally made by party A and then altered by party B would violate the copyright of both A and B at once and thus expose themselves to potential legal actions from either party.\n\nBut the question is if simply mirroring a video constitutes the necessary [threshold of originality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_of_originality) to make the resulting work eligible for copyright.

Alice, as the original creator, maintains her copyright over the video, even when it's mirrored. Mirroring a video likely doesn't meet the threshold of originality to grant Bob a separate copyright. Therefore, Alice can claim infringement against both Bob (for mirroring and uploading her content) and Charlie (for uploading the mirrored version, which is still essentially her copyrighted work).\n\nB) This is incorrect because Alice's copyright extends to derivative works, including the mirrored version. She can claim infringement against both Bob and Charlie.\n\nC) This is incorrect because Bob likely doesn't have a valid copyright claim on the mirrored version.

At the very least you have a contract under which they repair (or make their best efforts to repair) your camera and you give them some money. more than likely, there are specific terms of the contract drafted by the repairer which you agreed to, either by signing something or by clicking on something on a web page (you know all that stuff nobody reads? That's a legally binding contract)\n\n**So, what does the contract say about time?**\n\nIf it says nothing then there is an implied term that the repair must be done in a *reasonable* time. What is a reasonable time? Its the time that a reasonable person who knows all the circumstances would consider neither too short nor too long. Is 2 months a reasonable time? Right now we don't have the information to say: it probably is a reasonable time if parts were required to be sourced etc. 2 years would definitely be unreasonable, 2 months? \\[shrug].\n\nIf it is an unreasonable time you can sue for damages (i.e. whatever the absence of your camera has cost you) or seek a court order forcing them to complete the contract by a certain date.

The distinction in the common law dates from the 19th century when industrialisation created more and more employees and those employees slowly gained more and more rights.\n\nLegislation in the UK (and most other common law jurisdictions) does not usually further define employee so the common law definition is still relevant. The *Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988* is no different.\n\nThe courts have developed 3 tests to determine if a person is subject to a contract of service. These were stated by MacKenna J in [Ready Mixed Concrete (SE) Ltd v Minster of Pensions and National Insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Mixed_Concrete_(South_East)_Ltd_v_Minister_of_Pensions_and_National_Insurance) \\[1968] 2 QB 497\n\n> A contract of service exists if these three conditions are fulfilled. (i) The servant agrees that, in consideration of a wage or other remuneration, he will provide his own work and skill in the performance of some service for his master. (ii) He agrees, expressly or impliedly, that in the performance of that service he will be subject to the other's control in a sufficient degree to make that other master. (iii) The other provisions of the contract are consistent with its being a contract of service.\n\nThese are known as the control test; the integration test; and the multiple test. It is now considered that the control test and the integration test (which were both developed first) are now merely factors, albeit significant factors, of a single multiple test.\n\n> I can put the point which I am making in other words. An obligation to do work subject to the other party's control is a necessary, though not always a sufficient, condition of a contract of service. If the provisions of the contract as a whole are inconsistent with its being a contract of service, it will be some other kind of contract, and the person doing the work will not be a servant. The judge's task is to classify the contract (a task like that of distinguishing a contract of sale from one of work and labour). He may, in performing it, take into account other matters besides control.\n\nThe definition is a little tautological: a contract is a contract of service if it has the elements of a contract of service. This case was also important as it clearly establishes that whether a contract is an employment contract is a matter of law and the parties cannot redefine their relationship with words \\- if it meets the requirements of a contract of service then that\u2019s what it is even if it describes itself as something else. A [duck test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test) is required.\n\nThe sorts of questions that are relevant to the multiple test are:\n\n* Can you work whatever hours you like?\n* Can you work where you like?\n* Do you get paid for what you produce (rather than by the hour or day)?\n* Can you hire somebody else to do the work?\n* Do you have to fix defective work without additional pay?\n* Can you make a profit or loss?\n* Can you be sued if you screw up the work?\n* Do you use your own plant and equipment?\n* Do you carry your own public risk/professional indemnity insurance?\n* Do you provide services to multiple clients and can you choose the quality of service you give to each?\n\nFrom your description, the \u201cagency\u201d sounds exactly like a labour hire employer. The fact that you can pass on individual placements is not enough to make this a contract for service since, if you do accept the placement, you can\u2019t send me to do the work, you can choose to work from 6\\-10 in the morning and 6\\-10 in the evening 4 days per week, you get paid by the hour etc. This is a contract of service and the agency is your employer.

According to the information provided, the employment status is determined by the nature of the working relationship, not just the contract wording. The courts use multiple tests, including the control test and integration test, to determine if someone is an employee. If the relationship meets the criteria for employment (such as the employer controlling when and how work is done, using the employer's equipment, etc.), then the worker is considered an employee regardless of how the contract describes the relationship. In this case, if the worker is deemed an employee, the copyright of their work would belong to the employer as per the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, unless there's an agreement stating otherwise.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes the contract wording alone determines employment status.

The furniture store's possession of the desk isn't wrongful until my employee goes to the furniture store and asked to be given the desk and the furniture store can confirm that my employee is authorized to pick it up, but refuses to turn over the desk to my employee anyway. And, this happens while I'm abroad on an ethnography research mission deep in the Amazon jungle for the next year, and I am unavailable.\n\nMy employee could sue the furniture store which upon refusing my employee's demand had wrongfully detained my custom desk to gain possession of it. This is because my employee has a superior right to possess the custom desk to the furniture store, even though I own the desk.\n\nSimilarly, if I buy a car with a car loan and then default on my loan in a way that authorizes its repossession upon the demand of the lender under the loan agreement and the applicable chattel mortgage law, and I refuse to allow it to be turned over to the repo man for the lender, either the lender or the repo man would have superior right to possession of the car to me, and I would be wrongfully detaining the car. This is true even though I came into possession of the car rightfully and was not wrongfully detaining it until the lender had the right to repossess it and demanded that I turn it over. Even then, my wrongful detention might be merely a breach of contract, rather than a crime.\n\nSo, yes it is unlawful possession in the technical sense, but wrongful possession includes a much broader range of conduct than, for example, criminal theft.\n\n> It's worth noting, that in this circumstance, the defendant gained\n> possession of the goods lawfully, there is no prior or contemporaneous\n> agreement with respect to returning goods.\n\nIn this situation, absent other extenuating circumstances (like a possessory repairman's lien or storage costs lien, or possession of something by a spouse while a divorce is pending, or a court order directing someone to hold property pending a determination of ownership by a court), anyone with a greater right to possession than the person who is currently in possession of it can simply demand that possession be turned over immediately, and their possession then becomes wrongful detention if they don't promptly comply.\n\nFor example, if you loan you backhoe to your neighbor with no other agreement, your neighbor has to return it to you or your agent upon demand.\n\nSomeone who is in possession of property of another lawfully entrusted to them, who has no other relationship to the owner of the property, is a \"bailee\" of the property for the owner or other person with a superior right to possession of it who delivered the property to the bailee, who is the \"bailor\" of the property.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A furniture store is holding a custom-made desk for a customer who has paid in full. The customer, currently unreachable on a year-long research expedition, sends an employee to retrieve the desk. The store refuses to release the desk to the employee. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The furniture store is not wrongfully detaining the desk because the original customer is not present to claim it.\n\nB) The employee has no legal standing to claim the desk, as they are not the owner.\n\nC) The furniture store's possession becomes wrongful only after refusing the employee's valid demand for the desk.\n\nD) The furniture store is committing criminal theft by refusing to release the desk.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The furniture store's possession becomes wrongful only after refusing the employee's valid demand for the desk. This scenario illustrates the concept of \"wrongful detention\" as described in the passage. Initially, the store's possession of the desk was lawful. However, when the employee, acting as an agent for the owner, made a valid demand for the desk, the store's continued possession became wrongful upon refusal.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the original customer's absence doesn't negate their right to have an agent collect the item.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because, as explained in the passage, an employee or agent can have a superior right to possession compared to the current holder, even if they don't own the item.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, while the detention may be wrongful, it doesn't necessarily constitute criminal theft. The passage states that wrongful possession includes a broader range of conduct than criminal theft and may be a civil matter rather than a criminal one."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31767/under-what-circumstances-can-a-banker-cut-your-line-of-credit", "docs_id": 31767, "title": "Under what circumstances can a banker cut your line of credit?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was once offered, and accepted, a line of credit for X.

The act of filming *per se* is therefore not illegal in a criminal sense. However, the proprietor of a private place can ask you to stop filming or demand that you leave; if you fail to comply then you will be trespassing.\n\nTrespass is not a criminal offence (although the police will undoubtedly remove you if called). However, if your intent was to intimidate, obstruct or disrupt activity within the premises, you could be charged with Aggravated Trespass under [s68 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/33/section/68).\n\n### Could the owner, or someone else, have a civil claim against me?\n\nThis is more difficult to answer. Trespass is a tort, so the owner could in theory have a claim against you if you were filming against his wishes. However, he would have to prove some measurable amount of damage, and this is why few trespass cases come to court.\n\nThe occupants of the premises may be able to sue if you breach their right to privacy (Article 8 [ECHR](http://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf), incorporated into UK law by the [Human Rights Act 1998](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42)); however, a court will balance this against your Article 10 right to freedom of expression. A court will consider all circumstances: for example, if you were filming in the toilets of a nightclub, the occupants' right to privacy may well outweigh your right to freedom of expression.\n\nA copyright owner may have a claim against you if you include their work in your film; for example, if you film inside a nightclub and substantial parts of songs are captured on your film, this may give rise to a claim.\n\n**I am not a lawyer.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this action?\n\nA) Filming inside nightclubs is always illegal and can result in criminal charges.\n\nB) The business owner can film freely in any nightclub without permission, as it's protected by freedom of expression.\n\nC) Filming is legal, but the nightclub owner can ask the person to stop or leave, and failure to comply could result in a trespass situation.\n\nD) As long as the filming doesn't capture copyrighted music, there are no legal concerns or potential civil claims to consider.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Filming itself is not illegal in a criminal sense in private venues like nightclubs. However, as these are private properties, the owners have the right to set rules about filming. They can ask someone to stop filming or to leave the premises. If the person refuses, it could be considered trespass.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because filming inside nightclubs is not inherently illegal and doesn't automatically result in criminal charges.\n\nAnswer B is overly permissive. While freedom of expression is a consideration, it doesn't override the property rights of nightclub owners or the privacy rights of patrons.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it overlooks potential privacy concerns and the property rights of the nightclub owners. Even if copyrighted music isn't captured, other legal issues could still arise.\n\nThe correct answer acknowledges that while filming isn't illegal per se, it's subject to the nightclub owner's rules and permission, with potential consequences if those rules are not followed."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/14413/could-ross-ulbricht-from-silk-road-not-get-life-sentence", "docs_id": 14413, "title": "Could Ross Ulbricht from Silk Road not get life sentence?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [Ross Ulbricht](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht) was the creator and operator of [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)), the first modern darknet market, best known as a platform for selling illegal drugs, until his 2013 arrest.\n\nFrom the [criminal complaint](http://www.webcitation.org/6ZJuXJPU7), Ross Ulbricht get double life sentence ([sentencing hearing](https://pt.scribd.com/doc/283722300/Ross-Ulbricht-Sentencing)). \n\nAfter he was arrest in the library, could he have done ANYTHING to don't get life sentence?
