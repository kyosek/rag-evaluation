However, the company must comply with local laws and regulations of the country where it's operating. This includes adhering to Polish regulations on online services, paying appropriate taxes in Poland, and following Polish labor laws if they employ workers in Poland. Option B correctly captures this balance between the freedom to operate across EU states and the obligation to comply with local laws."

Hartford*, 204 F.3d 1187 (9th Cir. Feb. 29, 2000\\) (holding that the Gender Motivated Violence Act (GMVA) applied to targeting of a transgender person) and *Parents for Privacy v. Barr*, No.18\\-35708 (9th Cir. Feb. 12, 2020\\) (rejecting arguments that a school policy protecting transgender students violated other students' rights).\n\nTo the extent that the Montana law was used in an attempt to do an end run around existing federal law protections of transgender individuals, it would probably be struck down as applied under the supremacy clause. Various other federal courts have found that transgender individuals are protected under:\n\n* The Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n* Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act,\n* Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972,\n* The Equal Credit Opportunity Act,\n* Title VII, Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act,\n* Title IX of the Affordable Care Act,\n* The Fair Housing Act, and\n* The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to grant certiorari to review or overturn these decisions protecting transgender rights (which isn't to say that it couldn't adopt new precedents overruling these decisions in the future).\n\nSo, in almost all areas where sex discrimination is prohibited under federal law, the Montana statute would have to yield to federal law. Federal law protections against sex discrimination aren't all encompassing, but the federal courts have not hesitated to invoke the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment when no statutory protections apply. So, there probably aren't many circumstances in which this law could have a meaningful effect.\n\nThe fact that a Montana state law might say otherwise is irrelevant.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recently specifically made clear to the Montana Supreme Court that it may not enforce state laws that violate federal law stating:\n\n> The Supremacy Clause provides that \u201cthe Judges in every State shall be\n> bound\u201d by the Federal Constitution, \u201cany Thing in the Constitution or\n> Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\u201d Art. VI, cl. 2\\.\n> \u201c\\[T]his Clause creates a rule of decision\u201d directing state courts that\n> they \u201cmust not give effect to state laws that conflict with federal\n> law\\[ ].\u201d *Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Center, Inc.*, 575 U.S. 320,\n> 324, 135 S.Ct. 1378, 191 L.Ed.2d 471 (2015\\).\n\n*Espinoza v. Montana Dept. of Revenue*, 207 L. Ed. 2d 679 (June 30, 2020\\).\n\nSimilarly, in another not too ancient case, the U.S. Supreme Court held that:\n\n> The question presented in this case is whether the holding of\n> *Citizens United* applies to the Montana state law. There can be no serious doubt that it does. *See* U.S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2\\.\n\n*Am. Tradition Partn., Inc. v. Bullock*, 567 U.S. 516, 516 (2012\\).\n\nAnother older and emphatic provision making clear that state officials must follow federal law from the U.S. Supreme Court is as follows:\n\n> Article VI of the Constitution makes the Constitution the \u2018supreme Law\n> of the Land.\u2019 In 1803, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for a\n> unanimous Court, referring to the Constitution as \u2018the fundamental and\n> paramount law of the nation,\u2019 declared in the notable case of *Marbury\n> v.

It follows that the interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment\n> enunciated by this Court in the Brown case is the supreme law of the\n> land, and Art. VI of the Constitution makes it of binding effect on\n> the States \u2018any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the\n> Contrary notwithstanding.\u2019 Every state legislator and executive and\n> judicial officer is solemnly committed by oath taken pursuant to Art.\n> VI, \u00b63 \u2018to support this Constitution.\u2019 Chief Justice Taney, speaking\n> for a unanimous Court in 1859, said that this requirement reflected\n> the framers' \u2018anxiety to preserve it \\[the Constitution] in full force,\n> in all its powers, and to guard against resistance to or evasion of\n> its authority, on the part of a State. \\* \\* \\*\u2019 *Ableman v.

The law would likely be struck down entirely due to the Supremacy Clause and existing federal case law protecting transgender rights. The provided information highlights several key points:\n\n1. There are numerous federal case precedents addressing the rights of transgender individuals under existing federal laws.\n2. The Supremacy Clause establishes that federal law takes precedence over state law when they conflict.\n3. Federal courts have consistently found that transgender individuals are protected under various federal laws and constitutional amendments.\n4. The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly declined to overturn decisions protecting transgender rights.\n5. Recent Supreme Court decisions have emphasized that state courts and officials must not enforce state laws that conflict with federal law.\n\nGiven these factors, it's highly likely that the Montana law would be found to conflict with federal protections and would be struck down under the Supremacy Clause. Options A and B are incorrect because they overstate the enforceability of the law in light of federal protections. Option D is incorrect because the law could be struck down by lower federal courts based on existing precedent, without requiring a direct ruling from the Supreme Court."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've read that a Federal law prohibits non\\-citizens from voting in Federal elections. I'm not a lawyer, but from reading the original Constitution and all the amendments, I don't see anything that empowers Congress to enact such a law. I would have thought that allowing resident aliens to vote would be up to the individual states. What is the Constitutional basis for this law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: TL;DNR: Madison, Hamilton, Justice Harlan \\& Justice Scalia agree with you. Justice Black does not. \n\nYou raise an interesting question. As you point out, the Qualifications Clause, Art I, \u00a7 2\\.1, (those who vote for the House of Representatives \u201cin each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature\u201d) gives states the power to establish voter qualifications. Yet 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611, passed as part of the *Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act* of 1996, (the IIRIRA) makes it illegal for most aliens to vote in federal elections. What gives? \n\nFirst, the IIRIRA is purely symbolic. *It literally has no effect on who can vote in the US*. For almost a century, every state has prohibited aliens from voting in state elections. Under the Qualifications Clause, this means no aliens can vote in federal elections. (Before WWI, many states allowed aliens to vote.) \n\nSecond, some people argue Congress has control over voter qualifications under the \"Elections Clause,\" Art. I, \u00a7 4\\.1, which gives Congress the power to regulate the \"Times Places and Manners of holding elections.\" Like Dale M, these people read, \"Manners of holding elections\u201d to include the qualifications for voting.\n\nThis reading of the Elections Clause is inconsistent with several of the sources of constitutional authority Americans typically consult, including the text, the intent of the Founder and precedent. All of these support the \u201cQualifications Clause\u201d reading of the Constitution. \n\n1\\) **Constitutional Text**: Reading the Elections Clause as giving Congress control over voter qualifications, renders the Qualifications Clause almost completely meaningless. Yet everyone agrees the Constitution should be read so that all its parts mean something \u2013 no part should be rendered superfluous. \n\n2\\) **Intent of the Founders**: When the Founders debated voting qualifications, they were clearly worried that politicians would manipulate the electoral rules to favor them. The Founders believed the Qualifications Clause kept both national and state politicians from stacking the electoral deck. First, by giving the power of deciding who could vote to the states, the Clause prevented national politicians from choosing their own electorate. Secondly, by requiring the states to use the same qualifications for voters in state and national elections, the Clause prevented state politicians from manipulating the rules in national elections. \n\nAs for the Electoral Clause, in Federalist 60, Hamilton was clear who controlled voter qualifications: \u201cThe qualifications of the persons who may choose or be chosen\u2026are unalterable by the \\[federal] legislature\u2026\u201d \n\n3\\) **Precedent and practice**: For most of our history, people acted consistently with Hamilton\u2019s statement. They tolerated a wide variation in who was allowed to vote across states. As noted above, many of those states specifically allowed aliens to vote. (And, starting in 1787 with the passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Congress passed a series of laws allowing aliens to vote in territories.) When Americans did make nationwide changes to voting qualifications, they did so by amending the Constitution. \n\nThere are only a handful of Supreme Court decisions involving federal control over voting qualifications. In 1970 the Supreme Court upheld a federal law changing the voting age to 18\\. The opinion of the Court, written by Justice Black, relied on the Elections Clause to say that Congress had the power to change voting requirements. None of the other Justices shared Black's views on the Elections Clause. Instead, they agreed with Justice Harlan, who said, \u201cnothing\u201d in the Constitution, \u201clends itself to the view that voting qualifications in federal elections are to be set by Congress.\u201d (These Justices used the Equal Protection Clause as the basis for federal control over voter qualifications.) \n\nSince then, no Justice has followed Justice Black. Instead, they have followed Justice Harlan. For example, in 2013, Justice Scalia, (in an opinion joined by Breyer, Ginsburg, Kagan, Kennedy, Roberts, and Sotomayor) said, \u201cthe Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them.\u201d \n\nFrom this evidence, I\u2019d say you were right to be puzzled about the constitutional authority for the IIRIRA. A federal law preventing aliens from voting in federal elections undermines the text of the constitution by rendering the Qualifications Clause superfluous, goes against the clear intent of the Founders, and is inconsistent with 200\\+ years of history and precedent. It only survives because it has no practical effect on voting in the US.",

I, \u00a7 4.1) which gives Congress the power to regulate the \"Times, Places and Manners of holding elections.\"\n\nB) The law is unconstitutional because it violates the Qualifications Clause (Art I, \u00a7 2.1), which gives states the power to establish voter qualifications.\n\nC) The law is constitutionally questionable but remains unchallenged because it has no practical effect, as all states already prohibit non-citizens from voting in state elections.\n\nD) The law is constitutionally valid based on the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause, which allows federal control over voter qualifications.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most accurate representation of the situation described in the passage. The law prohibiting non-citizens from voting in federal elections (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 611) is indeed constitutionally questionable for several reasons:\n\n1. It appears to conflict with the Qualifications Clause, which gives states the power to establish voter qualifications.\n2. It goes against the Founders' intent, as expressed by Hamilton in Federalist 60.\n3. It contradicts historical precedent and practice, where states had varying voting qualifications, including some that allowed aliens to vote.\n4. Recent Supreme Court opinions, such as Justice Scalia's in 2013, have affirmed that the Elections Clause does not empower Congress to determine who may vote in federal elections.\n\nHowever, the law remains unchallenged and in place primarily because it has no practical effect. This is due to the fact that for almost a century, all states have independently prohibited non-citizens from voting in state elections, which, under the Qualifications Clause, automatically extends to federal elections as well.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they present overly simplified views that don't capture the nuanced constitutional situation. Option D is incorrect because while the Equal Protection Clause has been used to justify some federal control over voter qualifications, it was not the basis for this specific law."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A developer creates an audiobook using a text-to-speech (TTS) synthesizer with a high-quality voice sample. The TTS software is licensed under an open-source license, but the voice sample is under a proprietary license. The license for the voice sample does not explicitly mention the legal status of generated artifacts. What is the most likely legal status of the resulting audiobook?\n\nA) The audiobook is entirely the developer's intellectual property, free from any licensing restrictions.\nB) The audiobook is only subject to the open-source license of the TTS software.\nC) The audiobook is likely a derived work of both the original text and the voice sample, requiring appropriate licensing for both.\nD) The audiobook is solely a derived work of the original text, with no connection to the voice sample's license.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the audiobook is likely considered a derived work of both the original text and the high-quality voice sample. The documentation states that with current high-quality voices using samples recorded by human speakers, the output would most likely contain large parts of the voice itself, making it a derived work. This means the developer would need appropriate licensing for both creating the derived work (the spoken text) and distributing it. The use of a high-quality voice sample suggests that the output is not purely algorithmic, which would require consideration of the voice sample's license. To be on the safe side, especially when dealing with proprietary voice samples, it's crucial to obtain proper licensing for both the text and the voice used in the audiobook creation."

Which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA) Company X can no longer enforce the arbitration agreement because more than 6 years have passed since the contract was signed.\n\nB) Company X can enforce the arbitration agreement because the statute of limitations begins when the dispute arises, not when the contract was signed.\n\nC) The statute of limitations for enforcing arbitration agreements in New Jersey is 10 years, so Company X can still enforce it.\n\nD) Arbitration agreements in New Jersey are not subject to any statute of limitations and can be enforced at any time.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. In New Jersey, the statute of limitations for breach of contract, including arbitration agreements, is generally six years. However, the crucial point is that the limitation period begins when the cause of action accrues, not when the contract is signed. In this case, the cause of action (the dispute leading to the lawsuit) arose on March 15, 2023, when Employee Y filed the lawsuit. Therefore, Company X is well within the six-year limit to enforce the arbitration agreement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it misunderstands when the statute of limitations begins to run. Option C is incorrect because New Jersey's statute of limitations for contracts, including arbitration agreements, is six years, not ten. Option D is incorrect because arbitration agreements are subject to the same statute of limitations as other contracts in New Jersey, as per the legal principle that arbitration agreements cannot be subjected to more burdensome requirements than other contracts."

Someone uses the website without reading the Terms and uses it for a commercial purpose (meeting with one of their customers, for example). Or suppose I want to limit users to one account to limit usage and charge more, but a customer uses one work account and one personal account with the pseudonym John Doe.\n\nClearly, since they violated the ToS, I could ban the person from the site. I may be able to claim damages from a civil lawsuit. However, I was curious as to whether, if a person does not read the Terms of Service and violates them in a substantial way, would the person have criminal intent, recklessness, or negligence? In some cases, it may be clear without the Terms of Service that you cannot, for example, spread a virus or delete data from the server.\n\nThis is also true for a contract as well.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In general, a ToS document for a web site or online service is simply a contract or agreement. Normally violations of such an agreement are possible grounds for a civil suit, but are not crimes.\n\nMoreover, some terms that some TOS documents claim are not legally enforceable. For example some insist that a user waive a right that the law says cannot be waived.\n\nThe kind of terms mentioned ion the question are probably enforceable in most jurisdictions.\n\nIf a person intentionally supplies false information to a site operator or service provider, with the intention of gaining some financial benefit that would not be available without the false statements, under circumstances where it would be reasonable for the site operator to rely on the statements, that would be fraud in many jurisdictions. Fraud is often a matter for a civil suit, but in some cases it can be a crime also. Those cases vary in different jurisdictions, and the question does not specify any particular jurisdiction.\n\nCriminal fraud is the only case where I can think of where a ToS violation would be a crime.\n\nSome TOS documents prohibit things which are already crimes. For example a communication site might include in its ToS that users are not to use it to assist in committing a crime, or to unlawfully harass someone. If a user violated those provisions, they would also be committing a crime, but only because those actions would be crimes even if the TOS had never mentioned them.\n\nIt is a crime to plan a murder via a chat site, whether the TOS says so or not. But that is because it is a crime to plan a murder in general, with nor without the chat site.\n\nThere are some specifically online crimes. For example, posting so\\-called \"revenge porn\" is a crime in many jurisdictions. But that is a crime because of a law against it, not because of a TOS that prohibits it.\n\nIn all usual cases, a ToS violation will be dealt with via a civil suit, or by limiting or canceling the user's access, if it is dealt with at all.\n\nCFAA\n----\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") the Computer fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), specifically 18 U. S. C. \u00a71030(a)(2\\), makes it a crime for anyone who\n\n> ... intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized access ...\n\nThe recent case of [*Van Buren v. United States*, 593 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2021\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/593/19-783/#tab-opinion-4435485) dealt with the \"exceeds authorized access\" language. (See the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Buren_v._United_States)) In that case, Van Buren, a police officer, accessed official databases to determine id the holder of a given license plate was in fact an undercover police officer. Van Buren thought that this information was being provided to a criminal, and was paid $6,000 for it. Van Buren knew that the access policy prohibited access for \"personal use\" or any \"non\\-official purpose\". He was charged with a felony violation of the CFAA on the ground that he accessed information with an \"improper purpose\", although he would have been authorized to access that same information with a proper purpose. After a long discussion of the meanign of the words \"so\" and \"entitled\" in the stsatute, the court opnion says:\n\n> If the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause criminalizes every violation of a computer\\-use policy, then millions of otherwise law\\-abiding citizens are criminals. Take the workplace. Employers commonly state that computers and electronic devices can be used only for business purposes. So on the Government\u2019s reading of the statute, an employee who sends a personal e\\-mail or reads the news using her work computer has violated the CFAA. Or consider the Internet. Many websites, services, and databases\u2014which provide \u201cinformation\u201d from \u201cprotected computer\\[s],\u201d \u00a71030(a)(2\\)(C)\u2014authorize a user\u2019s access only upon his agreement to follow specified terms of service. If the \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d clause encompasses violations of circumstance\\-based access restrictions on employers\u2019 computers, it is difficult to see why it would not also encompass violations of such restrictions on website providers\u2019 computers. And indeed, numerous amici explain why the Government\u2019s reading of subsection (a)(2\\) would do just that\u2014criminalize everything from embellishing an online\\-dating profile to using a pseudonym on Facebook.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> ... For example, one police department might prohibit using a confidential database for a non\\-law\\-enforcement purpose (an access restriction), while another might prohibit using information from the database for a non\\-law\\-enforcement purpose (a use restriction). Conduct like Van Buren\u2019s can be characterized either way, and an employer might not see much difference between the two. On the Government\u2019s reading, however, the conduct would violate the CFAA only if the employer phrased the policy as an access restriction. An interpretation that stakes so much on a fine distinction controlled by the drafting practices of private parties is hard to sell as the most plausible.\n> \n> \n> In sum, an individual \u201cexceeds authorized access\u201d when he accesses a computer with authorization but then obtains information located in particular areas of the computer\u2014such as files, folders, or databases\u2014that are off limits to him.\n\nThis case clearly says that a person who has authorization to access a computer, but does so for a purpose prohibited by system policy, perhaps as expressed n a TOS contract, is not subject to criminal prosecution under the CFAA. It does not directly deal with the case where, as a condition of access, a person must furnish truthful ID information, or comply with some other condition, and whether violating such a condition would constitute a crime under the CFAA. But it casts significant doubt on any interpretation of the CFAA which would treat that as a crime",

The key point is that Section 12 of the Sexual Offenses Act 2003 requires an actual child victim for the offense to be committed.

There is a federal prohibition against discriminating in employment provided that you are at least 40 years old.

Contracts with minors, such as are involved with opening a bank account, are generally invalid with the exception of \"necessities\", education and insurance [in Massachusetts](https://statelaws.findlaw.com/massachusetts-law/massachusetts-legal-ages-laws.html). No law compels a bank to \"accept\" any person (to open a saving or checking account \u2013 even more so with accepting a loan application).

Age discrimination laws, particularly at the federal level, primarily protect individuals 40 and older in employment contexts. There are many legal instances of age-based restrictions for minors, including limitations on contracts. Banks are not legally obligated to accept any customer, and banking services, while considered a public accommodation, are not subject to age discrimination protections at the federal or state level (using Massachusetts as an example). Therefore, the bank's action, while discriminatory based on age, is legally permissible."

Since in the US fraud is primarily a state matter, we'd have to do a state\\-by\\-state study, but \"intended to result in financial or personal gain\" is not the universal definition. The same goes for [California](https://www.justia.com/trials-litigation/docs/caci/1900/1900.html) and [Ohio](https://www.leagle.com/decision/198417710ohiost3d1671140). I don't know of any jurisdiction where \"financial or personal gain\" is a required element. There are some ways I can think of that the recipient could be harmed by thinking that the thing was real.

According to the information provided, fraud typically requires that the deception results in damage to the person deceived. While the exact definition may vary by state, the key elements often include a false representation, knowledge of its falsity, intent to induce reliance, actual reliance by the victim, and resulting damages. \n\nOption A is incorrect because financial gain is not a universal requirement for fraud in all jurisdictions. \n\nOption B is too absolute; fraud generally requires that harm or damage results from the deception.\n\nOption D introduces an arbitrary time limit that is not supported by the given information. \n\nOption C correctly captures the essence of fraud as described in the source, emphasizing the importance of resulting damages to the deceived party."

What is the name of the document that is produced when\n>  the title search is complete?\n\nThere are several kinds of products of a title search that could be produced. \n\nThe smallest and cheapest, but not usually sufficient for a closing on real estate, is an O\\&E for \"ownership and encumbrance report\" which lists the current owner of record and current debts that the property is subject to based upon a superficial, non\\-guaranteed search.\n\nAnother product is an abstract of title, which is a list of all recorded documents related to the title of the property, sometimes discarding documents that are \"wild deeds\" or are barred by adverse possession doctrines (a sort of statute of limitations that gives someone with a long chain of uninterrupted title priority over someone who has older documents that arguably given them an interest in the property).\n\nA third product is a title commitment. This document states that the title insurance company is insuring and guaranteeing that a certain person will own the property free and clear subject to only specified encumbrances and easements of record, if certain steps are taken (i.e. if the required documents are paid at closing and the identified debts are paid in the amounts listed). Often there are lots of exceptions for easements, HOA organization documents, special taxing districts, mineral rights, water rights, etc.\n\nIn the Western U.S., normally a title commitment is the main document used at closing. In the Eastern U.S., a title abstract followed by an insured opinion letter regarding title from an attorney is more common.\n\n> And does that document need to be signed by an attorney?\n\nIn the Eastern U.S., for example, in New York State, this is restricted to attorneys. In many Western U.S. states one does not have to be an attorney to do an abstract or a title commitment or to issue title insurance, although title insurance companies generally have an attorney on staff even though most routine cases are done by title officers and paralegals who are not lawyers.\n\n> Is a notarized signature required?

Japan has, next to other animals, lots of black (everywhere) and brown bears (in the north).\nNeedless to say, I'd like to protect myself. Pepper sprays have been proven to be very effective.\nThus I always carry a big spray when hiking.\nOn my hiking backpack I carry it outside in a side pocket which is kind of a net, so see thorough (partly).\nSo you **might** be able to see it.\nWell I doubt that bears will go and sue me **but**:\nafaik Japan has a concealed carry law that applies to pepper spray as well.\nThis article backs me on this, I think:\n[https://izumi\\-keiji.jp/column/houritsu\\-gimon/goshin\\-spray](https://izumi-keiji.jp/column/houritsu-gimon/goshin-spray)\n\nSo I wonder:\n\n* What exactly is concealed in this case?\n* Do I violate the law when carrying while hiking?\n\nAnd more broadly not totally related to the question:\n\n* What if I take a train from/to the mountain? do I have to display the can at all times?

If a woman carries pepper spray with a rational purpose such as to defend herself, such act shall be justified. However, it still may be punishable under the Minor Offense Act if she carries it without any necessity.\n\nSo, what is this Minor Offense Act?

So... **The default is, that carrying pepper spray is illegal** if your carrying **doesn't** qualify for a *justifiable reason*. It is up to you to prove that your reason to carry it is justified. However, what is a justifiable reason?\n\nWell, as Tokyoweekender said: if you are not able to defend yourself and you are in a bad area, or if you are stalked, or if you go into the mountains where there truly are wild animals, you *might* be understood justified. However, you gamble there: you'd need to convince the police that you have justification, and the Japanese police does not like people carrying any such items at all. It's not upon the Japanese police to prove you didn't have a reason, it's on you to prove you have justification for the exception!\n\nIn the case that was discussed [in OP's link,](https://izumi-keiji.jp/column/houritsu-gimon/goshin-spray) someone that was regularly transporting large amounts of money was under suit for carrying the pepper spray hidden on them. One of the main factors in the assessment was the fact that the accountant was transporting large amounts of cash money, which made it socially acceptable that he might need to protect himself (and the money) with the spray. The accountant then accidentally put the spray in his pocket when cycling and was met by police, resulting in the suit. The judge ruled, as far as I understand it, that on the job with money the spray was ok. However, the judge in the very case also noted that self\\-defense isn't a justification in itself, and that in large crowds there couldn't be a justification.\n\n> \u304a\u3088\u305d\u8b77\u8eab\u7528\u3067\u3042\u308c\u3070\u3001\u50ac\u6d99\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u306e\u643a\u5e2f\u304c\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306b\u300c\u6b63\u5f53\u306a\u7406\u7531\u300d\u3092\u5145\u305f\u3059\u3068\u5224\u65ad\u3059\u308b\u3082\u306e\u3067\u306f\u306a\u3044\n> \n> \n> If it is for self\\-defense, we \\[the court] do not judge that carrying pepper spray generally satisfies \"just cause\".\n\n> \u307e\u305f\u3001\u3053\u308c\u3068\u3044\u3063\u305f\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3082\u306a\u3044\u306e\u306b\u3001\u4eba\u306e\u591a\u6570\u96c6\u307e\u308b\u5834\u6240\u306a\u3069\u3067\u50ac\u6d99\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30fc\u3092\u96a0\u533f\u643a\u5e2f\u3059\u308b\u884c\u70ba\u306f\u3001\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u306b\u306f\u300c\u6b63\u5f53\u306a\u7406\u7531\u300d\u304c\u306a\u3044\u3068\u5224\u65ad\u3055\u308c\u308b\u3053\u3068\u304c\u591a\u3044\u3068\u8003\u3048\u308b\n> \n> \n> In addition, I \\[the judge] think that it is often judged that there is no \"justifiable reason\" for the act of concealing and carrying pepper spray in a place where many people gather, even though there is no particular need to do so.\n\nAkin to the laws regulating swords \\- where you need to prove you want to collect swords before buying them \\- you'd best inquire with the police *before* and ask for a certification that you require it for a specific reason \\- such as to defend against bears on a hiking trail or to protect the valuable goods you transport for work.",

Hiking in areas with dangerous wildlife, such as bears, could potentially be seen as a justifiable reason. Carrying it visibly on a hiking backpack in bear country would be the most defensible scenario among the options given.\n\nOption A is likely illegal, as public transportation doesn't present a clear justification.

The defense can ask about cycling during jury selection, but excluding all cyclists would require proving to the judge that they are biased, which is described as \"not an easy task.\" This aligns with the concept of \"strike for cause,\" where the judge would need to be convinced of a juror's inability to be impartial."

And then there are reports of people who wanted a test but couldn't get one in [New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/nyregion/coronavirus-testing-newyork.html.) and [Washington State](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/coronavirus-may-have-spread-undetected-for-weeks-in-washington-state/2020/03/01/0f292336-5bcc-11ea-9055-5fa12981bbbf_story.html). Contrast the situation in [South Korea](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51836898). Faced with a novel and obviously problematic situation, they adapted in a tremendous hurry, with innovative solutions in use within days.\n\nFURTHER EDIT: Mike Pence appears to [agree](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-us-testing-red-tape-mike-pence-vice-president/) that regulations and/or laws are getting in the way of testing.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What US laws currently impede the fight against COVID\\-19?\n\nIt is not that such laws *impede* (that is, *ex\\-ante*) the fight against coronavirus. Instead, prosecution for not abiding by those laws *under circumstances of emergency* would lead to the absurd outcome of penalizing (*ex\\-post*) people's efforts toward stopping the spread of the virus. Thus, it is a matter of balancing the *competing interests* of constitutional/statutory freedoms on the one side, and public policy or the common good on the other side.\n\nAs an example, consider the US government's likely decision to restrict or prohibit *interstate travel*. This prohibition seems justifiable as an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. \n\nAn infected person could complain in terms of [*U.S. v. Guest*, 383 US 745, 758 (1966\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/19661128383us74511071) (\"*freedom to travel throughout the United States has long been recognized as a basic right under the Constitution*\", citing cases). However, leaving that person's *freedom of movement* unaltered exposes the population of the destination \\[virus\\-free] state(s) to a high risk of contagion, which is precisely what the government intended to prevent.\n\nMost examples have to do with the *freedom of movement*. In addition to that, any form of quarantine or a prohibition to attend gatherings might also be construed as a hindrance to people's *freedom of expression* or their *right to assemble* as premised on the [First Amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/first_amendment). The rationale is inline with [the argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association#United_States_Constitution) that \"*people can engage in effective speech only when they join others*\". But, similar to the previous example, the risk and impact of contagion are too high to preserve or remedy the person's said rights under a situation that can easily get \\-\\-or might already be getting\\-\\- out of control.\n\nNote: This is not intended to be an exhaustive answer.",

The passage explains that it's not that laws directly impede the fight against COVID-19, but rather that strictly enforcing these laws during an emergency could penalize efforts to stop the virus's spread. The text emphasizes the need to balance constitutional/statutory freedoms with public policy and the common good.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text doesn't mention any laws explicitly prohibiting virus-fighting measures. Option B is wrong because the passage clearly indicates that there are potential conflicts between existing laws and emergency responses. Option D is incorrect because the Constitution doesn't provide explicit exceptions for public health emergencies; instead, the text suggests that a balancing of interests is necessary."

Bob\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance covers damage to his house up to a total rebuild costing 100k and covers personal liability up to another 100k. However, a court finds Bob liable for paying Mary\u2019s medical bills, which are more than 200k. Can the court order that the insurance payout all go to Mary and none of it go to rebuilding Bob\u2019s house? Or would the house necessarily have to be rebuilt and Mary would only be able to put a lien on it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Insurance doesn't work the way you think it does\n------------------------------------------------\n\nInsurance *indemnifies* Bob from any liability he has towards Mary up to the value of the insurance. So, if a court finds that Bob must pay Mary $200k then Bob must pay Mary $200k. Bob can then turn to his insurer to indemnify him and, under the terms of the policy, they will pay out $100k for personal liability leaving Bob to find the other $100k wherever he can.\n\nThe insurance company would not be a party to the litigation (although it would handle the defence on *behalf* of the insured) so a court cannot order it to do anything. Further there are many, many cases where the insured is found liable for something which the policy (allegedly) doesn\u2019t cover \\- this often leads to litigation between the insured and the insurer.\n\nIn parallel, the policy will cover the property damage in accordance with its terms. Assuming the house is adequately insured then the insurer will pay for the demolition, design \\& reconstruction. It is possible that by agreement or at the insurer's discretion that the insurance can cut Bob a check and leave him to do what he likes with the money: rebuild the home, go on a holiday, or pay a debt he might owe to someone.\n\nIf the house is not adequately insured then Bob is a [co\\-insurer](https://www.brokerlink.ca/blog/co-insurance-explained/) and the cost of rebuilding is split. For example, if the cost of rebuilding is actually $150k and the total damage amounts to $90k then the insurer will pay $60k and Bob will have to pay the remaining $30k. Co\\-insurance terms usually have an error factor built in.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Bob's negligence causes an explosion that destroys his house and injures Mary. Bob's homeowner's insurance policy covers property damage up to $100,000 and personal liability up to $100,000. A court finds Bob liable for $250,000 in damages to Mary. The cost to rebuild Bob's house is estimated at $150,000. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the insurance payout and Bob's liability?\n\nA) The court can order the entire $200,000 insurance payout to go to Mary, leaving nothing for Bob's house reconstruction.\n\nB) The insurance company will pay $100,000 for Bob's house reconstruction and $100,000 to Mary, leaving Bob personally liable for the remaining $150,000 owed to Mary.\n\nC) The insurance company will pay $150,000 for Bob's house reconstruction (as a co-insurer) and $50,000 to Mary, leaving Bob personally liable for $200,000.\n\nD) The insurance company will pay $100,000 to Mary for liability coverage and $100,000 for Bob's house reconstruction, leaving Bob personally liable for $150,000 to Mary and $50,000 for additional reconstruction costs.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The insurance policy works separately for property damage and liability coverage. The insurance company will pay out the maximum $100,000 for liability to indemnify Bob against Mary's claim, leaving him personally responsible for the remaining $150,000. For property damage, the insurance will cover the maximum $100,000 for house reconstruction, with Bob responsible for the additional $50,000 as a co-insurer. The court cannot dictate how the insurance company allocates its payouts between property damage and liability coverage, as these are separate components of the policy."

But if the donor bought the car used for less than $10,000, then there would be some capital gain on the sale which would be reported as part of one's California and United States income taxes in the year of the sale by the gift recipient. The exact rate due would depend upon the seller's tax brackets, which would also be based on other income.\n\nIn addition, there would probably be California DMV charges for a new license and registration, which could be characterized as a tax, but which are normally paid by the purchaser, along with sales tax.",

The car was originally purchased by his uncle for $12,000 five years ago. John decides to sell the car for $10,000 shortly after receiving it. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the tax implications of this sale?\n\nA) John will owe capital gains tax on $10,000 since that's the full amount he received from the sale.\nB) John will not owe any capital gains tax because the sale price is less than the original purchase price.\nC) John will owe capital gains tax on $2,000, which is the difference between the sale price and the original purchase price.\nD) John will not owe any capital gains tax, but he will be responsible for paying sales tax and DMV fees on the transaction.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. John will not owe any capital gains tax on this sale. The capital gains tax is calculated based on the difference between the sale price and the adjusted basis of the asset. In this case, John inherited the car's adjusted basis from his uncle, which is $12,000 (the original purchase price). Since John is selling the car for $10,000, which is less than the adjusted basis, there is no capital gain to be taxed. In fact, this would be considered a capital loss, although personal property losses are generally not deductible.\n\nOption A is incorrect because capital gains tax is not applied to the full sale amount, but only to the profit (if any).\n\nOption C is incorrect because it misunderstands how the adjusted basis works in gifted property.\n\nOption D is partially correct about DMV fees but incorrect about the capital gains tax. While John may indeed be responsible for DMV fees and the buyer might owe sales tax, these are separate from capital gains tax considerations."

The reason you feel there is a \u201clegal grey area\u201d is because there\u2019s a legal gray area.\n\nThe way the common law works is that there are some acts and omissions that are clearly crimes/torts/breach of contract, some that aren\u2019t and some that live in that grey area.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A non-profit organization's bylaws state that \"all issues to be voted on shall be decided by a simple majority of qualified members present and voting at the meeting in which the vote takes place, provided a quorum is present.\" At a meeting with 50 qualified members in attendance (constituting a quorum), a vote is taken on a new policy. The results are: 3 votes in favor, 2 votes against, and 45 abstentions. What is the outcome of this vote?\n\nA) The policy fails to pass because less than half of the members present voted in favor.\nB) The vote is invalid and must be retaken due to the high number of abstentions.\nC) The policy passes with a 3-2 majority of those \"present and voting.\"\nD) The policy is tabled until the next meeting when more members are willing to cast a vote.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The bylaws specifically state that decisions are made by a \"simple majority of qualified members present and voting.\" In this case, only 5 members actually cast a vote (3 in favor, 2 against). The 45 abstentions are not counted as part of the voting process. Therefore, out of the 5 votes cast, the majority (3 out of 5) were in favor, so the policy passes. The phrase \"present and voting\" is crucial here, as it excludes abstentions from the vote count. While it may seem counterintuitive that such a small number of votes can decide an issue when so many members are present, this is precisely why the \"present and voting\" clause exists in many bylaws and parliamentary procedures."

According to the information provided, there are generally no widespread international treaties that restrict a sovereign state's ability to impose exit taxes on wealth leaving the country. The answer notes that the expert is \"not aware of any such treaties.\" However, it does mention that some free trade agreements, such as those forming the European Union, may have the effect of limiting such taxes among member nations. This aligns with option D, which acknowledges the general absence of restrictions while noting the potential exceptions in certain trade agreements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it claims widespread treaties exist, which contradicts the information given. Option B, while touching on the EU example, overstates the case by suggesting that EU treaties definitively prevent exit taxes, which is not supported by the given information. Option C is incorrect because it suggests that most countries have strict international obligations preventing exit taxes, which is not supported by the information provided and goes against the statement that sovereign states can \"nationally do whatever they want\" in this regard."

Contracts do not need to have all terms explicitly spelled out for those terms to be binding; it is expected that dental care has a cost, and if you don't explicitly specify the cost then it's assumed you're willing to pay a reasonable fee. They can't charge you six million dollars for a bandage, but there's a *very* wide range of fees considered \"reasonable\" for a doctor to charge. If you care more about the price, it's your responsibility to work these things out yourself before saying \"yes.\" The dentist does not need to make you sign a written contract saying it's your job to check, because when you agreed to the care without asking about the price you *already* agreed to pay whatever would be charged (subject to the fact that courts will not enforce an unconscionable contract).\n\n[California law](http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/transparency-and-disclosure-health-costs.aspx#Legislation) requires hospitals to provide someone without insurance a written *estimate* of healthcare costs upon request, as well as requiring any hospital with a master list of charges for services to make it available to the public and to give anyone (on request) a list of average charges for 25 common outpatient services.

According to the documentation, when a patient agrees to a medical service without explicitly asking about the price, they are implicitly agreeing to pay whatever would be charged, subject to the limitation that the fee must be reasonable. A written contract is not necessary for this agreement to be binding. While patients can dispute unreasonably high charges, they cannot simply refuse to pay or unilaterally decide what constitutes a reasonable fee. The dentist is not legally required to disclose prices upfront unless specifically asked, and California law only requires hospitals (not individual practitioners like dentists) to provide cost estimates upon request. Therefore, by agreeing to the cavity filling without inquiring about the cost, the patient has legally obligated themselves to pay the dentist's fee, assuming it falls within a reasonable range for such services."

By making the entire novel freely available online, the author is essentially lending it to the public, which constitutes publication under copyright law.\n\nB) This is an example of a public performance, which the law explicitly states \"does not of itself constitute publication.\" While it's being transmitted to the public, it's not being distributed in a way that allows the audience to retain a copy.\n\nC) This is a public display, which, like public performance, does not itself constitute publication according to the law. The painting is being shown, but copies are not being distributed.\n\nD) While this involves transmitting the image to the public, the \"do not reproduce\" watermark suggests the photographer is not intending to distribute copies or allow further distribution. This falls more under public display than publication.\n\nThe key distinction is that publication involves distribution of copies, while public performance or display does not necessarily involve such distribution."

The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 does not make specific provisions for accessing isolated open access land, and there is no implicit right to cross private property.

Students were not informed of the nature of the survey prior to taking it, but they did know that it was non\\-anonymous and that school administration would be accessing the results of the survey.\n\nThe parent of the friend of my son received a letter telling her that there was some concern over the responses of her son and that she should follow up with her son to make sure there aren't mental health issues. I did not receive a letter, so I assume my son's SDQ did not raise any flags. I also do not know who within my school's administration has access to the SDQ results.\n\nMy concern is that administration is gathering mental health information about students without telling students (aged 14\\-18\\) that the purpose of the SDQ is to gather information about their mental health, and releasing this information to their parents without the students' consent. This would seem to me to violate HIPAA, which forbids the disclosure of a patient's protected health information without the patient's authorization. I have attached an image of the SDQ, as well as a link to the official website.\n\n[Link to survey download page](http://www.sdqinfo.com/py/sdqinfo/b3.py?language=Englishqz(USA)) The correct file is \"One\\-sided self\\-rated SDQ for 11\\-17 year olds\"\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qLkc0.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qLkc0.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Everything appears fine in terms of the school's actions. Who cares if they give the information to the parents? As long as there is not some other violation at the school or unless the information goes deeper than what you've provided the student has no ability to consent or not. This is true for two reasons. \n\n1\\) Protected Health Information\n\nProtected health information under the HIPAA Privacy Rule protects most \"individually identifiable health information\" *held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate...* \n\nHIPAA defines a *covered entity* as:\n\n* a health care provider that conducts certain standard administrative and financial transactions in electronic form\n* a health care clearinghouse; or\n* a health plan\n\nAs I'm sure you agree, the school is neither one of those things.\n\n2\\) Talking to the parents of a minor\n\nThe [Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html) defers to state law regarding who is and is not considered a minor and when. That said, in general situations, \"a parent, guardian or other person acting *in loco parentis* usually is the personal representative of the minor child, and a health care provider is permitted to share patient information with a patient's personal representative.\" \n\nA parent is not treated as a minor child's personal representative [when](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/mental-health/index.html): \n\n> (1\\) State or other law does not require the consent of a parent or other person before a minor can obtain a particular health care service, the minor consents to the health care service, and the minor child has not requested the parent be treated as a personal representative; (2\\) someone other than the parent is authorized by law to consent to the provision of a particular health service to a minor and provides such consent; or (3\\) a parent agrees to a confidential relationship between the minor and a health care provider with respect to the health care service.\n\nFinally, special treatment is given to cases of psychotherapy notes. A parent does not have a right to receive a copy of these notes about a child's mental health treatment. \n\n> The Privacy Rule distinguishes between mental health information in a mental health professional\u2019s private notes and that contained in the medical record. It does not provide a right of access to psychotherapy notes, which the Privacy Rule defines as notes recorded by a health care provider who is a mental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of a conversation during a private counseling session or a group, joint, or family counseling session and that are separate from the rest of the patient\u2019s medical record.\n\n**Addendum**\n\nRecognizing that a school is not a health care provider or clearinghouse or health plan, I looked further for an answer related specifically to schools. Schools in these situations are not in general governed by HIPAA, but rather are governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This [Joint Guidance on the Application of the FERPA and the HIPAA to Student Health Records](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/hipaaferpajointguide.pdf) issued jointly by the Dep't of Health and Human Services and the Dep't of Education is worth you taking a look at due to the numerous situations that can arise and the detailed Q\\&A included. \n\nGenerally, though, parents and eligible students (those 18\\+) have the right to inspect and review the student's education records. Education records are those that are directly related to the student and kept by an educational institution or agency or by a party acting for that agency or institution. \n\nImportantly, for you:\n\n> At the elementary or sec\n>  ondary level, a student\u2019s health \n>  records, including immunization records, maintained\n>  by an educational agency or institution subject \n>  to \n>  FERPA\n>  , as well as records maintained by a school\n>  nurse, are \u201ceducation records\u201d subject to \n>  FERPA\n>  .

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this practice?\n\nA) The school is in violation of HIPAA by sharing student mental health information with parents without student consent.\n\nB) The school's actions are permissible under FERPA, as the SDQ results likely qualify as \"education records.\"\n\nC) The school must obtain explicit student consent before administering the SDQ, as it collects mental health information.\n\nD) The school is required by HIPAA to keep all SDQ results confidential and cannot share them with parents under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The school's actions are most likely permissible under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), not the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). FERPA typically governs student records in educational settings, not HIPAA. The SDQ results would likely be considered \"education records\" under FERPA, which generally allows schools to share such information with parents of minor students. FERPA considers health records maintained by a school, including mental health information, to be part of a student's education records. Parents have the right to inspect these records for students under 18. The school does not need student consent to administer the SDQ or share results with parents of minors. Therefore, option B is the most accurate statement regarding the legal implications of the school's actions."

If there is a young child (say 4\\-10\\-ish) who is unsupervised and causing a major disruption, what is the extent of the measures you can take to stop him/her, as far as the law is concerned? When I say causing a disruption, I mean things like trashing a store, or spitting on passerby, or being aggressive, or even less important rules, like cheating at an arcade game, such as skeeball? I'm wondering basically because I watched this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=NuHLsPVeqLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuHLsPVeqLU)\nAs a normal person, watching, are you alllowed to intervene? Do you just have to deal with it, or can you forcefully make the child stop? I want to know from a legal standpoint, rather than moral.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In addition to the general considerations of (1\\) who is allowed to use non\\-deadly physical force to maintain order in a shop (which I think that one could do if \"deputized\" by the property owner or to protect the property of another as well), and (2\\) the use of non\\-deadly physical force to make a citizen's arrest (which many of these scenarios would justify as the disorder would be a crime if committed by an adult), (3\\) I suspect that there is also some point at which a bystander may intervene to prevent harms associated with an unsupervised minor being at large and in need of supervision.\n\nGenerally speaking, intervention with the minimum reasonable non\\-deadly physical force to prevent property damage, or an assault, or a threat, is going to be permissible. As to the third reason: for a mentally normal ten\\-year\\-old that might be a stretch; for a four\\-year\\-old or a clearly impaired older child it might not.\n\nOne could approach the child, say, \"where's your mom or dad\", \"do you have a babysitter or sibling around?\", \"what is your name?\", or \"are you lost?\" and detain the child until a satisfactory answer is provided or a suitable authority arrives, to prevent the problem of a child being lost, abducted or hurt by the child's own actions.\n\nIt would be quite hard for a parent, guardian or babysitter to complain about this kind of conduct when the child was unsupervised and is released as soon as you confirm that this really is a responsible adult or older minor who is responsible for the child.\n\nIt would be important in doing so to not secret away or isolate the child, to try to determine the location of the child's caretaker, to refrain from doing anything that would harm the child, and to seek assistance from an authority within a reasonable time. Typically, if no caretaker appeared, a cop would come and the cop would oversee the situation until a social worker could come.\n\nFor example, Colorado has the following statute that would apply once a cop arrived (omitting lengthy provisions that apply to newborn children):\n\n> \u00a7 19\\-3\\-401\\.

Neglected or dependent child\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A child is neglected or dependent if:\n> \n> \n> (a) A parent, guardian, or legal custodian has abandoned the child or\n>  has subjected him or her to mistreatment or abuse or a parent,\n>  guardian, or legal custodian has suffered or allowed another to\n>  mistreat or abuse the child without taking lawful means to stop such\n>  mistreatment or abuse and prevent it from recurring;\n> \n> \n> (b) The child lacks proper parental care through the actions or\n>  omissions of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian;\n> \n> \n> (c) The child's environment is injurious to his or her welfare;\n> \n> \n> (d) A parent, guardian, or legal custodian fails or refuses to provide\n>  the child with proper or necessary subsistence, education, medical\n>  care, or any other care necessary for his or her health, guidance, or\n>  well\\-being;\n> \n> \n> (e) The child is homeless, without proper care, or not domiciled with\n>  his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian through no fault of\n>  such parent, guardian, or legal custodian;\n> \n> \n> (f) The child has run away from home or is otherwise beyond the\n>  control of his or her parent, guardian, or legal custodian;\n\nI don't have easily at hand legal authority authorizing a third\\-party who is not a law enforcement officer to take custody of a dependent or neglected child until a law enforcement officer arrives, but I strongly suspect from the context that this is allowed either under common law, or a statute that I have not located, or some legal fiction (e.g., that the citizen is implicitly deputized by the law enforcement officer after the fact), or simply as a matter of custom and ordinary practice not codified in any authoritative legal source.",

It only works for literate English speakers who see the sign, and doesn't clearly define the boundaries of the property.\n\nB) Though legal and potentially more convincing, this still doesn't address the root cause of why people are entering the property.\n\nC) This is the most effective solution suggested in the answer. It addresses the actual need (people being thirsty) while also securing the water tap. It provides a potential compromise that respects both the homeowner's property rights and the needs of passersby.\n\nD) This option wasn't suggested in the answer and would likely be an overreaction, potentially wasting police resources for a non-emergency situation.\n\nThe correct answer (C) provides a practical solution that addresses the core issue while avoiding potential legal complications or ineffective deterrents."

Such devices can receive broadcasts that require a TV licence, e.g. via iPlayer. Do you have to unlock it?\n\nWould, for example, the argument that your phone or computer contains sensitive or personal data be a \"reasonable excuse\"? Such data could include embarrassing photos, other people's personal data and the like. In particular I can imagine they may want to view your browser history to see if you have visited iplayer.com.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It will be fact\\-specific, but potentially not unlocking your phone for such a reason *could* be a \"reasonable excuse\". However, you will need to provide evidence for such an excuse. The prosecution will still have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that the excuse is not \"reasonable\".\n\nIt is entirely possible that the court would determine any such excuse based on privacy to not be reasonable, partly because it grants a very broad shield to defendants which would frustrate the purpose of the law, but partly because they can point to precedent that privacy is not an absolute right and that privacy infringement can be justified in the circumstances (the same way the police can search your phone).\n\nI have not been able to find any relevant case law on the matter, but I will keep investigating and update my answer if I find any.\n\nAs an aside, it does appear possible for any warrant obtained by TV Licensing officials to include a [Section 49](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/section/49) Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 notice which would compel you to unlock the phone regardless of any \"reasonable excuse\".

If they request you to unlock your smartphone, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding your legal obligations?\n\nA) You must always unlock your phone immediately upon request, with no exceptions.\n\nB) You can refuse to unlock your phone if it contains any personal or sensitive data.\n\nC) You may have a \"reasonable excuse\" to not unlock your phone, but the burden of proof is on you to justify this excuse.\n\nD) You can refuse to unlock your phone unless the warrant specifically includes a Section 49 RIPA 2000 notice.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, while you are generally required to assist in the examination, you may have a \"reasonable excuse\" to not unlock your phone. However, the burden of proof is on you to provide evidence for such an excuse, and the prosecution would still need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that your excuse is not reasonable. It's important to note that privacy concerns alone may not be considered a reasonable excuse, as courts may view this as too broad a shield that could frustrate the purpose of the law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there are potential exceptions, such as having a \"reasonable excuse.\" Option B is too broad and likely wouldn't be considered a blanket \"reasonable excuse.\" Option D is incorrect because while a Section 49 RIPA 2000 notice would indeed compel you to unlock the phone, its absence doesn't automatically mean you can refuse - you would still need a \"reasonable excuse\" under the Communications Act."

The airline, while able to deduct the donations they pass on to the charity, must also report the money received from customers as income.

It demonstrates a clear business purpose (market research), reasonable accommodations (moderately priced hotels), and proper documentation (detailed expense reports with justifications). This aligns with the advice given in the documentation about the IRS looking carefully at such reimbursements.\n\nOption A is incorrect because attending a shareholder meeting is specifically mentioned as not being a business expense for reimbursement purposes.\n\nOptions C and D are both examples of excessive or questionable expenses that would likely raise red flags with the IRS, as they could be seen as attempts to disguise personal travel or luxury experiences as business expenses.\n\nThe correct answer demonstrates a balance between legitimate business activity and reasonable expenses, which is less likely to be scrutinized as a potential disguised dividend payment."

According to Florida law, stealing a bicycle worth $2,000 constitutes grand theft, which is a felony in the third degree with a maximum sentence of 5 years. Additionally, breaking the lock would result in a criminal mischief charge. However, since the damage to the lock ($100) is less than $1,000, it doesn't elevate the theft charge. While the person would face both charges, sentences are often served concurrently, meaning the maximum prison time would still be 5 years. Option A is incorrect because it ignores the criminal mischief charge. Option B is incorrect because it suggests the sentences would be served consecutively, which is rare.

According to the Maine Constitution:\n\n> The Attorney General shall be chosen biennially by joint ballot of the Senators and Representatives in convention.\n\nThe other is the chairman of the board of professional land surveyors. According to 32 MRS S 18211 SS 4:\n\n> The board shall meet at least once a year to conduct its business and to elect a chair.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is, 'how long do these terms last?' \n\nIn the first place, consider a scenario where John is elected Attorney General or Chair of the Board in a January of say the year 2000\\. Suppose the next election of a Chair or an Attorney General does not happen until December of 2001 or December of 2002 respectively. In each of those cases, does John serve more than one total year (in the case of Chair) or more than two total years (in the case of the AG)?\n\nIn the second place, suppose no \"election\" or \"motion of choosing\" takes place at all. What is the logical consequence of such a failure? If the preceding AG or the preceding Chair continues to serve, there is no consequence it seems for not doing that which is required by law. Does the Chair or AG cease to serve upon failure to \"choose\" or \"elect\" them annually or biennially? If so, when? \\- (see my first question above).\n\nI did manage to find this. See 5 MRS S 3\n\n> \u00a73\\. Civil officers serve until successors qualify\n>  All civil officers, other than judicial officers, appointed in accordance with law and whose terms of office are fixed by law, shall hold office during the term for which they were appointed and until their successors in office have been appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed in accordance with law. \\[1975, c. 771, \u00a725 (RPR).]\n\nBut 1\\) I don't exactly know what counts as a civil officer. And 2\\) I don't know what \"terms of office are fixed by law\" means precisely. After all, if the terms were really fixed by law, I might not be asking this question in the first place. On the other hand, if it is presumed that the \"elections\" will take place when they're supposed to do so, then the terms are kind of \"fixed\" in a sense.\n\nSecondly, even if the AG counts as a \"civil officer\", one of the very next sections after 5 MRS Section 3 says this. (See 5 MRS Section 6\\):\n\n> \u00a76\\. Officials have 30 days to qualify\n>  All public officers appointed or renewed in accordance with law shall, within 30 days after being commissioned, qualify to perform the duties of their office and the certificate of qualification must be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. Any officer who fails to qualify within 30 days and file a certificate of qualification in the office of the Secretary of State within 45 days must be suspended by the Secretary of State until the defect is corrected. During this suspension, the officer may be deemed to have forfeited the appointment and the office may be declared vacant by the appointing authority and a new appointment made. \\[1991, c. 837, Pt. A, \u00a77 (AMD).]\n\nI checked with the secretary of state. There are no \"certificates of qualification\" for board chairs. That must mean that they count as something other than \"public officers.\" So that might mean that section 3 does not apply to them at all. \n\nThere is one more thing. See 10 MRS S 8009:\n\n> \u00a78009\\. Standardized terms\n>  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon expiration of a professional or occupational licensing board member's term, that member serves until a successor is appointed and qualified. The successor's term commences at the expiration of the preceding term, regardless of the date of appointment. A vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of a specified term must be filled by appointment of a similarly qualified individual as a replacement. The replacement member serves for the remainder of the unexpired term, regardless of the date of appointment. \\[2013, c. 217, Pt. A, \u00a72 (AMD).]\n\nBut I am sure this section is talking about the terms of actual board members, not the chair or any other kind of special elected officer of the board. \n\nWhat I'd like to know, in addition to an answer particularized for the state of Maine in these cases if you can, is when the term of such an official would end in the absence of any kind of legal specification?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not quite sure what you're asking here. \n\nOfficials serve until they are (1\\) replaced (which covers until after their successor has qualified) or (2\\) removed from office by legal (or inevitable biological) processes. If the successor is not appointed and qualified, the successor does not start in the job. This may mean the previous person serves a bit longer. The previous person could also be reappointed to another term.\n\nBased on a brief view of the [speech history for Maine's attorney general](http://www.maine.gov/ag/news/speeches.shtml), it looks like there is a swearing\\-in ceremony approximately Jan. 7 of the odd\\-numbered years.",

According to Maine law, specifically 5 MRS \u00a7 3, civil officers (which would include the Attorney General) \"shall hold office during the term for which they were appointed and until their successors in office have been appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed in accordance with law.\" This means that even if the election is delayed, the current Attorney General would continue to serve until a new Attorney General is elected and qualified for the position.

Importantly, these powers can be exercised before an arrest and without obtaining a warrant. This includes the ability to collect IMEI numbers and potentially access message content without the device owner's consent. \n\nOption A is incorrect because a warrant is not always required. \nOption B is false as these powers can be used before an arrest. \nOption D is too restrictive, as the act potentially allows access to more than just basic device information.\nOption C correctly captures the expansive nature of the powers granted under this act, including the ability to access various types of data without consent or a warrant, even in pre-arrest scenarios."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There's a bit of story to this:\n\nWe had been trying to find a therapist for my son. We wanted one that we felt comfortable with. We didn't care if the provider was out of network or if we'd have to pay for their services out of pocket. We found one that we all really like and have seen them for several sessions now.\n\nWe have commercial health insurance through my work, and my son also has insurance through the state (Wisconsin) under Medicaid. My commercial insurance has zero out of network coverages.\n\nThe provider billed my commercial insurance first for the services, knowing that it would likely be declined due to being out of network.\n\nAfter it was declined, the provider then sent the claim to Medicaid, and they declined it too, saying they won't cover any of it since it was out of network to my commercial insurance. I'm fine with that, we just pay for the services out of pocket and that's that. Apparently not. The provider has told us that we can no longer see them because they cannot accept payment from us. The provider said they heard this from a representative at Medicaid and that they read it in some documents.\n\nOne supporting quote that I was provided with to support their claim that they can no longer see us is this:\n\n> BadgerCare Plus and Wisconsin Medicaid will not reimburse the provider if the commercial health insurance plan denied or would deny payment because a service otherwise covered under the commercial health insurance plan was performed by a provider outside the plan. **In addition, if a member receives a covered service outside their commercial health insurance plan, the provider cannot collect payment from the member.**\n\nThe provider went back to the representative to confirm that they can't bill us even if insurance isn't involved and they were told:\n\n> No they can\u2019t, that would be considered fraud.\n\nIs this legal? How can I not just pay for a service out of pocket? What fraud would I or the provider be committing? I'd understand if we went into this whole thing thinking that it was going to be covered by insurance, but we knew insurance likely wasn't going to cover it.\n\nAny help or advice would be really appreciated.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is \"Topic \\#601\" in various ForwardHealth [interpretative statements](https://www.forwardhealth.wi.gov/kw/archive/BehavioralTreatment080119.pdf) about BadgerCare Plus and Medicaid. The last 3 paragraphs say:\n\n> When commercial health insurance plans require members to use a\n> designated network of providers, non\\-network (i.e., providers who do\n> not have a contract with the member's commercial health insurance\n> plan) will be reimbursed by the commercial health insurance plan only\n> if they obtain a referral or provide an emergency service.\n> \n> \n> Except for emergency services and covered services that are not\n> covered under the commercial health insurance plan, members enrolled\n> in both a commercial health insurance plan and BadgerCare Plus or\n> Wisconsin Medicaid (i.e., state\\-contracted MCO (managed care\n> organization), fee\\-for\\-service) are required to receive services from\n> providers affiliated with the commercial health insurance plan. In\n> this situation, providers are required to refer the members to the\n> commercial health insurance plan's network providers. This is\n> necessary because commercial health insurance is always primary to\n> BadgerCare Plus.\n> \n> \n> BadgerCare Plus and Wisconsin Medicaid will not reimburse the provider\n> if the commercial health insurance plan denied or would deny payment\n> because a service otherwise covered under the commercial health\n> insurance plan was performed by a provider outside the plan. In\n> addition, if a member receives a covered service outside their\n> commercial health insurance plan, the provider cannot collect payment\n> from the member.\n\nIf we take these statements by the Dept. of Health Services as correct interpretations of the law, then it seems that their interpretation is correct: \"providers are required to refer the members to the commercial health insurance plan's network providers\" (you as a patient have no choice) and \"the provider cannot collect payment from the member\" (they are encouraged to refer you to a network provider, because they are prohibited by law from taking payment from you).\n\nIf you had received the services from the provider and not mentioned any insurance, this would have been treated as a normal doctor\\-patient case, and they would not know that the state would prohibit them from receiving payment from you. By going through the motions with insurance, I regret to say that you exposed them to relevant knowledge which they cannot take back or deny. The fraud would be between the provider and the state, via the provider's relation with this program.\n\nThat does not endorse the DHS legal interpretation, but since they are the ones who wrote the regulations, it is fairly likely that (by definition) they got it right.",

According to the ForwardHealth interpretative statements, if a member with both commercial insurance and Medicaid receives a covered service outside their commercial health insurance plan's network, the provider cannot collect payment from the member. Instead, providers are required to refer members to the commercial health insurance plan's network providers. This is because commercial health insurance is always primary to BadgerCare Plus and Medicaid. The provider is prohibited from billing the patient directly (A) or accepting out-of-pocket payment (D), as this would be considered fraud. Additionally, Medicaid will not reimburse the provider if the commercial insurance denied payment due to the service being performed by an out-of-network provider (B)."

The Fair Use doctrine provides a potential defense, but it requires a careful balancing of multiple factors, including the purpose of use, nature of the copyrighted work, amount used, and effect on the market value of the original work. Additionally, the \"transformativeness\" of the use is considered.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it's too absolute; not all such uses are automatically infringement.

How does the government assess whether a leak on wikileaks is legitimate, and is the assessment made on an individual basis, if so what is the process for determining their validity, or are they all rejected or accepted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The courts are never in such a broad position to rule on generic wikileaks evidence. Theoretically, a court could have to rule on the admissibility of a *specific* document, so in that sense the matter is always dealt with on a case by case basis. There is a [\"document\"](https://wikileaks.org/amazon-atlas/document/AmazonAtlas_v1/AmazonAtlas_v1.pdf) that purports to be somehow from Amazon, reporting that a certain grey building with no architectural charm in a nearby village is an Amazon data center. Legally speaking, nobody cares, but let's say that there is some legal reason why it matters whether the claim is true (I stipulate that the document passes the relevance test).\n\nThe publicly\\-posted document has no probative value, because anyone can create a file containing the word \"Amazon\". It looks like a cleaned\\-up OCR scan of a printout (hence the complete failure at non\\-English characters), and lacks any clear indicia of Amazon origin. Thus the party would have to establish that the document is authentic, and there must be a provable chain of custody from the author to the submitted document. [Federal Rules of Evidence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre) cover questions of authenticity and contents of admissible evidence in art IX, X. Nothing in [rule 901](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_901) suggests that such a document would be admissible.\n\nVery theoretically, if they happened to also have the original paper document, there might be sufficient forensic evidence to prove that the document is traceably come from the purported source. The wikileaks document *per se* would still be inadmissible, but the (more) original document could be admissible.",

The information provided indicates that courts do not make broad rulings on Wikileaks evidence as a whole. Instead, they would consider the admissibility of specific documents on a case-by-case basis. The key factors in determining admissibility would be the document's authenticity and whether there is a provable chain of custody from the author to the submitted document. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because public availability does not automatically make a document admissible in court. \n\nAnswer B is too absolute; while many Wikileaks documents might lack a clear chain of custody, it's not accurate to say they are never admissible. \n\nAnswer D is incorrect because courts do not have a blanket policy for Wikileaks documents; each document would be evaluated individually based on its merits and adherence to rules of evidence.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the nuanced approach courts would take, considering factors like authenticity and chain of custody for each specific document, rather than making sweeping judgments about Wikileaks evidence as a whole."

Some countries do not have a system of copyright registration at all. Of those that do, the benefits vary.\n\nIn the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\"), one cannot sue for infringement at all unless the copyright is first registered. One cannot obtain statutory damages, or legal fees as damages, unless the work is registered **before** the infringement starts, or no later than three months after publication. So if one thinks it is plausible that one will sue for infringement in a US court, it is a good idea to register early. In other countries, the benefits may be different and the value of registration not so clear.\n\nNote that a plaintiff (usually the copyright owner or claimant) can normally choose what jurisdiction to file an infringement suit in. Suit can usually be brought in any country where the work has been published or distributed. So one can limit registration to countries where one is likely to bring a suit.",

Registering copyright in the United States within three months of publication is crucial because:\n\n1. It allows the author to sue for infringement in US courts.\n2. It enables the author to seek statutory damages and legal fees if infringement occurs.\n3.

This strategy recognizes that:\n\n1. Not all countries have copyright registration systems.\n2. The benefits of registration vary between countries.\n3. Registration might be worthwhile only in countries where the author is likely to bring a suit.\n\nOption A is insufficient as it doesn't account for international protection.

In this case, the seller's agent is claiming that the earnest money was not paid, so they must provide evidence to support this claim. The buyer is not obligated to prove payment, especially when all parties previously agreed that the earnest money was paid and the closing documents confirm this. Options A and B incorrectly place the burden of proof on the buyer. Option D is incorrect because ignoring a lawsuit is generally not advisable, and the statute of limitations may vary by jurisdiction. The most accurate response is C, as it correctly identifies that the seller's agent (the plaintiff) must provide evidence to support their claim of non-payment."

When I reached out to the company they said that the store owners are allowed to refuse service \\& that they forwarded this information to the area supervisor. \n\nHowever, what I find most upsetting about this is that the company itself seems to be supporting the owner and her abusive behavior in this way, not that I necessarily want to go back to the store.\n\nI'm in California.

According to the documentation, a store owner has the right to ban any person from their store, as long as it's not for reasons prohibited by anti-discrimination laws. The company headquarters, while they may have some control over the franchise through their contract, are not legally obligated to intervene in the store owner's decision to ban a customer. The customer's options are limited, as the verbal abuse witnessed is unlikely to be treated as a crime based solely on a customer report.

With such cameras, the operator will typically be a controller, since they determine the purposes for which this camera is used. In this scenario, the operators \u2013 as part of their responsibility to conduct the data processing activity in a GDPR\\-compliant manner \u2013 had disabled any cloud features provided by the camera manufacturer.\n\nDespite this configuration, the camera manufacturer collected thumbnails and uploaded them to servers under their control.\n\nSo, we likely have two distinct issues at hand:\n\n* the camera manufacturer misled its customers about the privacy settings of the cameras. This is not necessarily a GDPR issue by itself.\n* the manufacturer performed data processing activities in contravention of various aspects of the GDPR.\n\nRelevant aspects of the GDPR that might have been violated:\n\n* the manufacturer did not have an Art 6 GDPR legal basis for this processing activity, such as a \u201clegitimate interest\u201d\n* the manufacturer did not provide information per Art 13 GDPR to the people being monitored this way\n* even if the cloud\\-based thumbnail processing were intended, this could be a violation against the Art 25 obligation to ensure \u201cdata protection by design and by default\u201d\n* depending on how the cloud storage services were configured, there might be violations against the Art 28 responsibility to contractually bind such vendors as data processors, or against the Chapter V rules on international data transfers\n\nDifferent actors might have different remedies against this violations:\n\n* buyers of the camera might have remedies under consumer protection and product liability laws against the manufacturer\n* data subjects of the illegal processing activity have remedies under the GDPR\n\t+ they can exercise their data subject rights against the data controllers, such as erasure of the thumbnails. However, this will be difficult to exercise in practice since the manufacturer will not have identifying information, and would then be free from having to fulfil certain data subject requests per Art 11 GDPR.\n\t+ they can lodge a complaint with a responsible supervisory authority, which would be the data protection agency in their EU/EEA member state (or the ICO in the UK). The EDPS is irrelevant here, since it is only the internal supervision authority for EU institutions. The competent supervisory authorities can levy fines.\n\t+ they can sue the data controllers, both for compliance (e.g. deleting unauthorized thumbnails) and for damages, if any were suffered. However, immaterial damages awarded for GDPR violations are typically fairly low, if they are recognized by the court at all.\n\t+ the right to judicial remedy (sue the controllers in court) and to lodge a complaint are independent. They largely pursue different remedies. Both can be used to seek compliance, but only supervisory authorities can impose fines, and only direct lawsuits by the data subjects can seek damages.",

There are regulations related to health information (HIPAA), to educational records, to tax information, to census information, credit reporting agencies, and to banking records (as well, of course, as to national security information). There are also largely consistent restrictions at the state level related to the juvenile justice process.\n\nBut data privacy is not a subject of general regulation in the U.S.\n\nInstead, the data privacy regulations of the U.S. consist of a patchwork of fragmentary state and federal laws and regulations, superimposed on a significant and not entirely consistent or well developed body of common law precedents such as the privacy torts set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which some states have adopted fully, some states have rejected almost completely, and some states have adopted in part or with significant modifications.\n\nThe U.S. Constitutional law of the First Amendment also heavily colors how other legal limitations and authorizations are construed and drafted, because the right to distribute truthful information without restriction has long been considered one of the core protections of the First Amendment, even in the much less vigorously protected area of commercial speech.\n\nSome states have more general regulations, and the most important of these is California, both because it is a large and economically significant state, and because it is the home to many of the leading U.S. technology companies, many of which expressly adopt of the law of the State of California in choice of law clauses in their terms of service and contracts.\n\nThe California law most similar to the GDPR is the [California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5) (CCPA) which gives consumers rights with respect to the use of the personal information that businesses collect about them and the [CCPA regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=IEB210D8CA2114665A08AF8443F0245AD&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) that provide guidance on how to implement the law.

While the First Amendment influences how privacy laws are interpreted, it does not provide comprehensive data privacy protections (ruling out D). \n\nThe correct statement is that the U.S. relies on a patchwork of federal and state laws for data privacy regulation. The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is indeed the most significant state-level regulation, both due to California's economic importance and its influence as home to many major tech companies. This fragmented approach, combining limited federal laws, state regulations, and common law precedents, accurately describes the current state of data privacy regulation in the United States."

Thus CNN's phrasing \"an apparent mishap\" seems bizarre to me: Jones's attorney was just obeying the law.\n\n**Question**: Was Alex Jones's attorney handing over phone\\-record evidence a \"mishap\" or required by law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Was Alex Jones's attorney handing over phone\\-record evidence a \"mishap\" or required by law?\n\n1. The discovery phase, *which concluded before the trial began*, required Alex Jones to provide texts and emails mentioning Sandy Hook (among other things). He did not provide any and testified in writing and in court he could find none.\n2. On August 3rd 2022, day seven of the trial, plaintiffs' attorney Mark Bankston claimed he had obtained from Jones's attorneys a digital copy of Jones's cellphone on which there were texts and emails that mentioned Sandy Hook. He said this copy was mistakenly provided to him. Whether accidental or deliberate, this copy or *its texts and emails mentioning Sandy Hook were not provided during discovery*. Judge Gamble told the jury about the digital copy, \"we don't know whether it was on accident or on purpose... but what we do know is that it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been.\" [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=7658](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=7658)\n\nA video clip of the part of the hearing in question, when Bankston begins asking Jones about the texts. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=tpnSCIak5A8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpnSCIak5A8). Or this timestamp in a longer clip [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=6821](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=6821).\n\nMark Bankston for the plaintiffs, addressing Jones:\n\n\"Your attorneys messed up and sent me a digital copy of your entire cellphone, with every text message you sent for the past two years. And, when informed, did not take any steps to identify it as privileged or protected in any way, and as of two days ago it fell free and clear into my possession. And that is how I know you lied to me when you said you didn't have text messages about Sandy Hook.\"\n\nThe above quote begins 5mins into the first clip or this timestamp in the longer clip [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=6830](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=6830)).\n\nAfter the texts, Bankston asked questions about emails not being turned over... Jones had sworn he didn't even use email. Bankston showed him emails that appeared to be written by Jones. \"I must have dictated them\" said Jones.\n\nJudge Gamble told the jury about the digital copy, \"we don't know it was on accident or on purpose, but what we do know is it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been.\" [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=7665](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=7665)\n\n[Bankston told journalist Dan Solomon the phone copy was put in a Dropbox the parties were using to exchange materials](https://nitter.net/dansolomon/status/1554900413702443016#m). Bankston did not believe it was put there deliberately and notified Jones's attorneys. Apparently Jones's attorneys did not respond. [Under Texas law they had ten days to assert privilege or say the material was put there by mistake, Rule 193\\.3(d)](https://www.stcl.edu/lib/TexasRulesProject/TRCP186-193/rule193-3Nov1999.htm) \\- as of August 3rd Bankston was legally free to read and use the material.\n\n(There is some gossip online about what was supposedly heard on 'hot mic' between Reynal and Bankston, I haven't heard it myself and have no timestamps or clips. I do think I heard Jones, after leaving the witness box, ask Reynal [\"they got my text messages?\"](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=8352))\n\n\\[edit]\n\nIncidentally, [this isn't the first time that Jones / his attorneys failed to comply with discovery orders in relation to these Sandy Hook cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Jones#Sandy_Hook_school_shooting) \\- a number of sanctions and default judgements have gone against him for that.\n\nIndeed this damages phase is the result of [the default judgment against him in September 2021 for failing to comply with discovery](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21074090-pozner-judgment):\n\n\"The Court find that Defendants unreasonably and vexatiously failed to comply with their discovery duties. The Court finds that Defendants' failure to comply with discovery in this case is greatly aggravated by Defendants' consistent pattern of discovery abuse throughout the other similar cases pending before this Court.\"\n\n\\[edit 2]\n\n**On August 4th 2022 Jones's attorneys have filed an emergency motion that seems to settle the issue of whether the provision of all the material was a \"mishap\": they say it was \"inadvertently\" supplied.**\n\n[text of the motion](https://www.scribd.com/document/585555024/Alex-Jones-Emergency-Petition)\n\nThey claim they promptly informed plaintiffs' attorneys about the mistake but the latter used the material anyway in violation of privilege, procedure and the court's protective order. Now Twitter lawyers are arguing about whether the language used by the defence was adequate to engage the rules mentioned above.\n\nBut this doesn't seem to resolve the issue of why the material demanded for discovery was not supplied for discovery or why Jones testifed he could not find such material.\n\nJudge Gamble denied the request for a blanket protective order to seal the record of the text messages and denied the motion for mistrial.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the Alex Jones Sandy Hook trial, his attorney inadvertently sent two years of Jones' cell phone records to the plaintiffs' attorney. Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of this situation?\n\nA) The plaintiffs' attorney was required to immediately delete the records upon receiving them, as they were protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nB) The defense attorney fulfilled their discovery obligations by sending these records, even if it was unintentional.\n\nC) The plaintiffs' attorney was legally permitted to use the records after a 10-day period, during which the defense did not assert privilege or claim mistake.\n\nD) The judge ruled that the records were inadmissible as evidence because they were obtained through an accidental disclosure.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to Texas law (Rule 193.3(d)), when the defense attorney inadvertently sent the phone records, they had 10 days to assert privilege or claim the material was sent by mistake. The plaintiffs' attorney, Mark Bankston, notified Jones' attorneys about receiving the records, but they apparently did not respond. After the 10-day period, Bankston was legally free to read and use the material in court.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the records were not automatically protected by attorney-client privilege, and the plaintiffs' attorney was not required to delete them immediately.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the defense had failed to provide these records during the actual discovery phase, which had concluded before the trial began. The inadvertent sending of records during the trial does not fulfill previous discovery obligations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the judge did not rule the records inadmissible. In fact, Judge Gamble allowed the use of the records and denied the defense's emergency motion for a protective order to seal the record of the text messages."

In this case, the party making the payment is a \"decentralized autonomous organization\".\n\nCreation of \"new property\" should only apply when the \"creator\" owns the raw materials. For example, when a oil company owns the mineral rights and simply transforms the oil from a state of buried to a state of being in a barrel, such an activity is not taxable.\n\nHowever, if an oil company is rendering a drilling service for the owner of the mineral rights, and gets paid not in fiat cash at the end of the month, but in barrels of oil immediately upon extraction, then the oil company's revenue is the market value of the oil at the moment of extraction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is cryptocurrency mining/staking profits \"newly created property\"? I think that Crypto profits from staking/mining should be treated as payment received for performance of a service, i.e. assembling a new block.\n\nYour rationale mistakenly conflates two modalities of profit, one of which certainly constitutes newly created property.\n\nMining/staking profits have two components: (1\\) \\[crypto\\-]coins (whether fractional or not) which are new insofar as they did not exist before, and (2\\) transaction fees (in terms of the cryptocurrency) each payer determines in a competition for a timely processing of his transaction. Only the second component fits the notion of *service*, which [Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines as \"*\\[t]he being employed **to serve another**; duty or labor to be rendered by one person **to another**, the former being bound to submit his will to the direction and control of **the latter**.*\" (emphasis added). In other words, a service involves a party and a counterparty.\n\nThe first component is not cognizable as \"service\" because there is no reasonable way to attach to a counterparty the act and outcome of mining/staking (that is, other than processing the specific transaction the anonymous/pseudonymous payer submitted). Indeed, the additional coins pursuant to the first component are not traceable to other's balance. The scheduled existence of additional coins pursuant to the first component does not change the fact that these coins come out of nowhere. Hence these coins are newly created.\n\nIt is in this sense that [Jarrett's pleadings](https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IRS-Tax-Litigation.pdf) (paragraph 35\\) cite from [*Eisner v. Macomber*, 252 U.S. 189, 207 (1920\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/1920441252us1891420) the language \"*coming in*\". However, *Macomber* seems largely unavailing to Jarrett's claim because *Macomber* addresses whether \"*a true stock dividend made lawfully and in good faith*\" is taxable. For that purpose, the court delves in \"*the nature of a corporation and the stockholder's relation to it*\", a framework that is foreign to the cryptominer's/staker's relation to a quite abstract \"entity\" such as a cryptocurrency protocol.\n\n> In this case, the party making the payment is a \"decentralized autonomous organization\".\n\nThat is inaccurate in regard to the first component of profit because there is no such entity or organization in the first place. Simply put, one cannot file suit against \"Bitcoin\" or against \"the blockchain\", just like it would make no sense to file suit against the US dollar or against abstract entities such as a \"decentralized economy\". The economy does not pay the agent. Other agents acting in that economy do, but that brings us back to the second component of miners' profit.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the nature of cryptocurrency mining/staking profits according to the explanation given?\n\nA) All cryptocurrency mining/staking profits should be treated as payment for services rendered to a decentralized autonomous organization.\n\nB) Cryptocurrency mining/staking profits are entirely composed of newly created property that did not exist before.\n\nC) Cryptocurrency mining/staking profits consist of two components: newly created coins and transaction fees, with only the latter being considered as payment for services.\n\nD) Cryptocurrency mining/staking profits are analogous to stock dividends and should be treated similarly for tax purposes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the explanation distinguishes between two components of cryptocurrency mining/staking profits:\n\n1. Newly created coins that did not exist before and are not traceable to any other party's balance. This component is considered newly created property.\n\n2. Transaction fees paid by users for processing their transactions. This component can be considered as payment for services.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it doesn't acknowledge the newly created property aspect. Answer B is incorrect as it ignores the transaction fees component. Answer D is incorrect because while the explanation mentions the Eisner v. Macomber case regarding stock dividends, it explicitly states that this framework is not applicable to cryptocurrency mining/staking."
