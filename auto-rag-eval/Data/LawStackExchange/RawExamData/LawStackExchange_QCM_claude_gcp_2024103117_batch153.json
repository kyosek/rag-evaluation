This question is intentionally on Law.SE instead of Politics.SE as the focus is intended to be on law rather than political viability.\n\nAs an example of a similar case, consider Roy Moore, who in 2001 was elected as Alabama's 27th Chief Justice, removed from office in 2003, was again elected chief justice in 2013, again forced out, then won a Republican primary for Senate in a heavily Republican state, earning Trump's endorsement, and is again a candidate for the US Senate. \n\nAs a closely related question, does impeachment by the House of Representatives, with or without subsequent removal from office by the Senate, actually disqualify one from being re\\-appointed as Vice President or elsewhere early in the line of succession, and re\\-reaching the same Presidential office by resignations or otherwise? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Impeachment of a president does not on conviction automatically disqualify the convicted party from becoming president again. However, after conviction, the Senate can vote to add to the punishment of removal from office \"disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States.\" This requires only [a simple majority vote](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-2/49-judgment-removal-and-disqualification.html).\n\n> Does impeachment by the House of Representatives, with or without subsequent removal from office by the Senate, actually disqualify one from being re\\-elected to the same Presidential office?\n\nSee above. It requires impeachment by the House, conviction by the Senate, and a separate vote by the Senate to impose the punishment of disqualification.\n\nIt's conceivable that the Senate could disqualify the convicted party only from becoming president, though it looks like in the two prior instances where this punishment was imposed it was the broader disqualification. But if a person disqualified only from being president is in an office that would normally be in the line of succession, that person is simply omitted from the line of succession.

The LLC owns property. The value of the property is essentially the entire value of the company. Is the individual's ownership of the company considered \"real property\" or \"personal property\"? Or something else?\n\n**Edited for context**\n\nI'm named as executor in a will for a close relative who passed away suddenly. The decedent was sole proprietor of two closely held companies. One was a small business (\"INC\") doing actual work, with customers, suppliers, revenue, phones, and all. The other business (\"LLC\") owns the commercial building, in which the first business was one tenant, and just collects rents, and maintains the property. The property was heavily mortgaged but self\\-sustaining.\n\nOne doc the probate attorney sent me says I will bind myself (\"Bond of legal representative of surety\") to discharge faithfully the duties as executor. This bond amount is twice the market value of the property held by the LLC, ignoring mortgage and debt, so it's millions of dollars. Um, yikes?!? \n\nPer Google, the state says the bond must be 200% of the value of personal property, excluding real property.\n\nObviously, I'll get a real opinion from an attorney whom the estate pays, and who knows the details. \n\nBut in the meantime I'm curious \\-\\- if you own a company that's little but a shell around real property, is equity in the company itself real property or personal property? Or neither?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think it's personal property.\n\nHere's why.\n\nI think the purpose of the bond is to protect the estate from malfeasance of the executor. I.e., to deter an unscrupulous executor from transferring the personal property of the decedent out of the estate at below market value and, thus, inequitably damaging the value of the estate. The bond gives the estate equitable recourse. The estate's remedy is to enforce a potential judgment by collecting against the bond.\n\nSo, in this case, in theory, because the executor *might* have the power to transfer *ownership* of the LLC (or its *equitable interest*, hat tip: @Scott) to a third party at below market value (subject to the Operating Agreement; but then, who would complain anyway against an inappropriate sale of membership interest, if not the estate?), the state will require a bond to ensure the estate is protected against potential malfeasance by the executor.\n\nI believe the reason for excluding real property from the bond requirement is because in order to clear title, the probate judge must specifically approve the sale of any real estate. At which time s/he will withhold her approval if the sale price is out\\-of\\-line with market.\n\nOne can imagine this is done as a practical matter. In other words, it would be impractical to have the judge personally approve the sale of lots of low\\-value items (personal property). But more practical to have the judge approve the sale of a few high\\-value items (real property).\n\nBut, as above described, if the sale could circumvent the probate court (as in the case of an LLC membership interest) then the sale should be required to be covered by the bond.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an attorney.

As the executor of the estate, you are required to post a bond. The state law requires a bond of 200% of the value of personal property, excluding real property. How would the ownership interest in this LLC likely be classified for the purpose of determining the bond amount?\n\nA) As real property, because the LLC's primary asset is real estate\nB) As personal property, because ownership in an LLC is considered an intangible asset\nC) As neither personal nor real property, because it's a business entity\nD) As both real and personal property, split based on the LLC's asset composition\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The ownership interest in the LLC would likely be classified as personal property for the purpose of determining the bond amount. Even though the LLC's primary asset is real estate (the commercial building), the individual's ownership is in the LLC itself, not directly in the real estate. Ownership interest in an LLC is generally considered an intangible asset and thus personal property.\n\nThe bond requirement is designed to protect the estate from potential mismanagement or misconduct by the executor. Since the executor could potentially transfer or sell the LLC ownership at below market value without direct court oversight (unlike the sale of real property directly owned by the estate), the state would likely require the bond to cover the full value of the LLC ownership as personal property.\n\nThis classification aligns with the purpose of the bond, which is to provide protection for assets that the executor could potentially mishandle without direct court supervision. It also reflects the legal distinction between owning an LLC (which is personal property) and directly owning real estate (which would be real property)."}, "2": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67882/filing-civil-complaints-at-the-last-minute", "docs_id": 67882, "title": "Filing Civil Complaints at the Last Minute", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I started working for a personal injury firm a few months ago and am responsible for filing civil lawsuits with the court.\n\nIn most cases, we filed them right before the statute of limitations is about to run out.\n\nIs this a typical practice?

Can a law firm submit a corrected complaint and still have it\n> be accepted even though time has run out?\n\nThis depends on what you mean by \"rejected\":\n\n1. If you mean that judgment was issued in favour of the defendant then under the principle of [res judicata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_judicata) you will not be able to file a \"corrected\" complaint relating to the same cause of action. This is the case regardless of whether or not the limitation period hass expired. You would need to use the usual remedies available to a losing party (e.g. appeal, setting aside, varying, etc.). You may find it challenging to introduce new arguments at appeal which could have been raised in the first instance case but were not.\n2. If you mean that you made some procedural error in relation to the claim, then it will depend on which [rule of court](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules) you contravened. Some rules permit the court to exercise its discretion while others do not. If the court has invalidated your claim without allowing you to fix the error then you will only be able to bring a fresh claim if you are still within the limitation period. A claim is \"brought\" when a request for the issue of a claim form is delivered to the correct court office during its opening hours (Barnes v St Helens MBC \\[2006] EWCA Civ 1372\\).\n3. If you mean that you have become aware that your statement of case contains errors or other content that you would like to change, then you can try to have it amended. If you have not yet served it on the other party then you can do so without the court's permission ([CPR 17\\.1(1\\)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.1). If you have already served it then you will need either the other party's consent or the permission of the court ([CPR 17\\.1(2\\)](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.1)). [CPR 17\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part17#17.4) provides that where a party applies to amend a statement of case and a limitation period has expired, \"*the court may allow an amendment whose effect will be to add or substitute a new claim, but only if the new claim arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a claim in respect of which the party applying for permission has already claimed a remedy in the proceedings.*\" Other rules apply in the case of changing the name of a party or altering the capacity in which the party brings the claim (CPR 17\\.4(3\\) and (4\\), [19\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part19#19.4), and [19\\.5](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part19#19.5)).\n\nMore generally, bringing a claim at the last minute can have some disadvantages. If you are seeking interest on a money claim, the court may be reluctant to award it at the rate and for the period that you would have hoped for if it is not the defendant's fault that you delayed. There could also be cost implications based on your conduct before the proceedings ([CPR 44\\.4](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part-44-general-rules-about-costs#rule44.4)).\n\nThe court will generally take a dim view of \"tactical\" use of a limitation period if doing so goes against the court's overriding objective and the duty of the parties to further that objective ([CPR 1\\.1](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part01#1.1) and [1\\.3](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/part01#1.3)). There can also be cost implications if you have issued a last\\-minute claim without observing the [practice direction on pre\\-action conduct and protocols](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct). However this last point can be fixed by issuing the claim in time and then applying to court for a stay of proceedings while you comply with the pre\\-action PD ([Pre\\-action PD paragraph 17](https://www.justice.gov.uk/courts/procedure-rules/civil/rules/pd_pre-action_conduct#17.1)).\n\nAlso, for some causes of action, the speed at which you bring a claim may be a factor in your chances of success.

My understanding is that for first offences, it's possible that a mandatory session with a therapist or psychologist may be appointed. The student then has to have at least one session with the therapist before any other action is taken towards making a judgement call on the student's acts.\n\nUnder what circumstances is this common, and what roles of the law or court system actually handle this kind of processing and interfacing with the therapist and offender?\n\nThe U.S. system is the law system I'm focused on, specifically with respect to high schools (if that helps).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Usually what would happen would be that the charge would be referred to juvenile court following the arrest of the juvenile or issuance of a citation to the juvenile for that offense by law enforcement. The juvenile court (or the juvenile division of some other court) would then have discretion to impose a variety of sentences if it found that the juvenile was guilty or if there was a plea bargain (plea bargains would typically resolve 85%\\+ of cases).\n\nThe default sentence would typically be a modest fine and/or a brief period of incarceration in a juvenile facility.\n\nBut, the juvenile court, often as part of a plea bargain proposed by the juvenile's counsel could call (sometimes with the required approval of the prosecutor) for a \"deferred judgment\" in which the case would be dismissed as if it had never happened if certain conditions were met, or probation subject to conditions including attendance at therapy, in lieu of a fine and/or period of incarceration. The resolution you describe in your question sounds more like a deferred judgment than a probation sentence, although the differences are subtle.\n\nInstead of therapy, another possibility would be community service, typically as a probation condition.\n\nTherapy or a deferred judgment, in general, wouldn't typically be limited as a matter of law to first offenses, and would be guaranteed as a remedy in any particular case. It would simply be a common resolution in some particular juvenile courts with a particular set of judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys.\n\nIn practice, often this kind of resolution (i.e. a deferred judgment conditioned on attending therapy or alcoholics anonymous or both) would be proposed by a private lawyer hired by the juvenile's parents who would offer to pay for the therapy at their own expense. \n\nA public defender for an indigent juvenile would often not have the time to arrange the therapy setup and would not have a client with the means to pay for it, so a fine and/or incarceration sentences and/or community service would be a more likely sentence for an indigent (i.e. poor) juvenile.\n\nStill, a lot depends upon the attitude of the prosecutor and judge. Some prosecutors and judges might be inclined to take a hard line (this is particularly common in minority neighborhoods and in a case where a juvenile had many prior offenses); others might be inclined towards leniency and seeing a prospect for rehabilitation (particularly for a white or Asian defendant from a middle class family without many prior offenses). Similarly, boys would be more likely to receive a more severe sentence, while girls would be more likely to receive some leniency.

The disposition of a Minor in Possession charge for a first-time high school offender is not predetermined by law. Instead, it depends on various factors, including the judge's discretion, the prosecutor's willingness to negotiate, the defense attorney's ability to propose alternative resolutions (like therapy or deferred judgment), and the defendant's background (including factors like race, socioeconomic status, and prior offenses). While therapy sessions or deferred judgments are possible outcomes, they are not mandatory or guaranteed for first-time offenders.

Users would register accounts, and having registered accounts they would be able to play the game in question against other registered users. They would also be able to post messages to each other.\n\nThis would be a free service and would be run by me as a hobby. It would not be a for\\-profit enterprise.\n\nIt is clear that such a web app would be subject to various provisions of the GDPR, as I would be gathering some identifying or personal information about users:\n\n* Users registering would be required to supply a pseudonymous username to identify themselves. This will typically be personally identifying information, since it is commonplace for people to consistently use a chosen pseudonym/handle across their online presence.\n* Users may post messages to one another. The contents of these messages cannot be guaranteed not to include personal information volunteered by the user, so pessimistically they must be presumed to all be (in their entirety) personally identifying information.\n\nThe GDPR provides that data subjects (in this case, the users of the web app) have a \"right to be forgotten\". This means that the user can contact the data controller (me) and demand that their data be deleted. It is my understanding that they can do this via any reasonable medium; for example, they could send me an email or they could post a message on the site itself, in a place where they could expect the demand to be seen and responded to. I daresay that the moment they make such a post, I am in receipt of the demand and legally required to act on it. \"Acting on it\" in this specific case would probably entail deleting all messages posted by the user, and anonymizing the user's username on the site.\n\nWhat happens if the following chain of events occurs:\n\n1. A user registers to the site, using the pseudonym \"Bob\".\n2. Bob engages in various activities on the site, causing personal information to be stored in the site's database.\n3. I make a routine backup of the site's database. This includes Bob's data from step 2\\.\n4. I go to bed.\n5. Bob posts on the site, demanding that their data be deleted under the terms of the GDPR's \"right to be forgotten\".\n6. The site's database fails catastrophically and all of the data in the live system is irrevocably lost (or it is in any case put beyond my technical capacity to repair it).\n7. I get up.\n8. I notice that the site is down and that the database has been trashed.\n9. I restore the site's database, allowing it to resume operation. Bob's activity from step 2 is restored, but his demand to be forgotten from step 5 is not restored, because it occurred after the database was backed up and I am not aware of it.\n10. Two months later, Bob notices that his data remains on the site, but that I appear to have deleted his demand that I delete that data.\n11. Bob complains about me to some statutory body or other that has a remit to handle such complaints.\n\nBob's action at step 5 creates an obligation on my part to delete all of Bob's data. Per other questions on this site (for example [this one](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/66794/the-scope-of-gdpr-and-the-right-to-be-forgotten)), I do not necessarily have an obligation to delete Bob's data from the backup that was created at step 3; however I do have an obligation to ensure that Bob's data is put beyond use should such a backup be restored to the live system. I have failed to act on that obligation. What potential consequences exist?\n\nI would like to reiterate at this point that I am a \"one\\-man band\", with some technical expertise but no legal expertise whatsoever.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> The GDPR provides that data subjects (in this case, the users of the web app) have a \"right to be forgotten\". This means that the user can contact the data controller (me) and demand that their data be deleted.\n\nMore or less, but there are some details. In my view the term \"right to be forgotten\" is unfortunate, because it raises expectations that the GDPR does not fulfill. What there is, is a right to have personal data (PD) deleted or anonymized, but there are a number of exceptions where the right does not apply.\n\nThe right to deletion is provided for in [GDPR Article 17](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-17-gdpr/). (Recitals 65 and 66 are also relevant.) There are six points in Article 17(1\\), and only when at least one of them applies is deletion (erasure) requited. Probably the most common in the sort of situation described in the question is: 17(1\\)(b) which reads:\n\n> the data subject \\[user] withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of Article 6(1\\), or point (a) of Article 9(2\\), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;\n\nBut note that point (b) applies only when \"there is no other legal ground for the processing\". Points (a), (c), or (e) might well also be relevant in the situation described in the question.\n\nHowever, Article 17(3\\) lists five exceptions (points (a) to (e)). If any of these apply, the Data Controller (DC) is not required to delete the data as requested by the DS. Particularly relevant may be point (a) of Article 17(3\\), which reads:\n\n> for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;\n\nWhere a message posted to the site is part of a public exchange of messages, and removing it would render the messages of others unclear so that their expression is hindered, this point may apply and deletion may not be required.\n\nNow to come to the specific situation in the question.\n\nThe result of the chain of events is that Bob has made a request for erasure, but through no intent of anyone's that request was lost and the DC never received it. To Bob it may seem as if it was intentionally ignored.\n\nIf the DC posts an announcement on the site that posts between Time X and Time Y may have been lost, Bob may well see it and know that a re\\-send of the article 17 request would be needed.\n\nBob would in any case be well advised to send a follow\\-up request/demand. If Bob does this the DC will presumably comply, or if an exception applies, tell Bob of the exception, including any needed supporting information. Problem solved.\n\nBut Bob may not make a 2nd request. If Bob complains to a Data Protection Authority (DPA) the DPA may forward this to the DC. In which case the DC will presumably respond that there is no record of the request having been made, and treat it as a new request. If the DPA is at all reasonable, and there is no indication that this DC is in the habit of ignoring Article 17 requests, that may well end the matter. If Bob provides the exact timestamp of his article 7 request, the DC may be able to trace the DB crash and restoration, which should settle the matter.\n\n> Bob's action at step 5 creates an obligation on my part to delete all of Bob's data.\n\nThat is stating the matter overly strongly. My understanding ism that if Bob has included personal information in forum posts or other public posts to the site, and others have then quoted this, the DC has no obligation to edit other people's posts to remove info about Bob. Aside from that, various exceptions may apply, described in Article 17(3\\). If one does apply, the DC has no such obligation. But in any case the DC should acknowledge the request (once the DC learns of it) and if the DC thinks an exception applies, should notify Bob of the exception and why it applies.\n\nIt is not yet clear to what extent the DC is obliged to remove Bob's info from stored backups, or to somehow ensure that if a backup is restored, Bob's data is not restored with it, or else is promptly removed again. Bob's obligation does not extend to cases where unreasonable time and effort would be required, considering the nature of the data involved.\n\nI cannot speak to how reasonable or unreasonable the DPA might be. My understanding is that individual complaints against non\\-commercial sites are not usually a high priority at DPAs, but that may not always be correct. If things get to that point, the DC may well want to consult a lawyer with expertise in such matters.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A hobby website owner, operating under GDPR regulations, faces a situation where a user named Bob requests data deletion, but due to a database crash and subsequent restoration from backup, the deletion request is lost.

But note that you can't just add such license terms.\n\n\t+ Either, the license is still the LGPL with some extra terms. But then, the terms of the LGPLv3 allow recipients to remove the additional restrictions.\n\t+ Or, this is an entirely separate license. But then it would no longer be the LGPL, and no longer be an Open Source license.Whether such additional terms create a separate license or can be removed from the license is currently being litigated in the US in the context of the Neo4J database, which added the \"Commons Clause\" restrictions to the AGPLv3\\.

This is sometimes known as an \u201copen core\u201d business model.\n\nDue to the limited copyleft effect of the LGPL, you can still combine the proprietary parts and the LGPL\\-covered parts into a single program, but doing so may be confusing for users. It should be absolutely clear which parts are LGPL\\-covered, and which are your proprietary parts that cannot be modified. However, you would not be able to prevent recipients from using the LGPL\\-covered parts without your proprietary components, i.e. they would always be able to remove any licensing checks etc.\n\nMore generally, it could make sense to think about why you want to publish any part of the software as Open Source.

Likewise, the usual default is that rent and utility payments are pro\\-rated when a tenant leaves between due dates.

While Bob, as an exclusive licensee, has a primary claim against Carol (the infringer), he cannot typically sue independently. The case law indicates that the patent owner's presence is usually necessary in such lawsuits. If Alice refuses to join voluntarily, Bob can make her a party to the lawsuit as an involuntary plaintiff under Rule 19(a), as established in cases like Gentesix v.

Such a claim would depend on the specific terms of their licensing agreement.\n\nOption C is partially correct but overly restrictive.

This is unless of course I have no legal claim to accrued wages unpaid.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> What legal options do I have here?\n\nIt depends on how much you are owed. If it is less than $5000 (in a city court) you can sue them in small claims. If it is more than that, you'll have to sue them in a different court. \n\n> Do I have a claim to salary if I quit?\n\nYes, absolutely. You quitting does not relieve the business of its obligation to pay you for work you have already performed. In some states, they may also be required to pay you for accrued leave (sick/vacation time). You should not have to work for a company that does not pay you, we got rid of slavery a long time ago.\n\n> I'm nearly positive I would not have a claim to the 100% discretionary bonus.\n\nMaybe, maybe not. This depends on your contract and what you've been told. If you were told (in writing) that you would be given $X amount for a bonus for work performed in 2018, the bonus may no longer be discretionary because the company obligated themselves to pay it via a promise. Bonuses may be harder to argue in court, but if you have sufficient documentation that you were promised this bonus then you may have a claim to it. \n\nIf you do decide to go to court with this, gather up as much documentation as you can before quitting, print it out and save it to bring to court or to your lawyer. Make sure to get as much as possible, for example if it is an email, get the whole chain, as much of the headers as possible, etc. If you have voicemails, see if you can save them or record them for later. \n\n**Do not wait too long**, have a lawyer draft up a demand letter the moment you quit outlining exactly everything you are owed, including the bonus, vacation, sick days, etc. Deliver this via certified mail.

In fact, it applies only to them: The title of the section in question is \"Contributions and donations by foreign nationals,\" and the text of the section reflects that.\n\nA campaign contribution must be received by the campaign organization to be a campaign contribution, so there is the source of US jurisdiction: A foreign person, even one who has never [set foot in](https://archives.cjr.org/language_corner/missed_step.php) the US, can nonetheless be subject to US jurisdiction because of an act whose effects are felt in the US, regardless of where in the world the act was initiated.\n\nThe restrictions on \"electioneering communications\" are implicitly concerned with communications inside US territory, but (even ignoring that) they concern only \"broadcast, cable, or satellite\" communications, which implies that only audio and video communications are in scope.

Option B, purchasing airtime for ads supporting a candidate, would likely be considered a direct financial contribution to a campaign and falls under the \"electioneering communications\" provision, which specifically mentions \"broadcast, cable, or satellite\" communications. \n\nOption A (publishing leaked documents) is not explicitly covered by this law and may be protected under press freedoms.

In England and Wales, the communication between Person B and Lawyer B falls under legal professional privilege, specifically litigation privilege.

The duty of disclosure only starts once proceedings have officially commenced, and even then, privileged communications remain protected unless the client waives that privilege or a court orders disclosure.

Section 1(1\\) says that the only contracts concerning goods covered by the Act are those 'under which one person transfers or agrees to transfer to another the property in goods'. A lease doesn't transfer the cooker to you: it gives you exclusive possession of a dwelling containing the cooker.

The Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982 does not apply to leased property, as it doesn't involve transferring ownership of goods. The Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 specifically excludes appliances like cookers from the landlord's repair obligations.

Whether a law is criminalizing peaceful assembly or prohibiting unlawful violence is a question that depends on th wording of the law, and the way it is applied\n\nIn [the *De Jonge* opinion](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/299/353/) the Court wrote:\n\n> The broad reach of the statute as thus applied is plain. While defendant was a member of the Communist Party, that membership was not necessary to conviction on such a charge. A like fate might have attended any speaker, although not a member, who \"assisted in the conduct\" of the meeting. However innocuous the object of the meeting, however lawful the subjects and tenor of the addresses, however reasonable and timely the discussion, all those assisting in the conduct of the meeting would be subject to imprisonment as felons if the meeting were held by the Communist Party.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> While the States are entitled to protect themselves from the abuse of the privileges of our institutions through an attempted substitution of force and violence in the place of peaceful political action in order to effect revolutionary changes in government, none of our decisions goes to the length of sustaining such a curtailment of the right of free speech and assembly as the Oregon statute demands in its present application. In Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, under the New York statute defining criminal anarchy, the defendant was found to be responsible for a \"manifesto\" advocating the overthrow of the government by violence and unlawful means. Id. pp. 268 U. S. 656, 268 U. S. 662, 268 U. S. 663\\. In Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, under the California statute relating to criminal syndicalism, the defendant was found guilty of willfully and deliberately assisting in the forming of an organization for the purpose of carrying on a revolutionary class struggle by criminal methods ...\n> \n> \n> Freedom of speech and of the press are fundamental rights which are safeguarded by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. *Gitlow v.

This means that while states can regulate public gatherings, especially to prevent violence or unlawful actions, they must do so in a way that does not infringe on the constitutional right to peaceable assembly. \n\nOption A is incorrect because states do not have complete freedom in this area and must consider First Amendment protections. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the First Amendment's protections have been extended to limit state actions through the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\nOption D is too extreme, as states can regulate gatherings that are not peaceful or that involve unlawful actions.\n\nThe key is understanding the balance between state authority to maintain public order and the constitutional protection of peaceful assembly."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19733/can-a-business-charge-for-the-time-it-takes-the-business-to-cancel-a-service", "docs_id": 19733, "title": "Can a business charge for the time it takes the business to cancel a service?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A month\\-by\\-month security contract was severed in writing on the last day of the month of May.

In Washington state, it is legal to possess and purchase up to 28 grams of MJ. Suppose I purchase a legal amount in Washington, then travel to Florida (leaving my dope in Washington), but somehow Florida learns of my purchase in Washington. Is there case law (or any statute) whereby can't they prosecute me for committing an act that is illegal in Florida? It needn't be drugs.\n\nI know (or ought to know) that they don't \"have jurisdiction\": I am specifically looking for case law that officially establishes that in order for a government to have authority to prosecute an offense, the act had to have been committed within the geographical territory controlled by that government. Is there official law that expressly says this, or is this just part of the common historical understanding of \"jurisdiction\"? This need not be US law only.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In the specific example you have given, Florida law could not be applied. A state has jurisdiction over a crime under constitutional due process limits on the scope of a state's criminal jurisdiction if the crime is either committed within the state (regardless of where the harm occurs) or is directed at or impacts the state (the classic example is a gunshot fired from the Ohio side of the state line killing someone located in Indiana, which could be prosecuted in either state, or in both states as it doesn't violate double jeopardy to be prosecuted for the same offense by more than one sovereign). \n\nSometimes these issues are framed not as \"jurisdictional\" per se, but as \"conflict of law\" questions limited by the constitution. The proof that a crime was committed in the territory where it is applicable is called proof of *locus delecti* and depends upon the nature of the crime alleged and the location of the act or acts constituting it. To determine where a crime is committed depends on what acts constitute the crime, something that leaves considerable room for flexible interpretation and a careful reading of the exact wording of the relevant criminal statute. \n\nThe most important limitation on the territorial jurisdiction of a U.S. state is the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This applies directly in the case of federal criminal prosecutions in the federal courts, and applies in state courts because it is incorporated to apply in state court cases through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States under 20th century case law applying the \"Selective Incorporation doctrine.\"\n\nThe Sixth Amendment mandates that criminal trials be conducted \u201cby an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.\u201d \n\nIf a suspect is not present in a state to be criminally prosecuted, then the options available to a state are (1\\) to toll the running of the statute of limitations while the suspect is outside the state to the extent permitted by the relevant state statute and the U.S. Constitution, (2\\) to bring a civil lawsuit against the suspect instead of a criminal prosecution, or (3\\) to seek extradition of the suspect, which must be granted under certain circumstances under the United State Constitution and reads as follows in the pertinent part:\n\n> Article IV, Section 2, Clause 2:\n> \n> \n> A person charged in any state with treason, felony, or other crime,\n>  who shall flee from justice, and be found in another state, shall on\n>  demand of the executive authority of the state from which he fled, be\n>  delivered up, to be removed to the state having jurisdiction of the\n>  crime.\n\n(Note that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to civil lawsuits. Civil lawsuit trials can be conducted in a state other than the state where the breach of contract or tort giving rise to the lawsuit took place for jurisdictional purposes and not infrequently is brought in another state, although constitutional choice of law rules limit the circumstances under which a particular state's laws can be applied to a particular set of circumstances in a lawsuit.)\n\nThe Sixth Amendment, on its face, prohibits Florida from prosecuting a case in the example given in the question involving a crime that was committed solely in Washington State. \n\nOf course, the exact definition of the crime might determine where it was committed. In traditional \"common law\" \"blue collar\" crimes there is usually no ambiguity over where it is committed except in the most extraordinary circumstances, but in prosecutions of conspiracies and crimes involving economic activity (such as owning or mailing something), the question of where a crime is committed can grow much fuzzier.\n\nFor example, one could imagine a differently defined crime prohibiting providing funds to finance a purchase of marijuana in excess of 20 grams being committed both in Washington State and Florida at the same time (e.g. perhaps a purchase of marijuana in Washington State was financed by a Florida bank by delivering cash to a courier in Florida who is bound for Washington State knowing that the cash would be used to finance a marijuana purchase).\n\nSimilar ideas apply in international circumstances where the Sixth Amendment and Extradition Clause do not apply. But, in those cases, the more flexible and less well defined \"law of nations\" as interpreted by Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court and the President still does impose some territorial boundaries on prosecutions for actions which are not crimes in the country where they are committed under that country's domestic laws. But, those boundaries are not so hard and fast and the idea that a crime is committed in places where it has an impact allow for considerable flexibility in prosecuting crimes committed outside the United States.\n\nIt has also been well settled since the earliest days of the United States that \"The courts of no country execute the penal laws of another.\" *The Antelope*, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 66, 123 (U.S. Supreme Court 1825\\) and that this applies to states applying each other's penal laws as well. So, Florida cannot enforce a violation of the criminal laws of Washington State in its courts either. If you get in a bar fight in Seattle, you can't be prosecute for assault in a court in Orlando, even if both of the parties to the bar fight were Orlando residents and U.S. citizens.\n\nSome notable cases resolving the question of whether *locus delecti* is present in a particular case include the following: \n\nIn *Hyde v. United States*, 225 U.S. 347 (1912\\) although none of the defendants had entered the District of Columbia as part of their conspiracy to defraud the United States, they were convicted because one co\\-conspirator had committed overt acts in Columbia (225 U.S., at 363\\). So conspiracy is a continuing offense committed in all the districts where a co\\-conspirator acts on the agreement. \n\nSimilarly, *In re Palliser*, 136 U.S. 257 (1890\\) the sending of letters from New York to postmasters in Connecticut in an attempt to gain postage on credit, made Connecticut, where the mail he addressed and dispatched was received, an appropriate venue (136 U.S., at 266\u2014268\\).\n\nA typical state statute on the subject from Colorado's Revised Statutes (2016\\) is as follows:\n\n> \u00a7 18\\-1\\-201\\. State jurisdiction\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A person is subject to prosecution in this state for an offense\n>  which he commits, by his own conduct or that of another for which he\n>  is legally accountable, if: (a) The conduct constitutes an offense and\n>  is committed either wholly or partly within the state; or (b) The\n>  conduct outside the state constitutes an attempt, as defined by this\n>  code, to commit an offense within the state; or (c) The conduct\n>  outside the state constitutes a conspiracy to commit an offense within\n>  the state, and an act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs in the\n>  state; or (d) The conduct within the state constitutes an attempt,\n>  solicitation, or conspiracy to commit in another jurisdiction an\n>  offense prohibited under the laws of this state and such other\n>  jurisdiction. (2\\) An offense is committed partly within this state if\n>  conduct occurs in this state which is an element of an offense or if\n>  the result of conduct in this state is such an element. In homicide,\n>  the \"result\" is either the physical contact which causes death or the\n>  death itself; and if the body of a criminal homicide victim is found\n>  within the state, the death is presumed to have occurred within the\n>  state. (3\\) Whether an offender is in or outside of the state is\n>  immaterial to the commission of an offense based on an omission to\n>  perform a duty imposed by the law of this state.\n\nCase law under this statute sometimes describes the issue presented under this statute a question of \"sovereign jurisdiction.\" *See, e.g., People v. Cullen*, 695 P.2d 750 (Colo. App. 1984\\).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A resident of Florida travels to Washington state and legally purchases 25 grams of marijuana. They consume the marijuana entirely while in Washington, then return to Florida. Later, Florida authorities learn about the purchase and consumption that occurred in Washington. Under which circumstances could Florida potentially have jurisdiction to prosecute this individual?\n\nA) Florida can prosecute because the purchase exceeded 20 grams, which is illegal in Florida.\nB) Florida can prosecute if the individual discussed their plans to purchase marijuana while still in Florida.\nC) Florida cannot prosecute because the act occurred entirely within Washington state's jurisdiction.\nD) Florida can prosecute because the individual is a Florida resident, regardless of where the act occurred.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. Florida generally cannot prosecute for acts that occur entirely within another state's jurisdiction (eliminating options A and D). However, if the individual discussed plans to purchase marijuana while still in Florida, this could potentially be construed as part of a conspiracy or attempt to commit a crime, which Florida might have jurisdiction over under laws similar to the Colorado statute mentioned in the passage.

Prior to 2008, a 14 year old child could choose with which parent to live, unless the judge determined that the chosen parent is unfit.\n\nAs proving that a parent is unfit was not always easy, the Georgia General Assembly in 2008 replaced the unfit parent standard with a Best Interests of the Child Standard.

He convinces his 12-year-old nephew Tommy that the painting rightfully belongs to their family and was unfairly taken by the museum. John tells Tommy it would be a heroic act to retrieve it, and instructs him on how to bypass security. Tommy successfully takes the painting and brings it to John. Under common law principles, particularly as applied in the USA, how would John likely be treated legally in this situation?\n\nA) John would not be held criminally responsible since he didn't physically steal the painting himself.\nB) John would be charged with a lesser offense than theft, such as contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\nC) John would be charged with theft, treated as if he had committed the act himself.\nD) John would not be charged, but would be required to testify against Tommy in juvenile court.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Based on the principles of complicity in common law jurisdictions, particularly as exemplified by Ohio's statute, John would likely be charged with theft as if he had committed the act himself. The law generally treats causing an innocent or irresponsible person (like a child) to commit an offense as equivalent to committing the offense directly. John's actions in manipulating Tommy to commit the theft would fall under the concept of using an innocent agent, which does not absolve the mastermind of criminal responsibility. The penalty for such complicity is typically the same as for the underlying offense.

The intention is to ensure that trade in the EU is not distorted by government incentives, so that factories get built in the most efficient location rather than where a government offers the biggest subsidy.

The EU ruling was based on the principle that member states cannot provide selective tax advantages to specific companies, as this distorts fair competition within the EU.

In the event my brother passed first, it's obvious I would be the sole heir. However, if my parents pass first and their will was distributed to me and my brother and then my brother passed after them, can my parents add a clause to their will to deny his wife any part of the estate? If he had children, I'm sure they'd want it to go to them. However, if he didn't have children, can a clause be added to have it go back to me? She's entitled to 1/2 their accumulated assets during the marriage, but is there any way to deny her anything related to my parents' will?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In some jurisdictions, certain relatives cannot be disinherited without their consent (e.g. in community property states, your wife's right of inheritance is independent of any will). Daughter\\-in\\-law is not one of the statutorily\\-protected relations.

The hard part if for the testator to decide on / think about a hierarchy, such as \"Wife first; if wife dead, oldest female child; if oldest female child dead then children of oldest female child...\". Painful statements like \"Person X shall in no circumstance receive any portion of the estate\" indicates testator's intent, and following the testator's wishes (hence \"will\") is the basic principle of inheritance law. \n\nIt's certainly possible to write a will, especially if it is really simple.

The documentation indicates that wills can include conditions and hierarchies for asset distribution, such as specifying alternative beneficiaries in case of certain events (like a child's death).

The Lateran Treaty of 1929, between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy, said ([Article 7, paragraph 3](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html)):\n\n> In conformit\u00e0 alle norme del diritto internazionale, \u00e8 vietato agli aeromobili di qualsiasi specie di trasvolare sul territorio del Vaticano.\n\n> In accordance with the provisions of International Law, it is forbidden for aircraft of any kind whatsoever to fly over the territory of the Vatican.\n\nThe revision of 1984 did not preserve this provision (see [its Article 13(1\\)](http://home.lu.lv/%7Erbalodis/Baznicu%20tiesibas/Akti/Arvalstis_ligumi/Italijas&Sv.Kresla_konkordats.pdf)). The present situation is that Vatican airspace, managed by the Italian national authorities, is subject to flight restrictions preventing low\\-flying aircraft and drones. So you cannot legally buzz St Peter's Basilica in your helicopter, but you could fly at a higher altitude in the normal way. (The restrictions are for anything below 3500 feet, and for comparison St Peter's is about 450 feet tall.)\n\nThere are obvious exceptions for papal or other official travel, and Popes have used their own helicopters to travel in and out of the Vatican since 1976\\. Since 2015, the helipad has also been made available for emergency use by medical helicopters from a nearby children's hospital. That demonstrates the extent to which it is *not* available for routine travel. Therefore, I think that \"flying there for business purposes, flying domestically, or leaving the country by helicopter\" are all forbidden, unless you are the Pope or have his permission.\n\nYou also cannot land or take off in a fixed\\-wing aircraft, but that's largely a matter of geography, not law: there is no runway.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements about the Vatican City State's airspace regulations is most accurate?\n\nA) The Vatican has always allowed helicopters to fly freely within its airspace, with no restrictions.\n\nB) From 1929 to 1984, all aircraft were banned from flying over Vatican territory, but now only low-flying aircraft and drones are restricted.\n\nC) The Vatican currently bans all aircraft from its airspace, including papal helicopters and medical emergency flights.\n\nD) The Vatican has never had any airspace restrictions, relying solely on international aviation laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, the Vatican City State banned all aircraft from flying over its territory between 1929 and 1984, as stipulated in the Lateran Treaty. After 1984, this blanket ban was lifted. Currently, there are restrictions on low-flying aircraft and drones (below 3500 feet), but higher altitude flights are permitted.

I've been watching them for over 6\\-months, so first\\-and\\-foremost I'm a fan. But after having thought about this situation for a few days, I'm not entirely sure if the lawsuit is unfair. In H3H3 videos, they don't just show small clips or images from videos that they make fun of; they show almost the entire work of the targeted author's video but in the form of small clips. \n\nThe format is essentially: \n\n* Show a clip/segment of the other person's video\n* Pause said clip\n* Change scene from the reviewed video to H3H3 making commnetary on that particular clip/segment\n* Pick up where you left off on the video and show the next 5\\-10 seconds\n* Rinse and repeat\n\nFrom watching their videos, I'd estimate that H3H3 shows at least half of the other author's video more than 95% of the time.

Does it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Only a court can decide if use is fair.** As Dale stated, we will know whether it was or was not legally fair when a court decides, and it ceased to be appealed. Unfortunately, there is no formula. Remember that fair use is an exception to rules that make copyright infringement illegal, so it occupies a narrow space practically by definition.\n\nFortunately this was already decided\n------------------------------------\n\n*(yes, I recognize that this is an old question)*\n\nJudge Katherine B. Forrest [decided in favor of your favorite YouTuber](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4356997/116/hosseinzadeh-v-klein/):\n\n> The Court has held that the Klein video constitutes fair use, and further that the Klein video does not infringe plaintiff\u2019s copyrights.\n\nand further that:\n\n> But even if this Court held the Klein video is not fair use, the Court would still dismiss Claim II because defendants clearly had a subjective \u201cgood faith belief\u201d that their video did not infringe plaintiff\u2019s copyrights. Cf. Lenz, 815 F.3d at 1153\\.\n> It is undisputed that defendants understand the concept of fair use and have an\n> established practice for ensuring their videos make fair use of copyrighted material.\n\nBut that answer isn't entirely satisfying, is it? Let's get specific.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFair use seems to be something that ***should*** be clear to both parties: the copyright holders and the user of copyrighted content. While it is true that the percentage of original content may be of concern, there is no specific percentage nominated in Title 17 Chapter 1 Section 107 of the US Code.\n\n> In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include\u2014\n> (1\\) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n> (2\\) the nature of the copyrighted work;\n> (3\\) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\n> (4\\) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\n> The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.\n\nIt takes vigilance on the part of both parties to cohabit this narrow law. Fortunately, YouTube has [recently taken measures](https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2016/04/improving-content-id-for-creators.html) to ensure that use that ***should*** (presumably in their view) be judged as fair will remain live on their site while a dispute process is pursued. This procedure resolves cases outside of formal legal battles, which can be costly for both parties. However, YouTube has pledged to [pay legal fees](https://publicpolicy.googleblog.com/2015/11/a-step-toward-protecting-fair-use-on.html) of content providers that are sued for copyright infringement, in special circumstances (esp. when the use was fair, and when a claimant is abusing, again presumably as determined by some legal counsel at YouTube). They discuss similar matters in their [FAQ page](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2797449?hl=en&ref_topic=2778546).\n\n> Why did YouTube let an abusive claimant remove my video?\n> YouTube takes action to address cases of abuse and misuse in our copyright takedown processes. While we cannot comment on specific cases or our processes, we do look into abuse of our copyright tools and processes, and have a zero\\-tolerance policy for claimants we've deemed abusive. Misuse of the copyright process (for both takedowns and counter notifications) can result in termination of an account.\n\nAnd remember that courts love precedent\n---------------------------------------\n\n**Future cases will likely leverage the decisions made in the case you mention**. And while the following does not have any real legal value, you may find comfort in knowing: there are many YouTubers out there that heavily leverage others' content, and their videos are still up. Again this is not strictly speaking a precedent, but you can safely assume that in cases where a high\\-profile YouTuber (say CinemaSins, for instance) uses content from many content owners, and uses a great deal of it, they will likely have come up against claims of unfair use, and have emerged with an intact channel.

If there is no precedent, what would be the thought process to arrive at yes / no sorting of indispensable parties? Any suggestions to improve the question are appreciated.\n\nBonus Question:\n\nIf Harry illegally built a deck and then sold his condo unit to Sally, does Sally own the deck and have a responsibility to maintain the deck or is it the Association's responsibility?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### Multiple factors matter and the correct answer isn't always obvious\n\nWhich parties are necessary in an action related to HOAs is often a tricky question (even for smart judges trying to do the right thing) and I have seen cases where the trial court says one thing, an intermediate appellate court rules another way, and the state supreme court agrees with one or the other for reasons different than those given by any of the lower courts.\n\nFrom a litigant's perspective, the better choice is usually to err on joining too many people, which is almost harmless error if they aren't necessary parties, rather than to joint too few people (which can often lead to reversal of a case which may have been correctly decided on the merits).\n\nSome of the main factors are reviewed below.\n\n**What remedy is sought?**\n\nPart of the answer hinges upon the remedy being sought.\n\nIf the suing HOA member sues for a declaratory judgment that allowing this was improper and a prospectively enforceable injunction, the individual HOA members are probably not necessary parties. Is the person suing seeking an order to tear down the decks? To impose a fine? For some injury suffered by another HOA member in the form of reduced property values?\n\nOne bright line rule is that anyone against whom relief is sought, directly or indirectly, is generally a necessary party, so the nature of the claim brought and the relief sought are critical to evaluating who is a necessary party.\n\nIf the relief sought is to have a deck removed, the owner of the property served by that deck almost certainly has to be made a party.\n\nEven this rule has exceptions, however, in cases where a named defendant fairly represents the interests of the unnamed defendants in some cases.\n\nFor example, the beneficiaries of a trust owning a unit don't have to be named as parties if the trust is named as a party.\n\nRelief in the form of a money judgment against a defendant almost always requires that defendant to be joined as a party. Relief \"in rem\" limited to recovery involving a particular identified piece of property sometimes can proceed with fewer parties if notice by publication is given to potentially interested parties.\n\n**Who owns the common areas?**\n\nIn some HOAs, all members have a present, undivided tenants\\-in\\-common co\\-ownership interest in the common areas, while in others, the common areas are owned by the HOA and the members of the HOA don't have a property interest in the common areas.\n\nThis arcane and technical issue could be outcome determinative on a necessary parties question. If the common areas are owned as tenants\\-in\\-common, all members of the HOA may be necessary parties.\n\n**Who has permission to enforce covenant violations and is this a covenant violation?**\n\nWho has standing to complain about the failure of a homeowner to comply with the covenants in the governing documents?\n\nSome HOA governing documents limit this authority to the HOA only, others allow either the HOA or any HOA member to enforce covenant violations.\n\nIn other words, some HOA governing documents allow Bob to sue Sally directly, without even naming the HOA as a party, for some kinds of covenant violations. Others authorize only the HOA to sue Sally.\n\nBut if the problem is that the HOA approved something that it shouldn't have approved, it isn't necessary a covenant violation, even though it seems to be one on its face.\n\n**Statute of limitations issues**\n\nRelated to who can sue, is the issue of statute of limitations.\n\nIn Colorado, where I practice law, and in many other states, there is a short statute of limitations (one year) within which you can sue to assert that a completed structure is built in violation of HOA covenants, and sometimes what triggers the statute of limitations will be different for a claim brought be the association (which may run from the date of the violation or from when it had notice) and for a claim brought by a homeowner (which can run from the date that an HOA member has notice of the violation).\n\n**Have HOA members or the HOA done something actionably wrong?**\n\nA common scheme in HOA governing documents is that someone must seek permission from an architectural control committee to make some kind of improvement, and if the architectural control committee fails to act within a certain amount of time, the proposal is deemed approved, even if it clearly violates some HOA policy or covenant.\n\nIn those cases, there is no valid claim of anyone against the offending deck building HOA member, and there isn't necessarily a claim against the HOA for negligently failing to enforce its covenants either.\n\n**The nature of the claim governs whether it runs with the land.**\n\nSometimes the nature of the claim is that a particular owner at a particular time did something wrong for which they are responsible (e.g. allowed a dog off a leash that bit someone). Usually claims like that name only the owner who did something wrong.\n\nSometimes something related to whether the property can continue to be in the state it is will run with the land and apply to future owners, so will claims that are liens against the property (e.g. for unpaid assessments) that were perfected by the person imposing them prior to the sale and not cleared up at closing.\n\nAnd, nothing prevents a single complaint filed in court from asserting more than one kind of claim.\n\nThe distinction is harder than it seems because the issue of whether an offense is particular to the person who committed it, or runs with the land, is often non\\-obvious and not well developed in case law or statutes.\n\n**Bottom line: It's complicated.**\n\nBecause multiple aspects of the HOA governing documents and the precise nature of the relief sought in the case are so essential to determining who is or is not a necessary party to a lawsuit involving an alleged failure by the HOA to comply with its own policies, determining who is a necessary party isn't easy.\n\nFar more facts are necessary to answer the question correctly.\n\n### Bonus question\n\n> If Harry illegally built a deck and then sold his condo unit to Sally,\n> does Sally own the deck and have a responsibility to maintain the deck\n> or is it the Association's responsibility?\n\nThis is highly dependent upon the definitions used and responsibilities created in the HOA governing documents. A lot will depend upon whether the governing documents treat this as a part of a unit, a limited common element, or a common element, but there is more to it than that. Even if it was built in violation of HOA policies, it may be a fait accompli at some point that is treated as valid.\n\nThere is not one consistent way to handle this issue that is predominant in HOA governing documents.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a Florida HOA dispute involving unauthorized wooden decks built on common areas, which of the following factors is LEAST likely to be considered when determining if an individual deck owner is an indispensable party to the lawsuit?\n\nA) The specific remedy sought in the lawsuit (e.g., deck removal, fines, or declaratory judgment)\nB) Whether the HOA governing documents allow individual members or only the HOA to enforce covenant violations\nC) The educational background of the current deck owners\nD) Whether the common areas are owned by individual members as tenants-in-common or solely by the HOA\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because the remedy sought is a crucial factor in determining necessary parties.

[The law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=12940.&lawCode=GOV), \u00a712940a makes it unlawful \"because of the religious creed of any person, to refuse to hire or employ the person...\".

Seeger, 380 U.S. 163 and Welsh v. US, 398 U.S. 333\\. And the court points out that government agencies are granted wide latitude in interpreting enabling legislation (under which the government might allow or disallow an action).\n\nIt us noted that as of 2002, there were no California cases deciding what constitutes a religious creed w.r.t. FEHA and that regulation. The court then recited various statements from other California cases regarding the characterization of a religion \u2013 the main relevant point is that a religion does not have to be theistic to be a \"religion\". The court also reviews federal employment discrimination laws, and again considers the difference between traditional and non\\-traditional religions. There are many snippets in the review of the law section saying things such as that\n\n> the court should find beliefs to be a religion if they \u2018occupy the\n> same place in the life of the \\[individual] as an orthodox belief in\n> God holds in the life of one clearly qualified.\u2019\n\nWe can now move to the question in \u00a76, *Is Veganism a Religious Creed For Purposes of the FEHA*.

Until someone actually alleges that they have a religious belief that prohibits vaccination, we can't analyze those arguments. The gist of the \"veganism is not a religion\" is it is too narrow a belief to constitute a religious belief. The court found that did not find that it is a \"belief system (which) addresses fundamental or ultimate questions\", and that it does not a address fundamental questions such as \"the meaning of human existence; \u2009the purpose of life; \u2009theories of humankind's nature or its place in the universe; \u2009matters of human life and death; \u2009or the exercise of faith\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the court's ruling in Friedman v.

In the US, the rules for determining parentage are generally established by the [Uniform Parentage Act](https://www.uniformlaws.org/HigherLogic/System/DownloadDocumentFile.ashx?DocumentFileKey=ccec4a4f-cf66-e428-04ba-2d5bd1b97c7b&forceDialog=1), instantiated for instance in Washington state [RCW Chapter 26\\.26A](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.26A&full=true). [RCW 26\\.26A.100](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.26A&full=true#26.26A.100) spells out the full set of rules:\n\nA parent\\-child relationship is established between an individual and a child if:\n\n> (1\\) The individual gives birth to the child, except as otherwise\n> provided in RCW 26\\.26A.700 through 26\\.26A.785;\n> \n> \n> (2\\) There is a presumption under RCW 26\\.26A.115 of the individual's\n> parentage of the child, unless the presumption is overcome in a\n> judicial proceeding or a valid denial of parentage is made under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.200 through 26\\.26A.265;\n> \n> \n> (3\\) The individual is adjudicated a parent of the child under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.400 through 26\\.26A.515;\n> \n> \n> (4\\) The individual adopts the child;\n> \n> \n> (5\\) The individual acknowledges parentage of the child under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.200 through 26\\.26A.265, unless the acknowledgment is rescinded under RCW 26\\.26A.235 or successfully challenged under RCW 26\\.26A.200\n> through 26\\.26A.265 or 26\\.26A.400 through 26\\.26A.515;\n> \n> \n> (6\\) The individual's parentage of the child is established under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.600 through 26\\.26A.635; or\n> \n> \n> (7\\) The individual's parentage of the child is established under RCW\n> 26\\.26A.705 through 26\\.26A.730\\.\n\n\u00a7\u00a7300\\-355 govern the use of genetic tests in determining parentage, according to which genetic test results can be evidence of parentage, but \u00a7\u00a7600 ff specifically address assisted reproduction and surrogacy agreements \u2013 RCW 26\\.26A.610 for example specifically assigns \"parentage\" to a person who consents to assisted reproduction by a woman with the intent to be a parent of a child, and under \u00a7605, a donor is not a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a hypothetical case, genetic material is stolen from an individual without their knowledge or consent and used to create a child through assisted reproduction.

In this case, the key factors are consent and intent to be a parent. The individual whose genetic material was stolen did not consent to assisted reproduction or intend to be a parent, which aligns with the donor status described in RCW 26.26A.605. Conversely, the person who arranged for the use of the genetic material likely intended to be a parent, which is a crucial factor in establishing parentage under RCW 26.26A.610.

However, despite this disconnect, both prestigious law schools and prospective students still find value in pursuing high rankings. This is because the signaling effect of a degree from a highly-ranked school remains beneficial in the job market, even if the actual educational experience might be compromised by factors such as a focus on research over teaching. This creates a situation where schools and students rationally pursue something (high rankings) that may not directly correlate with better education, which is the core irony Barton identifies."}}
