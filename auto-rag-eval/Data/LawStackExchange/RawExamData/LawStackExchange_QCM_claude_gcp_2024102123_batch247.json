It does not, however, excuse a British subject from the ordinary duties of paying taxes and the like; anyone in a more accessible (and more clearly British) part of the country would be subject to the normal forms of law enforcement, including imprisonment for contempt of court if they refused to obey court orders. Despite the more eccentric theories of the 'sovereign citizen' movement (who [do exist](http://loweringthebar.net/2016/03/sovereign-citizens-also-bothering-scotland.html) in the UK), the fact that somebody living in Britain is subject to British laws is not open to negotiation.\n\nResisting this law enforcement by force would not be a good idea: as well as the fact that the Government has access to bigger and better armed forces than you do, it would probably render you guilty of treason. The Treason Act 1351 (as amended and translated) makes it illegal to \"levy war against our lord the King in his realm, or be adherent to the King's enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere\"; the good news is that the death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998 (some time after that for murder)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the United Kingdom, if an individual claims their owned land as an independent nation and refuses to pay taxes or comply with building regulations, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal consequences?\n\nA) The individual would be immediately charged with treason and face the death penalty.\n\nB) The claim of independence would be recognized, exempting the individual from UK laws and taxes.\n\nC) The individual would still be subject to UK laws and could face normal law enforcement actions, including potential imprisonment for contempt of court.\n\nD) The government would be unable to take any legal action as long as the individual remains on their claimed \"independent\" land.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

The EULA clearly states that copyright is automatically transferred to the vendor when a document is created. The author gets started, writes \"It was a dark and stormy night\" then has a moment of writer's block, saves and closes, takes a walk, then tries again. The author has transferred copyright in the work to vendor, and needs vendor's permission to make revisions. So you have to tweak the EULA to grant automatic permission to author to create derivative works (revisions), and to distribute.

The answer suggests that a more effective strategy would be to impose a revenue-sharing formula on commercially exploited works, rather than attempting to directly seize intellectual property. This approach, along with granting automatic permission for authors to create derivative works and distribute their content, would be more legally sound and practically implementable.

This is based on the ['Schrems II' decision in 2020 that the EU\\-U.S. Privacy Shield](https://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&docid=228677&pageIndex=0&doclang=en) fails to protect Europeans' rights to data privacy when companies are transferring those data to the U.S. The details and requirements are discussed by the [International Association of Privacy Professionals](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-schrems-ii-decision-eu-us-data-transfers-in-question/).\n\nSuppose Alice Inc. was in this situation, in that they are a US company with their websites running on the cloud in US datacenters, let us say in a single docker container with apache and MySQL and their simple site. They could with a simple purchase of alternative hosting and a few commands deploy their webserver on an EU host. This would however have little effect on the access to the data, in that if US law enforcement turned up at the offices of Alice Inc. they could be required to hand over the data and their access to the data will not be changed in any way by the location of the web hosting.\n\nIf they did this, would this satisfy the particular aspect of the GDPR that was covered by the 'Schrems II' decision and the Meta fine?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Maybe this changes something, maybe not. But at first glance, yes, avoiding US\\-based vendors does help comply with Schrems II. They need not be EU\\-based.\n\nDefinition of an international data transfer\n--------------------------------------------\n\nThe GDPR unfortunately does not define what an international transfer is, and just explains when they may be lawful:\n\n> Art 44: Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country \\[\u2026] shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country \\[\u2026] to another third country \\[\u2026]. \\[\u2026]\n\nThis has been interpreted, in particular by the official EU SCCs and by [EDPB guidance](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-052021-interplay-between-application-article-3_en), to imply two roles: the data exporter, and the data importer. Per those EDPB guidelines, a transfer occurs when three criteria are fulfilled together:\n\n1. The data exporter is subject to GDPR (e.g. as a controller via Art 3, or as a processor via an Art 28 data processing contract).\n2. The exporter discloses or makes available personal data to the importer.\n3. The importer is in a \"third country\" (for EU GDPR: anything outside the EU/EEA).\n\nNote that these importer/exporter aspects are independent from roles like \"controller\" or \"processor\". It also does not depend on where in the world the exporter is situated.\n\nApplying this to your scenario\n------------------------------\n\nHow does this apply to your scenario?\n\n* I am assuming Alice Inc is subject to the GDPR (criterion \\#1\\). Now, Alice Inc can process personal data, and **that's not an international transfer**, even if Alice Inc is in the US (or any other third country). The general GDPR rules apply, such as the requirement to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security of processing operations.\n* If Alice Inc engages data processors to process personal data on Alice Inc's behalf, then this would fulfil criterion \\#2 (disclosure to a third party). For example, hosting providers generally act as data processors. Any other kind of data sharing (e.g. to other data processors) would also fall under this category. Tricky in an US context: while employees would be agents of Alice Inc and would not be separate recipients, contractors/freelancers would also be potential data importers.\n* If those data importers are based in the EU/EEA, then criterion \\#3 is not fulfilled and **there's no international transfer**. For example, using an EU\\-based hosting providers would sidestep Chapter V of the GDPR completely.\n* If those data importers are based outside of the EU/EEA, **then criterion \\#3 is triggered and we have an international transfer**.\n\nLawfulness of international data transfers\n------------------------------------------\n\nWhen there is an international transfer, it must be adequately protected. In order of decreasing priority:\n\n* country has an EU adequacy decision\n* appropriate safeguards\n\t+ for a group of companies: Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)\n\t+ Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)\n* Art 49 specific situations\n\nWhat SCCs and BCRs do is to translate enough of the GDPR from statutory law into a contract to ensure adequate protection. But to be effective, they must actually be enforceable, and the data importer must actually be able to comply with those rules.\n\nIn Schrems II, the CJEU found that the US (at that time) did not offer an adequate level of data protection, and that SCCs are probably invalid as well since importers cannot comply with both the SCCs and with US surveillance laws. Before using SCCs, it is effectively necessary to perform a transfer impact assessment (TIA) analyzing, among other things, the legal context of the importer's country. It may be possible to defuse this, for example by using supplemental security measures like end\\-to\\-end that prevent unlawful use of the data even if it falls into the wrong hands. However, such measures also tend to prevent intended use, especially in a cloud context.\n\nIn the [DPC Ireland decision against Meta Ireland (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/final_for_issue_ov_transfers_decision_12-05-23.pdf), the DPC finds:\n\n> 7\\.202 In summary, therefore, I am satisfied (and I so find) that:\n> \n> \n> (1\\) US law does not provide a level of protection that is essentially equivalent to that provided by EU law;  \n> \n> (2\\) Neither the 2010 SCCs nor the 2021 SCCs can compensate for the inadequate protection provided by US law; and  \n> \n> (3\\) Meta Ireland does not have in place any supplemental measures which would\n> compensate for the inadequate protection provided by US law.\n> \n> \n> 7\\.203 Accordingly, in making the Data Transfers, I find that, subject to the analysis contained at Section 8 below, Meta Ireland is infringing Article 46(1\\) GDPR.\n\nImplications of using non\\-US vendors\n-------------------------------------\n\nAs already mentioned, using EU\\-based data processors avoids the international transfer problem due to the way how international transfers are defined.\n\nEven if an international transfer occurs, that might not be a problem.\n\n* Some countries have an EU adequacy decision, for example Canada, Israel, or South Korea. While there would nominally be an international data transfer that needs to be disclosed e.g. in a privacy notice, there is no additional bureaucracy required.\n* In other countries, transfer tools like SCCs might work. A TIA might show that that the issues discussed in the Schrems II decision and the DPC decision wouldn't apply there.\n\nBut isn't that a contradiction?\n-------------------------------\n\nYou correctly point out a problem with the GDPR's approach to data transfers:\n\n> This would however have little effect on the access to the data, in that if US law enforcement turned up at the offices of Alice Inc. they could be required to hand over the data and their access to the data will not be changed in any way by the location of the web hosting.\n\nYes, this is arguably a loophole.\n\nHowever:\n\n* If the US\\-based Alice Inc is a data processor in behalf of another controller, that controller would likely be violating the GDPR by transferring personal data to Alice.\n* If Alice Inc is a data controller: while this might not be a violation of the Chapter V rules on international data transfers, such a scenario could be argued to be an Art 24 or Art 32 violation instead (requirement to ensure compliance and security).\n* When Alice Inc transfers personal data to data importers, that is less visible to data subjects, and outside of their immediate control. However, when Alice Inc collects data on data subjects, that is more visible to data subjects, in particular through an Art 13 or Art 14 privacy notice. That notice must also contain the identity of the data controller, which would disclose that Alice is US\\-based, which may enable to data subjects to make more informed choices.\n\nThis won't help Meta\n--------------------\n\nWhile moving to non\\-US data processors can be a sensible compliance approach for many companies, it is less useful for multinationals like Meta. In this context, Meta is an Irish data controller who engages platform and development services from an American company. Even if Meta Ireland tries to perform all GDPR\\-covered processing activities outside the US, it's actual corporate structure situates some processing activities such as administration tasks in the US and other third countries. If my above analysis is correct, it would have been easier for Meta to comply with GDPR if the US\\-based Meta company were the data controller."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Alice Inc., a US-based company, is considering how to comply with GDPR requirements following the 'Schrems II' decision. Which of the following actions would be MOST effective in addressing the specific concerns raised by the decision regarding international data transfers?\n\nA) Moving their web hosting to an EU-based provider while maintaining all other operations in the US\nB) Implementing end-to-end encryption for all data stored and processed by Alice Inc.\nC) Relocating the entire company, including all employees and operations, to the EU\nD) Using Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for all data transfers between the US and EU\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation:\nA) This is the most effective solution among the options given. By moving web hosting to an EU-based provider, Alice Inc. avoids triggering an international data transfer for this aspect of their operations. According to the EDPB guidelines, this would not constitute a data transfer under GDPR, as the data importer (the hosting provider) would be within the EU/EEA.\n\nB) While implementing end-to-end encryption can be a useful supplementary measure, it alone does not address the core issue of international data transfers. The Schrems II decision specifically highlighted that technical measures may not be sufficient to overcome the concerns about US surveillance laws.\n\nC) Relocating the entire company to the EU would indeed solve the international transfer issue, but it's an extreme and likely impractical solution for most businesses. The question asks for the MOST effective action, not the most comprehensive one.\n\nD) Using SCCs is no longer considered sufficient protection for data transfers to the US after the Schrems II decision.

However, it appears that no rent is due until a valid address is provided (though note that once a valid address is provided, [**all** withheld rent is then due](https://www.landlordlawblog.co.uk/2014/05/29/a-tenants-right-to-know-his-landlords-address/).)\n\nIt is possible that the landlord has made an honest mistake, and didn't realise that the current absence of a letting agent has left them in breach of the law. So it may be worth contacting the landlord to point this out, so they can appoint a new letting agent.\n\n*Please note: withholding rent when it is legally due can have serious consequences.

The tenant realizes that they have not been provided with an address in England or Wales for serving documents, as required by Section 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987. Which of the following statements is correct regarding this situation?\n\nA) The Section 21 notice is automatically invalid due to the lack of a UK address for the landlord.\nB) The tenant can legally withhold all rent payments until a valid UK address is provided.\nC) The Section 21 notice may still be valid, but the tenant is not obligated to pay rent until a valid UK address is provided.\nD) The tenant must continue paying rent as normal, regardless of the missing UK address.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because the validity of a Section 21 notice is not dependent on the landlord providing a UK address. The notice must comply with the requirements of Section 21 of the Housing Act 1988, but these do not include having a UK address for the landlord.\n\nOption B is partially correct but overly broad. While the tenant can withhold rent until a valid UK address is provided, they cannot legally withhold all rent payments indefinitely. Once a valid address is provided, all previously withheld rent becomes due.\n\nOption C is the correct answer. The Section 21 notice may still be valid if it meets all other requirements. However, according to Section 48 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987, rent is not legally due unless the landlord provides an address for service of documents in England or Wales. This means the tenant is not obligated to pay rent until such an address is provided, but they should be prepared to pay all withheld rent once a valid address is given.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it ignores the tenant's right to withhold rent when no valid UK address has been provided by the landlord."}, "8": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/80580/is-using-empty-debit-virtual-card-to-avoid-potential-cancellation-fees-a-fraud-i", "docs_id": 80580, "title": "Is using empty debit/virtual card to avoid potential cancellation fees a fraud in U.S.?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In Travel.SE there are often questions about cancellation fees and how can they be enforced in case of using an empty debit or virtual credit card for the booking.\n\nDoes this qualify as fraud or other crime / misdemeanor in the U.S.?

Even in international waters, the law of the ship's flag country applies, which likely restricts such armaments.\n3. The weight of the gun system (4.4 to 5.8 tons) is too heavy for most yacht hulls, especially those made of fiberglass.\n4. Only large steel-hulled vessels, similar to naval or commercial ships, could potentially support such a weapon system.\n5. Entering any country's territorial waters with such a weapon would likely violate local laws.\n\nOptions A, B, and C are incorrect as they oversimplify the complex legal and practical issues involved in arming a private yacht with military-grade weapons."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27965/is-it-really-an-abduction-if-the-protest-or-resistance-ends-before-the-victim", "docs_id": 27965, "title": "Is it really an abduction if the protest or resistance ends before the &quot;victim&quot; is &quot;released&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: My friend ran into her ex\\-boyfriend at a store.

When applying for federal financial aid, grants, and loans as a man, however, you may be asked to prove that you are exempt. To request a Status Information Letter (SIL) that shows you are exempt, you can either download an SIL request form from the Selective Service website (<http://www.sss.gov/PDFs/SilForm_Instructions.pdf>) or call them at 1\\-888\\-655\\-1825\\. This service is free and the exemption letter you will receive does not specify why you are exempt so it will not force you to out yourself in any other application process. The Selective Service does, however, require a copy of your birth certificate showing your birth\\-assigned sex. If the sex on your birth certificate has been changed, attach any documentation you have to that affect. Once you receive your Status Information Letter, keep it in your files. For those FTM people who transition before their eighteenth birthdays and change their birth certificates, it is also possible to register with the service. However, no one may register after their twenty\\-sixth birthday. Also, please note that although Selective Service materials refer to transgender people as \u201cpeople who have had a sex change,\u201d their policies apply to those who have transitioned regardless of surgical history.\n\nThe referenced form has a section where you can declare your gender assigned at birth, and you must attach a copy of your birth certificate. It would appear that having your gender assigned as female at birth does in fact exempt you from the requirement to register with selective service, and as a result you should not be penalized for any purpose related to your not having registered."}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Jake, born female but now identifying as a transgender male, is 20 years old and applying for federal financial aid.

However, when applying for federal financial aid as a male, he will likely need to prove his exemption. The correct course of action is to request a Status Information Letter (SIL) from the Selective Service System, which will confirm his exempt status without disclosing the reason for exemption. This letter, along with a copy of his original birth certificate showing his birth-assigned sex, will serve as proof of exemption when applying for federal financial aid.

But I can't find any reliable references to that. Can someone please provide me reliable information about any such laws or regulations that exist?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a couple of US laws that form the basis of effectively warrantless surveillance, including through tech companies:\n\n* Under Executive Order 12333, US intelligence agencies issue National Security Letters. These letters compel the recipient to provide requested data. These letters do not require a warrant, and typically include a gag order for the recipient.\n* Under Section 702 FISA, US intelligence agencies enjoy substantial powers for foreign surveillance. This surveillance has to be authorized by the FISA court, but it has been criticized for rubber\\-stamping requests. Proceedings at the FISA court are *ex parte* and lack representation for the surveillance subjects.\n* FISA and the National Security Letters mechanism where expanded through the Patriot Act.\n* US intelligence agencies often have creative interpretations of the governing laws. Judicial review tends to defer to executive branch interpretation if that interpretation is reasonable. Thus, there exists a secret body of quasi\\-law where intelligence agencies can interpret the existence of further powers.\n\nThese laws have very limited checks and balances. While Americans enjoy some protections, there are basically none for non\\-Americans. Subjects have extremely limited options to fight this surveillance in court. FISA has to be re\\-authorized every few years.\n\nThe true scope of surveillance under these laws became publicly known through the Snowden leaks. For example, intelligence agencies ran the PRISM program based on section 702 FISA that compelled companies to supply all data matching a \u201cselector\u201d.\n\nA bit of outside perspective: In 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled that EO 12333 and other laws mean that the United States do not have an adequate level of data protection, effectively forbidding further transfers of personal data into the US. While the EU's GDPR does recognize surveillance measures that are \u201cnecessary and proportionate in a democratic society\u201d, the lack of judicial remedies for surveillance subjects are especially troubling. The ECJ wrote in its judgement (case C\u2011311/18\\):\n\n> As regards judicial protection, the referring court states that EU citizens do not have the same remedies as US citizens in respect of the processing of personal data by the US authorities, since the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which constitutes, in United States law, the most important cause of action available to challenge unlawful surveillance, does not apply to EU citizens. In that regard, the referring court states that there are substantial obstacles in respect of the causes of action open to EU citizens, in particular that of *locus standi*, which it considers to be excessively difficult to satisfy. Furthermore, according to the findings of the referring court, the NSA\u2019s activities based on E.O. 12333 are not subject to judicial oversight and are not justiciable. \\[\u2026]\n> \n> \n> It follows therefore that neither Section 702 of the FISA, nor E.O. 12333, read in conjunction with PPD\u201128, correlates to the minimum safeguards resulting, under EU law, from the principle of proportionality, with the consequence that the surveillance programmes based on those provisions cannot be regarded as limited to what is strictly necessary."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal framework for government surveillance of digital communications in the United States?\n\nA) The government must always obtain a warrant before accessing any user data from technology companies.\n\nB) The Patriot Act allows unrestricted access to all user data for any government agency without oversight.\n\nC) National Security Letters and Section 702 FISA provide mechanisms for intelligence agencies to compel companies to provide user data, often without traditional warrant requirements.\n\nD) US laws provide equal protections and judicial remedies for both US citizens and non-US citizens in matters of digital surveillance.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because it accurately reflects the legal mechanisms described in the passage.

You are the data controller, the third party analytics are usually a data processor who only process data on your behalf. You must ensure that the data processor is compliant. Even if they were a joint controller you'd be responsible for what happens on the website (relevant precedent is the Fashion ID case).\n* While ePrivacy originally had a fairly weak concept of consent (e.g. \u201cby continuing to use this site, you consent \u2026\u201d). However, the GDPR updated the definition of consent, so that valid consent must be freely given, informed, actively given, and specific. If you set cookies for different purposes in addition to analytics, users should be able to give or withhold consent for analytics independently from other purposes. Since consent must be actively given, consent is never the default, e.g. pre\\-ticked checkboxes are not compliant (relevant precedent is the Planet49 case).\n* Like Google, GoSquared stores data in the US. You are causing personal data to be transferred into the US, which is an international transfer. Before it was invalidated earlier in 2020, such transfers were easy to do under the Privacy Shield adequacy decision. Now, such transfers are only legal if you sign SCCs with your data processor, and your risk assessment indicates that your user's data is sufficiently safe there, despite your processors potentially being legally unable to comply with the SCCs.

One reading of the circumstances is that you did not have a job offer, you went there on the assumption that you might get an official offer after being \"oriented\" and interviewed. The interview did not go well, so they did not give you the job. Time and travel expenses are often borne by the job candidate.\n\nThe alternative interpretation is that you had an actual job offer, and you traveled to the site as part of your employment (involving some training). In that first session, things went bad, and you got fired. If that is the case, then (a) you would be owed wages for that day and (b) there is a slim chance that the firing was not legal (there could be restrictions on firing employees in government jobs, in whatever jurisdiction this is).

The Apache Software Foundation agrees with this interpretation, stating that Apache 2.0 licensed software can be included in GPL 3.0 projects, but GPL 3.0 software cannot be included in Apache projects.

According to the information provided, an honorary consul who uses their home for conducting consular business does not enjoy the same level of protection as official consular premises.

This reflects the nuanced reality of how prior art affects patent validity. Prior art must be known to the patent office before a patent is granted to prevent its issuance. However, if secret or semi-secret prior art becomes public knowledge after a patent is granted, it can potentially be used to challenge the patent's validity. The key factor is the date when the prior art became publicly available, not when it was originally created. \n\nOption A is incorrect because prior art doesn't need to be widely known to the general public. Option B is too broad, as completely secret information cannot invalidate a patent until it becomes public. Option D is incorrect because even obscure but publicly available information can potentially be used as prior art if it can be accessed, even if it's difficult to find."}, "30": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85070/is-constiption-a-recognized-legal-concept", "docs_id": 85070, "title": "Is &quot;constiption&quot; a recognized legal concept?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Quite a few questions have been asked about \"constiption\" on Law SE and other SE sites.

The store provides shopping carts but he doesn't use one. He grabs the small items he needs and to transport them to the register in the front he puts them in the small pocket of his hoodie. As he's walking to the register, a loss prevention person stops them and accuses Bob of theft. He says \"We have you on camera stuff your hoodie with stuff\".

The loss prevention agent doesn't allow him to go to the register and forces Bob into the back room until the police arrives.\n\nDid Bob commit a theft?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The crime of theft generally requires two elements \\- taking control of property, and the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. If Bob had no intent to leave without paying, he may lack the intent often required for theft. In the scenario described, it's possible Bob has not committed theft, but his actions may indeed constitute theft depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nAs pointed out in the comments, some jurisdictions codify the concealment of merchandise as prima facie presumption of an intention to steal, or may even codify the act of concealment itself as a crime.

The crime of theft generally requires both the act of taking control of property and the intent to deprive the rightful owner of it. In Bob's case, while he did conceal items in his hoodie, his intent is not clear-cut. Some jurisdictions may consider concealment as prima facie evidence of intent to steal, while others may require more proof of intent. Additionally, some jurisdictions may have specific laws about willful concealment that don't require leaving the store to constitute a crime. The court's decision would depend on various factors, including local laws, how intent is inferred, and whether Bob's actions are deemed consistent with someone intending to pay.

The practice of an occupation or profession may be regulated by or pursuant to a law.\n\nHas art. 12(1\\) been interpreted to require that all students should be automatically graduated regardless of grades?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n==\n\nWhat it means is that no German can be forced by the government into a job, education or place of work. So for example, the Government cannot come and say \"we are short on railroad workers, the next 200 graduates of this school will report to Hamburg Station for training and become rail workers in Munich\".\n\nThat might be blindingly obvious *today*, but when this was written, the government that had just ceased to exist had heavily dictated who was allowed into which profession, not on personal qualification, but on things like faith, nationality, heritage and skin color. And *other* governments forming from the ashes right next door were indeed not capitalistic and their socialist central planning meant that they would direct at least parts of their workforce which jobs to take and sometimes even where.\n\nIn contrast, in Western Germany, whether or not one becomes a rail worker, which company educates them and where they work in the end is their choice.\n\nObviously choices are limited by reality. I can *choose* to be a railworker on an island in the North Sea, but I will be unemployed, because there is no rail line there and I won't get a permit to build my private one.\n\nI can *choose* to study philosophy, but if I cannot find an employer in need of philosophers, I will have to fall back on making money driving an Uber.\n\nI can *choose* to become a Pilot. But I will have a hard time finding a spare 747 to train on if I don't train with one of the big airlines. The may have their own, totally capitalistic goals. For example, contracts that say \"if we train you, you have to stay for X years and work for us or pay X amount of money\" are totally normal and legal in those businesses. And if their training center with the big 747 simulators is in city A, I can choose to train in city B, but I will obviously fail their program.\n\nSo no, this law does not imply any kind of automatic success on a personal level. You still need to qualify for the training you want, be able to pay rent in the city you want to live in and find an employer that employs you, or customers to become a successful freelancer. Maybe you cannot do that for personal reasons. But the government will not dictate instead.

Presumably such amn imitation would display the logo and other trademarks of the site being imitated, without permission, and in a way likely to confuse readers about the origin and affiliation of the display. Whether this would be considered to be \"used in trade\" or would be otherwise subject to a suit for trademark infringement is hard to say. \n\nA fake post in the sense of one actually posted to a social media site, but under an assumed name, possibly under a name that seems to be associated with a real person, but in fact is not so associated, probably violates the sites TOS. That would be a breech of contract, but such breeches are, I understand, rarely pursued in the form of actual lawsuits. \n\nIf a fake post in either sense uses the name or likeness of a real person without permission, that **might** violate the personality rights of the person imitated. Such rights vary considerably by jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions they apply only to the use in marketing. In some jurisdictions no such rights are recognized.

In both cases, laws limiting the exercise of those fundamental rights must be restrained, and a law against openly carrying guns to a political protest would be subject to \"strict scrutiny\", meaning that there would have to be a compelling reason to infringe on these rights. The legal rule, here and in the UK, is that it's legal unless it is specifically illegal. That is not to say that Michigan could not pass a law outlawing the carrying of weapons in government buildings, or outlaw political protests right at the door of the governor's office,\nbut until they do, it's legal.

The real issue is not whether those policies are permitted, but what the consequences are for breaking them. \n\nThe fact that a company forbids its employees from exercising a legal right doesn't mean that the employee ceases to have that legal right. It simply means that if the employee exercises that legal right, then the employee has breached the contract and may suffer the consequences for breaching that contract.\n\nViolations of those policies are grounds for termination from employment, and this would probably not be void as a matter of public policy. \n\nFor an employee at will this is really pretty meaningless, although it could conceivably affect unemployment benefit eligibility. But, for a unionized or civil service employee who can only be fired for cause, this is a big deal.\n\nBut, in theory, a company policy does not impact the tort liability or the criminal liability of the individual engaging in legally privileged self\\-defense to anyone. This is because two people can't contractually change their legal duties to third parties with whom they are not in privity (i.e. with whom they do not have a contractual relationship). And two people also can't contractually change the terms of a country's penal laws.\n\nThe policy may be a defense of the company from vicarious liability for the employee's use of force in violation of the policy that gives rise to civil liability for the employee because the grounds for authorizing self\\-defense were not present.\n\nIf the employee using force did so wrongfully and was sued for negligence rather than battery, the existence of the company policy might also go to the issue of whether the employee was acting negligently since a reasonable person in the employee's shoes might have been less likely to wrongfully use force in purported self\\-defense if there was such a policy than if there was not such a policy (and instead there might arguably have been a legal fiduciary duty as an agent to protect the property and workers of the principal in the absence of the policy)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A security guard at a bank is employed under a contract that includes a strict \"no violence\" policy, even in self-defense situations.

[http://www.lacourt.org/division/smallclaims/SC0011\\.aspx](http://www.lacourt.org/division/smallclaims/SC0011.aspx) only lists examples of plaintiffs seeking monetary judgments.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Usually this is done in the context of a suit for money damages for the return of a security deposit, or in the context of a defamation action when the landlord has made a negative credit report. But if there is no security deposit to return and no inaccurate credit report that has been made, these options aren't available.\n\nYou might be able to obtain a declaratory judgment that no rent is owed from a court. but this kind of case would probably be beyond the jurisdiction of the small claims court.

The situation: Tenant pays rent by handing a cheque to the landlord, the landlord is robbed before the cheque is deposited. Consensus on money.stackexchange.com is that the tenant should tell their bank to cancel the cheque, and hand over another cheque. \n\nHowever, what happens if the thief manages to cash in the checque before it is stopped? The money is gone. Clearly *someone* is going to lose out, either landlord or tenant. But whose money is it? Does the tenant have to pay the rent again, paying twice, or does the landlord lose his rental income for the month? \n\nThe question was asked in Canada, but other jurisdictions would be welcome as well. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Canada, the bank loses the money. They are the party that is ultimately responsible for paying only the person the cheque ordered to be paid. Canadian law is actually very strict on this, the bank would would be liable even if the landlord fraudulently gave the cheque to his brother to cash.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has made multiple decisions confirming the banks liability in cases like this, most recently in [Teva Canada Ltd. v. TD Canada Trust](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/16815/index.do):\n\n> ... The question at the heart of this case is which innocent party \u2014 T or the collecting banks \u2014 should bear the loss resulting from fraud? The Bills of Exchange Act should be interpreted in such a way that drawers and banks are exposed to the risks created by the fraudulent use of the system, but the banks are the more significant beneficiaries of the bills of exchange system. It is therefore appropriate, in certain circumstances, for them to bear risks and losses associated with that system. To allocate losses to the drawer for having failed to identify and detect the fraud is inconsistent with the strict liability tort of conversion, which makes any negligence on the part of the drawer or the banks in preventing the fraud irrelevant. The Court has, in multiple decisions, provided a two\u2011step framework which outlines what a bank must prove to demonstrate that a payee is fictitious or non\u2011existing. ...\n\nNote that tenant would still owe the landlord rent. If the bank paid someone other than landlord then cheque wasn't properly honoured and so no longer satisfies the debt. So in the end the landlord would get paid, the tenant would only pay for the rent once, and the only bank would lose. That is, assuming the bank couldn't recover the money from the person who fraudulently cashed the cheque.\n\n(Note that banks in Canada make it very difficult for their customers to obtain compensation when the bank screws up, so what I've written above is only what should happen according to the law in theory. In practice the tenant will have to spend months going through the bank's arduous dispute resolution process, and only after that fails be able to go court to recover the money. Most tenants will give up before this and so will end up having to pay the rent twice.)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In Canada, a tenant pays rent by cheque to their landlord. The landlord is robbed before depositing the cheque, and the thief manages to cash it. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal and financial consequences of this situation?\n\nA) The tenant is legally obligated to pay the rent again, effectively paying twice, as the original cheque was not received by the intended recipient.\n\nB) The landlord must bear the loss of rental income for the month, as they failed to securely handle the cheque after receiving it from the tenant.\n\nC) The bank is ultimately liable for the loss, must reimburse the landlord, and the tenant's original rent payment is considered fulfilled.\n\nD) The tenant and landlord must equally split the loss, each paying half of the month's rent to fairly distribute the burden of the theft.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Canadian law and Supreme Court decisions, the bank is ultimately liable in cases where a cheque is fraudulently cashed. The bank is responsible for ensuring payment is made only to the intended recipient. In this scenario, the bank would be required to reimburse the landlord for the fraudulently cashed cheque. The tenant's original rent payment would be considered fulfilled, as they properly issued the cheque to the landlord. The landlord would receive the rent payment from the bank, and the tenant would not be required to pay again. This aligns with the principle that banks, as primary beneficiaries of the cheque system, should bear certain risks associated with it. However, it's worth noting that in practice, recovering funds from banks can be a challenging and time-consuming process for individuals."}, "48": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28695/can-anonymized-data-be-collected-under-gdpr-without-consent", "docs_id": 28695, "title": "Can anonymized data be collected under GDPR without consent?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I am having an Android App in which I want to track the usage of the app. But the usage will not have anyone identity for eg.

In fact, under rules of English, it is impossible to construe \"is not employed on a full\\-time basis\" as referring to \"you\" (Eugene), and the clause can only refer to the \"children\". A non\\-technical common\\-sense way to see this comes from substituting your name in here and shortening the verbiage\n\n> Dependent means Eugene and your children, or a child for whom you or\n>  Eugene are the legal guardian. And that child must be under the\n>  termination age, not be full\\-time employed, and must be dependent\n>  on you or Eugene for support.\n\nThe idea that Eugene must be dependent on Eugene for support is a bit nonsensical and contradicts the plainer fact that Eugene is identified at the very start as being a dependent. \n\nThere *is* a possible ambiguity regarding the scope of the \"not\\-employed (etc.)\" clause. The sentence identifies two kinds of \"children\": natural, adopted or step\\-children, and also a child that you are a legal guardian of. The question is whether the clause \"who is under the termination age, is not employed on a full\\-time basis and is dependent on you or your spouse for support\" refers to all of those kinds of dependents, or just the legal guardian type. There is an interpretive doctrine, the [last antecedent rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_antecedent_rule), which would say that the restrictor only applies to \"or a child for whom you or your spouse are the legal guardian\". However, that rule always gives way to \"common sense\" and \"the full meaning and intent of the document\", so in fact it is typically only invoked as a way of rationalizing a conclusion reached on other grounds."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the travel insurance policy definition of \"Dependent,\" which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) A spouse who is employed full-time can still be considered a dependent under this policy.\n\nB) Only children who are not employed full-time can be considered dependents under this policy.\n\nC) The employment status clause applies to both spouses and children equally.\n\nD) The policy definition is intentionally ambiguous to allow for case-by-case interpretation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the interpretation provided in the documentation, the clause \"is not employed on a full-time basis and is dependent on you or your spouse for support\" applies only to children, not to the spouse. This is based on the grammatical structure of the definition and the logical interpretation that a spouse cannot be dependent on themselves for support. The policy clearly defines a spouse as a dependent at the beginning, without any employment-related conditions. The full-time employment restriction and dependency clause are specifically tied to the description of children (natural, adopted, step-children, or those under legal guardianship) who can be considered dependents.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the spouse's employment status is not a factor in their classification as a dependent. Option C is incorrect because the employment status clause does not apply to spouses.

That is also the case here.\n\n* The old law is Regulation (EU) No 531/2012\n* The successor law is Regulation (EU) 2022/612\n* The successor law contains the following article:\n\n> Article 23: Repeal\n> \n> \n> Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 is repealed.\n> \n> \n> References to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex II.\n\nThat annex provides a mapping between articles in both laws.\n\nSo, if your contract references Regulation 531/2012, you can interpret that as a reference to Regulation 2022/612\\.

You mention that the dispute \u201cis\u201d from a time when the new law applied. However, the question is not when the dispute was raised, but when the alleged breaches occurred. If the matter were to be laid before a court, the court would apply the old law for breaches while the old law was in force, and the new law for those breaches while the new law was in force. This could lead to the same or distinct results. I haven't read the laws in question, so it could also be that these regulations apply to the formation of contracts and not conduct during those contracts, so that the old law might remain in effect until one contractual period is over (e.g. if you have a yearly contract that will renew on 2022\\-12\\-01, the old regulation *might* be applicable until then)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A telecommunications contract was signed on 01/12/2021, referencing EU Regulation 531/2012 in its terms and conditions.

Your [clarification](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/56573/can-employer-legally-stop-paying-time-1-2-to-exempt-employee-after-stating-in#comment114621_56573) reflects that the notion of \"overtime\\-exempt\" is not contemplated in the contract at all, and the employer just brought it up belatedly.\n\nEven if the contract were ambiguous or contradicted itself in this regard, the [doctrine of *contra proferentem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_proferentem) would entitle you to the reasonable interpretation that favors your position (that is because the employer is the party who drafted the contract)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee is hired as a computer programmer on a 6-month contract with an agency. The written offer explicitly states they will be paid time and a half for overtime. Later, the agency informs the employee that they are classified as overtime-exempt and will no longer receive overtime pay. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The agency is legally obligated to stop paying overtime since the employee is classified as exempt.\n\nB) The agency can unilaterally change the terms of the contract at any time since the employee is exempt.\n\nC) The employee has no legal recourse because overtime exemption status overrides any written agreements.\n\nD) The agency is required to continue paying overtime as per the written contract terms, regardless of the employee's exempt status.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. According to the information provided, the written contract explicitly states that the employee will be paid time and a half for overtime. This forms a binding agreement between the parties. The fact that the employee may be classified as overtime-exempt under labor laws does not prohibit an employer from agreeing to pay overtime. The employer is still bound by the terms of the contract they offered and the employee accepted. The agency cannot unilaterally change these terms without the employee's agreement, regardless of the employee's exempt status. The doctrine of contra proferentem would also support interpreting any ambiguities in favor of the employee, as the employer drafted the contract. Therefore, the agency is required to continue paying overtime as per the written contract terms."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/55496/laws-blocking-the-use-of-dogs-to-detect-the-coronavirus-at-airports", "docs_id": 55496, "title": "Laws blocking the use of dogs to detect the coronavirus at airports?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Is there a law or regulation that prevents the use of dogs to detect the coronavirus at airports in the United States [as it is done already somewhere else](https://www.sfgate.com/travel/article/Coronavirus-sniffing-dogs-dubai-15454175.php#photo-19761801)? Do other countries have laws like these which block the use of dogs?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The issue is more likely that there is no law or regulation allowing the use of dogs to sniff passengers in the US for matters not related to crime, whereas Dubai, a monarchy, has a different political system. In general, you have the constitutional right to move about in the U and the right not to be unreasonably seized, a right which may not exist in some other jurisdictions. That right can be restricted in accordance with law, but there has to be some such law. It is not a crime to have covid, or to travel while infected (it is a crime to carry bombs and drugs on a plane).\n\nOne area where there is some restriction is where there always has been a restriction, namely entry into the US. There is (was) [covid screening](https://www.dhs.gov/coronavirus/protecting-air-travelers-and-american-public) at certain airports for flights from certain countries. [This directive](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/2020-05606.pdf) indicates the airport restrictions, but does not explain what screening will take place. The above DHS site says that \"the passenger will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and asked for contact information for local health authorities. Passengers will then be given written guidance about COVID\\-19 and directed to their final destination, and immediately home\\-quarantine in accordance with CDC best practices\". It is not clear whether a mandatory temperature check without even reasonable suspicion of a crime would constitute an unreasonable search (body searches are subject to higher standards than property searches, it seems), and constitutional law surrounding searches has emphasized the primacy of privacy in search law, not the fact of physically entering property of the body. Some airlines and airports offer voluntary temperature checking, so it might be possible if someone has a covid\\-sniffing dog to offer voluntary sniff testing, especially if it is offered by a private concern and does not have the appearance of government mandate (which would require a law)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the United States, what is the primary legal obstacle to implementing coronavirus-sniffing dogs at airports, as has been done in some other countries?\n\nA) There is a specific federal law prohibiting the use of dogs for disease detection at airports.\nB) The absence of a law or regulation explicitly permitting such use, coupled with constitutional protections against unreasonable searches.\nC) International aviation regulations that forbid the use of animals for passenger screening.\nD) Health and safety concerns about exposing dogs to potentially infected individuals.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The main legal obstacle in the US is not the existence of a law prohibiting such practices, but rather the absence of a law permitting them, combined with constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. In the US, citizens have the right to move freely and not be unreasonably seized, which can only be restricted by specific laws. Since having COVID-19 is not a crime, and there's no existing law allowing for such searches, implementing coronavirus-sniffing dogs would likely be seen as an unconstitutional intrusion without proper legal basis.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no specific federal law prohibiting the use of dogs for disease detection. The issue is the lack of a permissive law, not the existence of a prohibitive one.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect as there are no international aviation regulations specifically forbidding the use of animals for passenger screening. In fact, some countries like Dubai have implemented such measures.\n\nAnswer D, while potentially a practical concern, is not the primary legal obstacle.

This approach allows the applicant to maximize their chances of success. The Express Entry system uses a points-based system, and having a job in Canada adds significant points. Additionally, if the applicant receives a nomination through the OINP, it would add more points to their Express Entry profile. The OINP Masters Graduate Stream is also mentioned as a potential option, though it has specific requirements and deadlines.

If you're a contractor, you may end up in small claims court if they haven't paid in a reasonable time.

The key factors supporting this conclusion are:\n\n1. The agency set the schedule and provided instructions on how to do the job, which aligns with the control test for employment.\n2. The contract was sent after the work was completed, suggesting the agency recognized the need for formal documentation of an employment relationship.\n3. The individual was paid hourly, which is more typical of employee arrangements.\n\nThese factors strongly indicate an employer-employee relationship rather than a contractor arrangement. In British Columbia, employees must be paid within 48 hours if terminated by the employer, or within 6 days if they quit.

If the company under their control violates the rights of the minority shareholder(s), they are entitled to compensation from the majority shareholder(s) and/or the company, and they can and will sue them for that. Furthermore, any accounting irregularities, misrepresentations, faked reports, etc done during that process may easily push it from a mere civil claim into criminal charges.\n\nInvestor agreements and company bylaws\n--------------------------------------\n\n\"They can also kick the VC rep from the board since they own majority share.\" will be prevented by an investor rights agreement and modifications to the company charter and bylaws that mandate (for example) that a particular board seat will be controlled by that VC, and that this board seat will have a veto right over certain types of decisions \\- so the majority *can't* do whatever they want. The majority shareholders will also generally have a binding contractual agreement that they must vote in a particular way in certain aspects. \n\nDue diligence\n-------------\n\nA key part of most investment is due diligence review of the company current situation \\- the founders would be expected to agree to an invasive, thorough audit of their operations by the investors. This will include a review of any legal clauses, liabilities, etc. In addition, often the founders (personally) will be expected to sign so\\-called representations that affirm these details, and that they have disclosed all material aspects, and that they'll be personally liable for misrepresentations and omissions. In case of outright fraud (taking the money and running away) this will also be evidence in a criminal case that some misrepresentation was not just an accidental omission but an intentional act.\n\nTranches and clawback provisions\n--------------------------------\n\nIt's not that uncommon to have money disbursed in tranches conditional upon meeting certain provisions, and for any money that goes directly to founders it's not uncommon to see clawback provisions that state that the consequences of any misrepresentations will be taken out of these funds, possibly with large part of that money held in escrow for some time to cover that."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A venture capital firm is considering investing in a startup.
