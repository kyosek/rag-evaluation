These are two core [ethical principles](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/news_pub_judicialconduct_Principles_en.pdf) set out by the Canadian Judicial Council (CJC). (However, the CJC is clear that these principles \"do not set out standards for defining judicial misconduct.\")\n\nDepending on what is leading the judge to such a high rate of appellate intervention, the underlying cause may warrant removal. The possible reasons that the CJC can recommend a judge to be removed are listed at [s. 65(2\\)(a) to (d) of the *Judges Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/j-1/page-10.html#h-337775):\n\n> Where, in the opinion of the Council, the judge in respect of whom an inquiry or investigation has been made has become incapacitated or disabled from the due execution of the office of judge by reason of\n> \n> \n> (a) age or infirmity,\n> \n> \n> (b) having been guilty of misconduct,\n> \n> \n> (c) having failed in the due execution of that office, or\n> \n> \n> (d) having been placed, by his or her conduct or otherwise, in a position incompatible with the due execution of that office,\n> \n> \n> the Council, in its report to the Minister under subsection (1\\), may recommend that the judge be removed from office.\n\nFor some examples where the CJC recommended removal of a judge, see:\n\n* the [Report to the Minister of Justice re: Paul Cosgrove (2009\\)](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/Report_to_Minister_Justice_Cosgrove.pdf) (in which the CJC declined to consider whether serious incompetence could be a ground for removal; instead basing the recommendation for removal on serious misconduct that was damaging to the administration of jusice and the public's confidence in the judiciary);\n* the [Report to the Minister of Justice re: Robin Camp (2017\\)](https://cjc-ccm.ca/cmslib/general/Camp_Docs/2017-03-08%20Report%20to%20Minister.pdf).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Judge Smith has been serving on the bench for 15 years in Canada. Recently, it was discovered that 95% of her rulings have been overturned on appeal in the last 5 years. The Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) is reviewing her case. Which of the following is the MOST likely outcome based on the information provided?\n\nA) Judge Smith will face no consequences as appeal rates do not affect a judge's career.\n\nB) Judge Smith will be immediately removed from her position due to the high overturn rate.\n\nC) The CJC will investigate whether Judge Smith has failed in the due execution of her office or engaged in misconduct, potentially recommending removal.\n\nD) Judge Smith will be required to undergo additional training but will retain her position without further action.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While a high overturn rate alone doesn't automatically lead to removal, it suggests potential issues with the judge's performance or conduct. The CJC would likely investigate whether Judge Smith has \"failed in the due execution of that office\" or engaged in misconduct, as per the Judges Act. This investigation could potentially lead to a recommendation for removal, but it's not an immediate or guaranteed outcome.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while appeal rates don't directly affect a judge's career, such an extreme rate would likely have consequences and warrant investigation.\n\nOption B is too extreme, as immediate removal without investigation is not the typical process, even in severe cases.\n\nOption D is possible but unlikely to be the only action taken given the severity of the situation. The CJC would likely conduct a more thorough investigation before deciding on any course of action."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/9151/should-my-home-insurance-cover-the-costs", "docs_id": 9151, "title": "Should my home insurance cover the costs?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I live at Vancouver, BC, Canada. My fiancee and I are contracting a so\\-called [low\\-cost tenant home insurance with Square One](https://www.squareoneinsurance.ca/tenant-insurance). We've started this insurance 2 years ago and have been paying 44\\.27 CAD per month.\n\nAt the moment we signed for this insurance, I specifically asked the insurer a few questions of whether potential damages I could think of would be covered. Among these potential damages I asked whether a red wine stain on the carpet would be covered. The answer was \"yes\".\n\nRecently, I accidentally touched my glass of red wine with my elbow while eating and made a red wine stain on my carpet! I contacted (by phone) the insurance and they answered by email afterward:\n\n> We regret to inform you that your policy does not cover the loss reported to us. More specifically, your policy does not insure loss or\n>  damage to property you rent, except for the unintentional damage to the premises or contents resulting from fire, explosion, water damage\n>  or smoke insured under this policy. We direct you to Section 7\\.3\\.1 (e) of your insurance policy for the specific wordings.

Your insurance covers damage caused by fire, explosion, water damage or smoke. The \"premise\" is the place you're renting, and some examples of content that you are renting would be whatever furnishing came with the place, carpets, and curtains. By the written contract (based on their email summary), you are not covered for damage to rented carpeting owing to wine spillage. However, to be certain, you should look for the relevant portion of the contract to see if the language of the contract matches their conclusion about non\\-coverage. There is a tiny chance that the wording is actually ambiguous and they interpret the wording in a way favorable to them, but to make any progress if that is the case, you'd have to sue them, and hope that the court rules in your favor. \n\nOral amendments to contracts are sort of possible, but I think there is no chance that they would agree to your contention claim that that you have an oral modification of the contract. You would need to prove exactly what you asked and how they responded (something better than fervently maintaining that you asked X and they said Y because *nobody* actually remembers conversations verbatim from 2 years ago). Contracts usually have clauses saying that \"this contract is the whole contract\", explicitly denying that there can be oral amendments. This is a general rule for contracts in Canada: see [Gainers Inc. v. Pocklington Financial Corporation, 2000 ABCA 151 (CanLII)](http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2000/2000abca151/2000abca151.html)\n\n> When the deal is complete in the written contracts, and not subject to\n>  an escrow, other evidence (parol evidence) is inadmissible to vary or\n>  contradict a clear written contract: Chant v.

The insurance company denies the claim. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The tenant can easily win a lawsuit against the insurance company based on their verbal conversation from two years ago about wine stains being covered.\n\nB) The insurance company is legally obligated to cover the wine stain because it falls under \"unintentional damage to the premises.\"\n\nC) The tenant has no recourse and must accept the insurance company's decision without question.\n\nD) The tenant should carefully review the full policy wording to confirm the denial is consistent with the written contract, but based on the information provided, the denial appears to be in line with the policy terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement. The policy, as described, specifically limits coverage to damage from fire, explosion, water damage, or smoke. A wine stain doesn't fall into these categories. While the tenant remembers a conversation about wine stains being covered, oral modifications to contracts are generally not enforceable, especially when contracts often include clauses stating the written agreement is the entire contract. The tenant should review the full policy to ensure the denial aligns with the written terms, but based on the information provided, the insurance company's decision appears to be consistent with the policy.

The Administrative Penalty By-law specifically defines \"Extenuating Circumstances\" as a special or specified circumstance that partially or fully exempts a person from performance of a legal obligation to avoid an unreasonable or disproportionate burden or obstacle.

This standard allows the judge to consider a wide range of factors, including a parent's mental health diagnosis like Generalized Anxiety Disorder. However, the diagnosis itself doesn't automatically result in denial of custody (ruling out option A) or mandatory supervised visitation (ruling out option D). The court will evaluate how the condition affects the parent's ability to care for the child and the child's overall well-being.

This performance is presumably for a paying audience, of which the trio is expected to earn some performance royalties as a \"...life raft for the three of us.\"\n\n3. Does the composer receive any royalties from this particular performance? Or, from any contemporary public performance of his compositions still falling under copyright protection?\n4. If not from particular public performances, then is the composer's only source of royalties from publishing the written work (i.e. sheet music score)?\n\nPlease note that I'm using the present tense wherever I can here to inquire about how copyright protection and performance royalties work in the modern sense. I already have a *pretty* good idea (still unclear on some parts) how royalties work for contemporary popular rock/country/R\\&B music, etc.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: All that has changed is the identity of the copyright holder which has passed on to other(s) through the relevant laws for inheritance.

According to the information provided, multiple parties may have claims to royalties in this scenario. The composer's estate would likely receive royalties as the copyright holder of the musical composition, assuming the work is still under copyright protection. The orchestra may receive payment or royalties for their performance, depending on their contract with the record label. The record label would typically collect mechanical royalties from sales of the recording. Additionally, many countries have statutory royalty schemes for music that ensure various parties receive compensation.

In general, contracts are transferable without needing the agreement of all parties, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the contract. While it's understandable that the customer wanted proof of the transfer, they should have continued making payments as per the original contract terms while seeking clarification. Stopping payments likely put them in breach of the lease agreement, giving the lien-holder (whether the original company or the new one) the right to repossess the vehicle.

Another way of wording this question is: would federally decriminalizing marijuana mean that state criminalization is contradictory?\n\nProstitution for example is not a crime or even illegal under federal law, though it is a crime in almost every state. Given this example, it seems like marijuana would remain illegal under state law (if applicable), though I'm not confident about my intuition here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If such a bill passes as written, it removes any federal criminal prohibitions against marijuana (assuming their research was sufficiently thorough), and raises marijuana to the same legal status as celery salt, which simply is not mentioned by federal criminal law. There would be no federal declaration that marijuana is now legal, and therefore, when federal law is silent, state law can say something. If silence at the federal level precluded state law on the topic, there could be not any state law \u2013 the Supremacy Clause only addresses *conflicts*. The bill could also be written to include a positive declaration that there shall be no laws against marijuana, and *that* would create a conflict with state law.\n\nOften, conflicts are avoided by crafting a jurisdictional difference, such as having laws that only apply while on federal property, or w.r.t. federal employees. The Constitution is structured to separate what the federal government can do versus what state governments can do, so that conflicts don't arise \u2013 however, the Commerce Clause ends up being used to expand federal power (e.g. the Controlled Substances Act). As Nate Eldredge comments, there is a huge difference between what is allowed under federal vs. (certain) state laws w.r.t. fireworks, and even town\\-to\\-town variations in fireworks laws. Numerous \"professional\" acts are completely legal w.r.t. federal law but are illegal at the state level.

If federal legislation merely decriminalizes marijuana at the federal level without explicitly preempting state laws, existing state laws criminalizing marijuana would remain in effect. This is similar to other areas where federal law is silent but states have their own regulations, such as prostitution or certain professional licensing requirements. The Supremacy Clause only addresses conflicts between federal and state laws, not silence at the federal level. States would retain the authority to criminalize marijuana under their own laws, just as they do with many other substances or activities not explicitly addressed by federal criminal statutes. Options A and B are incorrect because federal decriminalization alone would not automatically invalidate state laws or require states to pass new laws.

To summarize, they imply that they would be legally protected from civil suits from former members who are being disciplined. Would this actually work? My first thought is that it doesn't make sense that a person who leaves cannot revoke their consent, especially since this wasn't a binding contract of any sort.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In [Guinn v. Church of Christ](https://law.justia.com/cases/oklahoma/supreme-court/1989/10494.html), plaintiff withdrew from the church after an internal investigation of her conduct. The church apparently held as a matter of religious doctrine that she must repent of her sins, also that withdrawing from the church is doctrinally impossible. The transgressions were widely publicized within the church; a lawsuit over outrage and invasion of privacy ensued. The upshot of the appeal is that the church can be held liable for post\\-withdrawal actions, but before that, the church has a privilege to communicate such transgressions (the church is not subject to secular judicature of its actions w.r.t. its members).\n\nContract law is not relevant here, what matters is that a person can knowingly and intelligently waive their right to litigate against a party, and while one is a member of the church which has such a waiver as part of their disciplinary doctrine, one cannot sue the church for its doctrinary actions as long as the actions do not constitute a threat to public safety which would justify state interference. Although the church argued that church membership is irrevocable, the court found that \"Just as freedom to worship is protected by the First Amendment, so also is the liberty to recede from one's religious allegiance\". Given that plaintiff had withdrawn consent yet the church subsequently announced the transgressions without her consent, the church was thus found to be liable.\n\nIn [Stepek v. Doe](https://casetext.com/case/stepek-v-doe), the court similarly affirmed that a church enjoys a privilege against charges of defamation, when the plaintiff continues to operate within the church, not having left the church.\n\nSo it can \"work\", to some extent. The person can always withdraw consent; the person has no legal recourse in case consent has not been withdrawn.

Based on legal precedents, what is likely to be the outcome?\n\nA) The church is fully protected from the lawsuit due to John's initial consent, regardless of his leaving.\nB) John's lawsuit will definitely succeed because he left the church before the announcement.\nC) The church will be held liable if they made the announcement after John left, but not if they made it before he left.\nD) The church has absolute immunity from such lawsuits due to religious freedom protections.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on legal precedents like Guinn v. Church of Christ, churches have a privilege to communicate transgressions of their members as part of their religious doctrine, and members cannot sue for such actions while they are part of the church. However, this privilege ends when a person leaves the church. If the church announced John's transgression after he left, they could be held liable. If they announced it before he left, they would likely be protected. The key factor is the timing of the announcement relative to John's departure from the church, not his initial consent or blanket religious protections."}, "11": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/82434/is-it-legal-to-report-the-amount-paid-to-the-lawyer-minus-the-disbursements-lawy", "docs_id": 82434, "title": "Is it legal to report the amount paid to the lawyer minus the disbursements lawyer had made by tax-year&#39;s end in 1099-NEC &quot;Nonemployee compensation&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Assume X,Y are positive real number and X\\<Y.

This approach helps avoid creating conflicting interpretations of the agreement or making promises that the company may not want to keep. Customer support representatives may not have the legal expertise to accurately interpret the ToS, which could lead to misunderstandings or incorrect information being given to users.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the website's refusal to clarify is not illegal.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because websites are not legally obligated to provide clarification of their ToS, even through their legal department.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because users do not have the right to freely interpret the ToS as they see fit. The ToS remains binding as written, regardless of the website's refusal to provide additional clarification.\n\nIf a user needs clarification on the ToS, they can either choose not to use the site or consult with their own lawyer to interpret the agreement's language and its implications under relevant laws."}, "15": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/92451/can-a-non-profit-organization-record-attendance-by-name-without-permission", "docs_id": 92451, "title": "Can a non-profit organization record attendance by name without permission?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have a GDPR question concerning a small non\\-profit organization. The organization is quite informal. Although it has many regular meetings, all these meetings are open to the public. As such, most of those who attend, even many regular attendees, are not officially registered members of the organization.\n\nThe organization would like to keep track of those who attend for follow\\-up purposes. I have three related questions about what the GDPR permits. In the first two cases, the organization does not make any formal announcement that it is tracking the attendance of whom attends. (However, attendance numbers are occasionally mentioned informally, so it is not a secret, either.)\n\nFirst, is it legal under the GDPR for the organization to take a count of how many people attend without recording any names? In this case, the organization groups the counts by the general age (child, teenager, or adult) and gender (male or female) of the attendees, but no names are recorded. These attendance numbers are shared among the organization members and are occasionally announced to all meeting attendees. (I would think that this is authorized.)\n\nSecond, is it legal under the GDPR for the organization to record the attendees by name, including their general age and gender as mentioned above? The names are obtained through informal contact with the attendees during meetings; attendees are never explicitly asked if they want their attendance recorded. These attendance lists with names are shared only among organization members on follow\\-up committees. (This is the main case that I have questions about under the GDPR.)\n\nThird, in case either or both of the above cases are not authorized under the GDPR, is there any legal way that attendance by name can be recorded and shared among designated organization members? The primary hesitation to formally requesting authorization is that the organization wants attendance records to be as accurate as possible and if some attendees do not grant authorization, then the records will never be accurate. I have heard that one way to accomplish this would be to verbally announce at the beginning of each meeting that attendance is recorded, or to conspicuously post a written notice to this effect at the entrance. Would either of these fulfill GDPR obligations? Or is there an alternative solution?\n\nIn any answer, I would appreciate it if you could cite specific relevant sections of the GDPR so that I can learn the law better.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The scope of the GDPR is entered when personal data is being processed in a structured manner.\n\nPersonal data is any information relating to identifiable data subjects (definition in Art 4(1\\)). \"Peter attended the meeting on the 14th\" is personal data. \"That woman with the blue handbag said she wanted to return on the 25th\" is personal data. However, aggregate statistics do not relate to individuals, and are typically not personal data. \"On the 14th, we had 25 attendees\" is not personal data.\n\nNot all use of personal data is within the scope of the GDPR. For example, the GDPR would not apply if two organizers talk about who attended the meeting. However, Art 2(1\\) says the GDPR applies when personal data\n\n* is processed wholly or partially with automated means (e.g. computers, smartphones), or\n* forms a filing system or is intended for a filing system (e.g. keeping notes on attendees, keeping attendance lists)\n\nIf GDPR applies, the organization would be responsible for ensuring compliance with its rules and principles, summarized in Art 5\\. Primarily, this means:\n\n* having a clear purpose for processing\n* selecting a suitable Art 6 legal basis for that purpose (e.g. *consent* or a *legitimate interest*)\n* only processing the minimum data necessary for achieving that purpose\n* determining and implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure compliance and security of the processing activities\n* preparing for data subject rights, in particular by providing an Art 13 privacy notice when collecting data from the data subjects\n\nThere are of course some complexities in the details. When the legal basis is \"consent\" (opt\\-in), the organization would have to ensure that this consent was freely given and sufficiently informed. Per Art 7(4\\), consent would not be freely given if that consent was a condition for access to the meeting. Using \"legitimate interest\" (opt\\-out) can be more flexible, but it requires performing a balancing test to show that the legitimate interest isn't outweighed by the data subjects' interests, rights, and freedoms. Roughly, relying on a legitimate interest is appropriate when the data subjects can reasonably expect the processing activity to occur.\n\nRegarding **point 1**, keeping general counts and aggregate statistics about attendees is probably OK since it wouldn't be personal data. If you are very conscientious about this, you could round all counts and use categories like \"0\\-4 attendees, 5\\-9 attendees\" for each facet, which makes it more difficult to make inferences about individuals. But the fundamental point is that all your data should relate to attendees as a whole, never to individuals.\n\nRegarding **point 2 and 3**, this is a question of legal basis. Since you gather names through informal conversations, I think that attendees would be weirded out if they learned that you kept detailed records on their attendance. So I think that you probably wouldn't have a legitimate interest here. However, being upfront with this and offering an opt\\-out could change this.\n\nOn the aspect of keeping detailed notes on data from informal conversations, I'd like to point out H\\&M's EUR 35 million fine back in 2020 (summary on [GDPRHub.eu](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=HmbBfDI_-_H%26M)). In a callcenter, managers used to have conversations with employees. These conversations touched on anything from vacation experiences to health problems, marriage problems, and religious beliefs. All of that is fine. What was not fine is that the managers went full Stasi and kept detailed notes about all of this on a shared drive and used that information for management decisions. This went on until a configuration error made those files accessible to all employees. This violated all the points in the basic compliance process outlined above: the records had no clear purpose, no suitable legal basis, contained way more data than necessary (and even Art 9 special categories of data like information on health or religious beliefs which have extra protection), did not have appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access, and did not fulfill data subject rights like the Art 13 right to be informed.\n\nIn case this non\\-profit is a church or religious organization that had its own comprehensive data protection rules before the GDPR came into force in 2018, those can continue to apply per Art 91\\. This could probably address some issues of legal basis, but cannot circumvent the GDPR's general principles.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A small non-profit organization wants to keep track of attendees at their public meetings.

Options A and C involve collecting personal data without proper consent or legal basis, violating key GDPR principles. Option D, while more transparent, still lacks a clear legal basis and doesn't provide attendees with an opt-out choice, which could be problematic under GDPR.

It is also common for foreign attorneys to take the New York bar exam \\- several thousand people do that each year \\- in which case they have a springboard to appear *pro hac vice* in other states. The NY exam is well\\-understood in this way, in terms of training and support that might be offered in the country of origin. But one\\-off appearances, particularly by in\\-house counsel, also take place routinely.\n\nMany states, including California, also have a category of \"foreign legal consultant\", someone who is retained to advise on the law of the specific foreign jurisdiction in question, but who isn't allowed to appear in court.\n\nIn the current version of the California Rules of Court, *pro hac vice* is covered in [Rule 9\\.40](https://www.courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index.cfm?title=nine&linkid=rule9_40). On its face, this rule only applies to attorneys who are \"eligible to practice before the bar of any United States court or the highest court in any state, territory, or insular possession of the United States\". There is a broad exception in 9\\.40(h),\n\n> This rule does not preclude the Supreme Court or a Court of Appeal from permitting argument in a particular case from a person who is not a licensee of the State Bar, but who is licensed to practice in another jurisdiction and who possesses special expertise in the particular field affected by the proceeding.\n\n\"Another jurisdiction\" is not facially limited to U.S jurisdictions, so it may be that the higher state courts could admit a foreign attorney. I do not know of an example either way.\n\nIn general, California's licensing requirements for lawyers have often been strictly interpreted. The State Bar Act (Business and Professions Code, 6000\\-6243\\) says that:\n\n> No person shall practice law in California unless the person is an active licensee of the State Bar.\n\nAn attorney appearing *pro hac vice* is temporarily registered with the State Bar once their application has been approved by the court. This general licensing regime, which aims to protect the public against dishonest or incompetent practitioners, has been held (e.g. in *Birbrower v. Superior Court* 17 Cal. 4th 119 (1998\\)) to imply\n\n> a strong public policy favoring the practice of law in California by licensed State Bar members.\n\nOccasional admission *pro hac vice* does not extend to doing regular legal work of other kinds, including giving legal advice, preparing documents, and so on \\- and certainly not to maintaining a permanent physical office in California, or advertising to the public. If you would like to do those things then the state would like you to take their own bar exam, in which case (if you pass!) you are in the same situation as any other California lawyer.\n\nThere is a fairly recent exception for international commercial arbitration (*not* applicable to normal arbitration about things like disputes over personal property).

In that context, saying lewd and suggestive things about the courier whom a member employs over a poker game with the people who run all of her main stops in connection with her job might have a causal nexus for harassment case purposes with her job, effectively enlisting everyone she has to do business with in her job in a campaign of harassment against her.\n\nIn contrast, suppose that someone who is engaging in iffy conduct that doesn't quite cross the line of harassment at work towards this courier goes to that Pessimists Club meeting and targets his crass comments not at the courier but his ex\\-girlfriend towards whom he has engaged in lots of harassing conduct. His comments about his ex\\-girlfriend would not have a causal nexus to the courier's workplace and probably wouldn't be something that could be considered to determine if he was engaged in workplace harassment. This would be true even though small town gossip made his harassment of his ex\\-girlfriend common knowledge which make the courier take otherwise ambiguous conduct from him much more seriously knowing his modus operandi and capacity for escalating the situation.\n\nBut, ultimately, one has to make a rather holistic evaluation of the entire situation to determine if there is a causal nexus or not between non\\-workplace behavior and alleged workplace harassment.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A senior manager at a large corporation frequently attends industry conferences.

In order to unify \"reasonable doubt\", \"reasonable price\", \"reasonable delay\" and so on, appeal is often made a mythical being, \"the reasonable man\", so reasonable force would be the degree of force the reasonable man would use in a given situation. I will draw from California criminal instructions ('cuz I have them) but similar instructions can be found across jurisdictions. For example, one instructions says \"A natural and probable consequence is one that a reasonable person would know is likely to happen if nothing unusual intervenes\". Or from a negligence instruction \"A reasonable person would have known that acting in that\nway would create such a risk\". More detailed appeal to The Reasonable Person is found in the justified homicide instruction:\n\n> Defendant\u2019s belief must have been reasonable and (he/she) must have\n>  acted only because of that belief. The defendant is only entitled to\n>  use that amount of force that a reasonable person would believe is\n>  necessary in the same situation. If the defendant used more force than\n>  was reasonable, the \\[attempted] killing was not justified.\n> \n> \n> When deciding whether the defendant\u2019s beliefs were reasonable,\n>  consider all the circumstances as they were known to and appeared to\n>  the defendant and consider what a reasonable person in a similar\n>  situation with similar knowledge would have believed. If the\n>  defendant\u2019s beliefs were reasonable, the danger does not need to have\n>  actually existed.\n> \n> \n> The defendant\u2019s belief that (he/she/ \\[or] someone else) was threatened\n>  may be reasonable even if (he/she) relied on information that was not\n>  true. However, the defendant must actually and reasonably have\n>  believed that the information was true.\n\nThere is no explanation of what it means to be \"a reasonable person\". Since nobody believes that they themselves are unreasonable, a simple and also wrong way of judging the matter is to subjectively judge whether *you yourself* would do the same thing, if you were in that situation. \n\nVery often, instructions do not even bother to say what \"reasonable\" means, so (re interpreting expert testimony) \"You may disregard any opinion that you find unbelievable, unreasonable, or unsupported by the evidence\"; (re *corpus delicti*) \"That other evidence may be slight and need only be enough to\nsupport a reasonable inference that a crime was committed\"; \"Also, before you may rely on circumstantial evidence to find the\ndefendant guilty, you must be convinced that the only reasonable\nconclusion supported by the circumstantial evidence is that the\ndefendant is guilty\", \"when considering circumstantial evidence, you must accept only reasonable conclusions and reject any that are unreasonable\"\n\nThe closest the law has come to articulating an objective characterization of \"reasonableness\" is in \"reasonable doubt\" instructions. One characterization is in [People v. Feldman, 71 N.E. 2d 433](http://brooklynworks.brooklaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1293&context=faculty). \n\n> It is not a doubt based upon sympathy or a whim or prejudice or bias\n>  or a caprice, or a sentimentality, or upon a reluctance of a\n>  weak\\-kneed, timid, jellyfish of a juror who is seeking to avoid the\n>  performance of a disagreeable duty, namely, to convict another human\n>  being of the commission of a serious crime\n\nA somewhat improved characterization is the Calcrim instruction\n\n> Proof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof that leaves you with an\n>  abiding conviction that the charge is true. The evidence need not\n>  eliminate all possible doubt because everything in life is open to\n>  some possible or imaginary doubt\n\nThere is room for improvement, but it points in the right direction.\n\nOn rare occasions, a law is written that actually includes a definition. [The Gas Price Spike Act HR 3784](https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/3784/text) said\n\n> The term \u2018reasonable profit\u2019 means the amount determined by the\n>  Reasonable Profits Board to be a reasonable profit on the sale.\n\nIt is then up to the board to subjectively determine what that profit is. (BTW this did not become law). \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nIt's actually very difficult to determine what reasoning judges use in those cases where they are the determiners of fact. They will likely call on their knowledge of law, asking \"are these circumstances sufficiently like past circumstance A where the defendant was convicted, or more like B where the defendant was acquitted\".", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In legal contexts, how is the concept of \"reasonableness\" typically determined in court cases?\n\nA) Judges always make the final decision on what is considered reasonable in every case.\nB) The law provides precise definitions for terms like \"reasonable\" and \"sufficient\" in all statutes.\nC) Juries or fact-finders often determine reasonableness based on the concept of a \"reasonable person\" and guided by jury instructions.\nD) Reasonableness is solely determined by precedent set in previous similar cases.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The passage explains that jurors (or judges when acting as fact-finders) typically determine what is \"reasonable\" in legal contexts. They are often guided by jury instructions that refer to the concept of a \"reasonable person\" - a hypothetical individual who exercises average care, skill, and judgment in conduct. The instructions may ask jurors to consider what a reasonable person would do in similar circumstances.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because judges do not always make this determination; it's often left to juries. Answer B is incorrect because the passage specifically mentions that laws often use vague terms without precise definitions.

The following is only as an \"example.\"\n\nIf you set up an LLC in the Seychelles, you could, in theory, avoid American tax by accruing income there. In practice, if you did nothing but \"banking\" in the Seychelles, America would look at your lack of \"value added\" there, and could tax you on Seychelles income as if your corporation was American.\n\nThe way to make such a claim stick (typically in a place like Ireland), is to set up a manufacturing or operating facility (e.g. call center) there so that you were shipping goods or services from your offshore operation.

Option B is wrong because it misunderstands how the U.S. treats foreign owners of LLCs for tax purposes.\n6.

Is it a factor in libel?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A statement cannot be libel unless it actually identifies the plaintiff to defame him. The identification need not be by name, but it must be specific enough that the public would be able to determine who the statement referred to.

Residential fences are often governed by specific local laws at the municipal or county level in the US, so no generally applicable answer is possible, short of a book giving laws for each locality.\n\nCommon\\-Law Rules\n-----------------\n\nUnder the common law, followed by many but far from all US jurisdictions, the key question is whether a fence is a \"partition fence\" or not. A partition fence is one built on or near the property line that is owned jointly by the owners of the properties it divides.\n\nA fence near the property line is probably a partition fence if:\n\n* The two property owners jointly built or paid for the building of the fence;\n* Parts of the fence are on each side of the property line;\n* The owners have agreed that the fence is common property; or\n* Both owners \"use\" the fence, as by connecting it to another fence running in a different direction, or by relying on it to contain domestic animals.\n\nA Fence is probably not a partition fence if:\n\n* It is entirely clear of the property line;\n* Only the owner on whose property it rests maintains it; and\n* Only the owner on whose property it rests uses it.\n\nThe owner of one of the properties may not remove, demolish, or modify a partition fence without permission from the other. Removing or modifying a partition fence without the permission of the owner of the adjacent property is a tort, and can lead to damages for the value of the fence begin awarded.\n\nThe owners must each maintain a partition fence, often each caring for his or her side. Failing to do so may be a tort.\n\nIf a fence is not a partition fence, the owner of the land is also the sole owner of the fence, and may modify or remove it without permission from, or notice to, the owner of any adjacent or nearby property.\n\nHowever, the above common\\-law rules may be modified by local laws, and one would be wise to check, or consult a lawyer who knows how to check, before making any demands.\n\nSources\n-------\n\n* The page [\"Removal or Destruction of Fences\"](https://fences.uslegal.com/removal-or-destruction-of-fences/) from US legal reads:\n\n> A fence is an enclosure creating an adequate blockade around a particular land for the purpose of prohibiting intrusions from outside. A landowner can remove a fence, separating his/her land from that of his/her neighbor, when such fence is located wholly upon his/her own land. However, a landowner is not empowered to remove a partition fence without the adjacent landowner\u2019s consent. A partition fence is the joint property of adjacent landowners.\n> \n> \n> A fence erected on the line between the lands of adjoining owners generally belongs to the parties as tenants in common. Generally, a partition fence is built equally on both sides of the line. Until the contrary is shown, the partition fence is presumed to be the common property of both owners. An owner of adjoining land can remove a partition fence upon formal notice to adjacent landowners.\n> \n> \n> For an improper removal of a partition fence, an aggrieved party can bring an action for damages. The standard for measuring damages for such removal or destruction is its value at the time. The value is determined by replacement costs minus depreciation for age and use. Moreover, when someone builds a fence on another person\u2019s land without any authority to do so, the landowner can remove or destroy such fence. A person is liable for removing, destroying, or injuring a fence belonging to another person just as one who commits such acts against any kind of property belonging to another is liable\\[i]. Such person is considered a tortfeasor. However, an individual cannot remove or destroy a fence on another individual\u2019s land without his/her consent.\n\n* The page [\"Property Line and Fence Laws in Maryland\"](https://www.findlaw.com/state/maryland-law/property-line-and-fence-laws-in-maryland.html) from FindLaw reads, in relevant part:\n\n> Maryland doesn't have specific rules dealing with fences. Instead, the state follows the common law practice that a fence built along a boundary line is owned in common by both property owners when both use the fence, unless otherwise agreed. A property owner is said to use a fence when they \"hook\\-up\" to the fence with another row of fence, or keep animals in the enclosure created by the fence. A fence built and used only by the builder is that person's sole property. When you purchase a new home, you take a property with an existing fence built and used by prior owners. Simply put, if you buy a property with a co\\-owned fence, you likely need to continue your maintenance of the fence.\n\n* The page [\"Is it legal for the neighbor to remove a fence on our shared property line?\"](https://answers.justia.com/question/2019/05/28/is-it-legal-for-the-neighbor-to-remove-a-693710) from Justia's \"Ask a Lawyer\" feature reads:\n\n> If both landowners paid to install a fence directly on a property line in the past, then yes, they need your permission to remove or replace the fence. Many fences are not built on a property line, but are instead just on one property or the other.\n> \n> \n> If you have had your land surveyed, you may be able to determine your exact property line. You or your neighbor are free to build new fences without permission as long as neither the fence nor any construction or excavation encroaches on the other's property.\n> \n> \n> Fences are a common property dispute, and can have long term effects. If a fence encroaches significantly on someone else's land for many years, this can actually become the new legal property line in some cases.\n\nAccording to the \"Fences\" section of the page [\"Disputes between your neighbours\"](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/for-the-public/common-legal-issues/disputes-between-your-neighbours/) from th New Zealand Law Society:\n\nIn New Zealand this is regulated by the Fencing Act 1978\\. Except where modified by individual agreements:\n\n> * Fences must be on the boundary line, though there is provision for give and take where the true boundary is difficult to fence.\n> * The cost of building or repairing a fence is borne equally between adjoining owners, unless one owner damages it, in which case the cost of repairs will fall on that owner.\n> * You can compel your neighbour to contribute to the cost of the fence bordering your two properties by following the procedures set out in the Fencing Act ...\n> * Developers of new subdivisions usually exempt themselves from contributing to the cost of a fence.\n> * Under the Property Law Act 2007, it is possible to apply to a District Court for an order to remove or alter a fence that is detrimentally affecting land or obstructing a view. Usually the cost of any removal falls on the person applying for the order.\n\n* The Booklet [\"Fences and the Law](https://Flsc.sa.gov.au/resources/FencesandtheLawBooklet.pdf) from the Legal Services Commission, South Australia states, on page 2:\n\n> Fences should be regarded as a joint\n> asset between neighbours.

We have flu vaccines. The flu kills, I believe, **hundreds, thousands of people every year**. OSHA has never purported to regulate on that basis.\u201d (bold type added)\n\nI always considered the lack of a conjunction before the last instance of some should *not* be interpreted as the logical conjunction between operands; the relationship is represented as ambiguous as to whether it is conjunctive or disjunctive and therefore it states both remaining silent and not including a grammatical conjunction. It should be used and interpreted as \u201cand/or\u201d. Just like how allegedly it is used here.\n\nBut the English language does not use it that way. It is seen often in the terse titles of the publications of the press. For e.g. \u201cU.S., EU to discuss Russian war threat Friday\u201d.\n\nAnd for their social consensus that the lack of a grammatical conjunction means the conjunctive operator (\u201cand\u201d), the above statement would mean the following:\n\n> \u201cThe flu kills, I believe, hundreds \\[and] thousands of people every year.\u201d\n\nNow who says that in the U.S.? Who says that? No one. Close idioms would be \u201cthousands and thousands\u201d, \u201cmillions and millions\u201d or Trump\u2019s favorite: \u201cbillions and billions\u201d. There is no such idiom as \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d in General American. And no one says \u201chundreds, thousands\u201d anywhere.\n\nAnd Gorsuch never said that. It\u2019s just another level when it turns out the Wise of the nation has a(t least one) conspiracy theorist idiot among them so he had to back track.\n\nI tried reviewing and rehearing the oral arguments and search for the alleged incorrect version as well as the allegedly corrected version, but found neither versions neither in the [transcript](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2021/21a240_7648.pdf) nor in the [audio](https://www.supremecourt.gov/media/audio/mp3files/21A240.mp3).\n\nNow, since at most of the time there is silence while one speaks in the oral arguments before the Supreme Court, it is plausible that even the audio was doctored and the part where he would actually say \u201chundreds **of** thousands\u201d (bold type added) the word \u201cof\u201d is deleted and a new audio is up now. But it is theoretically possible that the audio still includes the word \u201cof\u201d.\n\nSo, how does neither the transcript or the audio include these remarks of Gorsuch and where are the actual files that would at least include *one* of the alleged versions?\n\nOn the backwater of this: Has the Supreme Court ever been caught falsifying its own transcripts, for example, to avoid ridicule or considerable face loss or Gorsuch would be the proud first?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Gorsuch said it in the oral arguments on [*National Federation of Independent Business v.

Here's a fun little example (*Saint John Tug Boat Co. Ltd. v. Irving Refining Ltd.*, [\\[1964] S.C.R. 614](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1964/1964canlii88/1964canlii88.pdf)).\n\nThe plaintiff was a tug boat company who was providing tug services for the defendant who operated an oil refinery. The large crude oil tankers coming into the refinery needed tug guidance and the plaintiff provided this. There was an undisputed verbal acceptance of a written offer for services from June 13, 1961 to July 13, 1961\\. The agreement was expressly extended twice, each for two weeks, into August 1961\\. No further authorization for extension was made.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff continued to provide tug service for the incoming tankers and continued sending monthly invoices to the defendant until February 1962\\. The defendant did not pay and denied liability for all charges after the middle of August 1961\\.\n\nThe trial judge said:\n\n> I find that the defendant knew that the *Ocean Rockswift* continued after August 1, 1961, in commission on call to assist and did assist the large tankers during the period in question, and that the plaintiff expected payment on a rental basis for its being kept in commission. The defendant had ample opportunity to notify the plaintiff that it did not accept any liability on that basis, but did not do so. **The defendant acquiesced in the tug being so employed**.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada quoted from Anson on Contracts:\n\n> So if A allows B to work for him under such circumstances that no reasonable man would suppose that B meant to do the work for nothing, A will be liable to pay for it. The doing of the work is the offer; the permission to do it, or the acquiescence in its being done, constitutes the acceptance.\n\nAnd from Williston on Contracts:\n\n> Silence may be so deceptive that it may become necessary for one who receives beneficial services to speak in order to escape the inference of a promise to pay for them.\n\nBut the Supreme Court of Canada clarified:\n\n> ... mere failure to disown responsibility to pay compensation for services rendered is not of itself always enough to bind the person who has the benefit of those services. The circumstances must be such as to give rise to an inference that the alleged acceptor has consented to the work being done on the terms upon which it was offered before a binding contract will be implied.\n\n---\n\nThis answer shows how silence can play a role from a pure common law contract perspective, without considering equitable principles.

Employment agreements that claim ownership of employees' creations are common and often enforceable, but the interpretation can vary based on the specific wording and circumstances. The phrase \"not otherwise related to my job responsibilities\" creates a gray area for items that could be useful for work but weren't specifically developed for or used at work. This ambiguity means that ownership could depend on how broadly a court interprets the agreement's language and the nature of the employee's job responsibilities.

He called the gym to cancel his membership, but they insisted he come in person to cancel, which he couldn't do due to his condition. The gym continued to charge him for these 3 months. According to Florida law, what is John's best course of action?\n\nA) John has no recourse since he didn't cancel in person as requested by the gym.\nB) John should file a complaint with the Better Business Bureau against the gym for unfair practices.\nC) John should provide written notice of cancellation to the gym along with a doctor's certification of his disability.\nD) John can ignore the charges since the gym's cancellation policy violates state law.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Florida Statute 501.017, gym contracts must include a provision for cancellation if the buyer becomes physically unable to use a substantial portion of the services. The law states that the buyer must provide written notice of cancellation and may be required to furnish proof of disability from a licensed physician. Therefore, John's best course of action is to provide written notice of cancellation along with a doctor's certification of his disability. This approach complies with the legal requirements and gives John the strongest position for cancelling his contract and potentially receiving a refund for the period he was unable to use the gym.\n\nOption A is incorrect because Florida law doesn't require in-person cancellation. Option B, while potentially helpful, doesn't directly address the legal requirements for cancellation.

But here goes:\n\nLast summer my family and I took a two week road trip all over western Canada, visiting Victoria, Edmonton, and lots of stops along the way. I noticed during our trip that practically every hotel we stayed at had a pool with a water slide. Some of these water slides were very high; being two and three stories tall even. \n\nI've worked in the hospitality industry before, and I know that \\-\\- in America at least \\-\\- very few hotels have water slides because they are an insurance nightmare for the property. If you own a hotel with a water slide in the US, you pay through the nose for insurance because it's practically a given that at some point, there will be an accident, someone will get hurt, and you will likely get sued over it regardless of whose fault it may have been. That's why the few that do have water slides have limited hours and charge you extra to use it. The slides always empty into a special pool or at least a roped\\-off area in the main pool that is off\\-limits to regular swimmers. There is usually a lifeguard posted to shoo people toward the exit so that the pool is clear for the next rider. There are also signs *everywhere* warning swimmers about how dangerous it can be. This is just the kind of thing Americans expect to see at a water park.\n\nWhat was peculiar to me is that the slides I encountered in Canada generally just emptied right into the main pool where other people are swimming. There were no lifeguards, few warning signs, and they were free to use as long as the pool was open. I used them a few times and you come out of them pretty fast. Very fun, but I thought it was strange that it was entirely up to me and my wife to keep our kids away from the slide so they didn't get hit by people coming down (which I'm fine with by the way \\-\\- it's called *parenting* and I'm totally OK with that).\n\nMy point is that it's a common criticism in America that we are a sue\\-happy country where we just expect that there will be a lawsuit when somebody gets hurt, whereas in Canada I got the distinct impression that people are fully expected to take their own personal responsibility to not be stupid around the water slide.\n\nIs this impression correct?

What can a data subject do to prevent further distribution of PII when trying to access data from a potentially untrustworthy data controller? Is there actually a solution that both provides for data security for the subject and verification of identify to the data controller?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Overview\n--------\n\nThe GDPR requires data controllers (DCs) to exercise reasonable care when responding to an access, modification, or deletion request, to ensure that it comes from the actual Data Subject (person whose data is involved, here a DS). The GDPR does not specify just what methods must or may be used to ensure that an access (or other) request comes from the DS. It does say, in Article 12, that \"additional information\" may be requested from the DS by the DC for this purpose that is \"necessary to confirm the identity\" of the DS.\n\nIf a DC receives data for identification purposes, it must be used only for those purposes, and retained no longer than needed.\n\nPersonal Data (PD) in general must be limited according to article 5, so that data is used only for the purposes it was collected for, retained for no longer than needed, adn appropriately secured against unauthorized use or access. The DC is responsible for adhering to these limitations. Recitals 57, 59, and 77 (quoted below) confirm this, and discuss identification.\n\nIf a DC violates these restrictions, it is subject to the same enforcement as it would be for violating any other GDPR provision.\n\nIf a DS thinks the data requested to support identification of the DS is excessive, the DS may first complain to the DC, and then to the relevant supervisory authority if the response from the DC is not acceptable (allow at least 1 month for a response). But perhaps knowing that the GDPR forbids the DC from distributing or using this data except for the purpose it was collected, that is, to identify the DS, and from retaining it longer than need be, might offer some reassurance.\n\nA DS could also ask the DC what is the minimum data needed for identification, and redact data beyond this. The DC might need more than name and address, but not all that is on a bank statement or other ID document.\n\nGDPR Sources\n------------\n\n[Article 12](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-12-gdpr/) (section 6\\) of the GDPR reads:\n\n> Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.\n\nThat includes access requests.\n\nParagraph 1 of [Article 11](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-11-gdpr/) reads:\n\n> If the purposes for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no longer require the identification of a data subject by the controller, the controller shall not be obliged to maintain, acquire or process additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with this Regulation.\n\nParagraph 1(b) of [article 5](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/) specifies that personal data shall be :\n\n> collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;\n\nParagraph 1(c) of art 5 specifies that such data shall be:\n\n> limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ...\n\nParagraph 1(e) of art 5 specifies that such data shall be;\n\n> kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for **no longer than is necessary** for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; \\[emphasis added]\n\nParagraph 1(f) of art 5 further specifies that such data shall be:\n\n> processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing\n\n[Recital 59](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-59/) reads:\n\n> Modalities should be provided for facilitating the exercise of the data subject\u2019s rights under this Regulation, including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means for requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data are processed by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue delay and at the latest within one month and to give reasons where the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests.\n\n[Recital 57](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-57/) reads:\n\n> If the personal data processed by a controller do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional information in order to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of complying with any provision of this Regulation. However, the controller should not refuse to take additional information provided by the data subject in order to support the exercise of his or her rights. 3Identification should include the digital identification of a data subject, for example through authentication mechanism such as the same credentials, used by the data subject to log\\-in to the on\\-line service offered by the data controller.\n\n[Recital 77](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-77/) reads:\n\n> Guidance on the implementation of appropriate measures and on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the processor, especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the processing, their assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood and severity, and the identification of best practices to mitigate the risk, could be provided in particular by means of approved codes of conduct, approved certifications, guidelines provided by the Board or indications provided by a data protection officer.

The liability araises only at the user who uses it illegally.\n\n> But if so, would it then make a difference if the offline program decodes the file into system RAM only, and not to a file on disk?\n\nNo. Think about an ISO file.

The encoding process is reversible, meaning the original work can be fully reconstructed. According to copyright law, creating any copy of a copyrighted work without permission, regardless of the format or encoding method, is an infringement. The uploader cannot legitimately claim they randomly generated the art, as this would be considered perjury. The end-user who downloads and decodes the file is also potentially liable, but this doesn't negate the uploader's initial infringement.

What legal recourse do I have if I want to do that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Musical compositions can be, and if recent almost always are, protected by copyright. This is separate from the copyright on a recording of a performance of the work.\n\nIf you reuse a musical passage, the new work may be a *derivative work*, that is a work based on an earlier work. Or an extended musical quotation could be considered to be copyright infringement.\n\nIf this is in the [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\") the use of a section from a previous work **might** be considered to be a *fair use* ([fair\\-use](/questions/tagged/fair-use \"show questions tagged 'fair-use'\")). This is a specifically US concept in copyright law, although several other countries have a concept of *fair dealing* which is somewhat similar, although narrower.\n\nWhether a use is a fair use is an inherently fact\\-based determination. There is no clear and simple bright line for what is and is not a fair use. US law ([17 USC 197](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#107)) specifies four factors which are to be weighed by a court in considering the matter:\n\n1. **The purpose and character of the use**. If your use is commercial that weighs against fair use, but does not at all preclude it. This factor also includes whether the use is *transformative* or not. A transformative use is one that takes the part used for a very different sort of purpose than the original. Parodies are normally transformative, for example. A quote for purposes of commentary and analysis, or criticism is normally transformative. Transformative uses are more likely to be considered fair uses.\n2. **The nature of the copyrighted work**. Creative works such as fiction and *music* are more strongly protected than works such as textbooks and news stories. This probably weighs against fair use in the case described.\n3. **The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole**. If only a short section of a longer work is used, that weighs in favor of fair use. However very short quotes can still fail, to be held to be fair uses. In [*Harper vs Nation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper_%26_Row_v._Nation_Enterprises) a quote of about 300 words from a 500 page book was held not to be fair use because it was \"the heart of the book\".\n4. **The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.** A use that significantly harms the market value of the original, or serves as a replacement for it, weigh strongly against fair use. This was a major factor in *Harper vs Nation*.\n\nEach case of claimed fair use is evaluated by looking at all four factors, and the specific facts of the case.\n\nFrom the description in the question, such a use might well be held to be fair use. Musical quotations often are. But there is no way to be sure unless a court evaluates the specific case. A lawyer specifically experienced in not only copyright law, but copyrights on music, might be able to give more specific advice.\n\nOr you could, of course, seek permission from the copyright holder, quite likely the original composer or artist. If you get permission, there is no further issue. There might be a charge, but when the use is minor, and has no commercial effect, the charge might be small or even zero provided that the source is acknowledged.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A musician wants to use a short riff from a copyrighted song in their new composition, significantly transforming it into a different style.

In the United States, using a portion of a copyrighted work might be considered fair use, but it's not automatic. Fair use is determined by evaluating four factors:\n\n1. The purpose and character of the use (including whether it's transformative)\n2. The nature of the copyrighted work\n3. The amount and substantiality of the portion used\n4.

You could make the same request of the \"third party company\" but they are probably acting as a Data Processor (DP) in which case the obligation is on the DC.\n\nYou could also make a data access request under [Article 15](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-15-gdpr/) winch states:\n\n> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and the following information:\n\nThis is followed by a list of the details to be provided by the DC.\n\n> 2.

If the data begin processed does not include \"special\" data (mostly Personally Identifiable Information) \" and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons\" no representative is required. You are entitled to request the contact info of the representative. (A DC not in the EU must also have a representative.)\n\n> 3. Can the third\\-party share it with a company in EU country\n\nUnder \\[Article 44] transfers to counties outside the EU are restricted:\n\n> Any transfer of personal data which are undergoing processing or are intended for processing after transfer to a third country or to an international organisation shall take place only if, subject to the other provisions of this Regulation, the conditions laid down in this Chapter are complied with by the controller and processor, including for onward transfers of personal data from the third country or an international organisation to another third country or to another international organisation. 2All provisions in this Chapter shall be applied in order to ensure that the level of protection of natural persons guaranteed by this Regulation is not undermined.\n\nArticles 45 thru 50 specify the specific situations under whch such transfers are lawful.

Additional tracking might not be.

The customer discovers that these emails contain tracking pixels that record when the email is opened. The customer, who did not consent to this tracking, wants to know their legal rights. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation under GDPR?\n\nA) The customer has no legal recourse because email tracking is a standard business practice.\n\nB) The customer can immediately sue the Irish company for violating their privacy rights under GDPR.\n\nC) The customer should first request information from the Irish company about the data collection and processing, and if unsatisfied, can file a complaint with the Data Protection Commission.\n\nD) The customer can demand that the third-party IT system, based in the UK, immediately delete all collected data without contacting the Irish company.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate course of action is for the customer to first request information from the Irish company about the data collection and processing. Under GDPR Articles 13 and 14, the company should have informed the customer about the data collection, its purpose, and the customer's rights. If the customer is unsatisfied with the response, they can then file a complaint with the Data Protection Commission, which is Ireland's supervisory authority for GDPR matters. \n\nOption A is incorrect because email tracking without consent or proper notification can violate GDPR. Option B is incorrect because GDPR generally doesn't give individuals the right to directly sue companies; complaints typically go through supervisory authorities. Option D is incorrect because the customer should first address the issue with the Irish company (the data controller) rather than the third-party processor, and immediate deletion without proper procedure is not typically mandated."}, "45": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78128/acquiring-dual-citizenship", "docs_id": 78128, "title": "Acquiring Dual citizenship", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Student seeking further studies going abroad returns back to his motherland after completing his / her post graduation.

Indeed many countries will permit the student to vote by absentee ballot during the period of study.\n\nUnless the student has done something that the laws of the birth country consider to be a reason for losing voting rights or citizenship, there is no issue here. No such thing is mentioned in the question as it now stands. Indeed since the question asks about the student acquiring dual citizenship, it implies that the student has retained citizenship in the birth country, and so presumably voting rights there. The motive suggested for dual citizenship thus does not seem to make sense.\n\nTo acquire citizenship in the country of study the student would need to go through whatever process that country's laws specify. In most countries that includes a statement of intention to remain permanently in that country, and some evidence supporting that intention. The process is also likely to take rather longer than a typical course of graduate study. It is unusual for a student to gain citizenship in a country of study while still a student. It is still more unusual for a student to gain such citizenship and then return, not for just a visit, to the student's birth country.\n\nSome countries allow people being naturalized to retain citizenship in another country, some do not. Some countries allow a person who gains citizenship in another country to retain his or her birth citizenship, others do not.\n\nIf the country of study permits migrants to retain another citizenship while being naturalized, and the birth country permits a citizen to retain citizenship while being naturalized elsewhere, **and**, the student complies with the laws of the country of study for gaining its citizenship, then the student will have obtained dual citizenship. This is unusual, but it is perfectly possible if the laws om the countries involved permit it, and a good many do. But obtaining citizenship in a new country with which one had no previous connection is generally not a simple or quick process.\n\nNow, if one of the student's parents had been a citizen of the country of study, then the student might be able to obtain citizenship there by inheritance.

According to the documentation, a student who studies abroad and returns to their home country typically retains their original citizenship and voting rights. The student would not automatically lose Indian citizenship or voting rights (ruling out A and D). Obtaining German citizenship is not a quick or easy process, especially for someone who has returned to their home country (ruling out B). To be eligible for German citizenship, the student would generally need to return to Germany with the intention of permanent residence and go through a lengthy naturalization process.

Their APIs are means to access this streaming service on multiple platforms (e.g. computer, smart phone, etc).\n\nIt is almost certain\\* that the license does not allow for the creation of \"derivative works\" of the copyrighted work, which a video game would be. Thus, streaming services do not have the right to give you API access for a game (and why would they want to, even if they did have that right)?\n\nBy explicitly denying you the ability to so use their service, the streaming services are a) not breaching their license, and b) attempting to indemnify themselves in the case you do somehow use their API to play copyrighted music in your game.\n\n\\*The license would have to explicitly allow for the creation of derivative works; the copyright holders wouldn't give it away for free, because some game developers, such as the makers of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band series of games, would be willing to pay for them; as far as I know, there is not a streaming service producing a rhythm game, so it would not be in the streaming services' interest to pay for such an extension of their license.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A game developer wants to create a rhythm game that integrates music from popular streaming services.

Streaming services typically obtain licenses from copyright holders to stream music, but these licenses generally do not include the right to create derivative works, which games would be considered. The streaming services cannot grant rights they don't possess, so they explicitly prohibit such use in their terms of service. This protects them from potential copyright infringement claims and ensures they don't breach their own licensing agreements with copyright holders.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the issue is not technological but legal.

A good overview of the issues is present [at the Wikipedia post on the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_student_employee_unionization), whose supporting citation links have mostly rotted.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) denied the right of graduate students at private colleges to unionize in 2004 in a case involving Brown University which was reversed by the NLRB on August 23, 2016\\.\n\nThis did not prevent graduate students at public universities, which are outside the jurisdiction of the NLRB from unionizing, however. Graduate students at the University of Illinois at Urbana\\-Champagne had their union recognized when the Illinois Court of Appeals held that they were entitled to unionize under state laws related to public employees' unions. This was one of the first cases to successfully recognize a graduate student's union after a long lull in campuses organizing.\n\nThe Wikipedia article claims that this was a 2002 decision (this could be the date that the University and the union [reached an agreement](https://www.uigeo.org/2002/06/) ([stipulations](https://humanresources.illinois.edu/assets/docs/AHR/Stipulations.pdf)) regarding who was covered by the union), but the case in question appears to be *Graduate Employees Org. v.

This is not unusual with professional or managerial workers.\n\nHowever, even where both employer and employee might acknowledge this as the reality in a particular case, the courts tend to reject this analysis as too complicated and uncertain to adjudicate upon.\n\nInstead, the courts impose law upon the parties, holding that the primary obligation for which a salaried worker is remunerated are the hours of attendance, and a \"day's pay\" is reckoned accordingly.\n\nEmployers are free to use salaries as an alternative to hourly pay or per\\-diems, but when pro\\-rating disputes come to be adjudicated by the law, the employers have a clear understanding for how the calculation will be performed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An employee with an annual salary of \u00a352,000, working 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), is terminated and offered a \"termination award\" of 8 days' pay.

The photographer has the right to take and publish photos taken in public for non-commercial purposes, such as on a personal blog. As long as the image is not being used for advertising or other commercial purposes, and is not defamatory, the subject has no legal grounds to demand its removal. The photographer's rights to free speech and expression are protected in this scenario. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they imply restrictions or obligations that don't apply in this situation under U.S. law for non-commercial use of photos taken in public."}, "59": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11165/how-does-a-cancelled-delaware-domestic-llc-affect-the-companys-california-forei", "docs_id": 11165, "title": "How does a cancelled Delaware Domestic LLC affect the company&#39;s California Foreign LLC?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A Delaware Domestic LLC is cancelled status.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications?\n\nA) The California foreign LLC registration remains valid and can continue operations independently.\nB) The LLC can continue to operate in California as long as it informs the state about the Delaware cancellation.\nC) The LLC is immediately dissolved in all jurisdictions and cannot conduct any further business.\nD) The LLC has a grace period of 90 days to reinstate its Delaware status before losing its California foreign registration.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. When a Delaware LLC is cancelled, it ceases to exist as a legal entity. Since the California foreign LLC registration is not a separate entity, but merely a registration of the Delaware LLC to do business in California, the cancellation of the Delaware LLC means the entity no longer exists in any jurisdiction. Therefore, it cannot conduct any further business, either in Delaware or California. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the California foreign LLC registration is not a separate entity that can continue independently.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because informing California about the Delaware cancellation doesn't create a new legal entity or allow the non-existent LLC to continue operations.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because there is no automatic grace period for reinstatement that would allow continued operations. While reinstatement might be possible depending on Delaware law, the LLC cannot legally operate during any period when it is cancelled.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the relationship between domestic and foreign LLC registrations and the legal consequences of entity dissolution."}}
