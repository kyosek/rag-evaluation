This aligns with the reality of the software licensing landscape, where new licenses are continually being created and existing ones modified. While there are resources that catalog many common licenses (such as the OSI's list of approved open source licenses), no single source can claim to be truly comprehensive and up-to-date with all existing licenses. Therefore, option D is the most accurate statement among the given choices."

He said it was illegal verbal threat and wanted to sue me. May I ask if what I said regarded as an illegal verbal threat? Does \"2\\.report this case to your professor/advisor\" commits coercion in the second degree in NY? We are in NYC.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Probably not.\n\nBased on [this](http://criminaldefense.1800nynylaw.com/new-york-penal-law-135-60-coercion-in-the-second-degree.html), you need to threaten someone so they will do something they are legally entitled to refuse to do or to refrain from doing something they are legally entitled to do. It may be that your roommate is *not* legally entitled to make the noise you are disputing about.\n\nSecondly, for your purposes, the relevant threats must fall within the scope of:\n\n> 4. Accuse some person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be instituted against him or her; or\n> 5. Expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject some person to hatred, contempt or ridicule; or ...\n\nIts certainly not clear to me that you have done either of those things and *even if you had* it is not clear that they are a threat. These are things you are entitled to do in the context of resolving the dispute and pointing out to the other disputant where you are thinking of going if the dispute is not resolved between you is not a threat.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a dispute between roommates in New York City over noise issues, which of the following statements would most likely be considered an illegal verbal threat or coercion in the second degree?\n\nA) \"If you continue making noise, I will report you to the landlord for violating quiet hours.\"\n\nB) \"If this noise doesn't stop, I'm going to tell everyone in the building about your embarrassing medical condition.\"\n\nC) \"Unless you keep it down, I'll have to contact the leasing office to discuss possible solutions.\"\n\nD) \"If you don't quiet down, I'll have to report this ongoing issue to the university housing department.\"\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \n\nOption A is not likely to be considered an illegal threat as reporting a legitimate noise complaint to a landlord is a reasonable action and does not meet the criteria for coercion.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it involves threatening to expose a secret or publicize an asserted fact that could subject the person to hatred, contempt, or ridicule. This falls under the scope of coercion in the second degree according to New York law.\n\nOption C is similar to the original scenario and is not likely to be considered an illegal threat. Contacting the leasing office for solutions is a reasonable step in resolving a dispute and does not involve forcing the roommate to do something they're legally entitled to refuse.\n\nOption D, like A and C, involves reporting the issue to a relevant authority (university housing) and is not likely to be considered an illegal threat or coercion.\n\nThe key difference with option B is that it involves the threat of exposing private information to cause harm or embarrassment, which aligns with the legal definition of coercion in New York."

The employer might want the employee to sign an agreement transferring the copyright. Or the employer might simply treat the software as belonging to the employer.

According to the elements of defamation outlined in Grant v. Torstar Corp., a statement can be considered defamatory if it is (1) defamatory in nature, (2) refers to the plaintiff, and (3) is published, meaning it is communicated to at least one person other than the plaintiff. In this case, John's email to Mary meets all these criteria. It's false and harmful to Sarah's reputation, it clearly refers to Sarah, and it was communicated to Mary (a third party). The fact that it was a private communication to only one person does not exempt it from being considered defamation. As seen in the Faryna v. Chorny case, even a letter sent to a single individual can be grounds for a defamation lawsuit. The scale of the communication or the number of recipients does not necessarily determine whether something is defamatory, although it may affect the assessment of damages."

The response highlights that U.S. courts probably lack jurisdiction over China due to sovereign immunity.

In [*Barron v. Baltimore*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/32/243/) (1833\\), the Supreme Court held that the Bill of Rights was enacted as part of the federal constitution and only restricts the exercise of the federal government's authority. State and local governments are instead bound by the *Fourteenth* Amendment, which says that\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n\nOver the years, the courts have held that state action that deprives someone of fundamental rights deprives them of life, liberty, or property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. In [Wolf v. Colorado](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/338/25/) (1949\\), the Supreme Court held that the right against unreasonable searches and seizures is a fundamental right, so state action violating it is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Most of the Bill of Rights has been held to be \"fundamental,\" and people routinely say \"the state violated the Fourth Amendment\" instead of \"the state violated the Fourteenth Amendment by conducting an unreasonable search of the sort that would violate the Fourth Amendment if conducted by the federal government.\" Courts will say \"the Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth.\" But the point is that the Fourth Amendment *itself* is not applicable to anyone except the federal government.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment, by its terms, only restricts the states. The Fourth Amendment only restricts the federal government. With rare exceptions, neither applies to private entities.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the application of the Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures?\n\nA) The Fourth Amendment directly applies to federal, state, and local governments, as well as private corporations.\n\nB) The Fourth Amendment only applies to the federal government, while state and local governments are bound by the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\n\nC) The Fourth Amendment applies equally to all levels of government but not to private entities.\n\nD) The Fourth Amendment applies directly to federal, state, and local governments, but not to private corporations unless specified in their terms of service.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The Fourth Amendment, as part of the Bill of Rights, was originally intended to restrict only the federal government's authority, as established in Barron v. Baltimore (1833). State and local governments are instead bound by the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. Through a process called incorporation, the Supreme Court has held that fundamental rights protected by the Bill of Rights (including Fourth Amendment protections) apply to state and local governments via the Fourteenth Amendment. This was specifically addressed for Fourth Amendment protections in Wolf v. Colorado (1949). Private corporations are generally not bound by either amendment, with rare exceptions. The question's correct answer, B, accurately reflects this legal framework, while the other options contain various inaccuracies about the scope and application of these constitutional protections."

According to his platform over 100 representatives of congress have been reached in the past few weeks. \n\nThey are going to attempt the same thing this week but congress keeps ignoring the requests.\n\n**Would it be possible for a judge, lawyer, attorney general, etc. to start a new investigation or at least to subpoena the people who were in charge by that time, or is Congress the only way? Are there any other legal procedures to start a new investigation apart from Congress?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You don't really need any reasonable doubts about the currently available evidence to get it started. If an investigating authority thinks a crime has been committed and not yet been adjudicated, it is free to investigate, even if others disagree.\n\nThere are plenty of avenues for starting an investigation:\n\n* Congress can exercise its oversight power to initiate an investigation. State legislatures can do the same, so you could petition the New York Legislature, the Virginia General Assembly, or the Pennsylvania General Assembly.\n* At both the state and federal level, attorneys general have the authority to initiate an investigation of crimes committed within their jurisdictions.\n* At both the state and federal level, a judge's authority to appoint a special prosecutor is a power considered to be inherent in the courts, so nearly any court could appoint someone to pursue the investigation. Of course, the prosecutor's authority could be jurisdictionally limited \\-\\- if a New York state judge appointed a prosecutor, he wouldn't really have much authority to investigate federal crimes, and if a small\\-claims court judge in Idaho appointed a prosecutor, he'd be limited by both his lack of authority to investigate events outside his jurisdiction and the practical difficulties of enforcing a subpoena from out of state.\n* Even at the local level, law enforcement and legislative bodies have the authority to launch investigations. If NYPD or the Somerset County Sheriff or the Arlington County Board want to investigate, they could do so.\n* I don't know what the relevant rules are in each jurisdiction, but some states allow lawsuits for civil damages based on criminal activity. So if the gist of the sponsor's complaint is that someone used \"explosives and/or incendiaries\" to kill his son, it may be that he could bring a lawsuit over that, which would in turn open up the the tools of civil discovery. Of course, that's only if the claim isn't time\\-barred; now that we're nearly 17 years out, I'd guess that it would be too late.\n* And there's always the possibility of continuing an independent investigation. Using the same tools that the press uses \\-\\- interviews, freedom\\-of\\-information laws, etc. \\-\\- any member of the public is free to make an inquiry into any matter of public concern.\n\nObviously, I'd expect any of these authorities to be reluctant to take up the cause due to the investigatory consensus against the inside\\-job/cover\\-up theory, and I'd also expect \\-\\- for the same reason \\-\\- that any authority that tried to take it up would run into serious roadblocks from all the other authorities that have declined.",

In particular, if the child lives in a state with no such law can they be bound in a judgment from a state they do not reside in (and may never have resided/done business/etc.)?\n\nThis is legal curiosity and not a question about a specific case, though it is inspired by thinking about a certain parental figure in my life....\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It first of all depends on what the laws of the specific state say. For example, Ohio is a state said to have such a law, but that law, [ORC 2919\\.21](https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-2919.21) is more generally about the *crime* of non\\-support. So in fact,\n\n> (A) No person shall abandon, or fail to provide adequate support\n> to:...(3\\) The person's aged or infirm parent or adoptive parent, who\n> from lack of ability and means is unable to provide adequately for the\n> parent's own support\n\nDivisions B and C of the statute are limited to court\\-ordered support and support of juveniles. The law then says that\n\n> whoever violates division (A) or (B) of this section is guilty of\n> nonsupport of dependents, a misdemeanor of the first degree.\n\nNothing in the statutory language limits criminal liability in case a person was not aware of a financial need of one of their parents. [This legal brief](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/documents/reference/current/membersonlybriefs/132adultsupport.pdf) by the Ohio Legislative Service Commission indicates (based on case law in Ohio) that\n\n> Outside the criminal law, an adult child has no legal duty to support\n> a parent unless a contract, express or implied, exists.\n\n[California has a law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=9.&chapter=1.&part=4.&lawCode=FAM) imposing a similar financial responsibility on children, and [also has a law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=12350.&lawCode=WIC) denying such responsibility. The \"denying responsibility\" part says\n\n> No relative shall be held legally liable to support or to contribute\n> to the support of any applicant for or recipient of aid under this\n> chapter. No relative shall be held liable to defray in whole or in\n> part the cost of any medical care or hospital care or other service\n> rendered to the recipient pursuant to any provision of this code if he\n> is an applicant for or a recipient of aid under this chapter at the\n> time such medical care or hospital care or other service is rendered.\n\nThis is about public assistance for the aged, blind and disabled.

No county or city and county or officer or employee thereof\n> shall threaten any such relative with any legal action against him by\n> or in behalf of the county or city and county or with any penalty\n> whatsoever.\n\nBut still, under [Family Code 4400](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=9.&chapter=1.&part=4.&lawCode=FAM),\n\n> Except as otherwise provided by law, an adult child shall, to the\n> extent of the adult child\u2019s ability, support a parent who is in need\n> and unable to self\\-maintain by work\n\nand under \u00a74403,\n\n> (a) Subject to subdivision (b):\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A parent, or the county on behalf of the parent, may bring an\n> action against the child to enforce the duty of support under this\n> part.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) If the county furnishes support to a parent, the county has the\n> same right as the parent to whom the support was furnished to secure\n> reimbursement and obtain continuing support.\n> \n> \n> (b) The right of the county to proceed on behalf of the parent or to\n> obtain reimbursement is subject to any limitation otherwise imposed by\n> the law of this state.\n> \n> \n> (c) The court may order the child to pay the county reasonable\n> attorney\u2019s fees and court costs in a proceeding by the county under\n> this section.\n\nSo in California, it's not entirely clear what the actual legal obligation of a child is.\n\nYou can make a successful claim against a child in Pennsylvania, see [Health Care \\& Ret. Corp. of Am. v. Pittas (Pettas)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/pa-superior-court/1607095.html). And it turns out that you can sue across state lines, see [Melmark v. Schutt](https://cases.justia.com/pennsylvania/supreme-court/2019-78-map-2017.pdf?ts=1556287416) (this case involves suing parents of a mentally disabled adult child), a variant but under this same filial support law). The parents, in New Jersey, were sued under Pennsylvania law (where the child was). However, this isn't a trivial matter, since it involves the complex subject of \"choice of law\". In this case, the court (PA Supreme Court) concluded that Pennsylvania had the greater interest in applying its law, thus the parents were held to the other state's laws.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A 70-year-old mother living in Pennsylvania requires extensive medical care and cannot pay her bills. Her 45-year-old son lives in California. The mother's nursing home in Pennsylvania sues the son for payment under Pennsylvania's filial responsibility law. Which of the following is most likely to be true?\n\nA) The son cannot be held responsible because he lives in California, which has conflicting laws about filial responsibility.\n\nB) The son can only be held responsible if he lived in Pennsylvania at some point in his life.\n\nC) The Pennsylvania court may apply Pennsylvania law and hold the son responsible, even though he lives in California.\n\nD) The case will automatically be dismissed because filial responsibility laws cannot be enforced across state lines.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the case law presented (particularly Melmark v. Schutt), courts can enforce filial responsibility laws across state lines. In this scenario, a Pennsylvania court could potentially apply Pennsylvania law to the California-resident son due to the concept of \"choice of law.\" The court might determine that Pennsylvania has a greater interest in applying its law, especially since the mother and the care facility are located there.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because, while California does have conflicting laws, this doesn't automatically protect the son from Pennsylvania's law.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because residency history isn't necessarily a determining factor in these cases.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because, as demonstrated by the Melmark v. Schutt case, filial responsibility laws can indeed be enforced across state lines under certain circumstances.\n\nThis question tests understanding of interstate legal complexities and the application of filial responsibility laws across different jurisdictions."

I have always been the higher earner.\n\nWe both have recently agreed that I would buy out my ex's share of the family home, which is where I still live (I have been paying the mortgage repayments and all other related expenses for the property. On applying for finance, the bank required a binding financial agreement between us. I would assume that this was to make sure that there are no sudden nasties later on. \n\nBoth of us agreed that the only thing we wanted to settle on with our separation was her share of the house, which is half of the value of the house less the remaining mortgage, forgoing a share of the value of my superannuation (for clarification, the agreement equates to a 54%/46% split of total assets, which effectively consist of the house and combined super). She went to a solicitor to get this drawn up on our behalf, who strenuously advised against such an agreement. We are both very comfortable with this decision, and said that yes, this is what we want.\n\nThe solicitor stated that they would work directly with her instructions, but \"have a professional duty to warn you of their concerns\". In the email they sent regarding the agreement, they had this particular paragraph:\n\n> We would also reserve the right to take our own professional advice as to our efforts on your behalf.\n\nWhat does this mean? Are they implying that they would attempt to challenge our agreement, even though neither of us wants this to happen? I'm moderately sure that they are simply wanting to protect themselves professionally from any risk, but this really made me nervous.\n\nSo my question is, **Can a solicitor (in Australia) challenge a binding separation agreement they don't agree with?** We are both shaking our heads at the moment, we have an excellent relationship with shared custody of our children and neither of us wants this to happen.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The solicitor is allowed not to accept a case. If your ex\\-wife asked him to prepare papers, and he feels that she is getting ripped off, it is absolutely understandable that he won't prepare these papers for her, because he doesn't want to be sued or badmouthed when the deal goes wrong. \n\n\"We would also reserve the right to take our own professional advice as to our efforts on your behalf.\" means simply he is not specialised in some subject, and will prefer to ask someone who is. Like a medical doctor asking for a second opinion before going ahead and cutting your leg off. \n\nNow I would have preferred if the solicitor had said concretely what exactly is wrong with the contract. Also, it would be obvious that *you* would be very comfortable with anything that he would advice her against. If he thinks that it is a good deal for you but not for her, he should advice against it. \n\n(Your comment to another question seems to indicate that she should be paid a lot more than you offered, so her solicitor seems to have been perfectly right).",

This is similar to a doctor seeking a second opinion on a complex case. It does not imply that they will challenge the agreement against the client's wishes, refuse to draft the agreement, or breach confidentiality.

Alex*, [2017 SCC 37 at para. 31](https://canlii.ca/t/h4mzd#par31)).\n\nMany factors would pull a court to interpret a statute more narrowly or broadly than an acontextual, isolated reading of the words would suggest. Generally, this includes the full text, context, and purpose of the statute. Courts will look to:\n\n* the words of the provision\n* the surrounding words and related provisions\n* the words of the entire statute\n* the entire statute book\n* the legislative purpose as revealed through legislative history and the mischief the provision is meant to deal with\n* the presumption of constitutionality\n* etc.\n\nBasically every doctrine of statutory interpretation will pull towards either a narrow or broad reading of a provision. I would hesitate though to call these \"corrections\" of \"legislative flaws\" but rather an attempt to give effect to the legislative intent. Even the doctrine of absurdity that you mention is based in an assumption that the legislature does not intend absurd results. Instead of correcting \"legislative flaws\" this doctrine/canon is a way to *avoid* judicial error.\n\nHowever, *after* a full interpretation of a statute reveals that it is unconstitutional because it is over or under\\-inclusive, then a court may use the *remedies* of reading down or reading in (these are constitutional remedies not part of the ordinary act of interpretation). In such a circumstance, where it is a \"safe assumption\" that the Legislature would have enacted the \"corrected\" version, the court may declare the correction. See *Schachter v.

He lives in\n> California.\n> \n> \n> In what state will the trial be?\n\nOregon. State law crimes are always tried in the jurisdiction where they are committed. A crime is committed either where the acts causing the crime took place or where the harm caused by the crime is directed. In the classic example, if you shoot and murder someone in Oregon from within California, either state (or both states) can prosecute you for murder. If you have a DUI in Oregon that doesn't involve crossing the state line, California can't try you for that crime.\n\n> If he's convicted, will he have to move to Oregon to serve probation\n> or would he automatically serve probation in California since he lives\n> there?\n\nA standard condition of probation is to not leave the state without court permission, but the court imposing probation can authorize you to leave the state subject to other restrictions devised by the court (e.g. forfeiture of one's passport until the probation sentence is completed so that extradition is available if a felony is committed while on probation).\n\nThere is also a process in place by which states can cooperate to have their probation officers supervise a convicted defendant's probation order from one state in another state (usually with the requirement that the sentencing state either pay for that service, have the defendant pay for that service, or that there be reciprocity such that California will only agree supervise people placed on probation in Oregon if Oregon will agree to supervise people placed on probation in California).\n\nIt is also possible that even though probation is an available sentencing option, that for an out of state defendant, a jail sentence and/or a larger than usual fine will be imposed in lieu of a probation sentence, to avoid these complications.\n\nOf course, unless you let your lawyer (or if you are representing yourself, the court) know what you would like to arrange and take the proper legal steps to do so (which realistically requires the skills of an experienced criminal lawyer), the court won't allow you to do so.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: John, a resident of Texas, is arrested for a DUI while on vacation in Florida. He wants to return home to Texas during his trial and potential probation period. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding his situation?\n\nA) John can request to have his trial moved to Texas since that's his state of residence.\nB) If convicted, John will automatically serve his probation in Texas without any additional arrangements.\nC) The trial will be held in Florida, but John can arrange for interstate compact probation supervision in Texas with proper legal assistance.\nD) John will be required to remain in Florida for the duration of his trial and any subsequent probation period without exception.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The trial must be held in Florida where the offense occurred. However, with proper legal assistance, John can potentially arrange for interstate compact probation supervision, allowing him to serve his probation in Texas under certain conditions and agreements between the two states. Answer A is incorrect because state law crimes are tried in the jurisdiction where they are committed. Answer B is incorrect because probation is not automatically transferred to the offender's home state without proper arrangements. Answer D is too absolute; while staying in Florida might be required initially, arrangements can often be made for out-of-state probation supervision."

We have to maintain the integrity and reputation of producing respected scholars. Therefore it is important to have your work reviewed and approved first.\n\nMy focus is on the bolded part that basically says: I need to receive approval/permission before posting/publishing **anything** to the world\\-wide web. It doesn't say that approval or permission is just limited to publishing/posting academic materials and it seems it includes any material in the world\\-wide web. Why, I need to receive such a permission if I want to post something in the web from the university officials? I read the whole graduate manual in this particular public university, and it doesn't say anything about this situation.\n\nMy question: Is this an infringement on first amendment rights in a public university in the US for a college student?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The matter is not clear\\-cut (and the university lawyers are presumably relying on that fact). The bold part and following overstates the situation, especially the unconstrained \"publishing **anything**\" edict. You can publish whatever you want that the university doesn't have a legal interest in. The clause that says \"If you have co\\-authors or co\\-researchers you must ask their permission before publishing, and include their names\" is true, and defines a limit on their control. If you don't have co\\-authors, it's none of their legal business. (There can be issues regarding publishing an affiliation, so let's put that on hold).\n\nThey can, however, prohibit you from claiming an affiliation with Pod U, unless you submit your works to some internal vetting organization. This requirement should, however, be stated somewhere perhaps in the rules of the graduate school (not just the student handbook); or the other legally\\-enforceable rules.\n\nYou should also pay attention to the exact words that they use. You **must** ask permission to publish work done with a co\\-author (that's a fact: it's a standard requirement in universities). It is **important** to be sure that the information you publish is correct (clearly that is not in dispute). They are allowed to **ask** you to get X's approval. The First Amendment does not prohibit them from urging you to follow a course of action.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) This directive is a clear violation of the student's First Amendment rights and is unenforceable.\n\nB) The university has complete authority to control all of the student's online activities, including personal social media posts.\n\nC) The university can require approval for publications where the student claims affiliation with the institution, but cannot restrict all online activity.\n\nD) The student must comply with this directive as it is likely outlined in the graduate school manual.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The university's ability to control a student's online activity is limited and nuanced. They cannot restrict all online activity, as this would indeed infringe on First Amendment rights. However, they can have policies regarding how students represent the institution online, especially in academic contexts.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the directive as stated is overly broad, there are some circumstances where the university can require approval, making it not a clear-cut violation.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect as it gives the university too much authority. The university cannot control all of a student's online activities, especially those unrelated to their academic work or institutional affiliation.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the question states that the graduate manual doesn't mention this situation. Additionally, even if it were in the manual, a blanket restriction on all online activity would likely not be enforceable.\n\nThe correct answer recognizes that while the university can have some say over how students represent the institution online, they cannot restrict all online activity. This aligns with the explanation that the university can prohibit claiming affiliation without vetting, but cannot control everything a student posts online."

Here is a list of some of them:\n\n* Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs (\\>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Olmec Inscriptions (\\>3000 years old)\n* Ancient Mayan Glyphs\n* Ancient Aztec Glyphs\n* Old English Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Old Runic Inscriptions (\\>1000 years old)\n* Old Irish Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Chinese Inscriptions (\\>3000 years old, like the [oracle bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone))\n* Ancient Latin Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Ancient Greek Manuscripts (\\>1000 years old)\n* Etc. There are many other cultures such as Finnish, Tibetan, etc.\n\nSome of these are owned by places like the Catholic Church, others by places like the British Library, or other Libraries or Museums, even others are held by Universities, and still others are held by private individuals who may post an image online of the artifact for a variety of reasons, like [this person did](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/4t9kop/book_written_in_geez_ancient_ethiopic_unknown_age/). Also, some artifacts may have been *created* in one place (like in China), but *hosted* in another place (like at the British museum).\n\nSo the question is about looking at an online image of one of these artifacts, which is provided by one of the owners, and then either drawing a picture to replicate the object (like the image below), or copying it into text form, such as [this](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/), which was transcribed from [an image of a manuscript](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/manuscripts/cp/?tp=ob), into [electronic text](http://www.earlyenglishlaws.ac.uk/laws/texts/sacr-cor/view/#edition/translation).\n\nSpecifically, all of the things I am talking about are pre\\-copyright era, the actual objects themselves. So then someone finds/discovers the item (either they found it pre\\-copyright era, like 1000\\+ years ago finding something and putting it in the king's library), or it was discovered post\\-copyright\\-starting era. So somebody owns it. I am not concerned with that part. But then they take a picture of it and put it online. Some of the pictures (like the reddit image) are just quickly shot with an iPhone. Others require significant cost, care, and tooling, such as taking a picture of a fragile ancient manuscript, while others require that much cost/care/tooling to startup, but then can be automated for thousands or millions of artifacts (like the Google books project). But in the end, an image of a natural, copyright\\-free artifact (since it was created pre\\-copyright era) is online and publicly available.\n\nWhat you see in this situation often is \"this image is copyrighted\". To me that means that you can't directly sell the image, or host it on your site/product for commercial gain. But given the *content* of the image is in the public domain (again, the content from all those cultural resources listed at the beginning) because it was created thousands of years ago, I wonder what you are allowed to do with the image.\n\nI wonder if you are allowed to:\n\n* Make a drawing of it (like the sketch below).\n* Transcribe the text contained in the original document (which you could *see* because of the copyrighted image).\n\nObviously the drawing wouldn't be a straight copy of the *photograph*. It would draw the essence of the content instead. So the content is public domain, but the image is copyrighted and the artifact is owned. I wonder if you are allowed to essentially write down in electronic form what is in the manuscript artifact, or in the case of glyphs, to write down the glyphs.\n\nWhat this would mean is that one could go to a museum website and view their manuscripts, and transcribe them, and then do what you want with the transcription. If that's not allowed, I would be interested to know the reason.\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rl7Pn.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: What you're describing is generally permissible in the United States.\n\nThe photographer has copyright in the photograph itself, not in the items photographed. This means that they have copyright in the way that they composed the photograph \\-\\- what background they placed it against, lighting, camera placement, etc. \\-\\- but not in the ancient manuscript. \n\nIf you are strictly transcribing the text of the script, you're not infringing on anything that's copyrighted. If you make a sketch, there's more potential for infringement, but I suspect that you would not be working to faithfully copy the angles of the shadows as much as you would working to faithfully copy the image and condition of the artifact. \n\nEven if you were, calling that a copyright infringement would require that the image truly be copyrighted, and I'm not 100 percent convinced that they would be. Copyright is only available to *original* works of authorship, and that means that the author has to make some meaningful efforts to create something new out of the copyrighted elements discussed above.\n\nBut what has the photographer done in that picture of the Coronation Oath? It appears that they've photographed the book head\\-on, as it's displayed by the museum, with lighting as provided by the museum, in an effort to recreate the display one would see while visiting the museum. Is that really sufficiently \"original\" to merit copyright protection that could be invoked to prevent someone from drawing a duplicate? I doubt it.\n\nBut that picture of the Ge'ez book may be different. Someone appears to have grabbed the book, opened it up under weird lighting, kept their hands in the photograph, and otherwise actually composed a photograph that may not be particularly artistic, but is nonetheless difficult enough to duplicate that it can be considered original.\n\nSo let's be generous to the copyright trolls and assume that the sketch you're imagining is protected. Even then, that only raises the question of whether the copy is a fair use. You haven't said anything about how the hypothetical copier would be using these materials, but I have a hunch that the idea isn't to launch a multimillion dollar merchandising enterprise. If the idea is more academic or cultural, you'd have a better claim to fair use. Again, you can review [this fair\\-use explainer](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32422/is-this-copyright-infringement-is-it-fair-use-what-if-i-dont-make-any-money-o) to get a better idea.",

The artist plans to view high-quality photographs of these manuscripts on the institutions' websites, then create detailed sketches and transcribe the text. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this project in the United States?\n\nA) The artist cannot legally create sketches or transcriptions without permission from the institutions that own the manuscripts.\n\nB) The artist can legally transcribe the text but cannot create sketches based on the photographs without permission.\n\nC) The artist can legally create both sketches and transcriptions, as long as they are not exact copies of the photographs and are used for academic or cultural purposes.\n\nD) The artist can only use manuscripts that are explicitly labeled as being in the public domain on the institutions' websites.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the information provided, creating sketches and transcriptions of ancient manuscripts based on photographs is generally permissible in the United States. The key points supporting this are:\n\n1. The original manuscripts are in the public domain due to their age.\n2. Copyright for photographs only extends to original elements like composition and lighting, not the content of the manuscripts themselves.\n3. Transcribing text from the manuscripts does not infringe on any copyrights.\n4. Sketches that focus on reproducing the manuscript rather than the photographic elements are unlikely to infringe on the photograph's copyright.\n5. Even if there were potential copyright issues, such use would likely fall under fair use, especially for academic or cultural purposes.\n\nOption C is the most accurate, as it reflects the permissibility of both sketching and transcribing while acknowledging the importance of not directly copying the photographs and the relevance of the project's purpose."

So he cannot claim self defense.\n\nIs this true?\n\nThe reason I ask is I thought that the criminal activity must be related to why he is being attacked.\n\nFor example, a burglar comes in to my house and I shoot at him and he kills me. Now he's committing burglary.\n\nHowever, Kyle's crime is bringing a gun illegally. He doesn't rob or burglar people. The fact that his gun is illegal has nothing to do with why people are attacking him.\n\nHow related is the crime of those who claim self defense for this rule to apply? For example, say I park illegally and someone tries to rob me and I kill him. Can I claim self defense?\n\nOr say an illegant immigrant is peacefully enjoying dinner. Then someone robs him and he grabs a nearby gun and kills the robber. Can he claim self defense?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This appears to apply to all criminal activity, BUT\n===================================================\n\nIt only applies when defending a dwelling or business\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nand only removes a presumption, not the full right to self defense\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt has no effect on the Kyle Rittenhouse case.\n==============================================\n\nWhen interpreting the law, you can't take one sentence out of context and try to apply it. You must read the entire law, and interpret each statement in context.\nIn Wisconsin statute 939\\.48 (Self\\-defense and defense of others), the section you are citing is (1m)(b)(1\\). It contributes to 939\\.48(1m)(b), which modifies 939\\.48(1m)(ar), which expounds on (1\\).  \n\nTo paraphrase the law,  \n\n939\\.48 (self\\-defense)  \n\n1\\) A person may only use lethal force to defend themself or others from an immanent crime that would cause death or great bodily harm.  \n\n1ar) When defending your home or business, you may presume that someone breaking in poses the threat of death or great bodily harm.  \n\n1b) On second thought, you MAY NOT presume this under a couple of conditions:  \n\n1b1\\) You are actively engaged in criminal activity  \n\n1b2\\) You have reason to believe the person breaking in is a police officer, fire fighter, or paramedic engaged in their lawful duty.  \n\nIn legal terms, a presumption is something you shall / may act on before you have firm evidence to the contrary.  \nIf someone is breaking into your home, you do not have to identify them or see clear evidence of a threat (e.g., if it's too dark to see).  \n\nBUT if you can see someone clearly, and see a clear threat / clear lack of threat, you are no longer acting under presumption.  \n\nSo,  \n\nIf you are in bed, and someone breaks into your house, you may normally fire on them without clearly seeing a weapon.  \n\nBut if your spouse flips on the light and the intruder sees your gun and surrenders, you may no longer fire. You have firm evidence the intruder is not a threat.  \n\nIf you are hacking into the pentagon's computers late at night, and someone kicks in your door, you may **not** shoot at them, because you cannot presume threat. (It may be the FBI serving a no\\-knock warrant.)  \n\nBut if you flip on the the light and see someone in a ski mask threatening you with a crow bar, you may shoot him. You now have firm evidence of a threat to your life.  \n\nNone of this has any effect on the Kyle Rittenhouse case.\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nKyle was not defending his dwelling or business.  \n\nKyle's legal defense does not rest on a (claimed) presumption of threat, it rests on (claimed) evidence of threat.  \n\nLikewise, the accusations against Kyle don't claim that illegal possession of a firearm negates self\\-defense.  \n\nI don't know of any case law in Wisconsin involving self\\-defense while illegally carrying a gun, but there's nothing in the statute law that would bar self\\-defense in that situation.",

It does not completely eliminate the right to claim self-defense (ruling out option A). The statute specifically states that criminal activity removes the presumption of threat when defending a dwelling or business, but does not bar self-defense claims entirely (confirming option B). The law does not require the criminal activity to be related to the attack (ruling out option C), and it does have some effect on self-defense claims in certain situations (ruling out option D).

The right to information is a [statutory right](https://rti.gov.in/rti-act.pdf). The rights created by this law are stated explicitly, so no lawsuit or interpretation is required (unless a court case is required to understand what a \"competent authority\" is, or whether the right includes more than the 4 enumerated sub\\-rights). That is, this statute specifically creates a right, which could not be inferred from the Constitution.\n\nThere are three ways to create a new right. One is to \"discover\" that it was implicit in existing law, as in the Aadhaar ruling. Another is to amend the Constitution and add something to Part III. Turn to the [Constitution itself](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/India_2015.pdf?lang=en), art 368, which describes amending the Constitution. The third way is to do this statutorily, as in the right to information. Acts of Parliament are \"easier\" than Constitutional amendments: an amendment requires a 2/3 quorum, and us subject to other specific restrictions, possibly requiring approval by a majority of states. Likewise the right to free, compulsory education is Art. 23a of the Constitution, but the details of implementation are a statutory creation, subject to judicial review unlike Constitutional amendments (hence [Pramati Education and Cultural Trust v. Union of India (2014\\)](https://clpr.org.in/litigation/pramati-educational-cultural-trust-ors-vs-union-of-india-ors/)).\n\nTheoretically, the Constitution could be amended to require that all rights must be encoded in the Constitution, which would make it more difficult to create new rights.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the Indian legal system, which of the following statements best describes the relationship between constitutional rights and other legal rights?\n\nA) All fundamental rights in India are explicitly stated in the Constitution and cannot be derived through interpretation.\n\nB) Statutory rights, such as the Right to Information, have the same legal standing and amendment process as constitutional rights.\n\nC) The right to privacy is a statutory right created by an act of Parliament, separate from the Constitution.\n\nD) Some rights, like the right to privacy, can be derived from the Constitution through judicial interpretation, while others are created by specific laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nOption D is correct because it accurately reflects the complex nature of rights in the Indian legal system. The right to privacy, for example, was derived from the Constitution through judicial interpretation in the Justice K.S. Puttaswamy case, where it was found to be an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21. On the other hand, some rights, like the Right to Information, are created by specific laws passed by Parliament.\n\nOption A is incorrect because not all fundamental rights are explicitly stated in the Constitution. Some, like the right to privacy, have been derived through interpretation.\n\nOption B is incorrect because statutory rights and constitutional rights have different legal standings and amendment processes. Constitutional amendments require a more rigorous process, including a 2/3 quorum and possible approval by a majority of states.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the right to privacy is not a statutory right but a constitutional right derived from judicial interpretation of Article 21 of the Constitution."

According to the Slack terms of service, the license granted to a customer (in this case, Organization A) is \"non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, and limited.\" This means that Organization A cannot grant or transfer its rights to use Slack to any other entity, including Organization B, regardless of their relationship or any exchange of resources. The same principle likely applies to GSuite and other software services. Organization B must obtain its own licenses directly from the service providers if they wish to use these tools. The non-profit status of Organization A and the for-profit status of Organization B are irrelevant in this context, as the terms of service prohibit any form of sublicensing or transfer of usage rights."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A consumer signs up for an online course with monthly payment options. The terms and conditions, which weren't prominently displayed during sign-up, state that upon cancellation, all outstanding fees become immediately due. The consumer cancels after 16 days due to course material issues and personal dissatisfaction. Under UK consumer law, what is the most accurate assessment of this situation?\n\nA) The consumer is legally obligated to pay the full course fee immediately, as they agreed to the terms and conditions by logging in.\n\nB) The consumer has no obligation to pay any fees, as the terms were not clearly presented during sign-up.\n\nC) The consumer is entitled to a full refund, as all distance selling contracts have a 30-day cooling-off period.\n\nD) The consumer is liable for the full course fee, but the company may have committed an offence if they failed to provide required information about the contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to UK consumer law, consumers have a right to cancel contracts for services formed off-premises within 14 days. Since the cancellation occurred after 16 days, the consumer is outside this cooling-off period and is technically liable for the full course fee as per the contract terms. However, there are strict rules about what information companies must provide to consumers in distance contracts. If the company failed to provide all required information (such as clear cancellation terms or the nature of the payment obligation), they may have committed an offence. This could potentially void the contract, but it doesn't automatically exempt the consumer from payment. The correct answer reflects the complexity of the situation, acknowledging both the consumer's liability and the company's potential legal violation."

The modder is responsible for creating the infringing content, while the game company is liable for distributing it. Although the EULA transfers ownership of the mod to the game company, this doesn't protect them from copyright infringement claims by third parties.\n\nThe game company is likely to be the primary target of the lawsuit because they typically have more financial resources and insurance.

While Article 34.3.3 prevents courts from questioning the validity of laws that have been referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26, the Supreme Court has indicated that it might reconsider its own previous Article 26 decisions in exceptional circumstances. In the case of Re The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Bill 1999, the court stated that it would need \"compelling reasons\" that constitute an \"exceptional case\" to depart from its previous Article 26 decisions. This approach balances the finality intended by Article 34.3.3 with the court's ability to correct potential errors in truly exceptional situations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's too absolute; the court has left open the possibility of reconsidering decisions in exceptional cases. Option B is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the higher threshold required for reconsidering Article 26 decisions compared to other cases. Option D is incorrect as there's no mention of a specific time limit in the provided information or in Irish constitutional law."

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding their ability to access this information?\n\nA) The parent can only obtain this information if the work is related to a formal lawsuit.\n\nB) The parent has an absolute right to this information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n\nC) The parent can request the information, but the school district has discretion in how and whether to respond.\n\nD) The parent cannot request this information as it's protected by attorney-client privilege.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, while anyone can request information from government entities (including school districts), the agency has discretion in how and whether to respond to such requests. Even if the request is made under FOIA or similar state laws, it's ultimately up to the agency to decide how to handle the request. The parent can make the request, citing relevant laws to improve their chances, but there's no guarantee of receiving the information. Option A is incorrect because the work doesn't need to be related to a formal lawsuit for the information to be potentially accessible. Option B is wrong because FOIA doesn't grant an absolute right to all information. Option D is incorrect because while some information might be protected by privilege, the financial arrangements typically aren't, and the parent can at least make the request."

M and C have each other's contacts.\n\nThe day after the event, C calls M and wiretaps him (i.e. without M's consent or knowledge, everything he says on the call he is on with C is recorded).

If C constantly reassures M that she won't go to the police if he freely discusses with her the events of the previous night, which leads to a confession of the rape, is this covertly recorded call, in these circumstances, still admissible?\n\nd. If this evidence is inadmissible in any or all of these circumstances for a rape trial, would this be the same for any other crime or even family proceedings?\n\nI apologise if this is too much, but answers to any or all of my questions would be much appreciated. I am curious.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At common law almost all relevant evidences are by default admissible and there is no bar to admission of evidence based on how it is obtained, especially by a private person, even if the manner of gathering is straight\\-up illegal.\n\nIn this case, it is not even illegal. CVovert recordings by one of the parties in the conversation are not illegal in England, at least when it is between two private individuals. It is not in itself considered problematic to the evidence's admission.\n\nModern evidence rules (mostly from the *[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents)* for criminal cases) mean that confessions in particular may be subject to pre\\-trial proceedings (*voir dire*) to make sure that the confession can be considered reliable. It can be requested by the accused or required by the judge on their own motion.\n\n> [**76 Confessions.**](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/76)\n> \n> \n> * (1\\) In any proceedings a confession made by an accused person may be\n> given in evidence against him in so far as it is relevant to any\n> matter in issue in the proceedings and is not excluded by the court in\n> pursuance of this section.\n> * (2\\) If, in any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in\n> evidence a confession made by an accused person, it is represented to\n> the court that the confession was or may have been obtained\u2014\n> \n> \n> \t+ (a)by oppression of the person who made it; or\n> \t+ (b)in consequence of anything said or done which was likely, in the\n> \tcircumstances existing at the time, to render unreliable any\n> \tconfession which might be made by him in consequence thereof,the court shall not allow the confession to be given in evidence\n> against him except in so far as **the prosecution proves to the court\n> beyond reasonable doubt that the confession (notwithstanding that it\n> may be true) was not obtained as aforesaid**.\n> * (3\\) In any proceedings where the prosecution proposes to give in\n> evidence a confession made by an accused person, the court may of its\n> own motion require the prosecution, as a condition of allowing it to\n> do so, to prove that the confession was not obtained as mentioned in\n> subsection (2\\) above.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> * (8\\) In this section \u201coppression\u201d includes torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the use or threat of violence (whether or not amounting to torture).\n\nEvidences may also be excluded if it affects the trial's fairness to a significant degree. How the evidence was gathered is an explicit ground to consider.\n\n> [**78 Exclusion of unfair evidence.**](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/78)\n> \n> \n> * (1\\) In any proceedings the court may refuse to allow evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely to be given if it appears to\n> the court that, having regard to all the circumstances, including the\n> circumstances in which the evidence was obtained, the admission of the\n> evidence would have such an adverse effect on the fairness of the\n> proceedings that the court ought not to admit it.\n> * (2\\) Nothing in this section shall prejudice any rule of law requiring a court to exclude evidence.\n\n> b. If C intimidated and/or pressured M during the call into confessing, is this covertly recorded call, in these circumstances, still admissible?\n\nMaybe, depending on the circumstances. M would most likely need to raise these objections and establish the possibility, unless the evidence is clearly suspect (e.g. if the recording provided is not complete). The judge will consider the whole circumstances to decide.\n\n> c. If C constantly reassures M that she won't go to the police if he freely discusses with her the events of the previous night, which leads to a confession of the rape, is this covertly recorded call, in these circumstances, still admissible?\n\nThese circumstances alone most likely won't affect the admissiblity. Public policy encourages the reporting of criminal activities and promising not to go to the police is not coercive or manipulative in such a way that a person will confess to a crime that they did not commit. It may be perceived as \"unfair\" by some between the two individuals, but it does not make a criminal trial unfair.",

In England and Wales, covert recordings by one party to a conversation are not illegal, and there is no automatic bar to admitting evidence based on how it was obtained, especially by a private individual. However, under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, confessions can be subject to pre-trial proceedings to ensure reliability. The court may exclude the evidence if it was obtained through oppression or in circumstances likely to render it unreliable. The judge can also exclude evidence if its admission would have an adverse effect on the fairness of the proceedings. Therefore, while the evidence is likely admissible, its admissibility could be challenged and would be subject to judicial scrutiny, particularly if there are concerns about how it was obtained or its reliability."

All electricity meters are behind a locked door.\n\nMy electricity provider asks me to provide readings from my meter every three months, and I used to do so in the past. At first I had a key to the meters, and later when the locks were replaced with numerical ones every resident was given the passcode.\n\nRecently, the locks to the doors have been changed yet again, and I have neither the key nor the passcode. I have contacted the company that manages building maintenance (which is **not** my landlord or letting agency) and they have confirmed that they are the ones who replaced the locks, but they refuse to give me access to the meters.\n\nTheir best offer was to instruct the cleaner who comes every two weeks to take a picture of the meter and email it to me, but I feel this is inadequate. I would prefer to get a reading from the meter whenever I need it, without having to wait. In addition, when this happened in the past I was given a picture from the wrong meter and as a result I feel I cannot rely on them.  \n\nIf I cannot give a reading to the provider in time, my bill will be based on a guess of how much electricity they expect me to have used. I would very much prefer to continue giving them accurate readings in time.\n\nIs the management company's refusal to give me access to the meter reasonable? Can I force them to allow me access?\n\n### Research on legality\n\nWhile researching this matter I came across this website: <https://mocopa.org.uk> . My electricity provider is among those who have signed the agreement, which states that when a meter is installed or moved,\n\n> The location must be accessible to the Customer so they can read their meter\n\nwhile \"the Customer\" is defined as\n\n> a person to whom a Supplier proposes to supply or for the time being supplies electricity through an Exit Point (as such term is defined in the Use of System Agreement).\n\nI am not a lawyer so I cannot tell if \"the Customer\" is me in this case or the management company, but if it is myself then it seems the provider might be in breach of this agreement by allowing a third party (the management company) to restrict access.\n\nI contacted the provider (without specifically mentioning MOCOPA, however) and they claimed that the matter is between me and the management company.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Normally, the person who uses the electricity and pays for it is the \"customer\", that's you, not your landlord nor the maintenance company. Check out section 6\\.3\\.3 (A) of the [MOCOPA agreement](https://mocopa.org.uk/download/mocopa-v4-8/?wpdmdl=4022&refresh=5fb3c401df4a01605616641):\n\n> the Distribution Business shall agree with the Customer or developer the position and space for the Metering Equipment, and shall, in so much as it is within its reasonable control, ensure it remains reserved. **The location must be accessible to the Customer so they can read their meter and to the MOCOPA Operator (via the Customer)**. Consideration shall be given to the accessibility of the location to all users. The Distribution Businesses\u2019 service termination equipment and the Metering Equipment should be located between 0\\.5 and 1\\.8m above finished floor level subject to unavoidable constraints such as vandalism or fire risk mitigation\n\nEssentially, after the locks have been changed the last time, the building is no longer compliant with MOCOPA agreement requirements: I don't see any provisions that would allow to substitute the customer access to the metering equipment with an access via a proxy such as cleaning personnel.\n\nStart by sending a letter by **registered mail** to the maintenance company, requesting them to provide you the access to the meter. Mention the agreement you have found as grounds for your request. You might want o clarify upfront with your electricity provider who exactly you are supposed to contact, the maintenance company would be my first guess.\n\nChances are, you'll be given the access code. If they still refuse, they should state the reasons for doing so. Check their answer carefully, and if you are not convinced, you could take legal action (you may want to bring the response letter to a lawyer first). Having a copy of the letter you'd have sent will be a requirement for the legal action to be effective.",

The agreement does not allow for substituting customer access with proxy access through cleaning personnel or other third parties.

Regardless, what is another solid example of indirect discrimination?\n\nAnd if so, then why is a food establishment not offering vegan or gluten free fare not the same (philosophical belief, and philosophical belief or more likely disability, respectively)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Canada, this is usually referred to as \"adverse effect discrimination.\" This was the issue in *Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General)*, [2020 SCC 28](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/18510/index.do), but it presents a variety of examples from Canada and the United States (where it's called \"disparate impact discrimination\") for background.\n\n> Instead of asking whether a law explicitly targets a protected group for differential treatment, a court must explore whether it does so indirectly through its impact on members of that group (see *Eldridge*, at paras. 60\u201162; *Vriend*, at para. 82\\). A law, for example, may include seemingly neutral rules, restrictions or criteria that operate in practice as \u201cbuilt\u2011in headwinds\u201d for members of protected groups. The testing requirement in *Griggs* is the paradigmatic example; other examples include the aerobic fitness requirement in *Meiorin*, and the policy requiring employees to work on Saturdays in *Simpsons\u2011Sears* (see also *Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission)*, \\[1990] 2 S.C.R. 489\\).\n\nFrom these examples:\n\n* *[Eldridge](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1552/index.do)* was about failing to provide sign\\-language interpreters as an insured benefit under a provincial medical services plan. This restriction applied equally to the hearing and deaf populations. But this had an adverse impact on the deaf population. Because this was a government service, it was subject to scrutiny under the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.\n* [*Griggs*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970/124) was a class action against a large employer who required applicants for higher\\-paying jobs to pass an aptitude test and have completed high school. The claim was that this discriminated against African\\-American employees in violation of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Right Act. The Supreme Court of the United States held that the standardized testing requirement rendered a \"disproportionate number\" of African\\-Americans ineligible from promotion, transfer, or employment.\n\n> Congress has now provided that tests or criteria for employment or promotion may not provide equality of opportunity merely in the sense of the [fabled offer of milk to the stork and the fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Stork). On the contrary, Congress has now required that the posture and condition of the job seeker be taken into account. It has \\-\\- to resort again to the fable \\-\\- provided that the vessel in which the milk is proffered be one all seekers can use.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> On the record before us, neither the high school completion requirement nor the general intelligence test is shown to bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used.\n* In [*Simpsons\\-Sears*](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/101/index.do), an employer required full time workers to be available for Saturday shifts. A tenet of the faith of the complainant was that the Sabbath must be strictly kept, so she was not available to work on Saturdays. She filed a complaint under the Ontario Human Rights Code. The Supreme Court found in the complainant's favour.\n\n> it was not disputed, that the policy of Saturday opening followed by the respondent was adopted for sound business reasons and not as the result of any intent to discriminate against the complainant, nor out of any malice towards the complainant or members of her faith\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> An employment rule honestly made for sound economic or business reasons, equally applicable to all to whom it is intended to apply, may yet be discriminatory if it affects a person or group of persons differently from others to whom it may apply.\n\n---\n\nA very general framework:\n\n* Identify the source of any protection (constitutional, statute, etc.)\n* Determine whether it applies in a particular setting (employment, tenancy, public services, etc.)\n* Establish that a distinction results in members of a protected group being treated adversely\n* Look to whether the regime allows for exceptions for *bona fide* occupational/business needs, or allowance for reasonable accomodations etc.",

The restaurant refuses, citing operational needs. Which of the following best describes this situation under the concept of indirect discrimination?\n\nA) This is not discrimination, as the policy applies equally to all employees and was implemented for legitimate business reasons.\n\nB) This is direct discrimination, as the restaurant is intentionally targeting employees with certain religious beliefs.\n\nC) This is indirect discrimination, as the seemingly neutral policy disproportionately affects employees of certain religious groups, despite not being intentionally discriminatory.\n\nD) This situation does not involve discrimination, as employers are not required to accommodate religious practices that conflict with business operations.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario is an example of indirect discrimination (also known as adverse effect discrimination or disparate impact discrimination).

However, it disproportionately affects employees of certain religious groups who observe a Sabbath, similar to the Simpsons-Sears case mentioned in the documentation. \n\nThe policy was not intended to discriminate, but its effect is discriminatory. Option A is incorrect because even unintentional discrimination can be unlawful. Option B is wrong because there's no evidence of intentional targeting.

But nowhere does it mention anything to do with what I collect from my clients internally via email systems ect. \n\nA client has asked for my privacy policy but the only one I have is based around my own personal website. Do I need to create another policy for my clients and base this around what I process for them?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First, the relationship between the controller and processor is described in great details in [GDPR Chapter 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/chapter-4/). It is recommended reading.\n\n**TL;DR**: The *controller* is the one who calls the shots (i.e. what personal data to process, what means to use to process it, the purpose of processing, and the legal basis for processing). This is usually the owner of information system. The *processor* is the the entity that actually do the processing. If their relationship is not described in a legal document known as a DPA, both the controller and processor risks fines.\n\n> A client has asked for my privacy policy but the only one I have is based around my own personal website. Do I need to create another policy for my clients and base this around what I process for them?\n\nI think you have the right idea about you having different roles in different contexts, and also that you work for clients, *you* are processor. This also means that the client is the *controller*.\n\nA \"privacy policy\"\\-type document is not sufficient to regulate the relationship between the *controller* and *processor*. \n\nHow to regulate this relationship is described in [GDPR Article 28 (3\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/). Its start out by saying:\n\n> Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject\\-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller.\n\nIt then goes on to describe what stipulations the contract must contain.\n\nThis contract is usually called a **DPA**. The initials may stand for \"Data Processing Agreement\" or \"Data Protection Addendum\".\n\nBasically, if you personal process data on behalf of clients, you *need* to have this place. Both the controller and processor will be fined by the supervisory authority finds out that you are processing personal data without having such a contract in place.",

In this scenario, which of the following statements is correct regarding the developer's obligations under GDPR?\n\nA) The developer only needs a privacy policy for their personal website, as this covers all data processing activities.\n\nB) The developer should create two separate privacy policies - one for their website and another for client data processing.\n\nC) The developer needs a privacy policy for their website and a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for each client relationship.\n\nD) The developer only needs to provide clients with verbal assurances about data processing practices.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As a data controller for their own website, the developer needs a privacy policy that explains what data is processed on their website, why, and how. However, when processing data for clients, the developer acts as a data processor. In this role, GDPR Article 28(3) requires a binding contract or legal act between the processor and the controller (client). This is typically in the form of a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), which outlines the subject-matter, duration, nature, and purpose of the processing, as well as the obligations and rights of both parties. A standard privacy policy is not sufficient to regulate this relationship. Having both a privacy policy for their own site and DPAs for client relationships ensures the developer meets their obligations in both roles."

Do you have any idea about whether I should register it or not?\n\nWhat are the benefits?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Registering your copyright provides official proof of ownership, see [Copyright Act, \u00a753ff](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/page-16.html). It is not mandatory since you can use other means to argue that you own the copyright, but in case you want to sue someone for infringement, it simplifies what you would have to do.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the Canadian copyright system, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding copyright registration?\n\nA) Copyright registration is mandatory for all creative works in Canada before they can be legally protected.\nB) Copyright registration is not required, but it provides significant legal advantages in case of infringement disputes.\nC) Copyright registration is necessary to file an infringement lawsuit in Canadian courts.\nD) Copyright registration in Canada offers no additional benefits beyond unregistered copyright protection.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is the most accurate statement based on the information provided. In Canada, copyright registration is not mandatory, as copyright protection is automatically granted upon creation of an original work. However, registering a copyright does offer important benefits, particularly in legal scenarios.\n\nThe key advantages of copyright registration in Canada include:\n1. It provides official proof of ownership, which can be crucial in infringement cases.\n2. It simplifies the process of proving ownership in legal disputes.\n3. While not required for filing a lawsuit (unlike in the US), it can strengthen the copyright holder's position in court.\n\nOption A is incorrect because copyright registration is not mandatory in Canada. Option C is false because, unlike in the US, registration is not a prerequisite for filing an infringement lawsuit in Canada. Option D is incorrect as registration does offer additional benefits beyond unregistered copyright protection, particularly in providing official proof of ownership and simplifying legal proceedings."

While teachers have a duty of care for students when acting in their professional capacity (in loco parentis), this duty typically doesn't extend to situations outside of school or school-sponsored activities. At a public pool, the teacher would be considered a regular bystander.\n\nC) Incorrect. An off-duty lifeguard, despite having the skills to help, doesn't have a legal duty to rescue when not actively working. They would be considered a bystander in this situation.\n\nD) Correct. The on-duty lifeguard employed by the pool has a specific duty of care to swimmers using the pool. This falls under the category of duties arising from one's occupation or position.

When preparing a patent application for this invention, which of the following elements would be MOST likely to help the claim pass the \"significantly more\" test for subject matter eligibility under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7101?\n\nA) Adding a statement that the algorithm can be implemented on a generic computer\nB) Specifying that the algorithm is applied specifically to the field of supply chain management\nC) Including steps that transform raw inventory data into a new, useful output format for logistics planning\nD) Stating that the algorithm uses well-known mathematical techniques in a novel combination\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is most likely to satisfy the \"significantly more\" requirement because it involves \"effecting a transformation or reduction of a particular article to a different state or thing,\" which is one of the considerations that may qualify as significantly more according to USPTO guidance. This transformation of data into a new, useful format goes beyond merely applying an abstract idea on a computer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely implementing an abstract idea on a generic computer is specifically listed as insufficient to qualify as significantly more.\n\nOption B is also incorrect, as generally linking the use of a judicial exception (like an abstract algorithm) to a particular field of use is also listed as insufficient.\n\nOption D, while potentially novel, still primarily describes mathematical techniques, which are considered abstract ideas.

Based on the case load we may need to scale up fast so must have expensive excess capacity on hand. \n\nWe lost some deals to bids that were less than our cost. I traced them out and almost positive they are using cloud computing. The reputable hosting companies typically have a statement about secure servers and signing for a chain of custody if they receive physical media. \n\nI ran the cost and we can get server capacity on a cloud like an Amazon or Azure for literally pennies on the dollar and get (or release) capacity on demand.\n\nThe owner claims cannot satisfy chain of custody if the data hit a cloud. Is that true? \n\nI know two questions is not protocol for this site but what if the cloud account is owned by the customer? We just sell software/service. Now the customer would most likely need to give us access to the data but very easy to only give us read only access \\- they control the cloud account. Anyone doing review would have read only access. Could a customer sign a (valid) chain of custody if the data hit a cloud?\n\nI am clearly a techy. The original disc is still in a physical chain of custody. What is produced to the court is page by page tiff (or other rendition) redacted (or not) and stamped with a bates number. I know the law is the law and does not need to make sense but the original is not what is produced to the court. I am not getting touched a cloud would invalidate. Can you not just sign that Azure/Amazon was part of chain custody? It is not like the hammer that was used to crush the skull. Discovery data started as a clone of the collected physical disc or it was produces by the opposing party (still a copy).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Owner claims cannot satisfy chain of custody if the data hit a cloud.\n> \n> \n> Is that true?\n\nNo. On the one hand, as you say, you can just include the cloud provider on the chain of custody. On the other hand, opponents don't ask for chain of custody. And when they do, it's going to take a pretty drastic series of events to diminish the admissibility or weight of the evidence in court.\n\nTen years ago chain of custody was taken more seriously but after many recent court opinions about proportionality and cooperation, lawyers don't challenge chain of custody unless something glaring appears to be wrong.\n\nI could go on, but suffice it to say \\- I don't know of any case where chain of custody made a difference in civil litigation.\n\nBe aware that adding cloud storage adds a step to your processing and production workflow. As it is, you probably receive original evidence and process the data, host it for review, and then convert to TIF for production. If the data is hosted in the cloud rather than your local server your attorneys will be waiting for you to get the data uploaded to the review platform. And then when the review is done the production might take longer because of the download. Obviously the production delay is not as severe as the upload for review. There are ways around this, like rolling the upload, but this takes more human hours because of the additional management required.\n\nI'll also add security as the reason to stay out of the cloud. Litigation evidence is usually highly confidential and requires a high degree of security.\n\nSo, there are reasons for discovery vendors to avoid the cloud. Chain of custody is not one of them.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Freedom of speech is a constitutional right in many countries. But nowadays, several social networks \"which allow freedom of speech\" are appearing and growing because several of the main social networks don't allow content which is against certain ideologies. Certain theories or statements of certain ideologies are taken as true, and they can't be discussed because when they are, accounts are suspended or banned under violation of \"community standards\" and things like that. My question is, can any social network manage their own rules and declare that certain ideological/political ideas can't be discussed (but you can talk in favor of them) . Dont these \"community standards\" violate freedom of speech? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's look at the Ur\\-example of a free\\-speech law, and the most wide\\-ranging, the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. It says (my emphasis):\n\n> **Congress** shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\n\nThis limitation applies only to the **government**. Indeed, it has been [argued](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2060713) that this limitation only applies to the legislative branch of government and not to the executive (except when exercising legislatively delegated power) or judicial branches. Certainly, the courts have held that it is within their power to issue \"gag\" restraining orders.\n\nNotwithstanding, it imposes no restrictions on how non\\-government actors can limit your free speech. The owner of a shopping centre can require you not to evangelise, the owner of a stadium can require you not to use offensive language and the owner of a social media platform can restrict your speech in any way they wish.\n\n**You have a right to talk \\- they have a right not to give you a platform.**",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A social media platform bans users for discussing certain political ideologies that go against their community standards. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation and the concept of freedom of speech?\n\nA) The social media platform is violating the users' constitutional right to freedom of speech.\n\nB) The government should intervene to ensure the platform allows all forms of political speech.\n\nC) The platform is exercising its own right to determine what content it allows on its privately-owned service.\n\nD) Freedom of speech laws require all social media platforms to allow unrestricted political discourse.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that freedom of speech protections, such as those in the First Amendment of the US Constitution, typically apply only to government actions, not to private entities. Social media platforms, as private companies, have the right to establish their own rules and community standards, including restricting certain types of speech or content. This is summed up in the statement: \"You have a right to talk - they have a right not to give you a platform.\" \n\nOption A is incorrect because constitutional free speech rights generally don't apply to private platforms. Option B is wrong because government intervention to force speech on private platforms would likely violate the platforms' rights. Option D is incorrect as it misrepresents the scope of freedom of speech laws, which don't typically mandate private entities to allow all forms of speech."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: There was a question asked on another forum. \n**An instructor received a student's project assignment and was very disturbed by the contents** (it was a diary of a serial killer which included splattered blood on the pages and drawings of a disturbing nature \\- yes, it did meet the assignment's criteria).\n\nMy guess is that they have a Stephen King on their hands, not a serial killer \\- but with school shootings becoming more common, how would I know?  \n\nAnyway, just in case it could save someone else, I advised they take it to a mental health professional for review (just content; no name).\n\nIn case the *professional thought it was disturbing* (not creative writing) I added this near the bottom:\n\n> Don't tell me that when someone poses a credible threat to the public the name can't be disclosed, maybe you can't disclose it but someone or some process can. It would be bad to hear that they need the name today, and you don't know if you can, and you don't know who they can talk to about it.\n\nSo, I know that there are laws that protect student grades/identities/etc. and I'm not opposed to those.\n\nIf a psych has a duty to report actionable things to the police if a patient confides them (not patient confidential protected) I figured it would probably be legal for an instructor to take something that disturbed them to a mental health professional for a consult to ask if that professional thought it was disturbing... or if it just looked like creative writing.  \n\n(No student data released at this point except showing the assignment; name concealed)\n\nTwo comments are basically saying that they don't think it would be legal. \n\nSo here's my question:  \n\n**Would an instructor be legally allowed to show an assignment** to a (non\\-specific) mental health professional **because they thought it was so disturbing that maybe the public was threatened/endangered?**  \n\nTo keep it simple let's assume the student isn't a minor and isn't in High School.\n\nI'll happily delete my answer if they cannot.\n\n---\n\nP.S.  \n\n1\\. I did ref law.stackexchange but no on else posted anything.  \n\n2\\. The closest thing I found searching this site was a reference to the Joint Guidance on the Application of FERPA and HIPAA \\- which seems only to concern info collected by the school (not assignments) and who this can be disclosed to.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are certain privacy laws regarding what schools can reveal about students. To completely answer the question, we would have to know the state and school district involved, but we can get a pretty good estimate of the legal situation from applicable federal law, [34 CFR Part 99](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title34/34cfr99_main_02.tpl) (FERPA). That regulation addresses disclosure of student records, and they define \"record\" as \n\n> any information recorded in any way, including, but not limited to,\n>  handwriting, print, computer media, video or audio tape, film,\n>  microfilm, and microfiche\n\nwhich would include any written assignment (which is somehow written, and contains \"information\"). The regulations also refer to \"personally identifiable information\", which includes the student's name, which would normally be included on any assignment turned in, but could be removed if the teacher wants to in some way redistribute the essay.\n\nSubpart D addresses disclosing PID from a record, and generally consent is required (which could be from the parent, in the case of a minor), except as specified in [\u00a799\\.31](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=22e4dc673ac41bbc465f0af2269cac7e&mc=true&node=sp34.1.99.d&rgn=div6#se34.1.99_131). This would include for example those within the agency or institution who have been found to have an legitimate educational interest. This would include for example another teacher, the principle, the school psychiatrist (if there is one), but not the lunch lady or janitor. This would also include the psychiatrist who contracts with the school for consultation (but isn't an employee) as long as they are under the direct control of the school. It will also include disclosure to state and local educational authorities, under certain circumstances. (This is just a fragment of the conditions for non\\-consensual disclosure: the short version is, if the disclosure is to the school psychiatrist, it is allowed).\n\n\u00a799\\.36 then addresses \"health and safety emergencies\", which allows disclosure \"if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals\", where the agency \"may take into account the totality of the circumstances pertaining to a threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals\", and if it \"determines that there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals, it may disclose information from education records to any person whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals\".\n\nOne thing to note is that this regulation imposes restrictions on the school but not directly on the employee. The institution is expected to construct rules that implement the institutional requirements on their employees. If a disclosure is contrary to federal regulation, the penalty is visited by the government on the institution; the institution will then (hopefully) have established policies that employees will have to follow. Federal regulations do not anticipate that a teacher will make a *sua sponte* decision that a certain child may be a threat to public safety and therefore discloses a record. Instead, the teacher would probably make a disclosure within the organization, at which point the organization makes a decision whether the record needs to be turned over to the police, or someone else within the organization.\n\nAs for the specific case described, since the document presumably does not contain personally identifiable information, the disclosure restrictions do not apply. They do not apply to \"legitimate\" disclosure within the organization, and may not apply to certain kinds of disclosure outside the organization, but probably would prohibit disclosure to a neighbor who happens to be a child psychologist. The organization may well have promulgated rules that apply to employees which grossly misrepresent what the FERPA rules actually say (my employer did, \"out of an abundance of caution\"), so it is possible that the disclosure is contrary to FERPA\\-inspired local policy.",

The instructor wants to consult a mental health professional who is not employed by the university about the assignment. Under FERPA regulations, what is the most appropriate course of action for the instructor?\n\nA) The instructor can freely share the assignment with any mental health professional, as long as the student's name is removed.\n\nB) The instructor must obtain written consent from the student before sharing the assignment with anyone outside the university.\n\nC) The instructor should first consult with appropriate university officials to determine if there is an articulable and significant threat to safety before any external disclosure.\n\nD) The instructor is prohibited from sharing the assignment with anyone outside the university under any circumstances.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to FERPA regulations, the most appropriate course of action is for the instructor to first consult with appropriate university officials. This allows the institution to determine if there is \"an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals\" as specified in \u00a799.36. The university can then make an informed decision about whether disclosure to external parties is necessary and permissible under the \"health and safety emergencies\" exception. This approach ensures compliance with FERPA while also addressing potential safety concerns through proper channels within the institution."

This resulted in provisions both in the Articles of Confederation and in The Constitution prohibiting acceptance of \"any present, Emolument, Office, or Title\". Plaintiffs argue that\n\n> the word \u201cemolument\u201d was defined broadly in the eighteenth century to\n> mean \u201cprofit,\u201d \u201cadvantage,\u201d \u201cbenefit,\u201d and \u201ccomfort.\u201d\n\nPara 24 present a series of examples of \"things given\" which were found to be within the purview of the Emoluments Clauses, which includes employment, payment for work, also an honorary military insignia, a photograph, as well as [a piece of paper](https://www.justice.gov/file/20796/download) conferring honorary Irish citizenship on President Kennedy. In the latter case, the question is whether he could receive the piece of paper \u2013 the conclusion was that he could receive it and then deposit it with the Dept. of State pending Congressional approval (actual citizenship was not conferred, only an honor was conferred, but also a piece of paper was given, which brought the matter within the scope of the Foreign Emoluments Clause. The House of Representatives took up a specific matter on [May 4, 1789](https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llac&fileName=008/llac008.db&recNum=184) (p. 1581\\), with ample mention of \"presents\" (no mention of \"emoluments\"), receipt of which is prohibited without congressional approval. In the context of that debate, during the 5th Congress, it is clear that \"present\" means \"something that is presented\" and not \"something of significant value\".\n\nSince the [three relevant lawsuits](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11086) never reached the stage of evaluating the merits of the arguments, we can only guess how SCOTUS would interpret the word \"present\", but it is most likely that at least the present court would adhere to a more historical understanding of the term as \"something presented\", cash value being irrelevant.\n\nIt is also most probable that a person holding such an office *would* be legally allowed to say \"Thank you\" in response to the King of Norway declaring \"Wonder speech, Mr. Secretary\", even though doing so is acceptance of an honor.",

If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, it may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that it should be distinguished by some material difference between the facts of the cases; some jurisdictions allow for a judge to recommend that an appeal be carried out.

According to the documentation, for most businesses (unlike lawyers), holding customer money in a separate account is not highly regulated in the U.S. However, the funds should be kept separate from the company's own funds and cannot be borrowed against or used as collateral. This protects the customers' property and keeps it separate from the company's creditors.\n\nOption A is incorrect because obtaining a banking license is not necessarily required for this type of service, especially for non-financial businesses.\n\nOption C is incorrect because using customer funds as collateral goes against the principle of holding them in trust for the benefit of the customers.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a \"Rabbi Trust\" is specifically mentioned in the context of employee retirement funds, not for general customer fund holding services."

I'm trying to spend most of my time outside A as a tourist because I see possibility for major instability these years, which would mean extreme oppression and possibly getting stuck in A for a very long time.\n\nThere's a country (B) that's very welcoming in terms of giving citizenships, not quality of life. B gives you a citizenship pretty quickly compared to other ones, though it still takes years (naturalization and citizenship application). The problem is how am I going to go to B without a valid passport?\n\nYou might suggest going to B now so I can get the passport ASAP. I'm not doing that because B is dangerous.

According to the information provided, landlords are usually allowed to change lease terms during renewal periods. If the new no-pets policy was properly added during a lease renewal, the landlord has the right to enforce it, even for short visits. The absence of property damage or the brief nature of the visit does not exempt the tenant from the policy.

In some cases there is little description of the test beyond the dealer plugging the car into a computer, *doing something* and the computer generating a \"pass\" or \"fail\" response with no further explanation of what determines a pass or fail.\n\nAdditionally, some people report that their dealer required that the car's software be updated (for a fee) prior to performing said test.\n\nSo, is it legal for a warranty to hinge upon undisclosed criteria? Is it legal to charge money to perform such a test? And is it legal to require an additional purchase (software upgrade) to perform such a test?\n\n**Edit to add two points that may be relevant**:\n\n* Does it matter if a dealer themselves does not understand what the test does and that the test computer is running the manufacturer's software which is the only way to determine a pass/fail?\n* There are various ways to *approximate* battery capacity, including charging to full, and driving until the car stops to measure mileage however that is not only impractical because you may run out of charge in an undesirable location on a roadway but it also can vary substantially due to driving efficiency (are you driving uphill the entire time?). Because of this, no guarantee is in \"miles of range\" and any possible methods of capacity are an approximation. The manufacturer claims that only a dealer can make a warranty determination but the dealer seems to claim that it is ultimately the manufacturer's determination.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Main Question:** Most likely not under [Magnuson\\-Moss](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-50) or U.C.C..\n\n**Question 1:** If a charge payable before hand was not set forth in any [written warranty](https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/uscode.php?width=840&height=800&iframe=true&def_id=15-USC-1855261157-826470510&term_occur=999&term_src=title:15:chapter:50:section:2301), it is most likely not legal to deny remedy to the consumer. However, even if it was, it is possible that it would not meet the [federal minimum standards for warranties](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67241/what-are-the-legal-protections-to-buy-if-seller-refunds-instead-of-delivering-wh/67242#67242) as, per paragraph (d) a warranty has to provide for remedy without a charge. If there is absolutely no way for you to obtain the information to prove that a remedy is due \u2014 for e.g. no third party has legal or technical capacity to diagnose the vehicle \u2014 that is likely also a term to be found unconscionable and void, and may be found fraudulent, malicious and/or oppressive which may entitle one to collect punitive damages. (It is worth obtaining written confirmation of whether this decision is made in accord with their policies or on a line that they announce to be recorded)\n\n**Question 2:** Most likely same as Question 1\\.\n**Question 3:** Most likely same as Question 2\\.\n\nAccording to 15 U.S.C., subsection (a) of [Section 2302](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2302) entitled \"Full and conspicuous disclosure of terms and conditions; additional requirements for contents:\n\n> \"In order to improve the adequacy of information available to consumers, prevent deception, and improve competition in the marketing of consumer products, any warrantor warranting a consumer product to a consumer by means of a written warranty shall, to the extent required by rules of the Commission, fully and conspicuously disclose in simple and readily understood language the terms and conditions of such warranty.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) A statement of what the warrantor will do in the event of a defect, malfunction, or failure to conform with such written warranty\u2014at whose expense\u2014and for what period of time.\"\n> \n> \n> (5\\) A statement of what the consumer must do and expenses he must bear.\n> \n> \n> (6\\) Exceptions and exclusions from the terms of the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (7\\) The step\\-by\\-step procedure which the consumer should take in order to obtain performance of any obligation under the warranty, including the identification of any person or class of persons authorized to perform the obligations set forth in the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (12\\) The characteristics or properties of the products, or parts thereof, that are not covered by the warranty.\n> \n> \n> (13\\) The elements of the warranty in words or phrases which would not mislead a reasonable, average consumer as to the nature or scope of the warranty.\n\nIt may, in addition to any or all of the above, be a violation of paragraph (8\\), (9\\), (10\\) and/or (11\\) based on specific fact patterns.\n\n**To the 2nd point added:** If the manufacturer stated that the vehicle would run at least a certain number of miles on a full charge for a certain number of miles driven or number of years, and did not stipulate it otherwise, they would have to remedy this. It is highly likely that they tried to evade making such written statement (if not written, it's not a warranty under Magnuson\\-Moss). If they did, and they did not define the scope of what they would have to do in the case of a defect or malfunction, they would have to remedy it by repairs within a reasonable time; if they fail, they would have to refund or replace.\n\nThis does not mean that it is likely worth pursuing the matter in court other than maybe in small claims (See: [ohwilleke's reply to this question for a general explanation](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/67241/what-are-the-legal-protections-to-buy-if-seller-refunds-instead-of-delivering-wh/67242#67242)). Moreover, most auto manufacturers put arbitration provisions in their sale contracts and/or their warranties and generally it may be required of one to opt out of it within 30 days of entering into the agreement. If that took place, first the dispute would likely need to be disputed through a qualified dispute resolution mechanism of the manufacturer, dealer, distributor and/or sellers choice depending on who gave the warranty.\n\nThe specific State's lemon laws may provide for civil penalties for willful violations which may or may not be a very high bar to meet depending on the State's case law, and which is more likely to make it worth for \"lemon\" lawyers to take the case, but generally they are not a great deal more like hyenas of this segment of the law. It may still be worth considering for one depending on the specific facts, including State jurisdiction and the impeding nature of the nonconformity.\n\n(Please specify a State for the State's lemon laws applicable in this hypo)",

They deal with many things and sometimes, as here, they deal with the same thing twice. If they duplicated themselves, rather than cross\\-referencing, every time the law was changed, every single instance would have to be tracked down and changed.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: According to the documentation from LawStackExchange, why does Regulation (EU) No 540/2014 refer to UNECE Regulation No 138 regarding the AVAS pause function instead of directly stating that it is prohibited?\n\nA) To create intentional confusion in the legal system\nB) To allow for easier updates and maintain consistency across regulations\nC) To provide a loophole for manufacturers to include pause functions\nD) To emphasize the importance of the AVAS pause function prohibition\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. The documentation explains that cross-referencing, rather than duplicating information, is used in law codes to make updates easier and maintain consistency. When a change is needed, it only needs to be made in one place, and the change is automatically reflected everywhere the reference appears. This approach helps prevent conflicts that could arise if multiple instances of the same rule were to be updated inconsistently. It also saves time and reduces the risk of errors that could occur if every instance had to be manually tracked down and changed, especially in vast legal codes dealing with many topics."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I bought a house in Iowa in July 2016 and got a mortgage loan through a local lender. As part of the loan application, the lender applied for a tax credit program known as the 'Take Credit Mortgage Credit Certificate'. I paid $350 to the lender for the application, and met all qualifications. Link to tax credit: <http://www.iowafinanceauthority.gov/takecredit>. \n\nNow that it is tax time, I need information from the credit approval to receive the credit on my taxes. When following up with the lender (my loan originator no longer works for the lender), they tell me that the credit was applied for, but was neither approved nor denied before the closing date. I was never told about this prior to closing, so I had assumed everything was approved.\n\nMy question is, is the lender on the hook for the potential tax credits lost? The credit would have applied every year for the life of the 30\\-year loan. I cannot retroactively apply for the tax credit. Without this credit, I believe I am technically losing about $2000 a year, and that is just for the first 10 years. Can I sue for these potential losses? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is likely that you could sue, both for a refund of the fee charged and for the economic harm caused by not getting the credit.\n\nAt face value, this is a case of negligence or professional malpractice, with significant damages, not unlike a lawsuit against an accountant who failed to include an obvious deduction or checked the wrong box somewhere causing you to incur higher tax liability.\n\nBut, it wouldn't be uncommon for there to be elaborate waivers of liability in such a transaction, which might eliminate this liability. Also, this error probably wouldn't rise to the level of gross negligence or willful misconduct that would be impossible to waive in advance contractually. So, you would need to carefully review any agreements with the company before bringing suit to confirm that a right to sue over this mistake has not been waived.\n\nYou would also want to be sure about the relationship between the now departed individual who screwed it up and the firm that remains. If the individual was an independent contractor, your claim might be limited to that person and not to the larger entity that remains in business.",

The homebuyer likely has grounds to sue for both the refund of the application fee and the economic harm caused by not receiving the tax credit. However, it's crucial to review any agreements made with the lender for potential liability waivers before proceeding with legal action. This answer acknowledges the possibility of a lawsuit while also highlighting the important step of checking for any contractual limitations on liability. Options A and B are incorrect as they unduly limit the homebuyer's potential legal options. Option D is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation and ignores potential contractual limitations or the need to establish negligence."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose I want to make a turn, but other cars going straight have right\\-of\\-way. To be more precise, this applies to situations like:\n\n1. I'm making a left turn across a lane of incoming traffic, in the absence of stop signs or traffic lights\n2. I'm at a lighted intersection where I have a green light (unprotected left turn) and oncoming traffic also has a green light to continue straight\n3. I'm making a right turn into a lane where existing traffic in that lane is continuing straight\n\nUnder normal circumstances, it is my responsibility to go only when it is safe to do so, considering the distance of incoming cars and their speed. When it is safe, it is also my responsibility to actually go, to avoid blocking traffic behind me.\n\n**My question: should I turn or not when the incoming traffic comes close to me and stops (or dramatically slows down enough for me to go), even though they have right of way?** This scenario actually happens to me, either because the other driver is confused or just being nice.\n\nOne possibility: by stopping, are they relinquishing right\\-of\\-way and I should go, to avoid blocking traffic behind me. However I have never learned of such a rule where right\\-of\\-way is given up by stopping or slowing down.\n\nThe other possibility: they maintain right\\-of\\-way regardless. In this case, if I decide to go and then they suddenly accelerate and crash into me (e.g., for insurance fraud), am I at fault for being in the way? Even if they shouldn't have accelerated into me, realistically speaking, in the absence of dashcams, is a traffic officer likely to believe my story that they \"let me go,\" versus the more common scenario of me going when it isn't safe? Of course this depends on the officer and situation, but the possibility of being \"framed\" bothers me.\n\nAccording to [Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/car-accidents-proving-fault-29604.html):\n\n> A car making a left turn is almost always liable for a collision with a car coming straight in the other direction. Exceptions to this near\\-automatic rule are rare and difficult to prove, but they can occur if:\n\nThe three listed reasons do not include the scenario in this question, which to me, appears to be an exceptionally easy avenue for insurance fraud.\n\nI live in California, but I'm interested in general advice for this situation throughout the United States.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally traffic laws require you to yield the right\\-of\\-way to oncoming traffic when making a left turn on a two\\-way street. So that means that you must wait until it's safe to turn left. If you turn left and an oncoming car hits you, then it will appear as if you did not yield as required and caused the accident. You're liable.\n\nNow the situation may be more complicated if an oncoming vehicle appears to yield to you. You can choose to proceed or you can choose to wait. In your case you choose to proceed and if there is no incident, life goes on.\n\nBut you posed the hypothetical that the oncoming driver appears to yield but in fact doesn't or intentionally speeds up after you begin your turn and there is a collision.\n\nSo legally speaking the oncoming driver is at fault because intentionally causing an accident, nearly everywhere, is illegal. But how do YOU prove that happened. It's going to be your word against his unless there are bystanders who witnessed it. It's going to be an uphill battle to win in this case because it appears that you are at fault. Say you had a dashcam that shows the whole thing. Would that necessarily be convincing? What if the oncoming driver says he wasn't yielding but rather just slowing down because he thought you might cut in front of him? See the problems?\n\nMy best advice is to avoid putting yourself in such a position in the first place.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: When making a left turn at an intersection without a protected left turn signal, an oncoming car appears to slow down and yield to you, even though they have the right-of-way. You begin to make your turn, but the oncoming car suddenly accelerates and collides with you. In this scenario, who is most likely to be found at fault for the accident?\n\nA) You are at fault because you failed to yield the right-of-way to oncoming traffic.\nB) The oncoming driver is at fault because they intentionally caused the accident.\nC) Both drivers share equal fault for the accident.\nD) Fault cannot be determined without additional evidence or witnesses.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: \nA) This is the correct answer. Despite the oncoming car appearing to yield, you still have the legal obligation to yield the right-of-way when making a left turn. Without clear evidence that the other driver intentionally caused the accident, you would likely be found at fault for failing to yield.\n\nB) While intentionally causing an accident is illegal, proving this intent would be extremely difficult without clear evidence or witnesses. The default assumption is that the turning vehicle failed to yield.\n\nC) While both drivers may have contributed to the situation, the law generally places the primary responsibility on the turning vehicle to ensure it's safe to proceed.\n\nD) While additional evidence could help clarify the situation, in the absence of such evidence, the turning vehicle is typically presumed to be at fault in these scenarios.\n\nThis question tests understanding of right-of-way rules, the challenges of proving intent in traffic accidents, and the importance of defensive driving even when other drivers appear to be yielding."

A mere error or lapse of judgment will not possess enough \u201ccausal potency\u201d to amount to an intervening act capable of breaking the chain of causation.\n> \n> \n> Australian authorities suggest that medical treatment which is unforeseeable is treatment that is \u201cinexcusably bad\u201d, \u201ccompletely outside the bounds of what any other reputable medical practitioner might prescribe\u201d, or \u201cso obviously unnecessary or improper that it is in the nature of a gratuitous aggravation of the injury\u201d or \u201cextravagant from the point of view of medical practice or routine.\u201d\n> For your example, D2 did not break causation \\- further injury during transport is not unforeseeable. D3 *did* break causation \\- forgetting a patient for 9 hours is \u201cinexcusably bad\u201d.\n\nIn terms of liability:\n\nD1 *might* be liable. However, the \u201caccident\u201d must amount to negligence. If D1 did not owe a duty of care or complied with that duty and the injury was due to pure accident, then they are not liable. The breaking of the chain by D3 means they are only liable for the injuries sustained before then. However, many jurisdictions impose a duty to render aid on a person that caused an accident even if they were not negligent in doing so. Whether D1 leaving the scene creates liability or is merely criminal depends on the specifics of such a law.\n\nD2 probably *isn\u2019t* liable.

This delay produced a one\\-week delay in the confirmation process of a SCOTUS judge.\n* During the testimony she characterized this as a miscommunication, and the delay, as a misunderstanding.\n* Her lawyers tried to shut down this line of inquiry as protected by the attorney\\-client privilege because it was related to what her lawyers told her of what was told to them by the Senate functionaries responsible for arranging the testimony.\n\nMy question is in what legal jeopardy would the lawyers be if Dr. Ford were given a transactional immunity. Since *the attorney\\-client privilege is with the client, it does not spread to the lawyers if the client is immunized, or does it*? If it turned out that they misled the client (deliberately or not) about the Senate's offer to expedite the testimony, this would have been an act of obstructing a nomination of a SCOTUS judge. Should this result in a delay in the confirmation (assuming the confirmation does go through), this delay may result in judge Kavanaugh not being one of the presiding judges on one of the cases heard by the SCOTUS. Would this not be an obstruction of justice (quite literally)?\n\nAnd while Dr. Blasey Ford characterized this as a misunderstanding, this is her view on the facts. But if this results in an indictment, wouldn't the judgement of how to view the facts be with the jury (rather than Dr. Ford \\-\\- a witness)? She would be an immunized witness compelled to testify, would she not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To consider obstruction of justice, it's not necessary to consider the impact of a delayed nomination on the work of the Supreme Court. [18 USC 1505](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1505) provides that a felony has been committed by \n\n> Whoever corruptly, or by threats or force, or by any threatening letter or communication influences, obstructs, or impedes or endeavors to influence, obstruct, or impede the due and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States, or the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry or investigation is being had by either House, or any committee of either House or any joint committee of the Congress\n\nSince there's no suggestion of threat or force, the issue would be whether the lawyers' actions were corrupt, and whether the delay constituted an impediment. I am doubtful that either could be established. Furthermore, section 1515(c) says that\n\n> This chapter does not prohibit or punish the providing of lawful, bona fide, legal representation services in connection with or anticipation of an official proceeding.\n\nReturning to your theory about preventing or delaying the confirmation of a nominated justice, there does not appear to be anything in the law that criminalizes this. The court having 8 members does not prevent it from hearing any case unless 3 of the 8 have recused themselves from the case, as the Supreme Court's quorum is six justices.",

I wish to simply drive the firearm up to WA and then register it in my name in WA, but I have heard that you are technically supposed to go through an FFL. Meaning, we would have to go down there, bring the firearm to UPS or FedEx, ship it to the FFL dealer in WA, then once I get back I would have to go to the dealer, pay a sales tax on the firearm (which is insane seeing how i didn't buy it and it was purchased probably 30 years ago), and then pay the transfer fee to have it filed in my name.\n\nDoes that sound right? Is there an easy way to do this? If I just brought the firearm up in the car could I just bring it into a FFL (or ship it from my home address so its cheaper?) and then have them register it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: At the federal level, [18 USC 926A](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/926A) governs interstate transportation of firearms:\n\n> any person who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from\n>  transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to\n>  transport a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may\n>  lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he\n>  may lawfully possess and carry such firearm if, during such\n>  transportation the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor\n>  any ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is directly\n>  accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting\n>  vehicle: Provided, That in the case of a vehicle without a compartment\n>  separate from the driver\u2019s compartment the firearm or ammunition shall\n>  be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or\n>  console\n\nThe federal law on transportation preempts state laws so you don't have to even wonder that the laws of Idaho/Nevada/Arizona or Oregon are. Here's a summary of [Washington firearms laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Washington), the main point of which is that for open carry, no registration is required. Transportation in state follows the unloaded / locked\\-up federal model. The open\\-carry law is [here](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.41.270), which basically says that you can't threaten people with any weapon, but merely being in possession is not a threat. If you're under 21, there are a few [other restrictions](http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.41.240) (you have to keep it on your property). If you do want a concealed carry permit, you apply at the police office \\-\\- this is a \"shall issue\" state.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: John inherits a handgun from his grandfather who lived in California. John lives in Washington state and wants to transport the firearm from California to Washington. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the legal transport and possession of this inherited firearm?\n\nA) John must ship the firearm to a licensed FFL dealer in Washington, pay sales tax, and complete a transfer before taking possession.\n\nB) John can transport the firearm himself, but must register it with Washington state authorities upon arrival.\n\nC) John can transport the firearm himself as long as it's unloaded and locked in a container separate from the passenger compartment during transit, and no registration is required in Washington for open carry.\n\nD) John must obtain a concealed carry permit in Washington before transporting the firearm across state lines.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to 18 USC 926A, John can legally transport the firearm across state lines if it's unloaded and either not readily accessible or locked in a separate container. Washington state does not require registration for open carry of firearms. The federal law preempts state laws during interstate transport. Option A is incorrect as using an FFL is not legally required in this case. Option B is wrong because Washington doesn't require firearm registration for open carry. Option D is incorrect because a concealed carry permit is not necessary for transport or open carry in Washington."

Can Amazon be asked to provide data from non\\-US countries for any security reason, substantiated or not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking a business can be subpoenaed to provide any records, electronic or otherwise, by any court with jurisdiction over that business. Most subpoenas are issued in the context of pending lawsuits or criminal cases, some can be issues by certain regulatory or criminal law enforcement agencies.\n\nThere are defenses to a subpoena which can be asserted to quash the subpoena before the information is provided by the business. The main defense is that the information is privileged, for example, because it contains attorney\\-client confidences, or it is protected as a trade secret which could be disclosed to a competitor or lose its trade secret status if access to the information is not controlled.\n\nBut, generally speaking, ordinary business records of dealings that a company like Amazon has with its customers are not privileged or otherwise exempt from disclosure pursuant to a subpoena.\n\nAnother process which is available but less common when dealing with a third\\-party is a search warrant. In general, a business is not exempt from disclosing records pursuant to a criminal search warrant simply because the records involve non\\-U.S. persons.\n\nThere are also special procedures similar to, but not identical to, subpoenas under the Patriot Act such as \"national security letters\" that can be issued when national security is at issue. Unlike a typical subpoena, the process involved in a national security letter information request must generally be kept secret from the public and from the target of the investigation. National security information requests are overseen the the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Court which is a non\\-adversarial court that operates much like a judge or magistrate to whom a criminal search warrant application is made, except that attorneys that practice before it must have security clearances and its proceedings operate with a much higher level of secrecy. National security inquiries are still subject to legal limitations which the FISA court evaluates, although the FISA court has a reputation for being something of a rubber stamp (there is debate over whether this reputation is well earned).\n\nThere is a detailed body of law describing what justifications are necessary for various types of record requests and what exceptions to the duty to disclose exist, but without more specifics in the question, an answer in this forum is not a place for a comprehensive treatise reviewing all of them which could fill several law review articles.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal process for obtaining this data?\n\nA) The cloud provider can only be compelled to provide data stored within U.S. borders, as foreign-stored data is outside U.S. jurisdiction.\n\nB) The government must obtain a standard subpoena from a regular court, which the cloud provider can easily challenge on the grounds of data privacy laws in the countries where the servers are located.\n\nC) The government can use a national security letter to request the data, which allows for a secretive process overseen by the FISA Court and limits the cloud provider's ability to disclose the request.\n\nD) The cloud provider is automatically exempt from providing any data stored outside the U.S., as it would violate international data protection agreements.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The information provided mentions that there are special procedures under the Patriot Act, such as \"national security letters,\" that can be used when national security is at issue. These requests are overseen by the FISA (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) Court, operate with a high level of secrecy, and the process must generally be kept secret from the public and the target of the investigation. While there are legal limitations evaluated by the FISA Court, this process provides the government with a powerful tool to request data in national security cases, even if the data is stored outside the U.S.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because U.S. authorities can, in fact, compel cloud providers to produce data stored outside the U.S. under certain circumstances. \n\nAnswer B is incorrect because while standard subpoenas exist, national security matters often use more secretive processes that are harder to challenge.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because cloud providers are not automatically exempt from providing foreign-stored data. The legal framework allows for such requests under specific conditions, especially in matters of national security."

This is to encourage them to move to the more secure chip and pin POS systems, but many retailers have not made said switch and instead have adopted more rigorous verification methodologies for the old system.\n\nOne such system I have seen requires the cashier to check the ID of the customer and match it with the card, as well as match the last four digits of the card with the last for digits that were read by the card reader. Other procedures require signature checking and other such things.\n\nMy question is this, if the cashier does not follow one or all of these steps (cashiers are required to maintain a certain speed, these procedures are very time consuming) and fraud occurs, then is the company able to transfer liability to its employee on the grounds that procedures were in place to prevent it, but were not followed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In theory, yes; in practice no.\n\nAt common law, an employer is [vicariously liable](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_liability) for the negligent actions of an employee performed in the course of employment, and the employee is also liable to third\\-parties but can claim indemnity from the employer. The employer can sue the employee for breach of contract and win (see [Lister v Romford Ice Cold Storage](http://www.safetyphoto.co.uk/subsite/case%20i%20j%20k%20l/lister_v_romford_ice__cold_storage.htm)), however, such suits are rarely brought and even more rarely successful.\n\nThis is partly because of the bad publicity such cases generate but mostly because many jurisdictions have introduced laws to stop them like the NSW [Employee's Liability Act](http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ela1991217/).",

These procedures include ID checks and matching card numbers. If a cashier fails to follow these procedures due to time pressure and fraud occurs, what is the most likely outcome regarding the company's ability to transfer liability to the employee?\n\nA) The company can easily transfer liability to the employee since procedures were in place but not followed.\n\nB) The company cannot transfer liability to the employee under any circumstances.\n\nC) The company can transfer liability to the employee, but only if the employee signed a specific agreement accepting such liability.\n\nD) The company is unlikely to successfully transfer liability to the employee in practice, despite having a theoretical legal basis to do so.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While in theory, the company could potentially sue the employee for breach of contract, the answer explains that such suits are rarely brought and even more rarely successful. This is due to factors like bad publicity and laws in many jurisdictions that prevent such actions. The answer specifically states \"In theory, yes; in practice no,\" which aligns most closely with option D. Options A and B are too absolute, and option C introduces a condition not mentioned in the original text."
