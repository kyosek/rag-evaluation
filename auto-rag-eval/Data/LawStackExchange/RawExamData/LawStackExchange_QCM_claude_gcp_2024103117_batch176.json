Students were not informed of the nature of the survey prior to taking it, but they did know that it was non\\-anonymous and that school administration would be accessing the results of the survey.\n\nThe parent of the friend of my son received a letter telling her that there was some concern over the responses of her son and that she should follow up with her son to make sure there aren't mental health issues. I did not receive a letter, so I assume my son's SDQ did not raise any flags. I also do not know who within my school's administration has access to the SDQ results.\n\nMy concern is that administration is gathering mental health information about students without telling students (aged 14\\-18\\) that the purpose of the SDQ is to gather information about their mental health, and releasing this information to their parents without the students' consent. This would seem to me to violate HIPAA, which forbids the disclosure of a patient's protected health information without the patient's authorization. I have attached an image of the SDQ, as well as a link to the official website.\n\n[Link to survey download page](http://www.sdqinfo.com/py/sdqinfo/b3.py?language=Englishqz(USA)) The correct file is \"One\\-sided self\\-rated SDQ for 11\\-17 year olds\"\n\n[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qLkc0.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qLkc0.png)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Everything appears fine in terms of the school's actions. Who cares if they give the information to the parents? As long as there is not some other violation at the school or unless the information goes deeper than what you've provided the student has no ability to consent or not. This is true for two reasons. \n\n1\\) Protected Health Information\n\nProtected health information under the HIPAA Privacy Rule protects most \"individually identifiable health information\" *held or transmitted by a covered entity or its business associate...* \n\nHIPAA defines a *covered entity* as:\n\n* a health care provider that conducts certain standard administrative and financial transactions in electronic form\n* a health care clearinghouse; or\n* a health plan\n\nAs I'm sure you agree, the school is neither one of those things.\n\n2\\) Talking to the parents of a minor\n\nThe [Privacy Rule](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html) defers to state law regarding who is and is not considered a minor and when. That said, in general situations, \"a parent, guardian or other person acting *in loco parentis* usually is the personal representative of the minor child, and a health care provider is permitted to share patient information with a patient's personal representative.\" \n\nA parent is not treated as a minor child's personal representative [when](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/special-topics/mental-health/index.html): \n\n> (1\\) State or other law does not require the consent of a parent or other person before a minor can obtain a particular health care service, the minor consents to the health care service, and the minor child has not requested the parent be treated as a personal representative; (2\\) someone other than the parent is authorized by law to consent to the provision of a particular health service to a minor and provides such consent; or (3\\) a parent agrees to a confidential relationship between the minor and a health care provider with respect to the health care service.\n\nFinally, special treatment is given to cases of psychotherapy notes. A parent does not have a right to receive a copy of these notes about a child's mental health treatment. \n\n> The Privacy Rule distinguishes between mental health information in a mental health professional\u2019s private notes and that contained in the medical record. It does not provide a right of access to psychotherapy notes, which the Privacy Rule defines as notes recorded by a health care provider who is a mental health professional documenting or analyzing the contents of a conversation during a private counseling session or a group, joint, or family counseling session and that are separate from the rest of the patient\u2019s medical record.\n\n**Addendum**\n\nRecognizing that a school is not a health care provider or clearinghouse or health plan, I looked further for an answer related specifically to schools. Schools in these situations are not in general governed by HIPAA, but rather are governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). This [Joint Guidance on the Application of the FERPA and the HIPAA to Student Health Records](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/hipaaferpajointguide.pdf) issued jointly by the Dep't of Health and Human Services and the Dep't of Education is worth you taking a look at due to the numerous situations that can arise and the detailed Q\\&A included. \n\nGenerally, though, parents and eligible students (those 18\\+) have the right to inspect and review the student's education records. Education records are those that are directly related to the student and kept by an educational institution or agency or by a party acting for that agency or institution. \n\nImportantly, for you:\n\n> At the elementary or sec\n>  ondary level, a student\u2019s health \n>  records, including immunization records, maintained\n>  by an educational agency or institution subject \n>  to \n>  FERPA\n>  , as well as records maintained by a school\n>  nurse, are \u201ceducation records\u201d subject to \n>  FERPA\n>  .

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Schools are generally not covered entities under HIPAA, so HIPAA does not apply here.\n2. FERPA governs the privacy of student education records, including health records maintained by schools.\n3. Under FERPA, parents have the right to inspect and review their child's education records, which would include this questionnaire.\n4.

If there is a young child (say 4\\-10\\-ish) who is unsupervised and causing a major disruption, what is the extent of the measures you can take to stop him/her, as far as the law is concerned? When I say causing a disruption, I mean things like trashing a store, or spitting on passerby, or being aggressive, or even less important rules, like cheating at an arcade game, such as skeeball? I'm wondering basically because I watched this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\\=NuHLsPVeqLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuHLsPVeqLU)\nAs a normal person, watching, are you alllowed to intervene? Do you just have to deal with it, or can you forcefully make the child stop? I want to know from a legal standpoint, rather than moral.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In addition to the general considerations of (1\\) who is allowed to use non\\-deadly physical force to maintain order in a shop (which I think that one could do if \"deputized\" by the property owner or to protect the property of another as well), and (2\\) the use of non\\-deadly physical force to make a citizen's arrest (which many of these scenarios would justify as the disorder would be a crime if committed by an adult), (3\\) I suspect that there is also some point at which a bystander may intervene to prevent harms associated with an unsupervised minor being at large and in need of supervision.\n\nGenerally speaking, intervention with the minimum reasonable non\\-deadly physical force to prevent property damage, or an assault, or a threat, is going to be permissible. As to the third reason: for a mentally normal ten\\-year\\-old that might be a stretch; for a four\\-year\\-old or a clearly impaired older child it might not.\n\nOne could approach the child, say, \"where's your mom or dad\", \"do you have a babysitter or sibling around?\", \"what is your name?\", or \"are you lost?\" and detain the child until a satisfactory answer is provided or a suitable authority arrives, to prevent the problem of a child being lost, abducted or hurt by the child's own actions.\n\nIt would be quite hard for a parent, guardian or babysitter to complain about this kind of conduct when the child was unsupervised and is released as soon as you confirm that this really is a responsible adult or older minor who is responsible for the child.\n\nIt would be important in doing so to not secret away or isolate the child, to try to determine the location of the child's caretaker, to refrain from doing anything that would harm the child, and to seek assistance from an authority within a reasonable time. Typically, if no caretaker appeared, a cop would come and the cop would oversee the situation until a social worker could come.\n\nFor example, Colorado has the following statute that would apply once a cop arrived (omitting lengthy provisions that apply to newborn children):\n\n> \u00a7 19\\-3\\-401\\.

If they don't charge you for the working time, good for your company.\n\nJust expect the IRS to look at this bill more carefully than usual to make sure this is not in reality a dividend payment. For example, if the business travel was \"two weeks in a five star hotel in Hawaii, all expenses paid\", that wouldn't look quite right and cause trouble for both of you.\n\nPS: Cost of travelling to a company\u2019s share holder meeting is not a business expense.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A shareholder of Company A, who receives no wages from this company but is employed by unrelated Company B, undertakes a business trip on behalf of Company A.

A shareholder can legally receive reimbursement for legitimate business expenses incurred on behalf of the company, even if they are not an employee receiving wages. However, because of the potential for abuse, the IRS is likely to scrutinize such transactions more carefully to ensure they are not disguised dividend payments.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because shareholders can be reimbursed for legitimate business expenses, regardless of employment status. Answer B is wrong because legitimate expense reimbursements are not typically considered dividend income. Answer D is unnecessary and potentially problematic, as it could complicate the tax situation for both companies.\n\nIt's important to note that the reimbursement should be for actual business-related expenses and should be properly documented. Excessive or lavish expenses that appear more like personal benefits could indeed be reclassified as dividends by the IRS, leading to tax implications for both the company and the shareholder."}, "6": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60424/when-someone-steals-my-bicycle-do-they-commit-a-higher-offence-if-they-need-to", "docs_id": 60424, "title": "When someone steals my bicycle, do they commit a higher offence if they need to break a lock?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I know that stealing a bike is crime.

The person would be charged with grand theft (as the bicycle's value exceeds $750 but is less than $5,000) and criminal mischief (for breaking the lock). Grand theft in this case is a third-degree felony with a maximum sentence of 5 years. The criminal mischief charge for damaging the lock (worth $200) would result in monetary damages but wouldn't increase the maximum prison sentence. The damage doesn't reach the $1,000 threshold required to be an aggravating factor for the theft charge. While the person could be convicted of both charges, the sentences would likely be served concurrently, maintaining the 5-year maximum.

In this case, the Supreme Court of Canada refused to enforce a U.S. court order because there was existing Canadian legislation that prevented the release of the requested information.

One is the Attorney General of the State of Maine. According to the Maine Constitution:\n\n> The Attorney General shall be chosen biennially by joint ballot of the Senators and Representatives in convention.\n\nThe other is the chairman of the board of professional land surveyors. According to 32 MRS S 18211 SS 4:\n\n> The board shall meet at least once a year to conduct its business and to elect a chair.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is, 'how long do these terms last?' \n\nIn the first place, consider a scenario where John is elected Attorney General or Chair of the Board in a January of say the year 2000\\. Suppose the next election of a Chair or an Attorney General does not happen until December of 2001 or December of 2002 respectively. In each of those cases, does John serve more than one total year (in the case of Chair) or more than two total years (in the case of the AG)?\n\nIn the second place, suppose no \"election\" or \"motion of choosing\" takes place at all. What is the logical consequence of such a failure? If the preceding AG or the preceding Chair continues to serve, there is no consequence it seems for not doing that which is required by law. Does the Chair or AG cease to serve upon failure to \"choose\" or \"elect\" them annually or biennially? If so, when? \\- (see my first question above).\n\nI did manage to find this. See 5 MRS S 3\n\n> \u00a73\\. Civil officers serve until successors qualify\n>  All civil officers, other than judicial officers, appointed in accordance with law and whose terms of office are fixed by law, shall hold office during the term for which they were appointed and until their successors in office have been appointed and qualified, unless sooner removed in accordance with law. \\[1975, c. 771, \u00a725 (RPR).]\n\nBut 1\\) I don't exactly know what counts as a civil officer. And 2\\) I don't know what \"terms of office are fixed by law\" means precisely. After all, if the terms were really fixed by law, I might not be asking this question in the first place. On the other hand, if it is presumed that the \"elections\" will take place when they're supposed to do so, then the terms are kind of \"fixed\" in a sense.\n\nSecondly, even if the AG counts as a \"civil officer\", one of the very next sections after 5 MRS Section 3 says this. (See 5 MRS Section 6\\):\n\n> \u00a76\\. Officials have 30 days to qualify\n>  All public officers appointed or renewed in accordance with law shall, within 30 days after being commissioned, qualify to perform the duties of their office and the certificate of qualification must be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. Any officer who fails to qualify within 30 days and file a certificate of qualification in the office of the Secretary of State within 45 days must be suspended by the Secretary of State until the defect is corrected. During this suspension, the officer may be deemed to have forfeited the appointment and the office may be declared vacant by the appointing authority and a new appointment made. \\[1991, c. 837, Pt. A, \u00a77 (AMD).]\n\nI checked with the secretary of state. There are no \"certificates of qualification\" for board chairs. That must mean that they count as something other than \"public officers.\" So that might mean that section 3 does not apply to them at all. \n\nThere is one more thing. See 10 MRS S 8009:\n\n> \u00a78009\\. Standardized terms\n>  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon expiration of a professional or occupational licensing board member's term, that member serves until a successor is appointed and qualified. The successor's term commences at the expiration of the preceding term, regardless of the date of appointment.

The replacement member serves for the remainder of the unexpired term, regardless of the date of appointment. \\[2013, c. 217, Pt. A, \u00a72 (AMD).]\n\nBut I am sure this section is talking about the terms of actual board members, not the chair or any other kind of special elected officer of the board. \n\nWhat I'd like to know, in addition to an answer particularized for the state of Maine in these cases if you can, is when the term of such an official would end in the absence of any kind of legal specification?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm not quite sure what you're asking here. \n\nOfficials serve until they are (1\\) replaced (which covers until after their successor has qualified) or (2\\) removed from office by legal (or inevitable biological) processes.

Theoretically, a court could have to rule on the admissibility of a *specific* document, so in that sense the matter is always dealt with on a case by case basis. There is a [\"document\"](https://wikileaks.org/amazon-atlas/document/AmazonAtlas_v1/AmazonAtlas_v1.pdf) that purports to be somehow from Amazon, reporting that a certain grey building with no architectural charm in a nearby village is an Amazon data center. Legally speaking, nobody cares, but let's say that there is some legal reason why it matters whether the claim is true (I stipulate that the document passes the relevance test).\n\nThe publicly\\-posted document has no probative value, because anyone can create a file containing the word \"Amazon\". It looks like a cleaned\\-up OCR scan of a printout (hence the complete failure at non\\-English characters), and lacks any clear indicia of Amazon origin. Thus the party would have to establish that the document is authentic, and there must be a provable chain of custody from the author to the submitted document.

Nothing in [rule 901](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_901) suggests that such a document would be admissible.\n\nVery theoretically, if they happened to also have the original paper document, there might be sufficient forensic evidence to prove that the document is traceably come from the purported source.

According to the information provided, courts do not make blanket rulings on the admissibility of Wikileaks evidence. Instead, they would assess each specific document on a case-by-case basis. The key factors in determining admissibility would be the document's authenticity and the ability to establish a clear chain of custody from the original author to the submitted document. \n\nOption A is incorrect because courts do not automatically accept Wikileaks documents without scrutiny. Option B is also wrong, as courts do not categorically reject all Wikileaks documents. Option D is incorrect because Julian Assange's personal verification is not a legal requirement for admissibility.\n\nThe correct approach, as stated in option C, aligns with the Federal Rules of Evidence, particularly Rules 901 and 902, which deal with authenticating or identifying evidence.

Some countries do not have a system of copyright registration at all.

There are regulations related to health information (HIPAA), to educational records, to tax information, to census information, credit reporting agencies, and to banking records (as well, of course, as to national security information). There are also largely consistent restrictions at the state level related to the juvenile justice process.\n\nBut data privacy is not a subject of general regulation in the U.S.\n\nInstead, the data privacy regulations of the U.S. consist of a patchwork of fragmentary state and federal laws and regulations, superimposed on a significant and not entirely consistent or well developed body of common law precedents such as the privacy torts set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which some states have adopted fully, some states have rejected almost completely, and some states have adopted in part or with significant modifications.\n\nThe U.S. Constitutional law of the First Amendment also heavily colors how other legal limitations and authorizations are construed and drafted, because the right to distribute truthful information without restriction has long been considered one of the core protections of the First Amendment, even in the much less vigorously protected area of commercial speech.\n\nSome states have more general regulations, and the most important of these is California, both because it is a large and economically significant state, and because it is the home to many of the leading U.S. technology companies, many of which expressly adopt of the law of the State of California in choice of law clauses in their terms of service and contracts.\n\nThe California law most similar to the GDPR is the [California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5) (CCPA) which gives consumers rights with respect to the use of the personal information that businesses collect about them and the [CCPA regulations](https://govt.westlaw.com/calregs/Browse/Home/California/CaliforniaCodeofRegulations?guid=IEB210D8CA2114665A08AF8443F0245AD&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=Default&contextData=(sc.Default)) that provide guidance on how to implement the law.

He did not provide any and testified in writing and in court he could find none.\n2. On August 3rd 2022, day seven of the trial, plaintiffs' attorney Mark Bankston claimed he had obtained from Jones's attorneys a digital copy of Jones's cellphone on which there were texts and emails that mentioned Sandy Hook. He said this copy was mistakenly provided to him. Whether accidental or deliberate, this copy or *its texts and emails mentioning Sandy Hook were not provided during discovery*. Judge Gamble told the jury about the digital copy, \"we don't know whether it was on accident or on purpose... but what we do know is that it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been.\" [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=7658](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=7658)\n\nA video clip of the part of the hearing in question, when Bankston begins asking Jones about the texts.

And, when informed, did not take any steps to identify it as privileged or protected in any way, and as of two days ago it fell free and clear into my possession.

Jones had sworn he didn't even use email. Bankston showed him emails that appeared to be written by Jones. \"I must have dictated them\" said Jones.\n\nJudge Gamble told the jury about the digital copy, \"we don't know it was on accident or on purpose, but what we do know is it wasn't properly turned over when it should have been.\" [https://youtu.be/qhtz\\_6JKSh8?t\\=7665](https://youtu.be/qhtz_6JKSh8?t=7665)\n\n[Bankston told journalist Dan Solomon the phone copy was put in a Dropbox the parties were using to exchange materials](https://nitter.net/dansolomon/status/1554900413702443016#m).

For example, when a oil company owns the mineral rights and simply transforms the oil from a state of buried to a state of being in a barrel, such an activity is not taxable.\n\nHowever, if an oil company is rendering a drilling service for the owner of the mineral rights, and gets paid not in fiat cash at the end of the month, but in barrels of oil immediately upon extraction, then the oil company's revenue is the market value of the oil at the moment of extraction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is cryptocurrency mining/staking profits \"newly created property\"? I think that Crypto profits from staking/mining should be treated as payment received for performance of a service, i.e. assembling a new block.\n\nYour rationale mistakenly conflates two modalities of profit, one of which certainly constitutes newly created property.\n\nMining/staking profits have two components: (1\\) \\[crypto\\-]coins (whether fractional or not) which are new insofar as they did not exist before, and (2\\) transaction fees (in terms of the cryptocurrency) each payer determines in a competition for a timely processing of his transaction. Only the second component fits the notion of *service*, which [Black's Law Dictionary](http://heimatundrecht.de/sites/default/files/dokumente/Black%27sLaw4th.pdf) defines as \"*\\[t]he being employed **to serve another**; duty or labor to be rendered by one person **to another**, the former being bound to submit his will to the direction and control of **the latter**.*\" (emphasis added). In other words, a service involves a party and a counterparty.\n\nThe first component is not cognizable as \"service\" because there is no reasonable way to attach to a counterparty the act and outcome of mining/staking (that is, other than processing the specific transaction the anonymous/pseudonymous payer submitted). Indeed, the additional coins pursuant to the first component are not traceable to other's balance. The scheduled existence of additional coins pursuant to the first component does not change the fact that these coins come out of nowhere. Hence these coins are newly created.\n\nIt is in this sense that [Jarrett's pleadings](https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/IRS-Tax-Litigation.pdf) (paragraph 35\\) cite from [*Eisner v. Macomber*, 252 U.S. 189, 207 (1920\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/1920441252us1891420) the language \"*coming in*\". However, *Macomber* seems largely unavailing to Jarrett's claim because *Macomber* addresses whether \"*a true stock dividend made lawfully and in good faith*\" is taxable. For that purpose, the court delves in \"*the nature of a corporation and the stockholder's relation to it*\", a framework that is foreign to the cryptominer's/staker's relation to a quite abstract \"entity\" such as a cryptocurrency protocol.\n\n> In this case, the party making the payment is a \"decentralized autonomous organization\".\n\nThat is inaccurate in regard to the first component of profit because there is no such entity or organization in the first place. Simply put, one cannot file suit against \"Bitcoin\" or against \"the blockchain\", just like it would make no sense to file suit against the US dollar or against abstract entities such as a \"decentralized economy\".

Ashcroft*, [537 U.S. 186](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/537/186/) (2003\\). The Official Syllabus of that decision summarizes its analysis:\n\n> The Copyright and Patent Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 8,\n> provides as to copyrights: \"Congress shall have Power ... \\[t]o promote\n> the Progress of Science ... by securing \\[to Authors] for limited Times\n> ... the exclusive Right to their ... Writings.\" In the 1998 Copyright\n> Term Extension Act (CTEA), Congress enlarged the duration of\n> copyrights by 20 years: Under the 1976 Copyright Act (1976 Act),\n> copyright protection generally lasted from a work's creation until 50\n> years after the author's death; under the CTEA, most copyrights now\n> run from creation until 70 years after the author's death, 17 U. S. C.\n> \u00a7 302(a). As in the case of prior copyright extensions, principally in\n> 1831, 1909, and 1976, Congress provided for application of the\n> enlarged terms to existing and future copyrights alike.\n> \n> \n> Petitioners, whose products or services build on copyrighted works\n> that have gone into the public domain, brought this suit seeking a\n> determination that the CTEA fails constitutional review under both the\n> Copyright Clause's \"limited Times\" prescription and the First\n> Amendment's free speech guarantee. Petitioners do not challenge the\n> CTEA's \"life\\-plus\\-70\\-years\" timespan itself. They maintain that\n> Congress went awry not with respect to newly created works, but in\n> enlarging the term for published works with existing copyrights. The\n> \"limited Tim\\[e]\" in effect when a copyright is secured, petitioners\n> urge, becomes the constitutional boundary, a clear line beyond the\n> power of Congress to extend. As to the First Amendment, petitioners\n> contend that the CTEA is a content\\-neutral regulation of speech that\n> fails inspection under the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate\n> for such regulations. The District Court entered judgment on the\n> pleadings for the Attorney General (respondent here), holding that the\n> CTEA does not violate the Copyright Clause's \"limited Times\"\n> restriction because the CTEA's terms, though longer than the 1976\n> Act's terms, are still limited, not perpetual, and therefore fit\n> within Congress' discretion. The court also held that there are no\n> First Amendment rights to use the copyrighted works of others. The\n> District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. In that court's unanimous view,\n> Harper \\& Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U. S. 539,\n> foreclosed petitioners' First Amendment challenge to the CTEA. The\n> appeals court reasoned that copyright does not impermissibly restrict\n> free speech, for it grants the author an exclusive right only to the\n> specific form of expression; it does not shield any idea or fact\n> contained in the copyrighted work, and it allows for \"fair use\" even\n> of the expression itself. A majority of the court also rejected\n> petitioners' Copyright Clause claim. The court ruled that Circuit\n> precedent precluded petitioners' plea for interpretation of the\n> \"limited Times\" prescription with a view to the Clause's preambular\n> statement of purpose:\n> \n> \n> \"To promote the Progress of Science.\" The court found nothing in the\n> constitutional text or history to suggest that a term of years for a\n> copyright is not a \"limited Tim\\[e]\" if it may later be extended for\n> another \"limited Tim\\[e].\" Recounting that the First Congress made the\n> 1790 Copyright Act applicable to existing copyrights arising under\n> state copyright laws, the court held that that construction by\n> contemporaries of the Constitution's formation merited almost\n> conclusive weight under Burrow\\-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111\n> U. S. 53, 57\\. As early as McClurg v. Kingsland, 1 How. 202, the Court\n> of Appeals recognized, this Court made it plain that the Copyright\n> Clause permits Congress to amplify an existing patent's terms.

Concerning\n> petitioners' assertion that Congress could evade the limitation on its\n> authority by stringing together an unlimited number of \"limited\n> Times,\" the court stated that such legislative misbehavior clearly was\n> not before it.

It held that originality, for copyright purposes, is constitutionally mandated for all works. *Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc.*, 499 U.S. 340 (1991\\).\n\nSee also:\n\n* Under the Copyright and Patent Clause, Congress' copyright authority is tied to the progress of science; its patent authority, to the progress of the useful arts. *Golan v. Holder*, 565 U.S. 302 (2012\\).\n* Under this clause, Congress, to encourage people to devote themselves to intellectual and artistic creation, may guarantee to authors and investors a reward in form of control over sale or commercial use of copies of their books. *Goldstein v. California*, 412 U.S. 546 (1973\\).\n* This clause is both grant of power and limitation; this clause is limited to promotion of advances in useful arts. *Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City*, 383 U.S. 1 (1966\\).\n* The economic philosophy behind this clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is best way to advance public welfare through talents of authors and inventors in Science and useful Arts. *Mazer v. Stein* , 347 U.S. 201 (1954\\).\n* The Copyright Act of Congress, R.S. \u00a7\u20024952, as amended by the Act Mar. 3, 1891, c. 565, 26 Stat. 1106, giving to authors the exclusive right to dramatize any of their works, is valid as applied to pantomine dramatization by means of moving picture films. *Kalem Co. v. Harper Bros.*, 222 U.S. 55 (1911\\).\n* This section does not limit the useful to that which satisfies immediate bodily needs, and painting and engraving not intended for a mechanical end are among the useful arts, the progress of which Congress is empowered by this section to promote. *Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co.*, 188 U.S. 239 (1903\\).\n* No authority exists for obtaining a copyright beyond the extent to which Congress has authorized it; \u2009a copyright cannot be sustained as a right existing at common law, but depends wholly on the legislation of Congress. *Banks v. Manchester*, 128 U.S. 244 (1888\\).\n* Legislation concerning trademark protection is not authorized by this clause. *In re Trade\\-Mark Cases*, 100 U.S. 82 (1879\\).\n\nA [list of U.S. Supreme Court cases on the issue of copyright at Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_copyright_case_law) includes many additional copyright cases that don't implicate the U.S. Constitutional language.\n\nIt is also worth noting that while the U.S. Supreme Court is the final and most authoritative interpreter of the U.S. Constitution, that any court presented with an issue of constitutional interpretation can, and indeed, is duty bound, to interpret the constitutional in a legally authoritative way, which in the case of appellate courts (state and federal) serves as a legal precedent for other cases that \"makes law\" on the issue.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between copyright law and the U.S. Constitution's Copyright Clause, as interpreted by the Supreme Court?\n\nA) The Copyright Clause allows Congress unlimited power to extend copyright terms, as long as they are not explicitly perpetual.\n\nB) The Copyright Clause restricts Congress from applying new copyright laws to existing copyrighted works.\n\nC) The Copyright Clause requires that copyrighted works demonstrate originality, and this requirement is constitutionally mandated.\n\nD) The Copyright Clause authorizes Congress to create trademark laws in addition to copyright and patent laws.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C.

This is extra ironic because as far as I can tell by scanning the previous brief it looks like PA case law falls strongly on the side of not respecting donor contracts (though I haven't fully researched the fact, the presidents the brief cites definitely support the idea that parent's can't sign away their child's right), so it seems like the firm is misleading people about the law so they can offer to write contracts that likely won't be respected.\n\nI know the website is not technically lying in what they say, but it seems intentional misleading. I doubt a legal firm would break the law so blatantly, so I assume the claims on the website must be legal. However, that surprises me since what little I do know about common law situations it seems like 'technical truths' that are intentionally misleading usually are treated as falsehoods in other situations, for instance slander/libel laws or contract rulings trying to emphasis intent of contract instead of just the letter of the contract.\n\nSo, why is a claim like this allowed?

In that way, you narrow the list of defendants to the person with that name who is associated with that address. Another alternative would be to have the party designate an agent for service of process in the contract, although that would be more unusual.\n\nBut, because the need to give notice under the contract is usually necessary to carry out the terms of the contract, it doesn't feel as intrusive as asking for a birthday or other identifying information.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In an international contract signed electronically, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the identification of signers for legal validity?\n\nA) Signers must provide their full legal name, date of birth, and current residential address to ensure the contract is legally binding.\n\nB) The contract is only valid if signers provide their full legal name, country of birth, and a government-issued ID number.\n\nC) The contract can be legally valid with just an authenticated electronic signature, even if no other identifying information is provided within the contract itself.\n\nD) Signers must provide at least two forms of unique identification, such as passport number and social security number, for the contract to be enforceable internationally.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the documentation, a contract is valid if the party authenticates the record they are affirming, even if no other identifying information is provided within the contract itself. The key is that the authentication (e.g., electronic signature) is present, not the amount of personal information given. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while providing full name and address might be practical, it's not strictly necessary for legal validity.\n\nAnswer B is false because neither country of birth nor a government ID number are required for a contract to be valid.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect as the documentation does not state that multiple forms of unique identification are necessary for enforceability.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that while additional identifying information may be helpful for practical reasons (such as enforcing the contract later), it is not a requirement for the contract's legal validity.

FDA regulations govern the manufacture or distribution of devices and drugs, not the consumption. An overview of FDA regulation is [here](https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/Overview/ucm2005300.htm). They say they they are \"responsible for regulating firms who manufacture, repackage, relabel, and/or import medical devices sold in the United States\". The entire pile of regulations (21 CFR) is [here](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm). There has to be an underlying statute that authorizes the FDA to impose restrictions: that would be in [Title 21 of the US Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21). The specific law regulating medical devices is [21 USC 360](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/360). Congress can easily pass laws that restrict what businesses do (a consequence of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution), but they (theoretically) have a more limited ability to restrict what an individual does.

However, FDA regulations and federal law do not explicitly prohibit individuals from possessing or using such devices. The regulations primarily target businesses involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, not end-users. While it may be difficult for a consumer to legally obtain the device without a prescription, there are no specific federal criminal or civil penalties for an individual using the device without FDA approval.

This citizenship cannot be lost before the age of 18, and even after 18, it is very difficult to lose accidentally. The individual would have to intentionally renounce their citizenship at a US consulate, which is not possible for a minor. Additionally, the US does not allow citizenship renunciation if it would render the person stateless.

As noted above, if such emails do not advertise or promote a product or service, they are not commercial email messages and thus they fall outside the Act.\n\nThis indicates that the FTC believes that \"e\\-mails regarding current or prospective job openings that are sent to individuals who are not currently employed by the sender, and who are not charged any fees or other consideration in connection with any current or prospective job\" do not independently \"advertise or promote a product or service.\" And if the e\\-mail does not advertise or promote a product or service, it is not a commercial electronic message.\n\nMore importantly, though, CAN\\-SPAM does not apply to the military, as the federal government is not a \"person\" as defined at [16 C.F.R. \u00a7 316\\.2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/16/316.2):\n\n> \u201cPerson\u201d means any individual, group, unincorporated association, limited or general partnership, corporation, or other business entity.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to the CAN-SPAM Act and related FTC guidance, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding unsolicited emails about job openings from a military recruiter?\n\nA) Such emails are always considered commercial electronic mail messages under the CAN-SPAM Act.\nB) Such emails are exempt from the CAN-SPAM Act because they are sent by a government entity.\nC) Such emails are subject to the CAN-SPAM Act, but have a specific exemption for job-related communications.\nD) Such emails likely do not fall under the CAN-SPAM Act because they do not primarily advertise or promote a commercial product or service.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption A is incorrect because emails about job openings are generally not considered to advertise or promote a commercial product or service, according to FTC guidance.\n\nOption B is correct.

California defines and criminalizes homicide in the penal code [here](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=187-199), and section 195 starts setting forth circumstances where homicide is excusable. 197\\.2, for example, includes when\n\n> committed in defense of habitation, property, or person, against one\n>  who manifestly intends or endeavors, by violence or surprise, to\n>  commit a felony, or against one who manifestly intends and endeavors,\n>  in a violent, riotous or tumultuous manner, to enter the habitation of\n>  another for the purpose of offering violence to any person therein\n\nThe jury then has to decide if the facts match the various conditions enumerated throughout the criminal code as justifications, so there are specific instructions that the judge reads, given [here](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3476.html). (This is a generic self\\-defense instruction, not just aimed at homicide). They are told that the accused \"may use reasonable force to protect that property from imminent harm\", and that reasonable force is \"the amount of force that a reasonable person in the same situation would believe is necessary to protect the property from imminent harm\". So if the prosecution cannot prove \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used more force than was reasonable to protect property from imminent harm\", they are supposed to acquit. Now, suppose that you're sitting at a sidewalk cafe and some passing perp reached for your cell phone on the table. Blowing off his head would be an unreasonable degree of force.\n\nThere are additional instructions aimed at specific situations, such as the [right to eject a trespasser](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/3400/3475.html) that allows you to use reasonable force to eject a trespasser who refuses to leave, and again that degree of force is whatever the reasonable man would do in the circumstances that the victim reasonably believed existed (regardless of whether there was an actual threat). Deadly force is specifically allowed in self\\-defense against a \"[forcible or atrocious crime](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/500/505.html)\", which includes robbery. This does not include deadly force to prevent vandalism. \n\nYou will have noticed that it comes down to the jury making a subjective judgment call as to whether the degree of force used was beyond what the hypothetical \"reasonable man\" would use. \n\nTo clarify in response to the comment, the thing that all of the justified force defenses have in common is that the force be reasonable *in order to stop the aggressor*. If you can (safely) stop the vandal by smacking him once, but it would be satisfying to turn him into paste, you have to remain unsatisfied. Individuals can use force in defense of self or property, but only the law can use force punitively (and as I assume you know, that never includes beating a person up).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In California, a homeowner catches a trespasser attempting to steal an expensive lawn ornament from their front yard.

In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds, that such infringer was not aware and **had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright**, the court in its discretion may reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $200\\.\n\n[Branch v. Ogilvy \\& Mather, Inc.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6743155512361007994) says of willfulness (emphasis mine):\n\n> Thus, in order to prove willfulness, a plaintiff must show that the defendant knew or should have known that its conduct constituted copyright infringement. Similarly, in order to establish innocent intent, the defendant must prove that it did not know and **should not have known** that its conduct constituted infringement. One defense to an allegation of willfulness is **the defendant's reasonable and good faith belief** that its actions do not constitute copyright infringement.\n\nThe central question, then, seems to be whether the notice \"no copyright infringement intended\" aids or harms an argument that the infringer \"did not know or should not have known\" that they were infringing copyright, or else that they had a \"reasonable and good faith belief\" of non\\-infringement.\n\nI am not aware of any case law that concerns such a notice, but my layman intuition suggests to me that\n\n1. such a notice lends evidential weight that the defendant did indeed know the work in question was under copyright;\n2. since the defendant was therefore aware the work was under copyright, it is unlikely that they could successfully claim a reasonable belief that publicly distributing the entirety of (or a substantial portion of) the work without permission was not infringement.\n\nUltimately, I don't think such a notice does anything to aid the defendant's argument that they \"should not have known\" their use was infringing. Nor do I think it furthers an argument of \"reasonable and good faith belief\" by the defendant: the reasonableness of such a belief will rest significantly on the facts of the infringement, not only on how loudly they shouted, \"I *swear* this isn't infringement!\" Conversely, such a notice may further the idea that the defendant did know that copyright applied to the work, strengthening the plaintiff's argument that the defendant should have known the use was infringing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a copyright infringement case, a defendant posted copyrighted material online with the disclaimer \"no copyright infringement intended.\" How might this statement most likely impact the court's determination of damages?\n\nA) It would automatically classify the infringement as innocent, limiting statutory damages to $200.\nB) It would have no impact on the court's determination of damages.\nC) It could potentially strengthen the plaintiff's argument for willful infringement.\nD) It would guarantee the court's recognition of a good faith belief in non-infringement.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The statement \"no copyright infringement intended\" could potentially strengthen the plaintiff's argument for willful infringement.

The statement alone does not demonstrate a reasonable belief that the use was non-infringing.\n4. Courts consider whether the defendant \"knew or should have known\" their actions constituted infringement.\n5. The disclaimer might indicate the defendant had reason to believe their acts could be infringing, yet proceeded anyway.\n\nWhile the defendant might argue this shows good faith, the mere presence of the disclaimer is unlikely to be sufficient evidence of a reasonable belief in non-infringement.

The trademark 'medi' is not listed in the dictionary as a common abbreviation for 'medical'.

The reason no doubt is that they do not want to be put in the position of saying \"that is not\", when a court may later decide \"yes it is\". You have to rely on the wording of the question, specifically the fact that it refers to being obviously about a particular individual. The two key terms here are \"particular\" and \"obviously\". The former means \"uniquely\", so a half\\-eaten sandwich is \"about\" some human, but there are billions of people that it could be about. \"Obviously\" is more a judgment call, but comes down to the question of whether there is a path between the datum and the specific person which a person of average intelligence can see, versus (non\\-obviously) a hypothetical scenario whereby one might be able to connect a datum to a specific person.\n\nThe fourth question relies on relating \"an individual\", which in context we have to interpret as meaning relating \"a specific individual\" to the datum, as opposed to relating some set of individuals. Their example of a single person in a post being a \"yes\" (actually they just say it is \"an example\", but not what it is an example of) indicates that if the datum could be true of a number of individuals, then it is not established as being personal data (yet).\n\nQ5 oddly implies that what you might do with data defines whether the data is \"personal data\", which is confusing, but amounts to saying \"even if this is in the ordinary sense 'personal data', it is not subject to the protection requirements\" \u2013 this is not uncommon in law, where rules are stated in terms of a label ('personal data\"), and the rules are very simple, but the definition of the label can be complicated.\n\nQ6 distinguishes \"incidental\" facts from \"significant\" facts. As they say, the fact that X attended a meeting is personal data; the fact that coffee was served is *not*, even though it is a fact connected to the meeting which is connected to the person. The fact that X (alone) had black coffee would be PD. Q7 is quite vague, but reduces to asking \"what is the purpose of gathering the data\": if the purpose is \"about\" individuals, it is PD, but if it is about processes / machines, move on to the next question. Finally, they ask whether the data \"can impact\" an individual (similar to Q5 but without the implication of specific intent to do so). Ordinarily, one would think the datum \"has red hair\" can't have an impact on an individual, but with a bit of creativity, one can construct a reasonable scenario where this could have an effect (such as tending to prejudice people against the individual).\n\nThe guidance that you are looking at is an interpretation of what the law requires, and it is helpful to look at multiple interpretations, such as [this one](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A company collects the following information about its employees:\n1.

A deed from one owner of real estate to another co\\-owner doesn't violate a due on sales clause of a mortgage or deed of trust, and the fact that both of you are on the mortgage or deed of trust does not mean that both of you need to own it. Unless the decree says otherwise, the ex would usually have to transfer the property even if the mortgage is not yet refinanced. But, not all decrees and not all separation agreements have the same requirements and provisions. The exact language in the governing document would matter.\n\nIf the decree doesn't say who gets to occupy the house, you could and probably should go to the court to have that issue clarified. Since violating a clear court order can give rise to contempt of court sanctions of incarceration or fines, often someone will comply with it without having to have the police intervene to remove someone.\n\nConceivably, if the ex did not leave, you could seek to hold the ex in contempt of court for violating the divorce decree if it implies that the ex's right to occupy the house has ended. If the ex is found by the court to have willfully violated a court order following notice to the ex, an arraignment and a hearing if the violation was not conceded at the arraignment, the ex could face incarceration and/or fines (contempt proceedings are rather complicated and exactly how you do this is beyond the scope of a simple answer). \n\nYou could also seek to hold the ex in contempt of court for not promptly signing the quitclaim deed (assuming that the decree does not condition the duty to do this on the refinancing of the house), but this would not be the best solution to that problem. This is because you could also go to the court and have it appoint the clerk of the court as the husband's agent to sign the quitclaim deed on behalf of the ex (assuming again that the decree does not condition the duty to do this on the refinancing of the house), if the ex failed to do so as required by the divorce decree by the deadline set forth in the decree, or a new court order, or within a reasonable time if not deadline is set. Then, after you were in title, you could bring an eviction action if necessary. It is much easier and faster to get an order directing the clerk to sign something on behalf of a party to a lawsuit than it is to hold someone in contempt of court.\n\nYou could also ask the court to issue a protection order prohibiting him from occupying the house at any time prior to the title being put into your name pursuant to the decree. This could take effect as soon as the protection order signed/authorized by the judge is served upon the ex. A protection order (in most states) is directly enforceable by the police, unlike most court orders which are only enforceable by bringing contempt of court charges in the court that issued the order. But, a court would usually be reluctant to issue a protection order unless there was a clear and present risk of physical harm, or severe emotional harm to you from a violation of the decree.\n\nAlso, while the ex wouldn't be committing the crime of trespassing by occupying the house, it wouldn't be unprecedented for you to persuade a police officer to remove the ex from the house after explaining the situation to prevent a breach of the peace between you, or because the ex's conduct in overstaying his right under the decree to be in the house constitutes \"disorderly conduct\" or \"loitering\" or \"harassment\" or some other minor offense in the opinion of the police officer, even if that charge might not hold up if prosecuted in court. But, there is really no way to compel a police officer to do that and it is close to the boundary of what a police officer does and doesn't have the authority to do.\n\nMost of these remedies would take several weeks, at a minimum, to complete. A protection order could be done in a day or two, subject to a prompt follow up hearing within a week or two after the fact.

[Washington search law](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=10.79&full=true) has extensive limits on strip and body cavity searches, whereas searching pockets is like searching a premise (a copy of the warrant must be eventually presented, along with an inventory of items seized).\n\nIt is typically stated that ideally, police will show a copy of the warrant to the person being searched or whose premise is being searched, but ideally does not mean \"must always\".

While there are general rules about presenting search warrants, the exact timing can vary by jurisdiction and circumstance. Most jurisdictions require that a copy of the warrant and a receipt for seized items be provided, but this doesn't always have to happen before the search begins. Some jurisdictions, like Arkansas, have specific rules about announcing presence and authority before entering a dwelling, but even then, the warrant itself might not need to be shown immediately if there's a reasonable belief that doing so could endanger the execution of the warrant.\n\nOption A is too absolute, as there are circumstances where immediate presentation isn't required. Option B is incorrect because in most cases, officers do need to provide the warrant at some point, not just after completion.

Liability insurance does not directly protect the corporate veil or prevent it from being pierced. The decision to pierce the corporate veil is based on factors such as commingling of personal and business finances, failure to observe corporate formalities, and other actions that blur the line between the LLC and its owner(s). However, liability insurance can help mitigate the financial consequences if the corporate veil is pierced by potentially covering judgments against the LLC. This can indirectly protect the owner's personal assets, not by preventing the piercing of the veil, but by providing a financial buffer.

The article says that 'the brand is now promoting stickers called \u201cBody Vibes\u201d', presumably \"the brand\" referring to Goop. It does seem to be true that they are *promoting* it, but they are not selling it: they do refer to a different web page for [shopbodyvibes.com](https://www.shopbodyvibes.com), and those folks are selling [something](https://www.shopbodyvibes.com/variety-packs/variety-12-pack), but they don't actually say what the things are, much less what they do.

The problem (not necessarily insurmountable) with going after somebody for making false advertising claims is that the most false claim (about NASA suits) is made by somebody that doesn't sell or manufacture the product, the claims made by the presumed manufacturer (\"programmed with the frequencies of nature to help the body energize itself\") are sufficiently vacuous as to have no truth value at all.

It says \"you can't vote unless...\" three things. It has to be locally legal to vote for something other than a federal office, the election has to include something other than voting for federal office, and it cannot be possible to vote for a federal office at the same time. Given that, it is impossible for any alien (even documented) to vote for president. Extant alien\\-voting laws are no higher than municipality, most being in Maryland. Violation of the law is a crime.\n\nBecause non\\-citizens are not allowed to vote in state\\-wide elections, the theory is that they literally cannot vote, so they will not receive a ballot, which comes from the state. [Here](https://elections.maryland.gov/laws_and_regs/documents/Election%20Law%202011.pdf) are the election laws for Maryland. There isn't a provision for \"disqualifying\" a vote, instead a person is prevented from voting in the first place if they are successfully challenged, because they can't prove who they are or the person they claim to be is not registered to vote (a non\\-citizen will never be registered with the state to vote, assuming no fraudulent documentation).

According to 18 U.S. Code \u00a7 611, an alien may be allowed to vote if three conditions are met: (1) the election is held partly for some purpose other than electing federal officials, (2) aliens are authorized to vote for such other purpose under state or local law, and (3) voting for the non-federal purpose is conducted independently from voting for federal offices, ensuring aliens cannot vote for federal positions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law specifically prohibits aliens from voting in elections solely for federal offices. \n\nOption C is incorrect because while some local jurisdictions may allow non-citizen voting in local elections, this alone does not satisfy all the conditions set by the federal law.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the law does not provide for federal judges to authorize alien voting under exceptional circumstances.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the specific conditions under which alien voting might be permissible according to federal law, emphasizing the complexity of the legal framework surrounding voting rights for non-citizens in the United States."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/27343/can-i-build-an-iphone-app-that-generates-cryptocurrency-income-without-the-user", "docs_id": 27343, "title": "Can I build an iPhone app that generates cryptocurrency income without the user&#39;s consent or knowledge?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I had an idea of an iPhone app but I'm not sure if the methods are entirely legal.

According to the documentation, Apple is likely to reject such an app regardless of whether the cryptocurrency mining feature is disclosed or not. This is due to several reasons:\n\n1.

If to publish some article with HTTP links in any web site, the source of information that has been used could be checked immediately by clicking on the links, (Wikipedia do such as to provide the changeability of objectivity of the information). However, in time the source web page that has been used as reference could be deleted, as result it becomes impossible to check the source of information. The way out is to create the mirror of source web page and include this mirror in own web site. So even if source web page will be deleted, it\u2019s still possible to refer on the mirror.\n\nLet me give an example of the conflict situation. Mr. A in a fit of temper published on his home page the unfavorable information in respect to himself, then later comes around and delete this information. However Mr. B, who has the interest to Mr. A, already quoted the deleted information with http\\-link and also just in case created the mirror of the home page of Mr. A.

Just like with google, nobody will object if you pull the site content assuming that you are not just trying to republish the content in breach of their copyright. They will however object if you are trying to pull a copy every minute as that would considered an attack on their servers.\n\nThere is however information which website owners explicitly state they don't want automated crawlers to access. This is by convention declared in a file on the website called [robots.txt](http://www.robotstxt.org/). You will see in the archive.org FAQ that they do not crawl those pages.\n\nLikewise, archive.org is removing content from website owners who give legal notice of not hosting their content \\- They will have to in order to comply with the DMCA.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A blogger wants to preserve references to online articles they cite in their posts.

It respects site owners' wishes as expressed in robots.txt files, acknowledges copyright protections, and complies with valid takedown requests. This approach is similar to how archive.org operates, balancing preservation efforts with legal obligations. Option A ignores potential copyright issues.
