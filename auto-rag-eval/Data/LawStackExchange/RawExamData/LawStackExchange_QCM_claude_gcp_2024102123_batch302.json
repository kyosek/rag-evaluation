        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: An author wants to write a book in a different language that simplifies and combines concepts from multiple American works on learning. Which of the following approaches is most likely to be considered legal and not infringing on copyright?\n\nA) Directly translating portions of the original works into the new language without altering the content\nB) Summarizing the main ideas from the original works without changing the language or context\nC) Rewriting the concepts using local idioms, simplifying the ideas, and presenting them in entirely new contexts\nD) Copying the structure and organization of the original works but using different words to express the ideas\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most likely to be considered legal and non-infringing. This approach involves significant transformation of the original works, which is a key factor in avoiding copyright infringement. By rewriting the concepts using local idioms, simplifying the ideas, and presenting them in entirely new contexts, the author is creating a \"transformative\" work that goes beyond mere translation or summarization.\n\nOption A is clearly infringing as it involves direct translation, which is a right reserved for the original authors. Option B, while not directly copying, may not be sufficiently transformative to avoid infringement. Option D, although using different words, might still be too close to the original works' structure and organization to be considered transformative.\n\nThe correct approach (C) aligns with the advice given in the original answer, which emphasizes the need for transformation that goes beyond what could be achieved through simple translation or paraphrasing."

Wouldn't it be illegal for the clause to exclude the jurisdiction of United States courts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is not illegal if the transaction has any relationship to the foreign country (this limitation is called the [minimum contacts](https://www.cogencyglobal.com/en-gb/blog/consent-to-jurisdiction-forum-selection-clauses-and-the-minimum-contacts-requirement) test). These agreements called [choice of law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choice_of_law_clause) or [forum selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_selection_clause) clauses are routinely honored.\n\nIt usually isn't illegal for a clause to exclude a United States court as a forum as to the parties to the contract.\n\nThe Restatement (Second) of the Conflict of Laws \u00a7 80 (1971\\), a source often relied upon by courts regarding common law rules upon which they have no binding precedents, states that:\n\n> \\[T]he parties agreement as to the place of the action cannot oust a\n> state of judicial jurisdiction, but such an agreement will be given\n> effect unless it is unfair or unreasonable.\n\nThis doesn't actually divest the U.S. courts of jurisdiction over the case, but does mean that if you bring the case in a U.S. court in circumstances where there is no reason that the clause isn't valid and applicable, that your case will be promptly dismissed, possibly with an award of attorney fees and costs against you for trying to evade a valid contractual provision.\n\nThe law concerning the scope of a choice of forum clause's application, and who decides that question, can be somewhat involved, but in particular cases, where the existence of a binding contract is undisputed and no exceptions to the general rule upholding these clauses is present, the enforcement of a choice of forum clause is often uncontroversial. As Wikipedia explains (in the forum selection clause link above):\n\n> In *Future Industries of America v. Advanced UV Light GmbH*, 10\\-3928,\n> the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York\n> City affirmed the dismissal of a case that sent the parties to Germany\n> because the forum selection clause made German courts the exclusive\n> forum. By contrast, the same court in *Global Seafood Inc. v. Bantry\n> Bay Mussels Ltd.*, 08\\-1358, affirmed the refusal of the lower court to\n> refer the parties to Ireland because the clause was not exclusive, and\n> the litigation continues in America.\n> \n> \n> The state of New York has a statute expressly dealing with those\n> circumstances under which a New York court may not dismiss a case on\n> the grounds of forum non conveniens if the parties' contract provides\n> that the agreed upon venue is a court in New York and if the\n> transaction involved an amount more than $1 million.\n> \n> \n> Currently, a U.S. Circuit Court split is emerging over whether forum\n> selection clauses in a contract supersede pre\\-existing arbitration\n> clauses in regulatory membership rules, such as FINRA.\n\nStatutory exceptions may apply in some cases.\n\nFor example, under U.S. law, a provision allowing a debt collector to bring suit in consumer debt collection cases outside the place where the consumer debtor resides is void as a matter of public policy under the [Fair Debt Collection Act](https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/supmanual/cch/fairdebt.pdf).\n\nBut, as a general rule, such clauses are not prohibited.\n\nTwo of the leading cases upholding such clauses in U.S. law are *M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off\\-Shore Co.*, 407 U.S. 1, 32 L. Ed. 2d 513, 92 Sup. Ct. 1907 (1972\\) (discussed in [this law review article](https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3360&context=til)) and *Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute*, 499 U.S. 585 (1991\\). And, although both of these cases were in the specialty of admiralty law there is no reasoning in these cases confining the holding of these cases to a maritime law setting.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A U.S. company and a German company enter into a contract with an exclusive forum selection clause designating German courts for any disputes. The U.S. company later wants to sue the German company in a U.S. court. Which of the following statements is most accurate?\n\nA) The U.S. court must hear the case because it's illegal for a contract to exclude U.S. court jurisdiction for U.S. companies.\n\nB) The U.S. court will likely dismiss the case, unless the forum selection clause is found to be unfair or unreasonable.\n\nC) The U.S. court will hear the case, but will apply German law as per the choice of law clause.\n\nD) The forum selection clause is automatically void because it doesn't meet the \"minimum contacts\" test with Germany.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, forum selection clauses are generally upheld by U.S. courts unless they are found to be unfair or unreasonable. The Restatement (Second) of the Conflict of Laws \u00a7 80 states that such agreements will be given effect unless unfair or unreasonable. U.S. courts typically honor these clauses and will dismiss cases that attempt to evade them.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it's not illegal for a contract to exclude U.S. court jurisdiction if the parties agree to it.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because it confuses choice of law with choice of forum. While the court might apply German law if there was a separate choice of law clause, the forum selection clause would likely result in dismissal.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the \"minimum contacts\" test is actually a limitation on forum selection clauses, requiring some relationship to the chosen forum. It doesn't automatically void such clauses.\n\nThis question tests understanding of forum selection clauses, their enforceability, and common misconceptions about jurisdiction in international contracts."

How do the organizations handle these cases?\n\nEDIT:  \n\nI agree with the copyright answer. I will search it further on the law Stack exchange site as suggested in the answer and the comments.\nThis is different from [the other question](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/109087/how-do-large-companies-protect-their-source-code) because there they OP is asking about ways to protect the source code. I am interested in impact of code theft and ways to handle it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Patents are not that relevant in this case. Software patents are unenforceable in most parts of the world anyway.\n\nWhat matters here is copyright. Every work contract has a clause that everything an employee creates as part of their employment is copyrighted by the company. So using company\\-owned code to build an own project would be a copyright violation. There are also other legal tools in some jurisdiction which can be used against employees trying to misuse intellectual company property. But that's a topic for [Law Stackexchange](https://law.stackexchange.com/).\n\nAlso, this isn't really related to a BYOD policy. Being able to bring your own device to work and then back home might make data theft more convenient, but isn't required. There are many other ways to steal sourcecode, like USB drives or uploading them to the internet. \n\nTo prevent the first you would have to design your software development offices like a supermax prison facility with meter\\-high walls (so nobody can throw a device over it) and strip searches on everyone leaving the building. This is neither feasible nor reasonable for anything below matters of national security.\n\nTo prevent the second, you would have to completely prevent internet access from developer workstations, which would greatly impede the productivity of any software developer.\n\nSo most companies do not even try to physically prevent employees from stealing sourcecode. They rather rely on the legal safeguards and on maintaining a mutual trust relationship with their employees. It might seem counter\\-intuitive to some, but when you do **not** treat your employees like potential criminals they are in fact **less** likely to betray you.",

As stated in the documentation, \"Every work contract has a clause that everything an employee creates as part of their employment is copyrighted by the company.\" Therefore, using company-owned code for a personal project would constitute a copyright violation. \n\nPatent infringement is less relevant because, as mentioned, \"Software patents are unenforceable in most parts of the world anyway.\" Trademark infringement doesn't apply to code usage, and while the scenario could potentially involve trade secret misappropriation, copyright is the primary legal tool used to protect source code ownership in employment contexts.\n\nThe question also touches on the challenges of preventing code theft through physical means, highlighting that companies often rely on legal safeguards and trust relationships with employees rather than extreme security measures."

Or are the prosecution expected to share such evidence with the defense (perhaps upon request) beforehand, allowing the defense to prepare for it? Basically, are the prosecution/defense supposed to know/anticipate the main evidence/witnesses of each party? Or are they allowed to keep some things secret and \"surprise\" the other side during the trial as an attempt to gain an advantage? And what things are they allowed to (or not allowed to keep) hidden away like that?\n\nAs an example, perhaps the defendant has some video evidence of him away from the crime scene. Is the defence allowed to bring up that evidence out of nowhere during the trial and blindside the prosecution? Or does the prosecution have right to know of such evidence beforehand so they can prepare a rebuttle with regards to it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Unsurprisingly, there is a rule of criminal procedure at the federal level, [rule 16](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_16). It is complicated, but here are the broad strokes of that requirement.\nThere are a number of requirements of government disclosure (a), and then there are defendant's disclosure rules (b). If defendant requests, the government must disclose defendants statements, also the defendant's prior record, documents and objects, test results. There is also a duty to disclose w.r.t. expert witnesses. Specifically excluded are government\\-internal documents regarding the investigation or prosecution (things that won't be introduced at trial), and grand jury transcripts. There are conditions and exceptions within the exceptions: all of these obligations are \"if the defendant requests\".\n\nThe defendant must disclose certain documents if the defendant requests and the government complies under Rule 16(a)(1\\)(E) which is the government's obligation to disclose objects. Then\n\n> the defendant must permit the government, upon request, to inspect and\n> to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs,\n> tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions of any of\n> these items\n\nif the defendant has it and intends to use it. There is a similar requirement to report test results in his possession that he intends to use, if he has so requested of the government, and also expert witnesses have to be disclosed. Not subject to disclosure by the defense are\nanything statement\\-like made by or to the defendant or his attorney by defendant, a witness or a prospective witness (on either side). This is pre\\-trial discovery. [Rule 26\\.2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp/rule_26.2) applies during trial:\n\n> After a witness other than the defendant has testified on direct\n> examination, the court, on motion of a party who did not call the\n> witness, must order an attorney for the government or the defendant\n> and the defendant's attorney to produce, for the examination and use\n> of the moving party, any statement of the witness that is in their\n> possession and that relates to the subject matter of the witness's\n> testimony.\n\nSo the government or defense must comply with that order as well.\n\n\"Surprise witnesses\" are allowed. The party discovering such a witness must be genuinely \"surprised\", so a party can't deliberately suppress information that they have a eyewitness and a photograph, but if they discover such evidence late in the game, it can be admissible.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a federal criminal trial, the defense team discovers new video evidence the day before the trial that shows the defendant was not at the crime scene. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the use of this evidence?\n\nA) The defense must immediately disclose this evidence to the prosecution, regardless of their strategy.\n\nB) The defense can introduce this as a \"surprise\" during the trial without any prior disclosure.\n\nC) The defense must disclose this evidence only if they had previously requested similar evidence from the prosecution.\n\nD) The defense cannot use this evidence at all because it was discovered too late in the process.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16, the defendant must disclose certain documents and objects if the defendant had previously requested and received similar disclosures from the government under Rule 16(a)(1)(E). In this case, if the defense had earlier requested and received evidence from the prosecution, they would be obligated to disclose this new video evidence. However, if no such request was made, the defense might be able to introduce it as a \"surprise\" during the trial. The key is that the discovery of the evidence must be genuinely \"surprising\" to the defense team, not deliberately suppressed. Option A is incorrect because immediate disclosure isn't always required. Option B is partially true but doesn't account for the reciprocal discovery rules. Option D is incorrect because late-discovered evidence can be admissible if it's genuinely new information."

Me and a friend are working on a sort of Horror/Comedy.\n\nA basic plot rundown: Ronald Mcdonald is a crazy lunatic who acts as the guardian of McDonalds, and will protect it at all costs. Yes, he tries to kill the Main Character.\n\nWe plan for this to be posted on YouTube, with credit to Mcdonalds in the credits, and in the video description. It will be free to watch, and we won't make any profit from it at all. Is it legal to do this, or is it an infringement on copyright?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Not the show you describe\n-------------------------\n\nRonald McDonald is a trademark, and his appearance is copyright owned by the McDonalds corporation. That means that subject to an exemption, only McDonalds can decide what happens with Ronald McDonald.\n\nAs described, you are going to use *Ronald McDonald*, not a generic clown that evokes Ronald McDonald in a comedy/horror. The most relevant exception that springs to mind is the trademark [Parody](https://www.lottfischer.com/blog/trademark-parody/) exemption (and a similar exemption that exists for copyright fair use).\n\nYour movie doesn't appear to be a parody \\- the idea of a murderous clown protecting a burger chain is not, on its face, a parody of McDonalds. That is, it might be funny (or not) on its own terms, but it is not obviously poking fun *at* McDonalds which is the essence of parody. Obviously, your plot outline is brief and perhaps the full script is an incisive commentary on the way McDonalds is doing ... something.\n\nFurther, famous marks have extra protection \\- works that tarnish the mark are more likely to be considered infringing. Tarnishment happens when a distinctive mark is depicted in a context of sexual activity, obscenity or illegal activity. You know, like a crazy lunatic murderer.\n\nCompare and contrast with this parody:\n\n[![Krusty Burger](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQZJX.jpg)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jQZJX.jpg)\n\nThis evokes McDonalds but it doesn't use any of their trademarks or copyrighted material *and* it also evokes other fast\\-food restaurants. The parody elements are clear: it clearly *isn't* McDonalds; it only uses as much material as necessary to get the audience to make the link; the joke is *about* fast\\-food restaurants: their sameness, teen\\-worker\\-exploitation, promotions, crap food etc.\n\nWhen they do [explicitly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD7uKwtc_FU&ab_channel=superchundable) compare Krusty Burger with McDonalds the joke is *about* [McDonalds](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/22_Short_Films_About_Springfield/Quotes):\n\n> **Lou:** Y'know, I went to the McDonald's in, uh, Shelbyville on Friday night.\n> \n> \n> **Chief Wiggum:** The McWhat?\n> \n> \n> **Lou:** Uh, the McDonald's restaurant.

To be clear, I do not belong to that religious group, the predominate religion of Utah, though my S/O does as does my former supervisor. When my supervisor dug into it and found out her religious affiliation he was heavily critical of her, and terminated me shortly after a discussion where he was quite critical of our relationship and was abusive in his thoughts on her.\n\nI am filing with the UALD \\& EEOC jointly, however I am looking for some statutes and rulings relevant to this to help strengthen my argument in this case against my former employer as this case is somewhat unusual. Most notably I am not being discriminated because of the specifics of my own religion, or of not belonging to a particular religion but because I am dating someone of a particular religion while I do not belong to it myself. The more conservative members of this particular religion, as communicated to me by my supervisor, believe that they should not be in inter\\-faith relationships.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI should update this that the UALD ruled that I was not discriminated against for *my* religion and after my employer slandered me for nearly a year, making it nearly impossible to work in my industry, pushing me to bankruptcy, the UALD ruling gave me the right to sue but did not rule in my favor. My lawyer suggested I should not sue as the company would continue slandering me if I lost, but would likely stop (they did) if I dropped it but still had the option to sue. All in all my finances were ruined, my career required life support, and I was out thousands of dollars on lawyers.\n\nEssentially the investigator was overly focused on what my religion is and didn't/couldn't understand where discrimination actually occurred.The employer's legal team did as much as they could to confuse the situation further. I learned my lesson on challenging the separation of church and state in Utah, as well as taking on a public company that spends millions on lawyers every year. I discovered after starting the process thanks to an answer below that the UALD rules in favor of less than 1% of employees in discrimination claims.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Utah laws Title 34A (Utah Labor Code), Chapter 5 (Utah Antidiscrimination Act)\n[Section 106 (Discriminatory or prohibited employment practices)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title34A/Chapter5/34A-5-S106.html?v=C34A-5-S106_2016051020160510) provides that:\n\n> (1\\) It is a discriminatory or prohibited employment practice to take an action described in Subsections (1\\)(a) through (g).\n>  (a) \n> \n> \n> \n> > (i) An employer may not refuse to hire, promote, discharge, demote, or terminate a person, or to retaliate against, harass, or discriminate in matters of compensation or in terms, privileges, and conditions of employment against a person otherwise qualified, because of:\n\n...\n\n> > > (F) religion;\n\nIt does not say \"the employee's religion\". \n\nHowever, under subsection (3\\)(a) of section 106, if religion (or any of the other categories protected under subsection (1\\)(a) is a *bona fide* occupational qualification, it may be the basis of a decision to hire, fire, or other employment actions. \n\nSection 106 does not apply to religious organizations, in any of various organizational formats, according to section 102\\. An employer is defined in [section 102(1\\)(I)(i)](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title34A/Chapter5/34A-5-S102.html?v=C34A-5-S102_2016051020160510) as:\n\n> a person employing 15 or more employees within the state for each working day in each of 20 calendar weeks or more in the current or preceding calendar year.\n\n(In addition to various governmental organizations) \n\nNothing in section 106 specifically mentions discrimination because of the religion of a spouse or dating partner. But it does say \"because of religion\" without saying whose.\n\n[This Utah Government site](https://laborcommission.utah.gov/divisions/AntidiscriminationAndLabor/employment_discrimination.html) has addiitonal information.\n\nNote also that even where it is found that an employer did not in fact unlawfully discriminate, if an employee complains about what the employee believes in good faith to be unlawful employment practices, and the employer takes adverse actions because of such complaints, that may still be unlawful retaliation. The case of [*Viktron v. Labor Comm.* Case No. 20000386\\-CA (2001 UT App 394\\)](https://law.justia.com/cases/utah/court-of-appeals-published/2001/viktron-1.html) deals with such a case. Other sources have suggested that retaliation is sometimes easier to prove than the initial act of discrimination is.\n\nMost large multi\\-national companies have internal anti\\-discrimination policies, often ones stricter than any law requires. The one i work for makes it very clear that any such action should be reported to HR or to a designated high\\-level office, and promises that serious action will be taken against managers enraging in such discrimination. It has even distributed videos in which various employees describe how they reported such improper practices and how the company responded. \n\nOf course, I don't know how your former employer's policies on such things read, or how they are enforced in practice. But it might be that going over the head of the supervisor would resolve this without legal action. In some cases, publicity can induce a company to \"do the right thing\" when it might not be legally compelled to. \n\n[This story in the *Salt Lake Tribune*](https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2017/12/17/it-doesnt-matter-what-you-say-in-utah-the-agency-that-investigates-job-discrimination-is-so-mistrusted-that-some-lawyers-go-to-the-feds-instead/) Discusses the UALD and the state of enforcement of the law.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation under Utah labor law?\n\nA) The termination is clearly legal as Utah law only protects against discrimination based on an employee's own religion.\n\nB) The termination is clearly illegal as Utah law explicitly prohibits discrimination based on an employee's partner's religion.\n\nC) The termination may be illegal under Utah law, which prohibits discrimination \"because of religion\" without specifying whose religion.\n\nD) The termination is legal if the employer has fewer than 15 employees, regardless of the reason.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Utah's Antidiscrimination Act (Title 34A, Chapter 5, Section 106) prohibits employment discrimination \"because of religion\" without explicitly stating it must be the employee's own religion. While the law doesn't specifically mention discrimination based on a partner's religion, the broad wording \"because of religion\" could potentially cover this situation. The case is unusual and not clearly defined in the statute, which is why option C is the most accurate. Option A is incorrect because the law doesn't specify \"employee's religion.\" Option B is incorrect because the law doesn't explicitly mention partner's religion. Option D, while true about the 15-employee threshold for the law to apply, doesn't address the core issue of religious discrimination in this scenario."

Rewriting a lease only affects future obligations, and doesn't extinguish past obligations. However, you appear to have released X from all obligations via paragraph 2\\. If you plan to sue for past rent, the court will have to interpret the statement that \"The landlord, Y, and Z agree to *relinquish X from any obligation* regarding the lease as mentioned above\", which is non\\-standard English. It is extremely likely that the court will interpret this to mean \"release\".\n\nYou might argue, using earlier emails, that all parties had a clear understanding that this means \"from all future obligations, but not past obligations\", but that is not what the written agreement says, and the parol evidence rule, which is codified as [explicit law in California](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3474830.pdf), says\n\n> execution of a contract in writing... supersedes all the negotiations\n> or stipulations concerning its matter which preceded or accompanied\n> the execution of the instrument\n\nThat clause lets X off the hook, in exchange for his claim on the security deposit and for relinquishing his tenant rights to the unit.

Federal government makes laws that control the interaction between states, and insures that constitution is upheld. \n\nTo enforce compliance with federal programs, congress uses the the spending clause to limit the amount of federally available funds to a given state.\n\nBesides cutting the funding, can the federal government do anything to a state, when the state creates internal rules(not conflicting with the constitution) that are contrary to federal government's ideas? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The state can decriminalize all drugs under state law, no problem. They merely have to repeal their version of the Uniform Controlled Substances Act and all related legislation. However, the federal drug statutes, contained in [21 U.S.C. 13](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/21usc/), still apply because of the principle of dual sovereignty (if a state tried to explicitly overrule them, the [Supremacy Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause) would come into play). Let's take a look at some of the statutes under Title 21, Chapter 13, of the U.S. Code.\n\nSection 801 of that chapter described Congress's findings in enacting the Controlled Substances Act. \u00a7801(3\\) through (6\\) provide the basis for federal authority to regulate intrastate affairs with respect to drug trafficking and possession. The section claims that intrastate drugs \"contribute to swelling the interstate traffic,\" and concludes that \"federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled substances is essential to the effective control of the interstate incidents of such traffic.\" Thus, the federal government will continue to enforce the federal controlled substances laws regardless of state legalization. A notable exception is the [Rohrabacher\\-Farr amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohrabacher%E2%80%93Farr_amendment), which bans DOJ from using federal funds to prosecute medical marijuana programs legal under state law.\n\nHowever, the federal government isn't always successful in (and doesn't always attempt) regulating intrastate behaviors using its [interstate commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause) authority. For example, the original Gun\\-Free School Zones Act of 1990 (since amended and complemented by a 1994 law using the condition\\-of\\-funding approach), was struck down by the Supreme Court in [*United States v. Lopez*, 514 U.S. 549 (1995\\)](https://origin-www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/United_States_v_Lopez_514_US_549_115_S_Ct_1624_131_L_Ed_2d_626_19?1538428198). The law, banning possession of handguns near schools, was found to be an overreach of the Commerce Clause authority. But it was amended by adding the additional interstate nexus of the gun having been moved interstate, which was a very minor limitation in practice. Since it only exempts individuals with a license issued by the state where the school is, it has significantly limited the ability of states to pass \"constitutional carry\" laws and allow for CCP reciprocity, because many highways and homes fall within its reach.\n\nSo, if a state is willing to lose all of its federal funding, then Congress can't ever force it to create, maintain, or enforce a state law. But in many ways, the federal government can still enforce its will through criminal law on a number of intrastate activities.",

It might be held unenforceable if no party to the contract nor the subject matter of the contract had any connection to New York State.\n\nThere are circumstances, however, where a consent to a forum, although not the choice of law provision, would be invalid. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act requires suits by a debt collector to collect a debt from a consumer to be brought in a venue where the consumer resides. But, it isn't clear to me that this would apply in an international transaction.\n\nThere might be other exceptions that would apply in some peculiar set of facts, but we don't have enough facts to speculate on those possibilities. Almost all legal rules are context specific and are subject to exceptions in unusual situations.\n\n> Could I be placed in situations where I would have to choose between\n>  violating local law or the contract?\n\nThis is exceedingly unlikely. New York, like most states, recognizes the doctrines of illegality and frustration of purpose and impossibility as defenses to failure to perform a contract. \n\nAlso, a contract that would mandate behavior that is illegal where the contract is performed that is not illegal in New York State, is hard to imagine. Without knowing anything about the context of the contract or its subject matter it is hard to speculate.\n\n> If a dispute does arise, would that mean I have to travel to NY just\n>  to go to court?\n\nNormally, you could hire a New York lawyer to represent you, filing an Answer, participating in discovery, and engaging in motion practice. But, ultimately, you would probably have to submit to a deposition in New York State, and would later have to go to New York State is the matter proceeded to trial. Sometimes, telephone testimony is permitted, but permission to do so would be unlikely to be granted to a defendant in a civil case in most circumstances, unless that defendant's testimony was on a minor and largely uncontroverted point.\n\nIn a case where one party is based in New York State and the other is based outside the United States, you could probably remove the case from state court to federal court, however, if more than $75,000 was at stake.",

Mexico has a \"right to publicity\", including the right to allow or deny the use of one's image([https://en.uhthoff.com.mx/articles/publicity\\-and\\-image\\-rights\\-in\\-mexico/](https://en.uhthoff.com.mx/articles/publicity-and-image-rights-in-mexico/)). *However,*\n\n> We were the principal supplier of jewelry (50K/year) to a customer who refused to raise the price 7 years (January 2000\\-December 2017\\).\n\nThis suggests the possibility of a contract. The contract can contain multiple terms, including potentially the granting of the right to use imagery that the cooperative holds(which they possibly might hold on behalf of their members). Additionally/alternatively, the permissions to use such images may have been obtained from the subjects by the photographers directly.\n\nIf not a term of the contract, such permission may possibly be revoked (though receiving payment can potentially complicate this); if part of the contract, it may still be revoked, but doing so may necessitate the termination of the contract.\n\nSide note: Generally speaking, unless mandated by law (unlikely, especially since they are not an employer) or contract terms, the buyer is not required to raise prices. The seller may be able to refuse to sell at the old prices (unless required to do so by contract terms).\n\n> That business was sold in 2018 to a lady who used to be the stock girl; she claims no knowledge of any accounting before her tenure. We want to \"close the books\", since we dont have the complete record; only the customer kept track of the differences so as to round everything off in their favor.\n\nThe buyer's records should be irrelevant to your accounting\\*. The buyer could sell the jewelry, give it away, or destroy it, and this should be irrelevant to In general, the cooperative gives the buyer jewelry and receives either money or debt in return. In either case, normally one receives a record recording of the receipt jewelry from the buyer (e.g. \"On DD/MM/YYYY, received 5 bracelets\" or whatever)\\*\\*.\n\n\\*Unless the \"buyer\" is not actually buying the jewelry, but rather selling it on consignment, which is a completely different relationship and scenario.\n\n\\*\\*Thus, even in the case of debt, this should not matter, as the cooperative should have its own, independent, records of its delivered property, funds, debts and invoices pending, for tax purposes if nothing else.\n\n> What makes this different, is that these people assure their customers that they are doing a good deed for traditional third\\-world artisans. Otherwise, probably, they would not purchase. Can these people somehow be legally held to the principles they espouse to their customers?\n\nGenerally, this would be dependent on the laws of where the borrower sells to their own customers. Usually, one is only held to account to act in accordance with laws and obligations(such as those established by contract); however, there are frequently \"false advertising laws\" prohibiting lies in advertising products. However, depending on the advertising, this may not be false. \"We buy directly form a co\\-operative of Mexican craftswomen\" would be true, for example.",

The answer highlights that many online retailers prefer to form the contract only when goods are dispatched, rather than at the point of order. This approach protects the company from potential lawsuits for specific performance if they're out of stock, allowing them to decline the offer and refund the money instead.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the sufficiency of a textbox and checkbox for contract formation varies depending on the specific EU country and the type of contract. Option B is false because contract formation laws can differ significantly between EU member states, making a single, standardized method potentially problematic. Option D is incorrect as the answer explicitly states that contract formation laws differ between England, Wales, and Scotland, despite them being part of the United Kingdom."

This statute (which would be typical of jurisdictions permitting this and was a model statute for many other states) states:\n\n> (1\\)\u2002At the time the conversion becomes effective, the converting\n>  entity shall be converted into the resulting entity, and the resulting\n>  entity shall thereafter be subject to all of the provisions of the\n>  organic statutes.\n> \n> \n> (2\\)\u2002Unless otherwise agreed, **the conversion of any converting entity\n>  into a resulting entity shall not be deemed to affect any obligations\n>  of the converting entity incurred prior to the conversion to the\n>  resulting entity or the personal liability of any person incurred\n>  prior to such conversion.**\n> \n> \n> (3\\)\u2002Unless otherwise agreed or otherwise provided by the organic\n>  statutes, other than this article, the converting entity shall not be\n>  required to wind up the entity's affairs or pay obligations and\n>  distribute the entity's assets, and the conversion shall not be deemed\n>  to constitute a dissolution of the converting entity and shall\n>  constitute a continuation of the existence of the converting entity in\n>  the form of the resulting entity.\n> \n> \n> (4\\)\u2002**The resulting entity is the same entity as the converting entity.**\n\nColorado Revised Statutes \u00a7 7\\-90\\-202\\.\n\nNothing in your question suggests another form of transaction that would cause the new entity to be one that is not bound by the old contract.\n\nBut, the nature of the change in name and entity form is also something that would ordinarily not be easy for an outsider to determine.\n\nIf, in fact, it was a sale of substantially all assets from A to B, which would not normally result in an assumption of the contract of A by B, then several options would be available:\n\n1. The non\\-defaulting company could sue A for breach and recover the funds received for the sale of the assets. If there were no funds, it would be a fraudulent transfer and the non\\-defaulting company could sue B on a fraudulent transfer theory.\n2. B could be held to be a successor company to A and held liable, for example, on an alter ego theory.\n3. B's continued participation in the contract after the A to B transition could be held to be conclusive evidence of an assumption of the contract by B making it liable by its own agreement as a consequence of its actions continuing to participate in the contract.\n\nUltimately, however, the facts in the question are not clear enough to determine the outcome.",

In most jurisdictions, when a company changes its form (e.g., from Inc. to LLC) through a statutory conversion process, it is considered a continuation of the same legal entity. Laws like Colorado's \"Junction Box Statute\" typically provide that the resulting entity (Company Y in this case) is the same entity as the converting entity (Company X). This means that Company Y would retain all of Company X's rights and obligations under existing contracts. The fact that the contract still had Company X's information does not invalidate it, as Company Y is legally considered the same entity.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Olio Model One is a smartwatch sold from 2015 to 2016 by Olio Devices, Inc. The Olio watches were rather expensive, with a price range from $595 to $1,395\\. Furthermore, to work, the Olio needs to be able to talk to a specific API server; without this API server, the companion smartphone app will not function, and without the smartphone app the watch itself will not function.\n\nOlio Devices was acquired by Flex, Ltd. in early 2017, after which they never sold anymore Olio watches; apparently Flex acquired Olio Devices just to use Olio's technology in their own products. In addition to ceasing the sale of Olio watches, Flex also shut down the API server I mentioned above later in 2017, resulting in most Olio watches losing almost all of their functionality. Neither the former employees of Olio Devices nor Flex gave any solution to this; customers were expected to live with their $595\\-$1395 paperweights.\n\nUnder United States consumer protection law (Olio Devices was founded and headquartered in California and Flex has offices throughout the US), can Flex be sued for this, either for payouts or for a solution to make the Olio watch work again? If so, is there a time frame in which such lawsuits would need to be filed?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are multiple thorny legal questions and factual questions that would need to be resolved to get an answer. An effective remedy for the consumers against Olio Devices would be challenging, but not impossible to prevail in, and an effective remedy against Flex would be considerably harder to prevail in.\n\nThe first thing you would need to know is how the sale of Olio Devices to Flex was structured. If Flex truly merged as a corporate entity with Olio Devices, or if Olio Devices purchased the Flex entity and then changed its name to Flex, there would be liability from the consumer to Flex is a cause of action could be established.\n\nBut, if Flex merely purchased selected assets from Olio Devices for cash, any liability would run from the consumer to Olio Devices, and would be limited to the cash received by Olio Devices in the deal.\n\nIf that cash was insufficient to pay liabilities owed by Olio Devices to its consumers, in order to prevail against Flex, the consumers would have to establish that the sale to Flex of its assets was a \"fraudulent transfer\" which doesn't necessarily require proof that there was an actual intent to defraud, but does require a showing that (1\\) the total liabilities of Olio Devices (including contingent future liabilities) exceeded the value of its assets at the time of the sale, (2\\) that Olio Devices did not receive \"substantially equivalent value\" for the assets it sold to Flex, (3\\) that the sale was not ratified by a bankruptcy court if Olio Devices was in bankruptcy, and (4\\) that the sale of assets from Olio Devices to Flex took place more than four years before the lawsuit seeking to set aside the fraudulent transfer. Alternately, the statute of limitations could be longer, the threshold of proof could be lower, and punitive damages up to 50% of the recovery otherwise available, if there was an actual intent to defraud the consumers of Olio Devices in the sale of assets transaction that could be established.\n\nIt is also possible that Olio Devices was kept intact as an entity, whose shareholders were now a parent company, and the parent company didn't take any assets out of the subsidiary, which would make it hard to sue the parent company.\n\nOf course, all of this hinges on whether there is an underlying case against Olio Devices.\n\nAssuming that the watches were sold in 2015 and 2016 without an intent to defraud at that time, one would have to determine what the nature of the contractual arrangement for post\\-sale service by Olio Devices was with respect to those watches. This would not be an elementary matter and would take review of relevant documents (e.g. warranties and license agreements) and consideration of case law in other circumstances that might be relevant regarding implied contractual terms. The outcome of that would be a close question. If the contract didn't have such a term, or expressly disavowed such liability, then the next question would be whether the absence of such term would render the contract unconscionable causing a term like that to be implied in law.\n\nAssuming that the consumers established that there was an implied contractual term that the watches would be supported by Olio Devices indefinitely, the next question would be when the statute of limitations started to accrue. Generally speaking, this happens when there is a breach of the contract and that breach is known to the consumer, which would probably happen in late 2017\\. The [statute of limitations in California](https://statelaws.findlaw.com/california-law/california-civil-statute-of-limitations-laws.html) for a breach of a written contract is four years, and for an oral contract is two years, but I don't know what the relevant statute of limitations would be in the case of a contractual term implied in law or in fact.\n\nThere might be a consumer protection law specific provision, intertwined with the implied contractual term, but my guess is that this is unlikely.\n\nAll of the relevant questions would arise primarily under state law. The law that would apply would again be fact specific. Normally a contract to enter into a sale of goods is governed by the state where the sale takes place and runs between the seller and the buyer, who would often not be the underlying manufacturer, so the warranty or license or service contract from the underlying manufacturer might be the controlling document and would usually have a choice of law provision which would probably choose California law as the governing law.\n\nIt is also conceivable that this issue could be framed as a product liability issue with the product being defective because it relied upon a service that could be discontinued. This liability would run directly from the consumer to Olio Devices. The statute of limitations in California for a products liability lawsuit involving personal property is generally three years.\n\nRealistically, the only economic way to bring any economic lawsuit would be via a class action lawsuit, but if any contract or license running from Olio Devices directly to the consumer contained an arbitration clause (which it is quite likely that it would) then a class action lawsuit would probably be barred and an arbitration proceeding would have to be commenced instead.\n\nSo, there are facts not present in the question that are necessary to provide an accurate answer, but the clock is definitely ticking and many theories of relief are likely to be barred some time in 2020 or 2021 depending upon the theory, and some causes of action may already be time barred.\n\nOf course, if this happened in 2017, it is very likely that someone already did bring a lawsuit, which may have been settled, resolved in arbitration proceedings, or resolved in a class action proceedings that was concluded or is still pending. If there was a class settlement of such a lawsuit, it may still be possible to apply to receive a payment under that settlement. It would be surprising for someone to wait until now to sue, if there were many thousands of units sold that were rendered useless and there was a viable litigation option. Somebody would almost surely have investigated the matter before then and there are multiple law firms in California that specialize in these kinds of lawsuits and usually figure out opportunities for lawsuits first and recruit clients second.\n\nOther Factual Background\n========================\n\nFactual background [here](https://www.soft32.com/blog/platforms/another-one-bites-dust-long-olio/) and [here](https://www.soft32.com/blog/platforms/update-another-one-bites-dust-long-olio/).\n\nData on the sale of the company/assets [here](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/97958-44).\n\nThe most valuable asset of Olio Devices was probably [its patent license revenues from Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/2016/01/25/microsoft-and-olio-devices-announce-patent-licensing-agreement/).\n\nIt appears that the purchase price was [$14 million.](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/olio-devices#section-overview)",

If Flex merged with Olio Devices or purchased the entire entity, they may be liable for Olio's obligations. However, if Flex only purchased selected assets, it would be much more difficult to hold them liable. The other options are incorrect because:\n\nA) is too absolute and doesn't account for the complexities of corporate acquisitions.\nB) oversimplifies the situation; even in an asset purchase, establishing liability against Flex would be challenging and would require proving elements of a fraudulent transfer.\nD) is incorrect because different legal theories (breach of contract, product liability, etc.) have different statutes of limitations under California law."

According to the information provided, there are generally no specific laws restricting polls or their content in the United States. This is because such restrictions would likely be considered an unreasonable infringement on freedom of speech. \n\nOption A is incorrect because polls are not subject to the same regulations as commercial advertisements. Restrictions on deceptive practices typically apply only to conduct in trade or commerce.\n\nOption B is false because the Federal Election Commission does not have such specific guidelines for polls. The information does not mention any such regulations for election-related polls.\n\nOption D is incorrect as there is no mention of the FCC requiring polls to include options for rejecting or disputing question premises. The lack of such requirements is part of the broader absence of poll-specific regulations.\n\nThe key point is that polls, even if potentially misleading or biased, are generally protected under free speech principles and are not subject to the same restrictions as commercial communications."

That is the address (therefore city) that you use for voter registration, and basically how you identify \"where I live\". If you lives 5 miles out in the country in an unincorporated area, you'd still use Needles (e.g.) as you mailing address: but you would not be able to vote for a mayor of Needles, just based on your mailing address. \n\nBoth municipalities might claim jurisdiction based on the physical location of the property, especially for matters of building code. It should not be possible for both municipalities to tax the full value of your property, but they could split the assessment proportionally. The cities themselves are not collecting the tax, the county is (though property straddling a county line raises an interesting question).",

A major split is between Sharers and Residuaries: a Sharers are all related by blood. A secondary split relates to testate vs. intestate succession (was there a will?). There are also special rules for West Bengal, Chennai and Bombay. A widow is generally entitled to a share of her husband's property, but if the husband dies before his father, the husband does not have his father's property. But then, if a Muslim marries under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, they are not treated legally as Muslim for purposes of inheritance.\n\nAll told, it is most likely that the widow has no legal claim on the property, but still a person should engage an attorney who can assess the particulars of the case.",

The document from Indian courts suggests that widows are generally entitled to a share of their husband's property, but this does not extend to property that the husband did not own or inherit. The statement that \"if the husband dies before his father, the husband does not have his father's property\" supports this conclusion. However, it's important to note that individual cases can be complex, and factors such as the specific state laws, whether the marriage was under the Special Marriage Act, and other legal variables could affect the outcome.

The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that people not suspected of criminal activity can ignore a police officer who approaches them. [Wisconsin](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/state-supreme-court-wisconsin-drivers-ignore-cop-knocking-car-window-drive/) has even said, that even after a police officer knocked on your window, you can still leave. However, it **may** give probable cause, especially with the statement of \"Oh shit! The police!\"\n\nIt **IS** illegal to run from a cop who has detained you or issued a lawful order.

However, once an officer issues a lawful order such as \"Stop!\", continuing to run becomes illegal. The act of running alone, even if preceded by a statement like \"Oh shit! The police!\", is not illegal, though it may give the officer probable cause to investigate further. It's important to note that this applies generally in the US, but specific state laws may vary. The legality of running is not dependent on whether you're carrying illegal items or have warrants, though these factors would certainly complicate the situation if discovered. Option D is incorrect because there are indeed circumstances where running from the police becomes illegal, specifically after a lawful order has been given."

Why else would the case still exist 14 years later? Same with forging a car registration or anything similar?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The statute of limitations is quite relevant.\n\nA couple points to help explain why:\n\n* First, there are a lot of different legal actions that could arise from someone stealing property. You could have criminal charges for theft, you could have a civil claim for conversion (to pay the value of the stolen property), you could have a civil claim for replevin (to return the stolen goods), and you could have a civil action to determine the true owner of the property.\n\nAll those cases arise under different laws, and all of them could have different SOLs. The fact that time has run out for one doesn't necessarily mean that time has run out for all of them.\n* Second, improperly obtaining title *does not* mean that you are not and never will be the true title holder. Take a look at the doctrine of \"adverse possession,\" which basically allows you to become the true owner of real or personal property by simply acting like the owner for a long enough period of time \\-\\- ranging from 5 to 21 years, depending on the jurisdiction.\n* Third, SOL is a restriction on when you can *start* a lawsuit. Sometimes, as Dale M said, it starts when you actually learn about the transfer, but it could also start when you *would have* learned about the transfer if you had exercised reasonable diligence. So the fact that a lawsuit is happening now regarding something that happened a long time ago doesn't necessarily mean the SOL was inoperative; it may just mean that the SOL didn't start until long after the transfer, or it majy just mean the litigation is dragging out.\n* Fourth, the Facebook example is not a good one. [That lawsuit](http://i.zdnet.com/blogs/cegliavszuck.pdf) is primarily focused not on the transfer of property, but on breaches of contract, for which [the relevant statute of limitations is six years](https://codes.findlaw.com/ny/civil-practice-law-and-rules/cvp-sect-213.html). Second, those breaches are focused on a contract reached in 2004\\. Because the lawsuit began in 2010, it was started within the statute of limitations.

However, I'll address some misconceptions that you have:\n\n> to protect me against potential lawsuits and future divorce\n\nNone of the scenarios will protect you from these. If you are a beneficiary of the trust then you own the beneficial interest. A beneficial interest is (for most purposes) an asset like any other and can be bought, sold, or taken away from you in a lawsuit.\n\n> I want to make a irrevocable trust\n> \n> \n> I would be the beneficiary.\n\nThese two aspects are mutually incompatible. If you are the beneficiary, then in [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") (and probably in many other jurisdictions), under the rule in [Saunders v Vautier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saunders_v_Vautier) you can collapse the trust and merge the beneficial and legal interests.

How about a company that I am the only owner of?\n\nYou can generally name anyone you like to the a trustee, including all of the above. The only thing you cannot do is have the trustee(s) be the exact same set of people as the beneficiary(s), because then there isn't a trust at all. This is because the beneficial and legal interests are held by the same people and the trust terms are unenforceable since you cannot sue yourself.\n\n> Are these cases still provide the correct protections?\n\nNone of them will provide you with protection against lawsuits and future divorce, for the reason I stated at the start.\n\nNote: my answer is largely based on [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") but with the assumption that it probably applies to most common law systems given that these are basic trust law principles.

This means the trust cannot truly be irrevocable if John is the only beneficiary.\n\nOption A is incorrect because naming himself as trustee would not provide protection, and having the same person as both sole trustee and sole beneficiary would negate the existence of a trust.\n\nOption B is incorrect because naming a company John owns as trustee doesn't ensure irrevocability or asset protection if John remains the sole beneficiary.\n\nOption D is incorrect because even if John is not the trustee, his beneficial interest in the trust is still considered an asset that can be subject to legal claims or divorce proceedings."

Carjacking is explicitly listed as a forcible felony in Statute 776.08.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The Kavanaugh hearings have brought up an interesting point. What are the legal obligations of a government employer, when it comes to handling allegations against a prospective employee?\n\nI would like to use a different example. Instead of a Supreme Court nomination, suppose that a person is applying to a teaching position in a public school, and someone claims that she had inappropriate contact with a minor. \n\nWhat kind of due process is the school required to abide by in approving or rejecting the candidate? Is a mere allegation enough to warrant refusal to hire, or is there legal precedent against that?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, there is legal precedent against this that would only apply to a government employee. First, let's discuss the private sector.\n\nIn this case, you are a private employee that comes to your place of work and accuses you of \"stealing the cookies from the cookie jar\" which is a serious criminal offense. They wish to talk and your boss is in the room. You plead the 5th, but your boss says you're fired if you don't talk to the cops. This is legal because you still have the right to refuse to talk, you just lose your job. A private employer has the right to free association, and wants nothing to do with cookie thieves, alleged or actual.\n\nHowever, in the government employ, your boss is an agent of the government. This same situation is different because the government pays the boss and the agent... so in essence the government is saying talk or be fired. This is unconstitutional as the government cannot retalitate against you for your refusal to talk.\n\nGenerally, in order to talk to you, the investigator would need either a signed Garrity Statement or a Signed Kalkines Statement. The former is a statement saying that they are investigating a wrong doing but you cannot lose your job if you refuse to speak to the investigators, where as Kalkines says you must talk but you are granted immunity for your part in the wrong doing, so long as you make truthful statements.\n\nFor more on this, check this [legal blog](https://www.spigglelaw.com/employment-blog/surviving-workplace-investigations/).\n\nThere is also the matter that a false accusation (and let me be clear... this is academic, I'm not saying the accusation in the real life topic is false, nor am I saying that the defense is false... we're merely discussing a possibility) is made to your employer and they do not offer the job on the basis of the accusation alone, this is grounds for defamation actions... and in certain jurisdictions, it's criminal defamation, so there could be jail time.\n\nIt's interesting you mentioned teachers, because this happens alot. Kids do know that there are certain things that get a teacher fired quickly, so teachers do get the occasional false accusation of sexual assault (I know one teacher who has had multiple accusations over the course of her career). One of the few good things I can say about the Teachers Union is they cover the legal defense of accused teachers. The accusations do get the teacher removed from the class for sometime, but they don't lose their jobs over this matter. It's followed up but the accusation doesn't immediately lead to the teacher getting fired..",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the school's legal obligations in handling this allegation?\n\nA) The school can immediately reject the candidate based solely on the allegation without any further investigation.\n\nB) The school must conduct a thorough investigation and provide due process before making a hiring decision, as the candidate has constitutional protections as a potential government employee.\n\nC) The school can ask the candidate to either deny the allegation or withdraw their application, with no other options available.\n\nD) The school has no legal obligation to consider the allegation and must proceed with hiring based only on the candidate's qualifications.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. As a government employer, the public school must provide due process and cannot make decisions based solely on allegations. The information provided indicates that government employees have constitutional protections that private sector employees do not. The school would need to conduct a proper investigation and allow the candidate to respond to the allegations before making a hiring decision. Simply rejecting the candidate based on an accusation alone (option A) could potentially lead to legal issues, including defamation claims. Options C and D are incorrect as they do not reflect the legal obligations and protections involved in government employment situations."

Briney.\nC) The man is protected under the Castle Doctrine, which allows for the use of force to defend one's property.\nD) The man can only be held liable if the thief dies as a result of the flashbang detonation.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. This case is most similar to Katko v. Briney, where property owners were held liable for injuries caused by a trap set for potential intruders. In both cases, an explosive device was used to deter theft, which courts have generally found to be an excessive use of force. Even though the intent was to protect property, the law typically does not allow for such potentially dangerous measures that can cause serious harm to others, even if they are committing a crime. The man in New Orleans could likely be held liable for any injuries caused by the flashbang, just as the Brineys were held liable for injuries caused by their shotgun trap."

Any \"final authority\" the Supreme Court has under the Constitution is limited to the parties of cases before it.\n\n1. Is it correct that failure of the Federal Constitution's Supremacy Clause to explicitly mention court decisions mean these do not form part of the \"Supreme law of the land\"?\n2. Is is correct that a Supreme Court decision only binds the parties to the case before it?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> To what extent do the decisions of appellate courts in the US (both\n> Federal and State), and particularly decisions of the US Supreme\n> Court, bind those who were not parties to the case?\n\nA published opinion of a court regarding questions of law is binding precedent with respect to all issues necessarily decided by the court to resolve the issues presented to it in a case arising in a court whose decisions can be appealed to it (in a court whose decisions can be appealed to a court that can be appealed to it).\n\nThus, U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decisions are binding precedents for the U.S. District Courts in its circuit (and on the bankruptcy courts and bankruptcy appellate panels in its circuit). Bankruptcy appeal panel decisions are binding on U.S. District Courts and U.S. Bankruptcy Courts in the appellate circuit, but are inferior to U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decisions.\n\nState supreme court decisions are binding on all state courts. Intermediate state court of appeals decisions are binding on the state trial courts whose decisions may ultimately be appealed to intermediate state courts of appeal (all of them if there is one intermediate state court of appeal, but only some of them if there are multiple intermediate appellate court districts in that state) and all courts to which appeals are taken to state courts if appeals from those state courts in non\\-appellate cases may be appealed to intermediate state courts of appeal.\n\nA U.S. District Court, in one of the rare cases in which there is a direct appeal of right to the U.S. Supreme Court (e.g. election law cases) is still bound by the binding precedents of its circuit on any issue decided in the case upon which the circuit has binding precedents.\n\nSimilarly, for example, in Colorado courts of limited jurisdiction called county courts have their decisions appealed to courts of general jurisdiction called district courts, but further appellate review of a county court decision is made to the Colorado Supreme Court rather than to the Colorado Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court. But, despite that, Colorado Court of Appeals precedents are still binding in county courts in Colorado, because the District Courts to which it appeals are themselves required to treat Colorado Court of Appeals decisions as binding precedents.\n\nBut, federal court decisions on matters of state law (usually in diversity jurisdiction cases) are only persuasive precedents on these state law matters. Thus, if the (federal) U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in a diversity case has to rule on a question of state law, a Colorado Supreme Court decision is more authoritative than a U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit decision on the same subject, even though either would be a binding precedent on the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\nConversely, a decision of a state's intermediate court of appeals is not binding upon federal courts on matters of state law, although they are highly persuasive. *See, e.g., Clark v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co.*, 319 F.3d 1234, 1240\\-1241 (10th Cir. 2003\\). A federal court may ignore an otherwise binding precedent of an intermediate state appellate court if the federal court concludes that the decision of that court was decided contrary to the likely holding of the state's highest court. *See, e.g., DigitalGlobe, Inc. v. Paladino*, 269 F. Supp. 3d 1112, 1122 (D. Colo. 2017\\). If a federal court is unsure how an issue of state law would be resolved in a state court, such as in a state law case of first impression upon which the state has no binding precedents, it can certify that legal issue to the state's highest court for a definitive resolution of the state law issue presented.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions are binding on all courts in the United States as to matters of federal law including interpretations of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nDecisions of a court that does not have appellate authority over the court making the decision, unpublished decisions of a court, decisions of a court on issues not necessary for it to decide in the case before it which are called *dicta*, and authorities other than case decisions, statutes, and regulations, are merely persuasive authority. Some courts don't allow citations to unpublished decisions at all.\n\nThere are a few federal forums where this is particularly tricky. The National Labor Relations Board, the U.S. Tax Court, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (none of which are Article III federal courts), each serve as unified trial courts with a national territorial scope in their subject matter areas. But appeals from their decisions are to whichever of the twelve U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the case arises (D.C. and Circuits 1\\-11\\). In those forums, the question of which circuit's decisions are binding and which are merely persuasive authority for the NLRB, Tax Court or BIA depends upon where the particular case before it arose.\n\n> And to what extent are Federal Court decisions binding on state\n> officials and courts?\n\n*Precedents and Federalism*\n\nU.S. Supreme Court decisions on questions of federal law including federal constitutional law and treaties, are binding on all courts. Federal court decisions on matters of state law are not binding on anyone but the parties to the lawsuit.\n\nFederal court decisions on question of state law are not binding precedents on state courts.\n\nThe corollary of these rules, which is subtle, is that a decision of a U.S. District Court in a state, or of a U.S. Court of Appeals in a Circuit that includes a state, on a question of federal law, is not a binding precedent on state courts in that state or circuit on that question of federal law.\n\nFor example, suppose that the Colorado Supreme Court determines, without resorting to a separate state constitutional right, that the 4th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution's exclusionary rule for unlawful searches and seizures require physical evidence obtained in reliance on a lie from a law enforcement officers to be excluded from evidence at trial as an unlawful search, but the 10th Circuit in which Colorado is located reaches the opposite conclusion, and the U.S. Supreme Court has not ever made a ruling definitively resolving that issue. In that situation, the meaning of the 4th Amendment in state court criminal trials would be different from the meaning of the 4th Amendment in federal court criminal trials in the same state, even though this is a question of federal law.\n\nThis isn't to say that a binding 10th Circuit precedent on a question of federal law wouldn't be extremely persuasive authority to a state court on that issue of federal law in the State of Colorado (which is located in the 10th Circuit). But it still wouldn't be a truly binding precedent.\n\n*The Effect of Court Rulings On Parties To Federal Cases And Federalism*\n\nFederal court decisions on questions of federal or state law are binding on the state officials affiliated with the governmental official or entity that is a party to the federal court case.\n\nFor example, a decision of the federal U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado in a case to which a Denver policeman is a party (with respect to something done by him in his official capacity as opposed to his private life), is binding upon all officials in the City and County of Denver, and on the City and County of Denver as an entity, even if only the policeman is a party to the lawsuit in federal court. But that ruling wouldn't be binding on the State of Colorado or the City of Aurora, which are different governmental entities.\n\nDetermining whether a particular government official from an agency, or a particular agency, is part of a state government, or of a particular local government, or is an independent governmental entity in its own right (e.g. in the case of the C.U. Regents of the University of Colorado), is not always a self\\-evident question and often would require fact specific legal analysis to determine.\n\nIf someone is ordered to do irreconcilable things by both a federal court in an order binding that person, and a state court in an order binding that person, the federal court order prevails over the state court order.",

The correct answer is C because state courts are not bound by lower federal court decisions on federal law issues, even within their own circuit. While the federal circuit court's decision would be highly persuasive, the state supreme court can maintain its own interpretation of the U.S. Constitution until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the issue. Federal courts in the state would follow the federal circuit court's ruling, creating a situation where the 4th Amendment could be applied differently in state and federal courts within the same state. Options A and B are incorrect because they misstate the binding nature of these decisions. Option D is incorrect because recency is not a factor in determining which interpretation to follow in this scenario."

Copyright law does not require the owner to actively use or profit from their work to maintain their rights. Brenda Books' decision not to print the book due to low profitability does not diminish their copyright protection. In a copyright infringement case, the copyright holder (Brenda Books) can seek either actual damages, an account of the infringer's profits, or statutory damages in some jurisdictions like the United States. The fact that the book was out of print does not prevent Brenda Books from pursuing these remedies. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they assume that the copyright holder's current use or profit from the work affects their rights or potential damages, which is not the case in copyright law."

The website does not collect or store any personal information in a database, nor does it sell any user data to third parties. Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), what is the business owner's obligation regarding a \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information\" link?\n\nA) The business owner must include the link, as all websites are required to have it under CCPA.\nB) The business owner does not need to include the link, but must state in the privacy policy that no personal information is sold.\nC) The business owner must include the link only if Google Analytics is considered a sale of personal information.\nD) The business owner must include the link and also provide a mechanism for users to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the CCPA and the official FAQ, businesses that do not sell personal information are not required to post a \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information\" link. However, the business should affirmatively state in its privacy notice that it does not sell personal information. The use of Google Analytics for internal improvement purposes is generally not considered a sale of personal information under CCPA. Therefore, the correct approach is to exclude the link but clearly state in the privacy policy that no personal information is sold."

They only need a reasonable belief that the phone contains evidence. Furthermore, if a suspect refuses to provide access information (like passwords or PINs), the police can serve a Section 49 Notice under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, compelling the suspect to provide this information. Failure to comply can result in additional criminal charges. This makes option C the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the extent of police powers in this situation. Options A and D are incorrect because they place limitations on police powers that don't exist in this context. Option B is also incorrect as it suggests police can only access data with the suspect's voluntary cooperation, which is not the case."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I frequently encounter situations in which there is likely civil liability between two parties but where the aggrieved party does not pursue legal action because they lack money and/or expertise.\n\nOccasionally I have approached lawyers when I see such cases with apparently positive (risk\\-adjusted) expected return from at least threatening, if not actually carrying out, litigation. And I usually get one of two answers:\n\n1. We're too busy to do something like that on contingency right now.\n2. We don't think the odds of prevailing and collecting merit the cost of pursuing that on contingency.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I follow the industry well enough to know that there are a lot of lawyers lacking for work. If you're an unemployed lawyer, or a solo practitioner without a full caseload, then isn't *any* non\\-frivolous case with a positive potential payout worth pursuing? And if you're a firm with the sunk cost of offices, staff, subscriptions, etc., wouldn't you always want those assets working at 100% capacity?\n\nTherefore, why doesn't every practice *want* a queue of potentially profitable contingency cases that they can chip away at when they don't have a 100% paid workload? I can understand that if one took a contingency case into litigation, and then paid work came along, one wouldn't want the contingency case distracting from the paid work. But can't one accept a case on contingency *and* \"as time permits,\" so that in such an event one would simply drop the contingency case (or, if it looked promising, hand it off to some other lawyer in a slump)?\n\nAre there practical or professional reasons this is not standard practice?\n\nFrom an economic perspective this seems odd: As a client if I don't have the means to pursue a legitimate claim, then (on principle) I might be willing to give up to 100% of any winnings to a lawyer who does pursue it. As a lawyer, if I have a positive expected return to a contingency case, I'd like to have the option of picking that up when I can't find other work (to within some error term \u2013 perhaps the alternative of running a coffee shop out of my office, or taking a minimum\\-wage writing job.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two basic problems with your theory:\n\n1. You say:\n\n> can't one accept a case on contingency and \"as time permits,\" so that in such an event one would simply drop the contingency case (or, if it looked promising, hand it off to some other lawyer in a slump)?\n\nNo. you can't. If you take a case, then drop it because a more profitable case comes along, you might well be disbarred, not to mention sued by the client you just threw over. You might even spend a night in jail for contempt\\-\\-in many cases, you are not allowed to simply drop a case without the court's permission.\n\nSo if you accept a contingency case, you accept it until (1\\) the case is over, (2\\) the client fires you, (3\\) you, the client, and the judge all agree you can quit, or (4\\) you can convince the judge you should be allowed to quit regardless of the client's wishes. Until then, you are stuck with the time and expense involved with handling the case.\n\n2. \"Expense\" is the second problem. You seem to be under the impression that once you've paid for the office and the coffee maker, there's no downside in pursuing a contingency case.\n\nBut filing and pursuing a lawsuit cost money, not just time. Copying and coding documents costs money. Stenographers for depositions cost money. Just filing a lawsuit often costs a few hundred dollars. Hell, in a major lawsuit, you will probably spend a few hundred dollars just on postage. And a lot of commercial litigation now involves expert witnesses, whose fees start at a few hundred dollars an hour. Normally that all gets billed back to the client, but on a contingency case the lawyer often absorbs most or all of it.\n\nSo from a lawyer's perspective, even if he or she is not working right now, \"any positive payout\" isn't enough. It has to be enough of a payout, and enough of a chance of winning, that the expected reward is worth paying, potentially, the cost of a trial, and forgoing other work if things get busy again while you're trying to prep your contingency case for trial.\n\nThe fact is, for a lot of this sort of case\\-\\-even if it looks \"potentially profitable\" to a non\\-lawyer\\-\\-is going to be less profitable, in the long run, than spending the same amount of time playing golf with people who might actually pay you by the hour to do something.\n\nAlso, two quick notes:\n\n1. Your suggestion of raising the contingency up to 100%, or close to it, won't help\\-\\-it's illegal in many jurisdictions, and unethical in all of them.\n2. As a side note, even if a lawyer did take one of these cases, it wouldn't do you any good, since lawyers are prohibited in most cases from splitting their fees with non\\-lawyers.",

In fact, it's explicitly stated in the documentation that raising contingency fees up to or close to 100% is illegal in many jurisdictions and considered unethical in all of them.

A user is covered by the general license on an installed copy of Windows for any calls made by programs running on that machine, as long as the local copy of the OS is properly licensed.\n\nThe various products, such as Office 365 each has a license for use of its API.

The \u00a3400 that was not given to the borrower is technically considered a payment on the loan. This means the borrower effectively owes \u00a3300 plus any interest agreed upon in the original contract. The loan is not invalidated by the partial disbursement, and the borrower is still obligated to repay the amount actually received. This scenario reflects the principle that loan repayments can begin immediately, even before the full amount is used by the borrower."

Now it has come to the attention of the local council, and they're sending out inspectors, etc.\n\nThe shed was approved (to 1A standards) by the council for the previous owner.\nAll the water/sewage/electricity connections are all official and approved.\nThe previous owner fitted out the shed as a \"house\", and we simply bought it and moved in. The previous owners had a development application to build a shed and a house, but seem to have only gone through with the shed.\n\nCan the council kick us out of our shed/house?\nDoes the amount of time we've lived here make any difference?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can the council kick us out of our shed/house?\n\nPotentially, yes. Although this is very unlikely.\n\n> Does the amount of time we've lived here make any difference?\n\nNo.\n\nBuilding and development in [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\")\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe law that governs building and construction in NSW is the [Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979](https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-1979-203). It's a very broad law and covers everything from a flagpole or barbeque to airports and railways and has a hierarchy of controls from State Environmental Plans (SEP) down to Local Environmental Plans (LEP) and finally the Building Code of Australia (BCA) and Plumbing Code of Australia (PCA). Electricity and gas installations are covered by different laws.\n\nHowever, for housing, there is a SEP that allows them to be constructed without Development Consent providing they comply with all relevant LEPs and the BCA \\& PCA. These so\\-called Complying Developments (CD) must be notified to the council but do not need the Council's approval. If you want to break the rules, you can't use this process and must go for a full Development Approval (DA). For completeness, there are also Exepnt Developments and State Significant Developments but neither are relevant here.\n\nOnce you have your DA or CD, you need to engage a Principal Certifying Authority (PCA) \\- a private certifier who ensures that the work is in compliance with the DA/CD and the BCA. They will issue a Construction Certificate (CC) which details the work that needs to be done. When its all finished to their satisfaction, they will issue an Occupation Certificate (OC) and the building can now be used.\n\nYou state that you have a DA (or maybe a CD) for a house and shed but only the shed was built and then fitted out as a house. Prima facie, this isn't compliant because it isn't what was approved. I am willing to bet that there is no OC and possibly no CC. This happens a lot.\n\nWhen you brought the property, your conveyancer should have checked that all building work was compliant. Maybe they did and told you about it but you didn't understand and went ahead anyway; maybe they didn't and just stuffed up.\n\nNow, if the building complies with the LEP and the BCA, all that may be necessary is to lodge a CD, hire a PCA to inspect the property and issue an OC and all the paperwork will be in order and everyone's happy.\n\nIf there are non\\-compliances, the council can, and probably will issue you a notice to fix them within a specified time frame. Providing you do that, you can then get the retroactive approvals and all will be good.\n\nHowever, if it's something that can't be readily fixed \\- like the building is too near the boundary, for example, that's when things get interesting.",

The local council has recently discovered this situation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the council's likely course of action?\n\nA) The council will immediately evict the couple due to the illegal conversion of the shed.\nB) The council will ignore the situation because the couple has been living there for over 10 years.\nC) The council will likely issue a notice to fix any non-compliances and require retroactive approvals.\nD) The council will have no authority to act because the previous owner had approved water and electricity connections.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most likely course of action for the council, based on the information provided, is to issue a notice to fix any non-compliances and require retroactive approvals. The documentation states that if there are non-compliances, \"the council can, and probably will issue you a notice to fix them within a specified time frame.\" It also mentions that after fixing issues, \"you can then get the retroactive approvals and all will be good.\" This approach allows for regularization of the situation without immediate eviction, while still ensuring compliance with building and planning regulations.

According to Texas law, it is illegal for a landlord to reject a rental application based on an applicant's disability. This falls under the protected categories outlined in fair housing laws.\n\nOption A is incorrect because rejecting an application due to a low credit score is generally considered a valid reason for denial, as it relates to the applicant's financial reliability.\n\nOption B is incorrect because student status is not typically a protected category under Texas state law, although some municipalities might have additional protections for students.\n\nOption D is incorrect because a history of late rent payments is a valid reason for a landlord to reject an application, as it directly relates to the applicant's reliability as a tenant.\n\nIt's important to note that while rejecting an application based on disability is illegal, landlords can legally reject applications for many other reasons not related to protected classes such as race, sex, religion, ethnicity, or familial status."

At the end of the program, I was told that the apprenticeship was not guaranteed and that, although they were sorry for misrepresenting themselves, they would work to secure employment for the graduates of the program. I recently received an email stating that they would no longer be providing any assistance.\n\nThe terms of the promise were:\n\n> \"Start a paid apprenticeship: You'll start working right after you graduate from the bootcamp, in a paid apprenticeship with one of our hiring partners...which includes companies like Amazon, iFixit and PG\\&E!\"\n\nDo I have a reasonable claim for lost wages based on the promise of employment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes.** \n\nTechnically, it would probably not be a claim for lost wages (which are usually awarded when someone injures you in a way that leaves you unable to work) but rather a claim for breach of contract.

After graduating, the school informed John that the apprenticeship was not guaranteed and later ceased all assistance in finding employment. If John decides to pursue legal action, what type of claim would be most appropriate, and what factors might affect the damages awarded?\n\nA) A claim for lost wages, with damages equal to the full amount of the promised apprenticeship salary\nB) A claim for breach of contract, with damages potentially reduced based on John's efforts to find alternative employment\nC) A claim for fraud, with punitive damages awarded regardless of John's job search efforts\nD) A small claims court filing for the cost of tuition, with no consideration of potential apprenticeship earnings\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate legal action would be a claim for breach of contract, not lost wages. The school made a specific promise of employment, which forms the basis of a contract. In determining damages, a court would likely consider:\n\n1. The expected earnings from the promised apprenticeship\n2. John's efforts to mitigate damages by seeking alternative employment (mitigation)\n3. Any earnings from alternative employment John secured\n\nIf John made reasonable efforts to find work but was unsuccessful, he might be eligible for the full amount of the promised apprenticeship earnings. However, if he found a lower-paying position, the damages might be reduced to the difference between the promised and actual earnings. If John made no effort to find alternative employment, the court might significantly reduce damages or award only nominal damages.\n\nOption A is incorrect because this isn't technically a lost wages claim. Option C is incorrect because while fraud might be considered, the damages would still likely be based on contract principles and mitigation efforts. Option D is incorrect because it doesn't account for the promised apprenticeship earnings, which are central to the case."

It is just a message sent by a software to their server. It's just data somewhere on a machine, under full control of the copyright owner.\n\n**A)** Is the copyright owner implicitly believed? In this case it would be easy for such a company to go rogue, and make up copyright claims. For example, they might allow a free (as in beer) software to be downloaded, but having an expensive, non\\-free software too. The user installs the free one, it \"phones home\" with information to identify the user with, they edit the logs, and sue the user for using the non\\-free version.\n\n**B)** If the data gathered by the copyright owner is not implicitly believed, then how can they press their claim if the user denies everything? By the time they obtain a warrant and show up with the police to search the premises of the supposed pirate, the evidence might have long since been destroyed. (and usually it's in a different country, making the process even more difficult and expensive)\n\nIf it's (A), how are users protected from frivolous lawsuits? If it's (B), then how can copyright owners exercise any of their rights? I would guess it's mostly (B), and the copyright owners just scare users into paying, and if a users refuses, there is not much they can do against him, besides threatening to start a lengthy and expensive lawsuit which the copyright owners have no real hope of winning, but would be so costly and time\\-consuming for the user (especially if the user is a private person or a much smaller company than the copyright holder) that he rather pays than to be dragged into it.\n\nIs my understanding correct, is this how it works? The copyright holder has little to no chance of winning, but proposes a settlement of a few hundred or few thousand $, and threatens a lengthy legal process for maybe millions if not complied, and the users are scared of that lengthy process and they rather pay the smaller sum instead of going for the very low risk of having to pay millions in legal fees?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Starting with generalities ...\n------------------------------\n\nAnyone can bring a civil case against anyone else providing they have [standing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_(law)). At this point the merits of the case do not matter \\- all the plaintiff is doing is making an allegation that the defendant has caused them harm. For this the evidence need only demonstrate that the defendant has a case to answer.\n\nIf the defendant intends to defend the case then the plaintiff will set out their version of the facts and the law and provide evidence to support that version. The defendant will set out their version of the facts and the law and provide evidence that supports their version. Both parties will also attempt to demonstrate that their opponent's case is a crock of s\\*%t: that the evidence is inadmissible, that the admitted evidence doesn't support the facts alleged, that the law isn't as the other party says etc.\n\nThere are specific judicial procedures in each jurisdiction that dictate how this all happens.\n\nIf it is clear on the face of it that the plaintiff's case *is* a crock of s\\*%t the defendant will file a motion to dismiss and, if the court agrees, that's the end of it.\n\nIf the trial proceeds to completion then the trier of fact (jury or judge as applicable) will decide what weight to give the evidence presented and decide on the [Preponderance of the Evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(law)#Preponderance_of_the_evidence) (Balance of Probabilities) if the plaintiff has proved their case. If so, the plaintiff will get (some of) what they asked for.\n\nMoving to specifics ...\n-----------------------\n\nFirst, while copyright violation is a crime and *can* be *prosecuted* by the state, that would be extremely unlikely on the facts stated. Criminal copyright violation involves copying and distribution on a commercial scale.\n\nWhat we are talking about is the plaintiff *suing* (not prosecuting) for violation.\n\nFrom the facts stated, they have standing and the defendant has a *[prima facie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie)* case to answer \\- that's enough to start legal proceedings.\n\nIn such proceedings the defendant is free to attack the admissibility or veracity of the plaintiff's evidence. If it is inadmissible the case will likely collapse. If it is admitted then the trier of fact will decide if it is \"good\" evidence and if the overall weight of evidence meets the burden of proof.\n\nFar A) \\- the defendant would prevail if they could demonstrate that they only ever used the free version within their terms of the licence.\n\nFor B) \\- destroying evidence needed for an active case is a serious crime. Along with the summons it is likely that the defendant would be served with a subpoena to deliver up the relevant evidence to the court. As there is no criminal investigation/prosecution police/search warrants are irrelevant.\n\nA lawyer is an officer of the court and is *not allowed* to start a legal action that they do not believe has a reasonable prospect of success \\- they can expose themselves to professional sanctions if they do. That said, frivolous lawsuits are launched from time to time and a defendant just has to deal with them \\- either through the court or by making a commercial decision to pay.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this practice?\n\nA) This is a legal and common practice among UK employment agencies.\nB) The practice is legal only if the agency reimburses the staff after their first shift.\nC) This practice is illegal, as mandatory training is considered work and must be paid for by the employer.\nD) The practice is legal as long as the training fee is not \"substantial\".\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to UK labor laws, mandatory training required by an employer is considered work time and must be paid for by the employer. It is illegal for companies to charge employees for training that is necessary for their job. The practice described in the question violates this principle. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest that unpaid mandatory training could be legal, which it is not. Option B is also incorrect because even if reimbursed later, requiring initial payment from employees for mandatory training is not allowed. The key point is that any training deemed mandatory by the employer must be provided at the employer's expense, not the employee's."

This makes me wonder what exactly keeps common law alive. I imagine many judges follow precedent because they have a personal respect for tradition or the merits of the common law system. But I also imagine many judges would want to ignore precedent to enact their own opinions.\n\nSo what prevents such judges from doing so? Are there local or state laws that require them to follow precedent? Can ignoring precedent get them fired? Or do they just fear backlash from the public or their peers if they break tradition?\n\nOr is the premise of my question flawed and judges break precedent all the time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Decisions that break with precedent do happen with some regularity, but far \"from all the time\" in the US. When they do happen, they are generally only at the top level of a state or federal court system, that is a State supreme Court (or equivalent, some states use a different term) or the US Supreme Court.\n\nThere are several factors which discourage judges from simply ignoring precedent.\n\nFirst of all, all the training a lawyer receives teaches him or her to respect precedent, and to find rules by examining past cases. precedent is literally the stuff with which a lawyer works, rather more than the wording of statutes (although those are also important).\n\nSecondly, as a lawyer works as a litigator, judges will usually ground their decisions on precedents, particularly in appellate cases, explaining their decisions largely in terms of how they conform to or extend precedents.\n\nThirdly, if a lower court judge fails to follow precedent, that judge will often be criticized by an appellate judge or justice, often in the course of an opinion overturning the lower\\-court judge's ruling. This does not feel pleasant to such a judge.\n\nFourthly, decision that fail to follow precedent are often (although not always) criticized by legal scholars, particularly in law review articles and treatises.\n\nFifthly, lower\\-court judges who often fail to follow precedents, are less likely to be recommended by senior judges for promotion to appellate positions. However, the actual appointments are controlled by politicians (in most cases) not other judges, so this factor may not be as strong it it would first seem.\n\nOnly once a judge gets to the level of the Supreme Court of a state, or the Federal Supreme Court, is that judge (now a Justice) expected to alter precedents as needed, and most justices have said that they make such changes only reluctantly.\n\nI am not aware of any US state or federal statute or regulation that specifically;y requires judges to follow precedent.\n\nThe most common way to alter precedent is not to overrule or ignore it, but to **distinguish** a prior case. This happens when a judge says something like:\n\n> In the previous case of *A v B* when had situation X which lead to outcome Q. But in this current case we have the very different situation X1\\. In the case of X1, the outcome should be S instead of Q.\n\nIf the new case becomes persuasive the old case *A v B* may apply to only one specific set of facts that almost never comes up, and the new rule apply to almost all other possible situations. The old case may cease to be cited or applied without ever being formally overruled.\n\nAnd, of course, where the rule is statutory, it may be changed if the legislature alters the law. If the rule is constitutional, it may be changed by a constitutional amendment. For example the 1830s case *Barron v Baltimore* held that the US bill of rights did not apply to the states, only to the Federal Government. But after the 1868 14th amendment, courts started to **incorporate** much of the bill of rights into the Due process clause of the 14th, and apply it against the states. This took place gradually, mostly during the period starting with 1898, up until about 1970, but with some incorporation coming as late as 2010 (*Heller*)",

The passage indicates that while there's no specific law requiring judges to follow precedent, several factors encourage them to do so, including their legal training, professional norms, and potential career implications. However, judges, especially those in higher courts, can distinguish cases from precedents or, in some cases, alter precedents. Options A and B are incorrect as there's no federal statute mandating adherence to precedent, and lower court judges don't frequently ignore precedent without consequences. Option D is too restrictive, as state supreme courts can also alter precedents within their jurisdictions."

Is there something in the language of the act that makes sexual harassment a civil rather than a criminal offense? Was that up to the lawmakers to decide, or is that just something that evolved out of the ways the courts and prosecutors responded to sexual harassment claims? And who decides such things in general?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Is there something in the language of the act that makes sexual\n>  harassment a civil rather than a criminal offence?\n\nYes. \n\nLaws that create criminal offenses have to have language to the effect of \"violation of this law is punishable by up to X years of imprisonment or a fine of up to $Y\", or \"violation of this law is a Class Z felony.\"\n\nSometimes it is not entirely clear if violation of a law can form a basis of a private civil lawsuit, or if it can only be enforced by government officials, from the language of the statute alone. When it is unclear the courts have to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nIn rare instances, it may be clear that some parts of a statute have criminal penalties, but due to unclear wording and punctuation in the statute, it is hard to tell precisely which parts of the statute these criminal penalties apply to, and in those cases, courts also have to resolve that ambiguity.\n\nThere is also some conduct that it is constitutional to punish with a civil penalty, but not as a crime that can result in incarceration. For example, it is unconstitutional in most states to incarcerate someone for failing to pay a debt, but there can be a civil penalty for failing to pay a debt. Courts decide if these constitutional limitations are violated.\n\nSimilarly, while Congress can enact both crimes and civil penalties, there are some governmental bodies, like school districts or water boards, that have the power to enact certain civil penalties, but do not have the authority to create new crimes.\n\n> Was that up to the lawmakers to decide, or is that just something that\n>  evolved out of the ways the courts and prosecutors responded to sexual\n>  harassment claims? And who decides such things in general?\n\nGenerally, this is decided by lawmakers. Obviously, however, anyone can lobby legislators to take one position or another.\n\nAlso, the fact that something has a civil penalty does not necessarily mean that prosecutors aren't the people who enforce the law. Sometimes violations of the law prosecuted by prosecutors have civil rather than criminal penalties. For example, many tax law violations are prosecuted by government lawyers with civil penalties, but only a small minority of tax law violations are prosecuted criminally.\n\nFurther, it isn't uncommon for a type of offense, like securities fraud, to have both civil penalties and criminal charges available as remedies that can be enforced by prosecutors. And, when that happens, prosecutors get to decide which tool to use.\n\nFor example, even if exactly the same conduct could be prosecuted with either a civil penalty or a criminal charge, prosecutors might prefer a civil penalty because the burden of proof is much lower, the 5th Amendment protection against self\\-incrimination does not apply (you can refuse to testify but that fact can be used against you in a civil penalty case), and a defendant in a civil penalty case doesn't have a right to a lawyer at government expense. Also, enforcing a civil penalty generates net revenue for the government most of the time, while criminal punishments normally cost the government more money to carry out than any revenue the government may receive from the person found guilty for fines and court costs.\n\nOn the other hand, trying to enforce a significant enough civil penalty to discourage misconduct against someone who has no money or property may be a futile effort, while criminal sanctions could discourage misconduct from other similarly situated people in the future.",

The passage explains that laws creating criminal offenses must include specific language about punishments like imprisonment or fines, or classify violations as felonies. The Civil Rights Act lacks such language for sexual harassment, making it a civil rather than criminal matter. Answer A is incorrect because the courts didn't independently decide this; it was based on the law's wording. B is wrong because prosecutors don't determine whether a law is civil or criminal. D is incorrect because there's no mention of constitutional limitations specifically preventing sexual harassment from being a criminal offense."

About 1\\.5 years ago, I decided to pay month\\-to\\-month since I entered the housing market in search of a house (of course, not knowing that it would take this long to find a house). I found a house and I'm closing next month (August 15\\). The last short\\-term lease I signed with the company has a clause in the contract that states I must guarantee the month of September even though the contract is only valid through August. Basically it states that if a tenant can be secured for the month of September, the additional fee will be waived (the fee is equal to 1 months rent which is approx $2,500\\) if not, I will be required to pay it.\n\nIs this legal? Would this hold up in court if I decide not to pay and let it go to small claims? This clause seems self fulfilling and unreasonable. Unreasonable b/c they are passing off the cost to the previous tenant because they can't find a tenant for the next month. Self\\-fulfilling b/c it is extremely unreasonable to assume that you can fill the apartment immediately for the next month since typically apartments are repainted, carpets cleaned/replaced, and not to mention the normal process of vetting and securing a new tenant (e.g. my contract expires August 31 and next month begins September 1; 1 day to clean, paint, replace carpets and find tenant). In addition, paying month\\-to\\-month comes with a 20% increase in rent. So I feel they are already absorbing their liabilities with the increase in rent.\n\nIf I fail to pay the Guarantee, can the property management company report my delinquency to the credit bureaus (e.g. will this effect my FICO score)?\n\nThanks in advance! \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Let's assume that you are right and the clause is unreasonable (personally, I don't think it is). \n\nSo?\n---\n\nYou agreed to the clause. Contract law permits people to sign up to unreasonable obligations: it's called freedom to contract. The time to take issue with the clause is *before* you enter the contract, not after.\n\nThe law will only interfere if the clause is *unconscionable*: so egregious that no reasonable person would agree to it. This clause is nowhere near unconscionable.\n\nHowever, this is a residential real estate contract and state law may give you additional rights that may make this unlawful. Also, as a consumer, there may be consumer protection law that interferes in the freedom to contract. I am not familiar enough with NY law to say: hire a lawyer.",

While the tenant may feel the clause is unreasonable, simply being unreasonable does not make a contract clause automatically void. As mentioned in the answer, contract law generally allows people to agree to terms that may seem unreasonable, under the principle of freedom to contract. However, there are exceptions, particularly in residential real estate and consumer protection laws, which vary by state. In New York, there may be specific laws that could potentially make such a clause unlawful in a residential lease. Therefore, the enforceability of the clause would depend on whether it violates any specific New York state laws regarding residential real estate contracts.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Two three year old children that agree on \"playing doctor\" and examining each others bodies, including genitalia are not committing a crime (but if one three year old child forces another three year old it is a crime, although it will be a case for the parents/psychologist/school counsellor not the police). Two 13 year old children/adolescents that consent to have sex are not committing a crime (there are some weird exceptions, particularly in America, where holding a nude photo of yourself is considered child pornography but that is an exception). Furthermore, two 13 year olds can enter a contract if it is \"reasonable\" for their age, e.g., maybe \u20ac/$ 30\\-50 or so.\n\nHowever, if one party in all those situations was 25, it would be illegal because children can't consent or enter binding contracts with an adult (for substantial amounts of money).\n\nIs the principle described above called something? How old is it? Did the Romans apply a similar concept? The medieval Catholic church?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The exception is often called a Romeo and Juliet exception colloquially when applied to statutory rape laws. See, e.g. [here](https://www.shouselaw.com/co/faqs/does-colorado-have-a-romeo-and-juliet-law/#:%7E:text=Yes.,less%20than%2010%20years%20older.). It is an exception to the age of capacity to consent to sexual conduct, not an exception to the capacity to consent to a contract.\n\nWhen children are very young (typically in the range of 7 to 12 as set by statute of common law, it is 6 in North Carolina) they lack the capacity to commit a crime, which has to do with the age of the offender and not the mutual ages of those involved.\n\n> Is the principle described above called something? How old is it? Did\n> the Romans apply a similar concept? The medieval Catholic church?\n\nThe principle that you described is a misunderstanding of the law and is incorrect. No jurisdiction has adopted it in the sense that you articulate. When these instances are not punishable as crimes they are not punishable for different reasons. So, the question of \"how old is it?\" is a category error that has no answer.\n\nThe medieval Catholic church did not have any criminal or contract jurisprudence. Both of those domains were handled by secular officials, usually either feudal lords or the officials of a \"free city\". In the medieval period, feudal secular law was often arbitrary and often came down to the personal whims of the individual holding the title. As @hmvsm appropriately notes, however, it did have doctrine about when a child was morally responsible for sins, but final adjudication of whether you sinned or not was ultimately determined in the afterlife, and the church doctrine of forgiveness of sins made the issue moot to a great extent.\n\nThe Roman Empire, of course, did have secular laws, but its laws in the area of contractual capacity, which are largely replicated by modern European civil codes, didn't contain the principle that you propose. To the best of my knowledge, the modern concept of statutory rape was unknown in the Roman world. The lack of hard age based cutoffs was, in part, because vital statistics record keeping was nowhere near universal, so many people did not even know their exact age in a legally provable manner. Approximate age in the very late Roman Empire would often have been determined based upon time elapsed since an infant baptism as recorded by church officials, but Christianity went from being very rare to universal between about 275 CE and 450 CE, and Rome fell not long after that point.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal concept of a \"Romeo and Juliet exception\" in modern law?\n\nA) It allows children of any age to engage in sexual activity without legal consequences as long as they are close in age.\n\nB) It provides an exception to statutory rape laws for individuals close in age, typically teenagers.\n\nC) It refers to the principle that very young children (under 7) cannot be held criminally responsible for any actions.\n\nD) It is a medieval Catholic church doctrine about when children become morally responsible for sins.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The \"Romeo and Juliet exception\" is a colloquial term used in modern law to describe exceptions to statutory rape laws for individuals who are close in age, typically teenagers. This exception recognizes that consensual sexual activity between peers who are close in age should not be criminalized in the same way as sexual activity between an adult and a minor. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it overstates the scope of the exception, which does not apply to children of any age. \n\nOption C describes the concept of the age of criminal responsibility, which is a separate legal principle from the Romeo and Juliet exception. \n\nOption D is incorrect because it confuses a modern legal concept with medieval church doctrine. While the Catholic church did have teachings about the age of moral responsibility, this is not related to the Romeo and Juliet exception in law."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Okay, I know officially the answer is \"no, there is no such thing as debtors jail for civil debts in the USA\", however let's explore this. Suppose a person is sued by a creditor for a debt. Normally what happens of course is there is a court date and eventually you go to court to make your case. Suppose after everything the judge rules you owe $x/month to the creditor(s). Suppose however you can't afford the payment plan of $x/month the court ordered. At this point could you go to jail for failure to oblige the court order?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is a civil case, taking away your freedom is only for criminal offenses. Not paying your bills is not a criminal offense. It is up to the creditor to look for your assets, etc.\n\nA court can make you show up and answer questions about your assets and income. While you are in court the judge can make you give your gold watch to your creditor.\n\nOutside the parameters of the question there are circumstances like failure to pay child support *when you do have the funds* that can lead to incarceration. In some places you can be jailed for contempt of court if the court requires your presence to let the creditor have the ability to try to get access to your assets and you do not show up.",

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: John owes $10,000 to a credit card company. After being sued, the court orders him to pay $500 per month. John genuinely cannot afford this payment. Which of the following scenarios is most likely to occur?\n\nA) John will be sent to jail for failing to comply with the court order.\nB) The credit card company can seize John's assets without further court intervention.\nC) John will be required to appear in court to answer questions about his assets and income.\nD) The judge will reduce the monthly payment amount without any further hearings.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: In civil debt cases, debtors cannot be imprisoned for failing to pay. The correct answer is C because the court can require John to appear and answer questions about his assets and income. This process, often called a debtor's examination, allows the creditor to gather information about the debtor's financial situation.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because there is no debtors' prison for civil debts in the USA. Answer B is incorrect because creditors typically need court approval to seize assets. Answer D is possible but less likely without a formal request for modification of the order.\n\nThis question tests understanding of civil debt proceedings, the limits of court authority in debt cases, and the rights of both debtors and creditors in the legal process."
