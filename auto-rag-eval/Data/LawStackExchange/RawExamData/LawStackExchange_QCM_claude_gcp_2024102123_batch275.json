            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the news you often read about differing philosophies of judicial interpretation, especially when important cases are decided (like several recent US Supreme Court decisions). I recently browsed through a book by Antonin Scalia in which he outlines a number of specific principles he endorses and does not endorse, with citations to earlier case law. Apparently there is some debate about the merits of such principles and how (or whether) judicial interpretation of legislation comports with legislators' understanding of what they are doing.\n\nIt is clear that many of these \"canons\" can be overridden on a per\\-law basis by including language in the law that explicitly goes against some judicial principle that would otherwise apply. However, my question is, are the principles themselves subject to legislative control in a broader sense? Can legislatures pass \"meta\\-laws\" which define how other laws are to be intepreted? For instance, could the US Congress pass a law saying \"Wherever ambiguity arises in statutory interpretation, the statute in question shall be understood as to favor the least powerful party in a dispute\"? Or \"No special deference shall be given to interpretation of statute by administrative agencies\" (i.e., to curtail Chevron deference)? Or more generally, can a legislature pass a law saying \"The law shall be understood as X\", where X is some principle of intepretation that is not specific to the law in which it is contained, but is meant to constrain interpretations of all other laws (or some subset of other laws)? Would such laws be valid?\n\nI'm interested mostly in the situation in the US, but would be interested to know how the issue could play out in different countires, or in particular US states.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, legislative bodies can pass legislation that constrains the interpretation of the rest of their legislation.\n\nIn the U.S., see [1 U.S.C \u00a71\\-8](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/1/chapter-1).\n\nIn Canada, see [The Interpretation Act](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-21/FullText.html).\n\nIn British Columbia, see [The Interpretation Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96238_01).\n\nAs an example of a back\\-and\\-forth between the courts and congress regarding a setting a standard of review, consider the passage of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Summarizing from *Holt v. Hobbs* 574 U. S. \\_\\_\\_\\_ (2015\\):\n\n* In *Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith*, 494 U. S. 872 (1990\\), the Supreme Court held that \"neutral, generally applicable laws that incidentally burden the exercise of religion usually do not violate the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment\".\n* Congress desired a stricter test that prohibited the burdening of religion *regardless* of whether the laws are neutral or generally applicable.\n* Congress passed RFRA in 1993, which required that \"\\[g]overnment shall not substantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that application of the burden\nto the person \u2014 (1\\) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental\ninterest; and (2\\) is the least restrictive means\nof furthering that compelling governmental interest\".\n\nRFRA was passed with the goal of setting the standard of review for all other legislation that burdens a person's exercise of religion. Without RFRA, the standard of review would have been that used in *Smith*, based solely on First Amendment protections. *With* RFRA, the standard of review became stronger, basically strict scrutiny.\n\nAn example of Congress setting the factors to be used in a balancing test is the addition of fair use via the Copyright Act of 1976\\. Prior to 1976, courts had been applying a fair use exception based on common law rather than statute. The act encoded in statute the four factors that Congress wanted to be considered and listed several purposes for which fair use was explicitly applicable. In this case, Congress basically codified the fair use doctrine as it was being used at the time by the courts. It could be considered an expression of approval for the existing interpretation of the time and a desire to prevent drift in that analysis.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the relationship between legislative bodies and judicial interpretation in the United States?\n\nA) Legislative bodies have no power to influence how courts interpret laws beyond the specific language of each individual statute.\n\nB) Legislative bodies can pass meta-laws that define how all other laws should be interpreted, but these are rarely enforced by courts.\n\nC) Legislative bodies can pass laws that provide general guidelines for interpretation, which courts are obligated to follow unless there's a constitutional conflict.\n\nD) Legislative bodies can only influence judicial interpretation by amending the Constitution.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As demonstrated by examples like the U.S. Code's rules of construction (1 U.S.C. \u00a71-8) and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), legislative bodies in the U.S. can indeed pass laws that provide general guidelines for how other laws should be interpreted. These guidelines are typically respected and followed by courts, as they represent the legislature's intent on how laws should be understood and applied. However, courts still retain the power to determine if such interpretive guidelines conflict with constitutional principles.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it ignores the existence of interpretive statutes and meta-laws that do influence judicial interpretation across multiple laws.\n\nAnswer B is partially correct in acknowledging that meta-laws exist, but it's wrong in suggesting that these are rarely enforced. In fact, courts regularly apply such interpretive guidelines when they exist.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because it overstates the difficulty of influencing judicial interpretation. While constitutional amendments are one way to affect interpretation, they are not the only way, as demonstrated by the existence of interpretive statutes."

Trump is preparing to walk into a Manhattan courtroom as both a defendant and a candidate, making final plans for his **arrest** on Tuesday \\[...].\n\nWhy would he be arrested? Is there a danger of flight? That seems implausible, given that he has arranged his appearance in front of the court out of his own volition, and because of his commercial, family and real estate ties to the country, and his plans to run for president again.\n\nIs there a danger of destroying evidence? In all reality, that would have happened by now, and most relevant searches have probably been conducted already.\n\nWhat other reasons would be there for an arrest?\n\n**As a clarification:** If I'm not mistaken, in Germany an indictment would simply be delivered by special registered mail, unless one of the above\\-mentioned dangers was present.\n\nIn the U.S., a simple delivery of an indictment can take on an appearance which I can only perceive as unnecessarily disparaging. A defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty. To me this principle implies that defendants should be treated with respect like any other citizen. Putting them in humiliating situations, let alone using force like restraining them with handcuffs like in the [case of Mr. Weisselberg](https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/trump-org-cfo-allen-weisselberg-waives-right-to-remain-silent-during-arrest-117095493824) contradicts this principle, unless there is reason to believe they would flee or otherwise obstruct the trial.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: An accused would be arrested for the purposes of [***arraignment***](https://nycourts.gov/courthelp/criminal/arraignments.shtml) (\"even a scheduled arrest is still an arrest\"). That does not entail that the accused would be held in custody pending or during trial. Many commenters are of the view that Mr. Trump would be released under his own recognizance without bail.\n\nReference: [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/trump-arrest-process-what-to-know-02a2ce34e03e25ab2fdd0e81dbcc62c7).",

This is a crucial step in the U.S. criminal justice system where the defendant is officially informed of the charges against them and asked to enter a plea.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\nA) While ensuring the defendant's presence is important, it's not the primary reason for arrest in this scenario, especially if the defendant has voluntarily agreed to appear.\n\nB) Conducting a search is not the main purpose of the arrest in this context, particularly for a high-profile defendant who has agreed to surrender.\n\nC) This is the correct answer, as arraignment is a key legal procedure that requires the defendant's presence, and the arrest facilitates this process.\n\nD) While arrests can have a public impact, demonstrating law enforcement power is not the legitimate purpose of an arrest in the U.S. justice system.\n\nThis question tests understanding of U.S. criminal procedure and the specific purpose of arrest in cases where defendants voluntarily surrender, highlighting the importance of the arraignment process in the American legal system."

The scope of this authority does not extend to\n>  rejection or revocation of a passport on the basis of delinquent\n>  Federal taxes.

Failure\n>  to provide a TIN is reported by the State Department to the Internal\n>  Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and may result in a $500 fine\n\nI'm trying to understand how the privacy act and exceptions to that law relates within these governmental institutions. \n\nIn other words, the SSN is issued by the social security department, which relates to revenue. The IRS should be involved in that aspect as it relates to finance. \n\n* Is this bill by Congress the binding law that allows the IRS to impose these requirements on the Department of State/Homeland Security? Or can independent government agencies create different requirements for inter\\-agency ways of doing business?\n* There are several reasons a person may not be issued a SSN. How can I locate the relevant information (IRS and Dep. of State) that accommodates this scenario?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Congress and the president control processes such as passport issuance by passing laws, which are subject to judicial review. Within the framework of the three\\-way checks and balances, therefore, the federal government as a whole is responsible for determining the rules for such a process.\n\nThe income tax process is also defined by federal laws. Since the federal government controls both processes, it is free to create interdependencies between those processes. For example, it can require passport applicants to give their social security numbers if it wants to be able to cancel the passports of those who are delinquent in paying their taxes.\n\nThe \"bill by congress\" does not become binding law until signed by the president, as you no doubt are aware. Independent government agencies may create requirements for inter\\-agency business by agreement, as long as that does not conflict with the law. Some statutes will say things like \"... or as so\\-and\\-so may by regulation provide.\" This hints at the existence of another important code, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). These are mostly (or perhaps entirely) regulations promulgated by the executive branch, pursuant to authority granted by the constitution or by statute.\n\nFor what reason could a US citizen possibly be denied a Social Security Number? The only cases I'm aware of where someone is ineligible is the case of a foreigner who is not allowed to work in the US. Such a person is also, of course, ineligible for a US passport, so there is no conflict in the requirement to disclose the SSN in the passport application.",

R.S., c. C\\-34, s. 72\\.\n\n**If you are subject to a prohibition order**\n\nIf the user is subject to a prohibition order (the U.S. equivalent term would be a protection order), a bow and arrow could be prohibited under that order. R.S., c. C\\-34, s. 109\\-111\\.\n\n**If you are hunting, or if you are shooting it within 200 yards of an occupied building**\n\nEven if target shooting is not regulated or prohibited in a municipality, you would ordinarily need a license to hunt anything under [the applicable hunting regulations of Alberta](https://www.albertaregulations.ca/huntingregs-pdfs-2018.html). [In particular](https://www.albertaregulations.ca/pdfs/hunting-regs/Licensing.pdf):\n\n> Hunters must possess a valid Wildlife Certificate and the applicable\n> hunting licence to hunt big game or game birds.\n\nThis includes bow hunting. And, as you note, Section 52 of the Wildlife Act, which prohibits shooting within 200 yards of an occupied building (unless it's your own). Realistically, there aren't many places in an urban municipality that are not within 200 yards of an occupied building.\n\n**If your conduct endangers the public or obstructs others rights**\n\nIn many circumstances, shooting arrows with a bow could constitute a common nuisance. R.S., c. C\\-34, s. 180\\.\n\n> 180 (1\\) Every one who commits a common nuisance and thereby\n> \n> \n> (a) endangers the lives, safety or health of the public, or\n> \n> \n> (b) causes physical injury to any person,\n> \n> \n> is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a\n> term not exceeding two years.\n> \n> \n> Marginal note:Definition\n> \n> \n> (2\\) For the purposes of this section, every one commits a common\n> nuisance who does an unlawful act or fails to discharge a legal duty\n> and thereby\n> \n> \n> (a) endangers the lives, safety, health, property or comfort of the\n> public; or\n> \n> \n> (b) obstructs the public in the exercise or enjoyment of any right\n> that is common to all the subjects of Her Majesty in Canada.\n\n**If you threaten to hurt a person or animal without justification**\n\nLikewise, if you aim your bow at someone with an arrow nocked without this justification, this probably constitutes a criminal offense called \"[unlawful threat](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-61.html#h-83)\", R.S., c. C\\-34, s. 264\\.1, which is an unlawful threat and a crime when one:\n\n> in any manner, knowingly utters, conveys or causes any person to\n> receive a threat\n> \n> \n> (a) to cause death or bodily harm to any person;\n> \n> \n> (b) to burn, destroy or damage real or personal property; or\n> \n> \n> (c) to kill, poison or injure an animal or bird that is the property\n> of any person.\n\n**If you hit a person or animal without justification**\n\nEven if you don't intend to hit a person or animal, if you do, it would probably at least constitute the tort of negligence, and probably [criminal negligence](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-50.html#h-75), R.S., c. C\\-34, s. 219\\-221, or assault with a weapon causing bodily harm, R.S., c. C\\-34, s. 267, or aggravated assault, R.S., c.

The definition of weapon in [one related statute](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-63.html#docCont) would probably apply and would cover a real (as opposed to a toy) bow and arrow, even though it is technically restricted to a particular statutory section R.S., c.

Hunting without a license is illegal, but this alone doesn't cover all scenarios.\n2. The Wildlife Act prohibits shooting within 200 yards of occupied buildings, not all buildings.\n3. Target practice in a backyard isn't explicitly illegal if other conditions are met.\n4. The key factor is public safety and rights. Under Section 180 of the Criminal Code, actions that endanger public safety or obstruct others' rights constitute a common nuisance, which is illegal. This would apply even in scenarios where other specific regulations aren't violated.\n\nAdditionally, other factors like threatening others, causing injury, or violating land use regulations could make bow use illegal, but the question specifically asks about circumstances assuming no municipal bylaw exists."

It includes (Section 33 at pdf page 21, line 1872\\)\n\n> No person shall solicit votes in any manner or by any means or method...\n\n(This prohibition is pertinent to proximity to the place of polling and the proximity of other voters waiting to vote)\n\nWhile in a line waiting to vote, my wife and I have a discussion wherein I explain why I'm going to vote for Joe as dog catcher. I don't ask her to vote for Joe, my conversation is confined to why I'm voting for Joe. I am not displaying or distributing campaign material.\n\nWould I be in violation of the statute ?\nWithout raising my voice, another voter might overhear my conversation, does that changed anything?\n\nExtra credit: Does this prohibition by the government violate my free speech rights?

For the purposes of this law, it doesn't matter if the person you are talking to is your wife or a stranger, you shouldn't be discussing politics while in the polling place and beyond the signs that say so. There are cases where people who are wearing the t\\-shirt in favor of Joe for Dog Catcher are asked to leave the polling place.\n\nWith respect to the first Amendment, a suit to get these laws declared unconstitutional would likely be countered by the State with the argument that it is narrowly tailored to conform with the least restrictive Time/Manner/Place restrictions (It's only enforced during the time the polling place is open, only in election season, It only bans discussion of candidates and policies on the ballots, and it's only while in line to vote or actually voting, all of which are clearly marked spaces.). It's also content neutral as you can discuss things like \"Who would win in a fight between Batman and Megatron\" or \"Greatest late 90s boy band: N'Sync or Backstreet Boys?\" You just can't discuss the policies of Joe\\- the Dog Catcher and Incumbant Ned \"The \"farm\" your dog went to live and is much happier\" Gassemall. Or any other candidate for that matter. The State can also likely show that it has a vested interest in not having voters who pick vitally important jobs manipulated or intimidated into voting for a corrupt candidate over a different one who wasn't getting discussion.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A tenant has a modified gross lease of a small commercial warehouse in San Fernando, CA. During the rainy seasons of 2017\\-2018 and the very wet 2018\\-2019, the tenant reported, on multiple occasions, leaks from the roof. These never seemed to have been properly addressed.\n\nMore recently, there was a severe enough leak that caused some damage by splattering as it dripped. The water is a dark rust color, and stains everything it touches.\n\nMore recently, water trapped in the ceiling insulation (which is held up by a plastic barrier) proved to be too heavy for the plastic and it ruptured, leaking all over numerous belongings. The landlord is unwilling to cover this damage, telling me that's what the tenant's insurance is for. The tenant has insurance that should cover this, but one of the few obligations the lease places on the landlord is to keep the roof in good working order.\n\nWhat are the legal options? It's very hard to search for information for commercial leases; almost everything online is about residential leases.\n\nEDIT:\n\nIs the landlord typically liable for damage to contents in a situation like this (that is, when they've failed to maintain the roof in proper working order, and the resulting water ingress damages the contents)? Or is it some kind of standard practice that the tenant's insurance should pay, and then the insurance company deals with the landlord?\n\nThe next question is, what kind of attorney handles this sort of thing?\n\nThe most important thing is to get the landlord to fix the roof to prevent further damage. Talking to other tenants suffering similar damage, it seems they're reluctant to fix it, and downright unwilling to pay for damages.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally speaking, keeping the roof in working order is the obligation of the landlord in a commercial modified gross lease. It would honestly be quite unusual for the tenant's insurance to cover it, and it would likewise be unusual for the landlord not to have insurance that covers an incident like this to the extent that it is insurable (usually, deterioration of a roof is not covered by anyone's insurance unless it is caused by a specific event like a hail storm, or toilet seat from an aircraft that blew up in mid\\-flight crashing down on it (if you miss the allusion to \"Dead Like Me\", don't sweat it)).\n\nIf the tenant's insurance does pay, it would normally have a right to subrogate against the landlord (i.e. sue the landlord for the money that it was out), but many commercial leases have an anti\\-subrogation clause that prohibits a tenant's insurer from pursuing a subrogation claim against the landlord (not all leases have such a term, but many do), since this is really the landlord's responsibility.\n\nThe landlord ordinarily would be liable to the tenant for damage foreseeably caused by the failure to the landlord to do what the landlord is obligated to do, but this is complicated because the tenant has a duty to mitigate damages if reasonably possible. So, rather than just allowing its stuff to be water damaged, the tenant is obligated to do what is necessary to prevent the damage (at least, if this is cheaper than allowing the damage to occur) and then sue for the cost of mitigation, rather than for the damage itself.\n\nAnother point to consider is that in many commercial leases, the landlord's obligation to repair is not triggered until a demand is made, the landlord refused, the tenant gives a written notice of default to the landlord, and the landlord does not address the problem within a \"cure\" period of a specified number of days after receiving the notice of default. A review of the lease for such provisions is in order.\n\nIf the landlord is allegedly in default, it may be possible to bring a lawsuit to compel the landlord to do the repair, or better yet, for the tenants to give the proper notices, then to make the repair, and then to withhold rent in the amount of the alleged damage or to sue the landlord for the cost of mitigation and to collect a judgment by withholding rent as a setoff against the judgment. If the lease is long enough for the litigation to run its course and still have enough of the lease left to setoff against rent due to collect, that may be a viable option.\n\n> what kind of attorney handles this sort of thing?\n\nReal estate, business law, commercial litigation and business litigation would all be common specialties for a law firm that handles this kind of dispute to advertise.\n\nLawyers who primarily do criminal law, immigration law, custody cases, personal injury, personal bankruptcy cases, and defense of residential evictions, would typically be inappropriate.\n\nThe lawyer will not be cheap, but usually, in a commercial lease situation, the dollar stakes are considerable.",

The landlord is usually responsible for damages caused by their failure to fulfill lease obligations, such as maintaining the roof. However, the tenant has a duty to mitigate further damage if reasonably possible, and can then seek compensation for the cost of mitigation.\n\nC is incorrect because most commercial leases require proper notice and opportunity for the landlord to cure the problem before legal action can be taken.\n\nD is incorrect because many commercial leases include anti-subrogation clauses that prevent the tenant's insurer from pursuing claims against the landlord. Additionally, it's not standard practice for the tenant's insurance to cover damages resulting from the landlord's failure to maintain the property."

Under these circumstances, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the customer's legal options?\n\nA) The customer can demand the dealer repair the car free of charge due to the undisclosed flood damage.\nB) The customer has a strong case for fraud if they can prove the dealer knew about the flood damage but denied it.\nC) The customer can return the car for a full refund within 30 days of purchase, as required by interstate commerce laws.\nD) Unless the car was sold with a specific warranty, the customer likely has no recourse against the dealer.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. In used car sales, the principle of \"caveat emptor\" (let the buyer beware) generally applies. Unless the car was sold with a specific warranty, used cars are typically sold \"as-is,\" meaning the dealer is not responsible for issues that arise after the sale. Even though the car had undisclosed flood damage, it's unlikely the dealer knew about it, especially given the clean CarFax report. For fraud to be proven (option B), the customer would need to demonstrate that the dealer had actual knowledge of the flood damage and deliberately lied about it, which is very difficult to prove. There is no automatic right to return a car or demand repairs (options A and C) in this scenario, particularly in an interstate transaction. The lack of a warranty and the \"as-is\" nature of most used car sales significantly limit the customer's options for recourse."

It's not like they open a Chase account and are limited by their balance.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It depends in part on what you mean by \"money\". US $100 bills are a prime example of \"money\". [Art 1 \u00a710 Cl. 1](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-10/) of the US Constitution says\n\n> No State shall ...[coin Money](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S10-C1-2-1/ALDE_00001098/); emit Bills of Credit; [make any\n> Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S10-C1-2-2-1/ALDE_00001099/) in Payment of Debts...\n\nUnder the constitution, only the federal government can \"print money\" in the \"universally usable\" sense. Anyone can print or otherwise \"emit\" objects with economic value, and such objects can be voluntarily accepted in trade. State and local governments can incur debts and thus spend money now that they do not yet have, as long as there is no legal limit on a government's ability to go into debt. California could issue IOU\\-bucks with the intent that a holder could redeem them as real federal money or as gold or silver at some point.\n\nThis limits the ability of a state treasury to print money, since in principle and practice\nit is redeemable in gold or silver. Each state has some set of laws and constitutional provisions that prevent writing rubber checks *ad infinitum*, for example only allowing debt for large capital projects (building) and requiring voter approval; requiring expenditures to not exceed projected revenues; granting emergency debt\\-mitigation powers (e.g. hiring freezes) to the governor when a state does go into unauthorized debt. In California, [Art IV \u00a712](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CONS&sectionNum=SEC.%2012.&article=IV) of the state constitution requires a balanced budget, meaning that the state cannot create infinite obligations without infinite revenues.\n\nFrom the legal perspective, private banks do not create money, although non\\-legally, [people may talk about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_creation) what banks do as \"creating money\". At that point in the discussion, we will have left law and moved to the realm of economic theory.",

The U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 10, Clause 1) explicitly prohibits states from coining money or emitting bills of credit. However, states can issue IOUs or similar instruments that are redeemable for federal currency, gold, or silver. This is subject to various state-level constitutional and legal restrictions, such as balanced budget requirements (e.g., California's Article IV, Section 12). Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest powers that states do not constitutionally possess.

In the Australian legal system, while a civil court may refer a potential criminal matter to law enforcement authorities, the police and public prosecutors maintain discretion over which cases they choose to investigate or prosecute. The court's referral does not obligate law enforcement to act, nor does it guarantee a higher priority for the case. This maintains the separation between civil and criminal proceedings, and preserves the independence of law enforcement in allocating their resources and determining which cases to pursue criminally.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because civil court judges cannot directly order criminal investigations. Answer B is wrong as the court cannot mandate a criminal investigation that law enforcement must prioritize. Answer D is incorrect because proving fraud in civil court does not automatically trigger a criminal investigation; the two processes are separate."

While looking at cars for sale at a closed car dealership, is it breaking and entering to open the door of an unlocked car?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Florida law states that\n\n> 810\\.02\u2003Burglary.\u2014 (1\\)(a) For offenses committed on or before July 1, 2001, \u201cburglary\u201d means entering or remaining in a dwelling, a\n>  structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense\n>  therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the\n>  defendant is licensed or invited to enter or remain.\n>  [Florida Statutes \\& Constitution : Online Sunshine: 810\\.02 Burglary](http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&SubMenu=1&App_mode=Display_Statute&Search_String=810.02&URL=0800-0899/0810/Sections/0810.02.html)\n\nThere are two relevant points here. (In this context, a \"conveyance\" means an automobile). \n\nOne is that Florida law states that there *must be intent to commit a crime* when entering a vehicle. This would be the case where someone steals parts (or the whole car) from a dealership; a crime was committed. But it would be difficult to show that people browsing through cars have intent to commit a crime, because the car dealership is in the business of selling cars, people have to get into a car to evaluate it, and during business hours, people enter the cars without salesmen.\n\nFlorida laws doesn't clearly differentiate between locked and unlocked doors when entering a conveyance or building; but obviously there would damage to a car by forcing entry by braking a window or crowbarring the door, and that is a separate crime covered under the same chapter of law.\n\nThe second point is the qualifier that \"...unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited.\"\n\nOne could argue that the dealership \\- by not securing the car lot with a fence or signage that states \"no trespassing\" during certain hours \\- is still open to the public, even though the dealership is obviously private property. And by remaining accessible after hours, the public has been invited onto the property.\n\nIf you looked, you may see boilerplate signage at the dealership that states it is open after hours, though they are not responsible for injuries, etc.",

Florida law requires intent to commit a crime for an action to be considered burglary. Additionally, if the dealership doesn't secure the lot or post clear \"No Trespassing\" signs, it could be argued that the premises remain open to the public.\n\nB) While explicit permission would certainly make it legal, it's not necessary. The absence of intent to commit a crime and lack of clear restrictions can be sufficient.\n\nC) Damaging the car would actually make the action more likely to be considered illegal, not less.\n\nD) Future intent to purchase doesn't negate potential current illegal activity. The immediate intent and circumstances are what matter legally.\n\nThe key factors are the lack of criminal intent and the implicit invitation created by an unsecured, unmarked lot, even when the dealership is closed."

Does this reduce the risk of genericization? Is there any other legal advantage to doing this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is capitalized because the word NEXIUM has a conspicuous definition. In other words, they're using it in the specific way they have defined it to mean. This is to differentiate it from any other meaning it may have in some other context. Obviously with NEXIUM, it's a word they just made up and it's very unlikely that it could ever be confused with anything other than their particular drug.\n\nBut what if the drug were called PRAXIA? The word praxia might be confused with the medical term. It's also the name of a city in Romania (I just learned that while looking that word up). But PRAXIA in all caps refers specifically to their drug, and there can be no ambiguity between that and other uses of the term.\n\nThis is especially important for drugs, since they are legally required to disclose the side effects in their advertising, and you wouldn't want someone potentially confusing the name of the drug with the condition it treats.\n\nYou see this in contracts as well. When a contract provision is written in ALL CAPS, it is done to conspicuously call attention to the text, either because it is redefining an established legal term or is modifying rights you may have under the law (e.g. LIMITED WARRANTY, SEVERABILITY, BINDING ARBITRATION, etc.)\n\nThere is no established rule for this, by the way. It's mostly a matter of style. Some laws require conspicuous disclosure of certain provisions in contracts, so ALL CAPS has traditionally been used to meet that requirement.\n\nNOTE: The term \"Nexium\" (not in caps) is simply the registered trademark for the drug. It simply protects their intellectual property (i.e. the name), and isn't intended to describe or define anything in a legal way.\n\n---\n\n**Fun fact:** Subway got sued for making \"Footlong\" sandwiches that were not actually 12 inches in length. They tried to argue that \"Footlong\" was a trademark and not intended to convey the length of their sandwiches. They settled the lawsuit, because really, that's a jackass move right there. I wonder, though... If they'd called it a FOOTLONG, would that have made a difference? ;\\-)",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: What is the primary purpose of writing a drug's trade name in all capital letters in pharmaceutical advertising and safety information?\n\nA) To make the drug name stand out visually from other text\nB) To indicate that the term has a specific, legally defined meaning in that context\nC) To reduce the risk of trademark genericization\nD) To comply with FDA regulations on drug advertising\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nThe primary purpose of writing a drug's trade name in all capital letters is to indicate that the term has a specific, legally defined meaning in that context. This practice helps differentiate the drug name from any other potential meanings or uses of the word, reducing ambiguity and ensuring clear communication about the specific pharmaceutical product being discussed.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while capitalizing does make the name stand out, this is not the primary legal or communicative purpose.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, while trademark protection is important, the use of all caps is not primarily aimed at preventing genericization. The trademark itself (whether in all caps or not) serves this purpose.\n\nOption D is incorrect because, while there are FDA regulations on drug advertising, the use of all caps for drug names is not a specific requirement. It's more of a convention adopted by pharmaceutical companies for clarity and legal precision.\n\nThe correct answer, B, aligns with the explanation provided in the original text, which states that capitalization is used to indicate a \"conspicuous definition\" and to differentiate the term from other potential meanings or contexts."

Software licenses, including EULAs, are copyrighted works that involve significant creative effort. Directly copying another company's EULA would likely infringe on their copyright. The best approach is for TechInnovate to hire a lawyer to draft a new EULA, using the competitor's as inspiration for points they want to cover, but without directly copying the text. This ensures that the new EULA is tailored to TechInnovate's needs while avoiding copyright infringement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because legal documents, including EULAs, are generally protected by copyright. Option C is false; EULAs are not in the public domain. Option D is also incorrect, as crediting the source does not make it legal to copy copyrighted text without permission."

Fiance(e)s come under a [special immigration status](https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/general/IMBRA.html) when applying for a visa.\n2. There is a body of law related to whether an engagement ring is an absolute gift or is conditional upon being married (this is not uniform from state to state and I don't recall what the majority rule in those cases is under the common law).

Pre\\-marital agreements governing a future marriage can be made by people who are engaged (although a post\\-nuptial agreement is also equal in effect in most cases).\n4. People who are engaged, like spouses, are generally considered to be in a \"confidential relationship\" with each other which imposes higher duties with respect to fairness in their dealings with each other than strangers, but generally less high duties than fiduciaries.\n5. While not strictly arising from the status of being engaged, adult cohabitants are generally [agents for service of process of each other at their shared home](https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_4), and are often considered to have a legally significant relationship for purposes of domestic violence statutes (usually related to either domestic violence crimes or temporary restraining orders).\n\nI am not familiar enough with the law of France to fully answer the balance of the question, which someone more familiar with that law can expand upon. \n\nBut, there is similarly a special immigration status in French law for a fiance(e).\n\nAnd, French law, in a flourish so romantic it could scarcely be any other country's law, also [allows people who are engaged a right to marry after one of them has died in certain circumstances](http://www.thelocal.fr/20140228/grieving-french-woman-to-marry-dead-partner):\n\n\"The legislation that allows posthumous marriages stems back to when a dam burst in 1959 and killed 420 people in southern France.\" It was most recently invoked in 2014 when a grieving French woman was granted permission by the French President to marry her former fianc\u00e9, who tragically died in 2012, just a month before they were due to wed.

The law in question is [set forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumous_marriage) at Articles 171 of the French Civil Code.

After reviewing the privacy laws that bind us by doing business in this country, there seem to be an endless amount of ways that we could be in violation without any malicious intent because of the vagueness of the language.\n\nMy idea to pitch to my partners is to set up the company in a country where laws are more explicit and the legal system is robust which holds all of our assets, processes payments, and where all the ownership lies, then use a local pass\\-through entity in the country we are targeting that has all of the liabilities of handling the sensitive information, but with which we are not technically affiliated.\n\nGiven this situation, is such an arrangement viable from a legal perspective in terms of protecting our assets and ourselves from liabilities and litigation?\n\nEDIT Feb 19, 2018\n\nGreat answers and responses. Given me a great deal to think about.\n\nJust a few points of clarification:\n\n* In the future our business will likely expand to markets other than \"A\", however, that is likely many years in the future. This consideration could render the question moot I suppose.\n* Since \"B\" is a purely hypothetical, my first choice was Singapore.\n* The legal system in \"A\" is fundamentally corrupt, its really just a contest of who has the most resources/connections.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Okay, let's call the \"*country where laws are loose at best*\" **A**, and the \"*country where laws are more explicit and the legal system is robust*\" **B**.\n\nThe answer pretty much depends on whether you mostly do business in A or not.\n\nNo matter what country B your business is domiciled in, if you do business (have customers) in country A, you won't be protected from *litigation* in that country. Noone of your adversaries in A would say \"Hmmm, they're from B, we can't sue them here in A\". If they can't get you in B, they will at least be able to **ban** you from A.\n\nIn most countries, if your business is present physically \u2014 offices, physical stores etc. \u2014 those need to belong to your entity registered in that country. You cannot have a food supermarket in the EU directly owned by a US company \u2014 it needs to be owned by an entity registered in the EU (which in turn can be owned by the US company though). If your business is purely online then you could get away without a local entity \u2014 but only until you become noticeable: Google, PayPal etc. all have entities in Europe and those are the targets for any litigation coming from Europe.\n\nIt is true though that having your *assets* registered in B would require your adversaries in A to litigate in B to get hold of your assets (unless they are present in A physically; it is not uncommon for two states in confrontation to arrest each other's property).\n\nBottom line:\n\n* if your customers are mostly/entirely in A, then having your business domiciled in B can only be justified if there are assets that can stay outside A without adversely affecting the business (e.g. intellectual property)\n* if your customers can be anywhere then definitely chose B to domicile your business.",

While incorporating in Country B (with a robust legal system) can offer some protection for the company's assets, it doesn't provide complete immunity from litigation in Country A where the business operates. The startup would still be subject to local laws and potential legal action in Country A.

No.\n\nIntellectual property practitioners and professors often describe copyright as \"a bundle of sticks.\" This means that intellectual property laws grant the creator of a copyrightable work a large number of rights, and the creator can grant or deny others each of those rights individually. So, for instance, an author can grant a publisher the right to publish his or her book in one country, but not in another, or to copy it verbatim but not to alter it.\n\nThe purpose of a license, any license, is to specify which of those rights pass to the licensee (the end user) and which stay with the licensor (the creator).\n\nThis is true of creative commons just as it is for any other license. For example, many open access publishers publish under the Creative Commons CC\\-BY journal. This is an attribution license; it requires as a term of the license that you give credit to the original creator. This is something you would not have to do with a public domain work. \n\nIn addition, under CC\\-BY, you have to include a copy of the license with each copy you distribute, and you cannot add your own copy protection to any copies you distribute. Again, these sort of restrictions do not apply to a public domain work.\n\nIn short: the purpose of a license\\-\\-any license\\-\\-is to define the ways in which you can, or can not, use the licensed materials. Any license that contains any provisions restricting the licensee's use is going to be more restrictive, by definition, than the use of something in the public domain.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was on YouTube a couple of days ago watching a video that looked at mobile game advertisements and whether or not they were reflective of the product.\n\nTo give an example, one game used online ads of supposed game footage with some of the characters being creatures from the Pok\u00e9mon franchise. However, the actual game doesn't contain these characters at all.\n\nOn the one hand, I wondered if while the ad could likely be removed on copyright grounds, would the game itself be shielded by not actually including these characters? On the other hand, is advertising a product as though it is connected to a franchise it blatantly isn't not also violating some advertising standards agency's rules of misleading advertising?\n\nIt obviously seems wrong to be using someone else's work in this way, even if your actual product doesn't contain it, but I'm intrigued by what the actual legalities are here.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The issue you identify isn't really a copyright issue. The same issue would arise if the product contained public domain images in the advertisements that aren't present in the work itself.\n\nEssentially, the question comes down to whether there was actionable deceptive advertising. Usually, these claims arise under specialized consumer protection statutes that offer remedies and means of enforcement different from an individualized fraud lawsuit, and usually a deceptive advertising claim is easier to prove than traditional fraud lawsuit.\n\nTraditional fraud lawsuits normally require a showing of damages caused by reasonable reliance upon the misrepresentation, which is uneconomic to prove in the case of an individual small consumer purchase.\n\nUsually, deceptive advertising of consumer products is established in a lawsuit by a government official in charge of regulating deceptive advertising or a class action lawsuit, and often statutory damages are assigned to each violation rather than requiring detailed proof of economic harm for compensatory damages from some but not other images being present.\n\nOften fine print in the advertisement or in a purchase form before buying the product discloses the disconnect. Also, the mere presence of an image in an advertisement doesn't necessary imply that it is included in the product. So prove of deceptive advertising liability in these cases is often difficult even with these relaxed standards. There are many gray area and close cases, and often, businesses settle these lawsuits rather than litigating them.\n\nA more specific answer would require knowledge of which jurisdiction's laws apply, which is often a non\\-trivial question in Internet based advertising lawsuits.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications of this practice?\n\nA) This is primarily a copyright infringement issue and the game company can be sued for damages by the franchise owner.\n\nB) The game company is protected from legal action as long as the advertised characters don't appear in the actual game.\n\nC) This situation is more likely to be addressed as a deceptive advertising issue rather than a copyright infringement case.\n\nD) The game company can avoid legal consequences by including fine print in the advertisement disclosing that the characters are not in the game.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The question primarily deals with deceptive advertising rather than copyright infringement. As stated in the documentation, \"The issue you identify isn't really a copyright issue.\" Instead, it falls under consumer protection laws and deceptive advertising regulations. \n\nOption A is incorrect because while copyright could be an issue for the ad itself, it's not the primary legal concern in this scenario. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the absence of copyrighted characters in the game doesn't shield the company from deceptive advertising claims.\n\nOption C is correct because the documentation emphasizes that this is mainly a deceptive advertising issue, which is typically addressed through consumer protection statutes.\n\nOption D is partially true but not the most accurate answer. While fine print might help, it doesn't guarantee protection from legal consequences, as the documentation states: \"Often fine print in the advertisement or in a purchase form before buying the product discloses the disconnect.

As stated in the documentation, \"If Carl is rich, he already has a lawyer.\" Wealthy individuals, especially those involved in criminal activities, often have pre-existing relationships with lawyers to handle their legal affairs. Even if Carl doesn't have a specific criminal defense attorney on retainer, he likely has a general counsel or a law firm that handles his business matters, who can then help him find an appropriate criminal defense lawyer.\n\nOption A is incorrect because jails do not typically provide internet access or devices to search for lawyers. Option B is unlikely for a wealthy individual, as there are other ways to obtain legal representation even without personal internet access.

Will reusing all of these names mentioned will cause a new game to became a derivative work, even through these names are apparently generic? (Some games have distinctive attribute/faction names, but this doesn't appear to be the case in DotA)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Strength, Agility, Intelligence, Stamina:\n-----------------------------------------\n\nUnlikely, given the vast array of *prior art* and the \"Obvious to any practitioner in the field\".\n\nVirtually every RPG out there uses four familiar stats:\n\n* Constitution/Stamina/Toughness\n* Strength\n* Dexterity\n* Intelligence\n\nThis is such a deeply held trope, and so axiomatic to RPGs on or off computers, that I doubt any intellectual property is in play. If it *ever* was, it has been completely undefended for the last 40 years, so it's much too late to now attempt to claim rights.\n\nSentinel and Scourge\n--------------------\n\nLet me dodge that one and generalize: Can you use *Alliance\\-Horde?*  \n\n*Terran\\-Protoss\\-Zerg?*  \n\n*Empire\\-Rebellion?*  \n\n*Gryffindor\\-Hufflepuff\\-Ravenclaw\\-Slytherin?*\n\nSee, there's a real spectrum there! The four names *alone* are so unique that J.K. Rowling would come after you if you used them *anywhere*. But Empire\\-Rebellion is too generic to assert an IP claim over.\n\nAnd if you pluck *non\\-paired* names from an IP, like Ravenclaw\\-Granger, that's not a problem either. A Wild West movie with feuding families the Grangers and Ravenclaws, would be absolutely fine; whereas Ravenclaws and Gryffindors would not be fine!\n\nDOTA 1, however, is a copyright morass. Many games permit fan\\-created \"mods\", ranging from the TM:PE traffic modeling mod in *Cities: Skylines* to the TSM auction pricing mod in *World of Warcraft*. The mod is nothing without the game. The game author doesn't own the mod, The mod author doesn't own the game. They coexist mostly by consent.\n\nDOTA I was an arena \"mod\" to *Warcraft III* and there has been quite considerable fighting over ownership of that IP. Valve now owns it [but agreed to allow non\\-commercial use of the IP](https://web.archive.org/web/20120724090129/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/05/11/valve-blizzard-reach-dota-trademark-agreement.aspx).\n\nEven so, the Sentinel\\-Scourge pairing is only really important in DOTA I. The pairing doesn't mean much in Warcraft III, as they are disjoint, like my Granger\\-Ravenclaw example above.\n\nYou would probably be fine, but the risk of trouble is exactly why **original games create original IP** \\- for instance Sentinels\\-Scourge *was not* reused in DOTA II!",

If S is the sole copyright holder, S can issue any other non\\-exclusive license in parallel, and can also stop offering the software under the MIT license. However, open source licenses such the MIT license are generally understood to be irrevocable, so S cannot prevent other people from using the software who already received it under the MIT license terms.\n\nBut: **only if S is the sole copyright holder.**\n\nThere is no particular reason to believe that S would be the sole copyright holder. One does not gain a copyright ownership just by supervising other people, although an employer might gain copyright ownership over works created by employees (e.g. the US \u201cwork for hire\u201d doctrine). That the copyright notices only mention S's name is an indication that S might be a copyright holder, but that's neither sufficient nor necessary for showing that S holds sole or joint copyright in the software. This leaves three relevant scenarios:\n\n* S might be the sole copyright holder, in which case, yes, S can effectively discard the MIT license. This might be the case e.g. if there was some other copyright assignment, outside of the MIT license. What copyright transfers or assignments are valid depends on the local laws, e.g. some jurisdiction do not recognize copyright as transferable and at most allow the assignment of economic aspects of copyright.\n* S might not be the sole copyright holder, but have additional permissions to the work. For example, there might have been extra licensing agreements, outside of the MIT license. Or S might have special rights for a work of joint authorship, if and only if the jurisdiction recognizes such additional rights.\n* S might not be the sole copyright holder and not have any agreements outside of the MIT license. Then S has no additional rights, and is bound by the terms of the MIT license. This doesn't have to be a problem: S can still pretty much do whatever S wants with the code, as long as S fulfils the license terms. These are pretty simple: just keep a copy of the copyright\\+license notice with any copies of the software the students created.",

S can only use the code without adhering to the MIT License if S is the sole copyright holder. Supervising the project doesn't automatically grant copyright ownership. If S is the sole copyright holder, S can issue new licenses or stop offering the software under the MIT license for future distributions. However, this is only possible if S actually owns all the copyright, which isn't guaranteed just by being the supervisor or having their name on the copyright notice. If S is not the sole copyright holder (e.g., if the students retain some copyright), S must adhere to the MIT License terms like any other user.

Instead, it depends on the specific language in the condominium's declaration. The declaration would outline whether balconies are considered limited common elements, who is responsible for their maintenance, and whether homeowners are allowed to make modifications like installing screens.

This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to:\n> \n> \n> (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or\n> \n> \n> (b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union.\n\nSo whether someone is an EU citizen, is not relevant. If an EU citizen is in America, the GDPR does not apply. \n\nHowever, it does apply to American citizens who are visiting the EU, when (a) or (b) above applies.

Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller\u2019s, processor\u2019s or an intermediary\u2019s website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union.",

The website is in English and prices are displayed in USD. However, it offers shipping to EU countries and has a separate page for EU customers with prices in Euros. The company collects customer data including name, address, and purchase history. Which of the following scenarios would most likely trigger GDPR compliance requirements for TechGadgets?\n\nA) An American citizen living in the US purchases a product and has it shipped to their friend in Germany.\nB) A German citizen studying abroad in Canada makes a purchase using their Canadian address and credit card.\nC) A French citizen living in France purchases a product using their French address and credit card.\nD) An American tourist temporarily visiting Italy accesses the website but doesn't make a purchase.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because it involves a data subject (French citizen) who is in the EU (living in France) making a purchase from a company that is clearly offering goods to EU customers (evidenced by the separate EU page with Euro pricing). This scenario falls under Article 3(2)(a) of the GDPR, which applies to non-EU companies processing data of individuals in the EU when offering goods or services to them.\n\nOption A doesn't trigger GDPR because the purchaser is not in the EU, even though the recipient is. The company isn't directly offering services to the EU resident in this case.\n\nOption B doesn't apply because the German citizen is not in the EU at the time of purchase, and GDPR is based on the location of the data subject, not their citizenship.\n\nOption D is tricky but less likely to trigger full GDPR compliance. While the tourist is temporarily in the EU, merely accessing the website without making a purchase or providing personal data is less likely to be considered as the company offering goods or services to EU data subjects."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Suppose you firmly believe something to be true but you know that it can be proven false beyond a reasonable doubt. This can happen if, for example, you witnessed something that is incredibly unusual. It might also happen if enough other people conspire to lie about something that you know the truth about.\n\nThe fifth amendment to the constitution should prohibit you from being forced to testify in a situation where you have a reasonable belief that truthful testimony could subject you to prosecution for a crime. But it seems like that can't help you in this case. Immunity from prosecution for truthful testimony won't help you if a prosecutor can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that your testimony is false. And I can't imagine a prosecutor allowing someone to testify with immunity from prosecution for making false statements in that very testimony.\n\nThis can't be so rare it has never happened. If it has happened, what happens when someone tells a judge that he pleads the fifth because he believes that if he gives the testimony he believes is truthful it will subject him to perjury charges because it can be proven false beyond a reasonable doubt (despite his belief that it is true)? If it has never happened, what should happen in this case?\n\nTo be precise, the assumption behind this question is that you have an objectively\\-reasonable belief that an answer that you believe is true would subject you to criminal liability for perjury.\n\nTo be clear:\n\n1. The person has not yet testified.\n2. They are being asked to testify.\n3. They have an objectively\\-reasonable fear that the testimony they would give will subject them to criminal liability for perjury.\n4. They therefore invoke their fifth amendment right.\n\nAssume none of these points are controversial. Obviously, others may not agree that the testimony they say they will give is truthful. But there is no reason to doubt their claim that the testimony they would give would subject them to criminal liability for perjury.\n\nThe question is whether this has ever occurred and, if so, what happened. Or, if it has not occurred, what would happen next? Can the person be granted immunity from prosecution for perjury in the very testimony they are given? Or can they be compelled to testify even though they have an objectively\\-reasonable belief that the testimony they would give will subject them to criminal liability? Or is there some third alternative?\n\nLastly, if this has never happened, why not? It seems like this wouldn't be a terribly uncommon situation. I don't think it would happen every day or even every year \\-\\- but never in the history of jurisprudence?!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The California [jury instructions for the crime of perjury](https://www.justia.com/criminal/docs/calcrim/2600/2640/) give more detail on what it means to commit perjury: it's not just that you make a statement that is false, you have to willfully state that the information is true even though you know it is false. If you have a belief that you will be convicted for perjury (or any crime) by testifying, you may invoke your 5th Amendment right (I assume you are not testifying as the defendant in a criminal matter). You might (theoretically: see below on immunity and perjury) be granted immunity from prosecution, in which case there is no 5th Amendment right to refuse to testify (you are not putting yourself in criminal jeopardy), and the court can order you to testify. Or, you might not be granted immunity and still be ordered to testify.\n\nThe federal immunity statute, [18 USC 6002](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/6002), also needs to be scrutinized. When ordered to testify, \"the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his privilege against self\\-incrimination\", but it generally cannot be used against him:\n\n> no testimony or other information compelled under the order (or any\n>  information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or\n>  other information) may be used against the witness in any criminal\n>  case\n\nHowever, there is an exception:\n\n> except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or\n>  otherwise failing to comply with the order.\n\nIn other words, you cannot be immunized against a perjury charge.\n\nIn [Kastigar v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/406/441/), 406 U.S. 441 defendant refused an order to testify, on the grounds that they (allegedly) believed that the government's grant of immunity was not broad enough, i.e. that there were areas where they might be questions and forced to criminally implicate themselves. They refused, and were held in contempt.\n\nThe opinion recognized that the 5th Amendment \"protects against any disclosures that the witness *reasonably* believes could be used in a criminal prosecution or could lead to other evidence that might be so used\" (emphasis added). \n\nIn [Mason v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/244/362/), 244 U.S. 362, the court held that\n\n> The Fifth Amendment does not relieve a witness from answering merely\n>  on his own declaration or judgment that an answer might incriminate\n>  him; whether he must answer is determinable by the trial court in the\n>  exercise of its sound discretion, and unless there is reasonable\n>  ground, as distinct from a remote or speculative possibility, to\n>  apprehend that a direct answer may prove dangerous to the witness, his\n>  answer should be compelled.\n\n[Heike v. United States](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/227/131/), 227 U.S. 131 asserts that \"the constitutional protection is confined to real danger, and does not extend to remote possibilities out of the ordinary course of law, citing [Brown v. Walker](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/161/591/), 161 U.S. 591 (itself quoting Lord Chief Justice Cockburn):\n\n> \"the danger to be apprehended must be real and appreciable, with\n>  reference to the ordinary operation of law in the ordinary course of\n>  things; not a danger of an imaginary and unsubstantial character,\n>  having reference to some extraordinary and barely possible\n>  contingency, so improbable that no reasonable man would suffer it to\n>  influence his conduct\"\n\nAlthough the wording of the immunity statute does not allow immunity from prosecution for perjury, the 5th Amendment right can only be invoked against a real legal jeopardy. They *can* be compelled to testify, they probably cannot be immunized against a perjury conviction (certainly not at the federal level). We would need to know the entire circumstances of the case to be able to assess whether the \"knowing to be false\" part could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.",

According to the provided information and relevant case law:\n\n1. The Fifth Amendment protection only applies to real and appreciable dangers of self-incrimination, not remote or speculative possibilities.\n\n2.

Federal immunity statutes explicitly do not protect against perjury charges for the testimony given.\n\n5. The witness cannot refuse to testify based solely on their own declaration that an answer might incriminate them.\n\nTherefore, the most likely outcome is that the court will assess the reasonableness of the witness's fear of self-incrimination and may still compel testimony if the fear is deemed unreasonable or speculative.

Most well\\-drafted contracts will do so.\n\nSpecifying that law their lawyer already knows generally reduces the risk the website owner may need to hire some other lawyer familiar with international law, like the CISG.

Websites include this clause to reduce potential legal ambiguity and associated costs. As explained in the documentation, specifying that the CISG does not apply helps reduce ambiguity in the contract (Terms of Service) and potentially saves money on legal fees in the long term.

According to the information provided, a witness for a signature on a medical records request form can be anyone with legal capacity, excluding children and those deemed legally incompetent. \n\nOption A (18-year-old neighbor) is of legal age and presumably of sound mind, making them an appropriate witness.\nOption B (35-year-old coworker) is an adult and likely of sound mind, making them an appropriate witness.\nOption C (10-year-old son) is a child and does not have legal capacity, making him NOT an appropriate witness.\nOption D (70-year-old grandmother) is an adult and presumably of sound mind, making her an appropriate witness.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, as Sarah's 10-year-old son would not be an appropriate witness due to his age and lack of legal capacity."

The fact that it's ancestral property inherited from his grandfather and father does not give his wife or children any legal claim to prevent the sale during his lifetime.

The landlord might be mindful enough to ensure that work done between 6AM to 7AM does not disturb tenants.\n\nEven if the landlord insisted on causing disturbances earlier than 7AM, the situation is very unlikely to justify tenants' breach of the lease.

The tenant should first remind the landlord of the local ordinance prohibiting construction before 7AM. If the landlord persists in starting work early, the tenant can report the violation to local authorities. This approach addresses the issue without breaching the lease agreement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the situation described does not justify breaking the lease without penalty.

The title of the question is: \"What are legal/ethical concerns to bear in mind, when hacking websites with open invitations?\"\n\nThis [answer](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/13383/71966) suggests to \"log everything you do just in case something bad happens and you need to prove it wasn't you, or wasn't deliberate!\"\n\nI thought \"How would that even help? How hard can it be to forge a log file? Or better yet, how hard can it be to log only the \"legal\" actions you do and exclude the illegal ones, and present this log file as evidence?\"\n\nSimilarly [this](https://security.stackexchange.com/q/11025/71966) question. In the question, OP states that his boss asks him to forge a log file in order to win a dispute. The answers clearly suggests not to do it. They also suggest to get the requested action written *and* to make sure a copy of this document is available outside the work (just in case the boss tries to destroy the evidence in case of a legal action).\n\nAgain, assume that this incident is indeed carried to court and boss claims he did not request such thing. The employee claims the boss requested such thing and presents his copy of the written request as an evidence. The boss claims that this was forged by the employee. What is going to happen? Who is the judge going to believe?\n\nOr yet a simpler example. Say Party 1 has some witnesses. Party 2 claims what these witnesses say is not correct and presents some kind of counter evidence. What is going to happen?\n\nIn the end, what determines which party the judge is going to believe?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In law there are two different concepts: admissibility of evidence and the weight of that evidence.\nYour question concerns both. I will begin by discussing a little bit about what both these two terms mean.\n\nAdmissibility means that this evidence may go before the trier of fact. Typically the trier of fact is the jury, however, if both parties have waived their rights to jury trials (particularly the defendant) the judge is the trier of fact as well as the law. When documents or testimony by witnesses is admissible, the trier of fact can consider it in reaching a decision.\n\nWeight of evidence is a different concept. The weight of evidence is what someone believes. For example if two witnesses who were bystanders testify that the light was red, but the defendant testifies that the light was green, most people would believe the bystanders. However, in this case the evidence by the defendant that the light was green is admissible, but the trier of fact may not afford it much weight.\n\nNow let's consider these logs. In the United States all statements made out of court, whether verbal or written, are considered hearsay (with some exceptions, a couple will be discussed later). Hearsay is generally inadmissible; however, there are many hearsay exceptions.\n\nOne exception is a record of a regularly conducted activity. The requirements are (summarized, you may refer to the federal rules of evidence 803\\-6\\.) for the full text):\n(A) the record was made at the time of the event by someone who knew about what happened\n(B) the record was kept in the course of this regularly conducted activity\n(C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity\n(D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness\n(E) neither the opponent does not show that the source of information nor or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n\nNow if these logs fit these requirements you can most likely use them in court. If they don't you probably will not be able to use to in court, unless one of the following applies:\n1\\.) you are being sued by someone (or you are suing them) who made the logs and you are offering the logs against them (this is referred to in legal settings as party\\-opponent statements) OR\n2\\.) the other party has offered evidence that you are lying and you are offering this logs to show you are telling the truth.\n\nMost likely the only admissible evidence would be the testimony of the employee and the employer. This leads to a he said she said scenario and the legal results will be highly ambiguous. The credibility of both witnesses will be likely assessed by the trier of fact and the trier will consider who has a higher incentive to lie. If there are more witnesses saying one thing versus another, it is likely they will be believed unless there is a reason all of them are lying.\n\nAlthough this is not legal advice, my suggestion for an employee in such a situation is to gather evidence that an employer asked you to commit a crime as part of your job. Print out emails, get written requests from the employer, and have witnesses present at the time of the request. Then the employee should refuse to perform the act. If as a result the employee is fired, one can sue. All these statements of the employer can be admitted as party\\-opponent statements. \n\nAdditionally I suggest that you advocate for your company to adopt policies which require record keeping, which will satisfy the hearsay exception given above.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the admissibility and weight of evidence in this scenario?\n\nA) The written request is inadmissible as evidence because it's considered hearsay.\n\nB) The written request is admissible as a party-opponent statement, but its weight will be determined by the trier of fact based on credibility assessments.\n\nC) The written request is only admissible if it meets the requirements for a record of regularly conducted activity.\n\nD) The written request is automatically given more weight than the boss's testimony due to its written nature.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The written request from the boss would likely be admissible in court as a party-opponent statement, which is an exception to the hearsay rule. This means the document can be presented as evidence against the boss. However, the weight given to this evidence would be determined by the trier of fact (judge or jury), who would assess the credibility of both the employee and the boss. The trier of fact would consider factors such as who has more incentive to lie and any other corroborating evidence. This scenario presents a \"he said, she said\" situation where the credibility of witnesses becomes crucial. The written nature of the request doesn't automatically give it more weight than verbal testimony, but it could be considered alongside other factors in assessing credibility."

I have heard from others that intent to use the picks for something otherwise illegal is what can actually get you into trouble, but I have not found anything to back this up.\n\nAccording to [the Open Organization of Lockpickers](http://toool.us/laws.html), Pennsylvania does not have any specific laws. Is this true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is a relevant law, [Title 18 section 907](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=9&sctn=7&subsctn=0) which states that \"A person commits a misdemeanor of the first degree if he possesses any instrument of crime with intent to employ it criminally\". So possession of lock picks is not a crime *per se*. In [Com. v. Gendrachi 389 A.2d 604](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2073535/com-v-gendrachi/?q=cites%3A1560947) we are reminded that \"intent need not be directly proved, but may be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the incident out of which the charges arise\". The accused was busted in mildly suspicious circumstances at 5:20 am in the dead of winter, urinating. The court notes that \"There is no evidence that appellant's hands were on the door or that he made an attempt to extract the tools from his pocket and apply them to the door. In fact, there is no act or statement by appellant that would lead one to infer that he intended to use the tools at that time\", and that \"appellant is a certified locksmith and it is not unreasonable to find the tools of his trade in his pocket, especially when he is wearing his work attire\". Note that this is on appeal: he was convicted initially. The point is that there is a lot of slop in cashing out the legal concept of \"intent\".\n\nPennsylvania does not, apparently, have any specific laws that refer to lock picks. It does have a statute that addresses having criminal tools, which are defined as (including) \"Anything used for criminal purposes and possessed by\nthe actor under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for lawful uses it may have\". Mr. Gendrachi had those very tools, and the appeals court did not say anything to suggest that the tools were not \"criminal tools\" (and in FN 5 they actually point out that the Commonwealth cannot say that the tools were weapons, a ludicrous proposition never raised by anyone \u2013 so by failing to deny that lock picks are criminal tools, they are adoptively admitting that they *are* criminal tools). Thus I conclude that there *is* a law in PA, that lock picks are burglary tools, and that the government would have to prove intent to use criminally.",

The law focuses on the intent to use them criminally, not mere possession.\n\nOption B is incorrect because while Pennsylvania doesn't have laws specifically mentioning lock picks by name, they fall under the broader category of \"instruments of crime\" in Title 18 section 907.\n\nOption C is correct. According to Pennsylvania law, possessing \"any instrument of crime with intent to employ it criminally\" is a misdemeanor. Lock picks can be considered instruments of crime, but possession only becomes illegal if there's intent to use them for criminal purposes. This intent can be inferred from circumstances.\n\nOption D is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that in the Gendrachi case, the court noted it would be \"ludicrous\" to consider lock picks as weapons.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the nuanced legal status of lock picks in Pennsylvania, requiring careful reading and interpretation of the provided legal information."

This was advertised to me as freehold though it has become clear through conveyancing that the situation is more complex than that.\n\nIn buying this house I would for some reason be buying the freehold and the leasehold, both. At some point in history the leasehold owner aquired the freehold and never combined the two.\n\nMy solicitor says there may be some reason behind this like some sort of rights hidden in one of the ancient contracts but has been light on details beyond this. \n\nIs this at all a normal situation? What reasons could there be to keep the two seperate but in the same hands?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This could have occurred for a variety of reasons, but is usually a way for a developer (or freehold asset company, or local authority) reserve control, or keep open a revenue stream of fees on an estate. As you are no doubt aware, the lease is essentially a contract between the landlord and the tenant, stipulating rights, reservations and obligations over a demised piece of land. It is common for freehold management companies to charge fees for issuing consents to alterations, keeping pets and such like. And of course premiums can be charged by a landlord for renewing leases, although the legislation governing leasehold houses is slightly different (see [Leasehold Reform Act 1967](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1967/88/contents)).\n\nThis kind of freehold/leasehold arrangement was also common in older 'equity release' sale and leaseback schemes, where the owner sells the freehold to a third party who then leases the property back to the tenant, usually at a nominal rent.\n\nThat being said, some developers of new estates have sold houses as leasehold (as good as freehold, apparently). It's a problem that's come into sharp focus recently and the government has issued [White Paper](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fixing-our-broken-housing-market) intending to legislate further, and perhaps ban the sale of new leasehold houses. \n\nIt may have been the case for the previous owner that when they came into ownership of both leasehold and freehold interests it didn't affect their enjoyment of the property in any way, so the titles were never merged. \n\nProvided there are no outstanding charges or incumbrances, both freehold and leasehold titles are in the same ownership and there is clear intention to merge the estates, this can be dealt with quite easily by application to the Land Registry. \n\nI'd suggest asking your solicitor to send you the lease, and explain any terms or provisions you're not sure of or don't understand.",

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I believe that in the US, public schools are allowed to perform music with religious texts, and that this has been upheld by the Supreme Court on the grounds that the music program is teaching music, heritage, and culture, not indoctrination. I lack the legal knowledge to be able to quote case law and wouldn't mind being educated or having my assumptions corrected.\n\nIf a public school banned the performance, by students, for a public audience, of music with religious texts, could a student or student's parent (assuming the student is a minor) claim that their First Amendment right has been violated by the ban?\n\nThis is a public performance, by students, which is organized by the school. The concert program is a long\\-standing tradition which usually includes many different songs from all over the world and a small number of sacred songs. The administration is considering banning the ones with religious content.\n\nEdit to clarify a few comments:\n\n1. No student would be forced to do anything at contrary to their beliefs.\n2. The performance would be singing, instrumental.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This question mixes up two separate although related issues:\n\n1. Does a student have a first amendment right to perform \"sacred\" music during school time?\n2. Is a public school allowed to include such in its curriculum, or does the First Amendment's Establishment Clause forbid that?\n\nThe answer hinted at in the question applies only to issue 2, while the title of the question goes to issue 1\\.\n\n[*Engel v. Vitale*, 370 U.S. 421 (1962\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_v._Vitale) held that school officials may not compose an official prayer, and mandate or encourage its recitation. (mandatory recitation would probably have been prohibited by [*West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette*, 319 U.S. 624 (1943\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_State_Board_of_Education_v._Barnette) much earlier.) The ruling of *Engel v. Vitale*, would also have applied to sung prayers. Later rulings, consistent with *Engle* prohibited \"one minute for prayer or meditation\" ( *Wallace v. Jaffree* (1985\\)), clergy\\-led prayer at middle school graduation ceremonies (*Lee v. Weisman* (1992\\)), and school\\-organized student\\-led prayer at high school football games (*Santa Fe ISD v. Doe* (2000\\)). But none of these prohibited religious music as part of an instructional music program that was not a form of worship. All the above cases prohibited school\\-organized prayers intended as prayer or worship.\n\nAs to issue \\#1, it is settled that students have the right to pray privately, in ways that do not disrupt school activities. It is hard to see how performing religious music could be done privately and non\\-disruptively.\n\nNeither students nor their parents have a right to insist that certain topics be included in the school curriculum. The students have a right to pray, but not to insist that the school organize prayers or include religious music in its music program.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A public high school's music program has traditionally included a variety of songs from different cultures, including some with religious texts. The school administration is considering banning all songs with religious content from the annual concert. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The school is required by the First Amendment to include religious songs in its music program.\nB) Students have a constitutional right to perform religious music as part of the school-organized concert.\nC) The school administration can choose to remove religious songs from the program without violating students' First Amendment rights.\nD) The school must allow religious songs in the program as long as they are not used for worship or prayer.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Based on the information provided, the school administration has the discretion to determine the content of its curriculum, including the music program. While schools are allowed to include religious music for educational purposes (teaching about music, heritage, and culture), they are not required to do so. Students and parents do not have a constitutional right to insist on the inclusion of specific content in the school curriculum. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the First Amendment does not require schools to include religious content in their programs. \n\nOption B is incorrect because students do not have a constitutional right to perform specific songs in a school-organized concert. \n\nOption D is incorrect because while schools may include religious songs for educational purposes, they are not obligated to do so, even if the songs are not used for worship or prayer.\n\nThe key point is that the school has the authority to shape its curriculum, including the music program, as long as it does not violate the Establishment Clause by promoting religion or organizing prayer or worship activities."

(This is different from a subsidiary, in which a company has more than 50% control.) Under those circumstances, I don't see how the company can bind its affiliate in a contract.\n\nBut Company B signed a contract with Company C, binding itself to sell all of its widget production, and that of its \"affiliate\" A, at a fixed price to C. In the relevant contract, Company B defined \"affiliate\" (perhaps improperly) as a company it controls. In point of fact, the \"control\" percentage was 80%.\n\nCan Company B so bind A with 80% control? How about 40% ownership?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It sounds like you may be conflating ownership and control. It's very common for an affiliate to have a contract with the parent company. These terms can be very detailed \\- it may give the parent company the right to sell the affiliates widgets, but not sprockets (as those are sold by another parent company). As such, you can't really measure \"control\" as a simple percentage.\n\nSo, when the parent is selling widgets, it can reasonably claim control over its affiliate. The buyer does not need to know the exact terms governing the relation between parent and affiliate.",

Company X enters into an agreement with Company Z to sell all widgets produced by X and its \"affiliates\" (defined in the contract as companies X controls) to Z at a fixed price. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The agreement between X and Z is invalid because X cannot bind Y without 100% ownership.\n\nB) Y is not bound by the agreement because X owns less than 80% of Y.\n\nC) The agreement is valid and binding on Y because X has both majority ownership and contractual control over Y's widget production.\n\nD) Y can challenge the agreement on the grounds that it's not technically an \"affiliate\" as commonly defined in business contexts.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation emphasizes that control is not solely determined by ownership percentage, but can be established through detailed contractual agreements. In this case, Company X has both majority ownership (60%) and a specific contract allowing it to sell Y's widgets. This combination of ownership and contractual control likely meets the definition of \"affiliate\" as used in X's agreement with Z, even if it differs from the common definition of affiliate. The buyer (Z) doesn't need to know the exact terms between X and Y. Therefore, the agreement is likely valid and binding on Y despite X not having 100% ownership or the commonly cited 80% threshold for subsidiaries."

I am wondering if companies face criminal liability if they sell products to someone who cannot make rational decisions and if they have the responsibility to make sure the person they are selling to can make rational decisions on their own.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n==\n\n### Overview\n\nThere is no general rule requiring a seller to determine the mental condition of a buyer. However, if a seller knows or has good reason to know that a buyer does in fact had dementia or some other mental problem, and is not or may well not be able to understand the nature of the deal or the reasons why it is or is not a good bargain, if the seller took advantage of the buyer's mental condition, then the seller may be liable.\n\nAlso, if the buyer's condition is such that the buyer is deemed not to be capable of properly entering into a contract, that is the buyer lacks the capacity to contract, then the contract may well be void from teh4 start.\n\nThe Video\n---------\n\nThe video linked in the question shows a man confronting a salesman who, he alleges, sold two houshold doors to his mother for a total of just under 6,000 pounds UK. The son claims that it was obvious that his mother was impaired. He claims that the only problem was that one door had a broken handle and latch, which could easily be repaired for 50 pounds. He claims that the salesman falsely states that the doors were \"not safe\" without mentioning that the one with a problem could easily be repaired, and need not be replaced. He also claims that the salesman took checks in payment, in spite of the printed terms on the invoice saying that no payment was due until after installation. He says repeatedly that the salesman \"pressured\" his mother into making this purchase, and describes it as \"robbery\".\n\nNo proof is shown in the video, and no court decision is refereed to. I express no vieo as to whether the claims of the son in the video are accurate. But I do discuss situations where similar claims are accurate.\n\n### Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (UTR)\n\nIt sees that a sales agent acting similarly to the one accused in the video might have committed unfair practices and thus offenses under the UTR, specifically \"aggressive selling\", \"misleading statements\", and \"misleading omissions\".\n\nUnder the UK [Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2008/1277/contents) (UTR) regulation 3, specifically 3(3\\) and 3(4\\):\n\n> (3\\) A commercial practice is unfair if\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) it contravenes the requirements of professional diligence; and\n> \n> \n> (b) it materially distorts or is likely to materially distort the economic behaviour of the average consumer with regard to the product.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) A commercial practice is unfair if\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) it is a misleading action under the provisions of regulation 5;\n> \n> \n> (b) it is a misleading omission under the provisions of regulation 6;\n> \n> \n> (c) it is aggressive under the provisions of regulation 7; or\n> \n> \n> (d) it is listed in Schedule 1\\.\n\nUTR regulation 5 provides in relevant part:\n\n> 5\\.\u2014(1\\) A commercial practice is a misleading action if it satisfies the conditions in either paragraph (2\\) or paragraph (3\\).\n> \n> \n> (2\\) A commercial practice satisfies the conditions of this paragraph\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a)if it contains false information and is therefore untruthful in relation to any of the matters in paragraph (4\\) or if it or its overall presentation in any way deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer in relation to any of the matters in that paragraph, even if the information is factually correct; and\n> \n> \n> (b) it causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision he would not have taken otherwise\n\nUTR Regulation 7 on Aggressive commercial practices provides in relevant part:\n\n> 7\\.\u2014(1\\) A commercial practice is aggressive if, in its factual context, taking account of all of its features and circumstances\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) it significantly impairs or is likely significantly to impair the average consumer's freedom of choice or conduct in relation to the product concerned through the use of harassment, coercion or undue influence; and\n> \n> \n> (b) it thereby causes or is likely to cause him to take a transactional decision he would not have taken otherwise.\n> \n> \n> (2\\) In determining whether a commercial practice uses harassment, coercion or undue influence account shall be taken of\u2014\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> (c) the exploitation by the trader of any specific misfortune or circumstance of such gravity as to impair the consumer's judgment, of which the trader is aware, to influence the consumer's decision with regard to the product;\n\nUTR regulation 8 provides in relevant part:\n\n> 8\\.\u2014(1\\) A trader is guilty of an offence if\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a) he knowingly or recklessly engages in a commercial practice which contravenes the requirements of professional diligence under regulation 3(3\\)(a); and\n> \n> \n> (b) the practice materially distorts or is likely to materially distort the economic behaviour of the average consumer with regard to the product under regulation 3(3\\)(b).\n\nUTR schedule 1(12\\) describes as unfair:\n\n> 12. Making a materially inaccurate claim concerning the nature and extent of the risk to the personal security of the consumer or his family if the consumer does not purchase the product.\n\nUTR regulations 9 through 12 make unfair practices, as described in regulations 3 through 7 and schedule 1, offenses punishable by fine or imprisonment.\n\nThese might well apply to the practices alleged in the video linked in the question\n\n### Financial Conduct Authority\n\nA [Guidance](https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/guidance-consultation/gc19-03.pdf) from the UK Financial Conduct Authority is available online.\n\nThis seems to apply more to sales of financial products (e.g. investments) than physical goods such as doors. It is also a draft, not a final regulation. But it more specifically deals with people vulnerable due to metal issues, and might show the trend of regulation on such issues in the UK.\n\n> 2\\.1 In our Approach to Consumers we define a vulnerable consumer as \u2018someone who,\n> due to their personal circumstances, is especially susceptible to detriment, particularly\n> when a firm is not acting with appropriate levels of care\u2019 (as presented in our Occasional\n> Paper 8 on Consumer Vulnerability)\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> 2\\.14 (g) Exposure to mis\\-selling \u2013 vulnerable consumers may be more likely to fall victim to\n> pressure selling, or be provided with the wrong information about potential products or services by staff who do not understand their circumstances. People with mental health problems, for example, are more likely to have mistakenly bought a product on\n> credit and 3 in 4 of those felt pressured into doing so.\n> \n> \n> 2\\.15 We expect the firms we regulate to treat customers, including vulnerable customers, fairly. Our previous work has shown that not all firms treat vulnerable consumers fairly, and those consumers face a significant risk of harm. Vulnerability is, therefore, a key priority for the FCA\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI have not found any UK law or regulation that requires firms or people doing general business to determine if a potential customer suffers from Alzheimer's, dementia, or any similar mental issue. However, taking advantage of people who exhibit symptoms of such problems might be found to be an unfair practice, and so lead to civil or criminal liability",

Under UK regulations, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the salesperson's potential liability?\n\nA) The salesperson has no liability as long as the woman agreed to the purchase, regardless of her mental state.\n\nB) The salesperson is only liable if they had prior knowledge of the woman's diagnosed dementia.\n\nC) The salesperson may be liable under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 for engaging in aggressive or misleading commercial practices.\n\nD) The salesperson is automatically criminally liable for selling to someone who exhibited signs of confusion.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. Under the UK Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (UTR), the salesperson may be liable for engaging in unfair commercial practices, which include aggressive selling, misleading statements, and misleading omissions. The regulations specifically address the exploitation of consumers' circumstances that may impair their judgment. While there's no general rule requiring sellers to determine a buyer's mental condition, taking advantage of apparent vulnerability could be considered an unfair practice. Options A and B are incorrect because they don't account for the protections provided by the UTR. Option D is too extreme, as automatic criminal liability isn't established merely by selling to someone who seems confused; the practice must be proven to be unfair under the regulations."

What can I legally do ? (I do not know the VIN or plate number)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I assume you mean that your father died, then one of your siblings just acted unilaterally. The specific details are governed by the laws of your state, but every state has provisions for \"intestate succession\" i.e. when someone does not have a will. In every state, somebody would have to petition the court to make them be \"in charge\", and then they have to follow the law in disposing of the estate. First you have to settle up any debts, then you can divide the remainder between the legal beneficiaries. Let's say that that means \"the 6 sisters\".\n\nThe person in charge gets to implement the law, so could give the youngest sister the truck as (part of) her share. Let's now say that the administrator\\-sister did not do this: she has a duty to protect the interests of all the beneficiaries. That would mean \"subtract that amount from what sister 6 gets\", and does not necessarily mean \"and file a criminal complaint against sister 6\". When all is said and done, if you don't get your fair share, you would have a civil case against sisters 1 and 6, so you could sue to get the money back. There are probably procedures in your state whereby all beneficiaries have to sign off on the disposition of the estate, though the court probably does not affirmatively track whether the paperwork has been filed and go after the person in charge. So you may have to hire a lawyer to get anywhere.\n\nThe police / DMV might be interested in document forgery.",

In cases of intestate succession, someone must petition the court to be appointed as the administrator. This person will then have the legal authority to manage the estate, including dealing with assets like the truck, settling debts, and ensuring proper distribution among beneficiaries.\n\nD) While the DMV might be interested in document forgery, this action doesn't address the broader issue of estate administration and might not be the most effective first step in resolving the overall situation.\n\nBy appointing an official administrator, the court ensures that the estate is handled according to state laws, protecting the interests of all beneficiaries and providing a legal framework to address issues like the improperly sold truck."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For a particular niche in demand but broad in utility industry, I am both a consumer and producer that participates internationally. Within segments of the participants, there are public informal concerns that the elimination of a price floor policy would lead to market failure through the unregulated undercutting of competition that would lead to lower quality products for consumers and an unprecedented drop in the number of competitors. For more sophisticated alternatives, as citizens of a country where free speech is protected, it seems like the people involved should have the right to publicly discuss how a policy would impact their lives and what could be proposed in place of it. However, such discussions would also inevitably include other independent business owners. Because of that, one should keep in mind that it is also strictly illegal for people who own or manage businesses in the same industry to decide or discuss what prices to set for the industry, which makes sense for the purposes of preventing a monopoly or oligopoly.\n\nBut, considering that such discussions wouldn't be solely to the benefit of the parties who would discuss such matters, but rather to the health of the entire market for any and all current and future participants, it seems unreasonable that participants who happen to be competitors wouldn't have any way to publicly voice the effects and alternatives of policies without it being considered collusion. \n\nAre there any laws detailing what the limits are in this context? Are there referable precedents for what is allowed and not allowed within the context of maintaining market competition? From what I gather, there is a form of tacit collusion if it would be called that which seems permissible, but I have never had any particular desire for this kind of discussion until recently, so I don't have much experience in knowing how I establish what is legal and what isn't. I am looking for laws that can illustrate details and limits to these discussions to make there are no infringements before proceeding with a quantitative analysis. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under US law, referring to the rather broad range of anti\\-trust legislation, regulation and case law, the most important issue is whether there is a *conspiracy*. A public discussion of some policy question is clearly not a conspiracy (even if only certain individuals are allowed to speak at the forum). So it is actually not illegal for executives to discuss their product. It would be illegal to engage in a a conspiracy to fix, raise, maintain or stabilize prices. To quote from the instructions from an antitrust case in the 9th Circuit, the case of Best Buy v. Toshiba, HannStar:\n\n> Under the federal Sherman Act, it is illegal for competitors,\n>  regardless of their size or amount of sales, to agree on the prices to\n>  be charged for their competing products. An agreement between\n>  competing firms can violate this rule even if there is not an\n>  agreement on the exact price to be charged. For example, it is illegal\n>  for competing companies to agree on maximum or minimum prices, a range\n>  within which prices will fall, a formula to set prices, or a component\n>  of prices, such as a shipping charge or an interest rate. It is also\n>  illegal for competitors to agree on a plan or scheme that will tend to\n>  stabilize prices.\n\nInterestingly, there was no instruction as to what constitutes a conspiracy: but, ordinarily, it means that means to agree in secret to do an illegal thing.",

The key factor is that it's a public forum and not a secret agreement.\nC) Agreeing on a component of pricing, such as a shipping charge, is specifically mentioned as illegal in the given information.\nD) This scenario involves competitors agreeing on a formula to set prices, which is explicitly stated as illegal in the provided legal instructions.\n\nOption B represents a public discussion of policy, which is protected speech and does not constitute a conspiracy to fix prices or limit competition.

While waiting for the SSN, the employer can use a letter from the SSA stating that the individual has applied for a number, along with immigration documents proving work authorization. This allows F to start teaching as scheduled without violating any regulations. Option A is incorrect as it's not necessary to wait for the SSN.

But, this simply consists of making a report to law enforcement about an incident and asking that the prosecutor either directly, or indirectly through a request directed to the law enforcement officer to whom a report is made, to pursue criminal charges in the case.\n\nBut, this request has no binding or legal effect, even though many law enforcement agencies and prosecutors offices have a formal or informal unwritten policy of honoring a crime reporting victim's wishes whenever possible. In the United States, a prosecutor can commence a criminal case against someone without consulting a victim of a crime, or over the objections of the victim of the crime, and can even (and sometimes does) incarcerate the victim of the crime to force the victim to testify against a criminal defendant (this most often happens in cases of statutory rape, domestic violence and cases involving organized crime or gangs).\n\nLikewise, a prosecutor (in the United States) can choose to decline to prosecute a criminal case despite irrefutable evidence tied up with a bow and the pleas of the victim and lots of other members of the general public.\n\n(Not all countries are like this. For example, in Germany, some crimes can only be prosecuted with the victim's consent, and within reason a prosecutor is required to prosecute every case in which there is clear evidence that a crime was committed and the victim's consent, if necessary, is present. While Germany is something of an extreme case, it is much closer to the norm than the U.S. is in countries that do not have a common law legal tradition, while the U.S., while an extreme case, is closer to the norm of countries in the common law tradition of British law.)\n\nA crime victim's wishes aren't entirely irrelevant in practice. Many states have a \"victim's bill of rights\" that requires a prosecutor to confer with a victim when possible over whether a criminal case will be commenced against a defendant, and in practice, many prosecutors in ordinary type cases come to think of the victims of crimes, rather than \"the People\" as their client, even though that isn't technically correct from a legal perspective.\n\nMost of the time, a crime victim's wishes will be respected by prosecutors whether conveyed directly to a prosecutor, or indirectly through a law enforcement officer. But, nothing requires either a law enforcement officer or a prosecutor to do so.\n\nLaw enforcement officers in some ways have even more discretion than prosecutors do and simply don't pass on information about myriad crimes that they have knowledge of and could prove, every day. But, prosecutors can choose to disagree with a law enforcement officer's exercise of discretion when they do know about an incident, either by declining to prosecute a crime, or by prosecuting a crime that law enforcement officers didn't want to prosecute. And, law enforcement officers as a matter of practical reality can be forced by prosecutors to execute search warrants and arrest warrants.\n\nAlso, it is true that when neither law enforcement or prosecutors know a crime has been committed that they can't prosecute it, and usually, the way that they learn of a crime is that a crime victim reports the crime to law enforcement. The decision to report or not report a crime not known to law enforcement is, in practice, what \"pressing charges\" or \"not pressing charges\" usually means and this does, in practice, constitute a veto power over further criminal proceedings arising from an incident, even though the language used implies a more formal step in a legal process than it does.\n\nExceptions To The General Rule\n==============================\n\nN.B. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there are a few exceptions to the general rule.\n\nA handful of U.S. states, so far as I know, all on the East Coast (and also England and South Africa), allow individuals who are crime victims to directly commence the prosecution of minor crimes in a court of law without the intervention of law enforcement or a prosecutor, or grand jury, often without an attorney. Usually, if this is done, the prosecuting attorney's office can take over the case from the private individual litigant if they choose to do so. A discussion of the historical practice with case citations can be found [here](https://www.insurancefraud.org/role-of-victims.htm).\n\nIn the roughly half of U.S. states and in the federal system, where felony criminal charges must be brought via a grand jury indictment before they can be tried, a so called \"[runaway grand jury](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2005/09/what-s-a-runaway-grand-jury.html)\" can bring criminal charges that the prosecutor has a duty to make a good faith effort to prosecute, without the request of the prosecutor convening the grand jury.\n\nFor example, [in a recent Alabama case](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/us/alabama-pregnant-woman-shot-in-stomach-manslaughter-indictment-trnd/index.html), prosecutors went to a grand jury seeking felony charges against someone who shot a pregnant woman, and the grand jury decided to indict the woman who was shot for manslaughter on the theory that she caused the death of her unborn child by starting a fight that led to the shooting. The prosecutor's office once it had control of the case, and had observed the public outrage over the decision, then dismissed those charges.\n\nThere are a few states where a crime victim who is dissatisfied with a prosecutor or law enforcement officer's exercise of discretion can apply to a court to have a disinterested and uninvolved attorney appointed as a [special prosecutor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_prosecutor) to review the facts of an alleged crime and decide independently regarding whether criminal charges should be pressed in a case where law enforcement and the prosecutor's office declined to do so. This is most frequently invoked when the alleged perpetrator of the crime is connected to law enforcement or the prosecutor's office.\n\nAlso, just become a prosecutor declines to bring a criminal case despite a crime victim's desire to \"press charges\", this doesn't mean that the victim can't sue the person who committed the crime for money damages (including punitive damages in many cases) from the same conduct that constituted the crime. In big dollar cases involving fraud or theft from a small number of affluent victims (a kind of case I frequently handle in my law practice), this happens all the time.",

In the U.S. legal system, \"pressing charges\" is not a formal legal process that gives victims direct control over criminal proceedings. Instead, it typically refers to a victim reporting a crime to law enforcement and expressing their desire for prosecution. However, the ultimate decision to file criminal charges rests with the prosecutor, who can choose to pursue or decline cases regardless of the victim's wishes. Prosecutors can even file charges without a victim's consent or against their wishes in some cases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because victims do not have the legal authority to directly initiate criminal proceedings in most jurisdictions, with only a few exceptions for minor crimes in some states.\n\nOption B is incorrect because law enforcement officers have discretion in how they handle reported crimes and are not obligated to pursue charges based solely on a victim's request.\n\nOption C is incorrect because prosecutors do not need a victim's consent to file charges. While many jurisdictions have laws requiring prosecutors to consult with victims, the final decision remains with the prosecutor."

All that is required is an agreement by both parties which presumably was made in this case. Obviously the exact wording would affect this and that's a matter for either Paypal but it seems that:\n\n* You agreed to produce the materials in exchange for money\n* You agreed as part of this to give exclusive rights to use the materials to the buyer, at least until he chose to publish it\n* The buyer changed their mind and was refunded the work that had not been done.\n* At this point, it still appears you had an agreement that he would have the rights to publish the work. You reneged on this.\n\nThe reason people use services with buyer/seller protection is to avoid having to go to court in situations like this. Your best bet is to submit all relevant details to PayPal and hope they decide in your favour. Unfortunately, PayPal is notorious for siding with buyers who are in the wrong.\n\nIf they don't, legal action is an option. You wouldn't be suing them for the \"false\" refund request, it would be for non\\-payment for the work in question. This might be cost prohibitive depending on how much was supposed to be paid and potentially impossible if you're in different countries.\n\n> He did send me a final email threatening me that he'll be watching me.\n\nThis does not change anything in terms of payment obligations.

The copyright holder. Nobody else. Nobody else can sue you for copyright violation or anything else. \n\nAs it seems that your company is the sole copyright holder, nobody can sue you but yourself. And as long as you don't sue yourself, you're just fine. (And as Dale says quite correctly, suing yourself wouldn't be just stupid, it could also be quite difficult or impossible).\n\nPS Suggesting features or finding bugs doesn't create a copyright. It could be argued that even fixing bugs doesn't create copyright.\n\nPS The license is completely irrelevant to this. The only thing that the GPL license does is saying who commits copyright infringement if they use the code, and who doesn't. As the sole copyright holder you cannot possibly infringe on your own copyright. And whoever is threatening you, as non\\-copyright holder they have no standing to sue you and will be laughed out of court. Even if I did illegally copy your software, that person who is not the copyright holder would have no standing to sue me, only you as the copyright holder would. So the case is double ridiculous: They have no standing to sue, and you have the copyright and would win even if they had standing. \n\nI'll just repeat that: Anyone who isn't the copyright holder will be laughed out of court if they sue you. The judge won't even look at the license. The judge will ask them: Are you the copyright holder? If they answer \"No\" or \"No, but...\" the judge sends them packing. \n\nIf someone *threatens* to sue you, tell them to sue you, and laugh at them. If someone sues you, get a lawyer, and the lawyer will laugh at them.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company has developed a product with two versions: a GPL-licensed subset and a commercial version with additional features. Someone is claiming the company can't commercialize their product because it's a derivation of GPL software. Based on the information provided, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal situation?\n\nA) The company is in violation of GPL and must cease commercialization immediately.\nB) Anyone can sue the company for GPL violation, regardless of copyright ownership.\nC) Only the copyright holder can sue for copyright infringement, which in this case is the company itself.\nD) The company must release all versions of their software under GPL to avoid legal issues.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The key point in this scenario is that the company is the sole author and copyright holder of the software. As stated in the documentation, only the copyright holder can sue for copyright infringement. Since the company owns the copyright, they cannot infringe upon their own copyright. The GPL license doesn't change this fundamental aspect of copyright law. Anyone who is not the copyright holder has no legal standing to sue the company for copyright infringement, even if they believe the GPL is being violated. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that only the copyright holder (the company itself) could theoretically sue for infringement, which is practically and legally nonsensical."

Perhaps there is a legal reason for such language and it should stay?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There is no automatic translation of micro\\-snippets of legalese into plain English, and optimal best re\\-phrasing would have to take into consideration the entire sentence and intent of the statement / clause. This particular snippet is typically used to mean \"Except as\", so you *could* just make that revision. The problem is that this is probably bad drafting even from the perspective of ponderous legalese, since the \"Save as\" exception needs to be paired with a contrasting qualifier like *otherwise, elsewhere, expressely*. Here is a sample translation from legalese to ordinary English.\n\nOriginal: \"Save as otherwise provided in this Constitution, meetings of the executive officers shall be exclusively set by the chairman of the board\". Plain English: \"The chairman of the board may call meetings of the executive officers. Section X Subsection 1 and Section XII Subsection 4 specify the only other conditions for a meeting of the executive officers\". Note that you don't have to wonder where \"as otherwise provided\" is spelled out.",

Eliminates the archaic \"Save as\" phrasing\n2. Directly references specific sections where exceptions or additional provisions are outlined\n3. Removes any ambiguity about where to find the relevant information\n4.

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Hopefully someone here can shed some light on this matter for me. Long story short, I entered into a contract with a general contractor for the construction of my new home. I have been moved into the home but there are multiple problems with the construction. These defects have been verified by third party inspectors. Despite the third party reports, my general contractor refuses to fix the problems.\n\nMy contract states that any disputes must go to binding arbitration through the AAA. This can be an expensive process and it's my understanding that I am unable to recover my legal costs in a judgement. \n\nI was reviewing the contract and doing some research on the contractor and came across the following:\n\n* The general contractor has an LLC. Let's say his legal business name is Smith Homes, LLC.\n* He has also registered a fictitious, or DBA, name with the state called Smith Homes.\n* My construction contract has his business logo in the top left corner. The logo only states the DBA name, Smith Homes.\n* In the top right corner of the contract it does list his state registration number.\n* The contract states the following: \"This contract made on 5th day of March 2018, by and between John Doe (my name) hereinafter called the owner and Smith Homes hereinafter called the contractor.\n* The signature line on the bottom simply states \"Contractor\" and then a place for the general contractor to sign.\n* Nowhere on the contract does it list the full legal name of the contractors business, Smith Homes, LLC.\n\nFrom my research, the DBA name can enter a contract if it is noted that it is a DBA of the legal company name when the parties are introduced at the beginning of the contract. You might write, for example, \"Smith Homes, LLC, d/b/a Smith Homes.\" \n\nWith all of that said, is this contract enforceable since the legal name of the contractor's business was not stated in the contract? Also, since the contractor signed his name at the bottom of the document, could he be personally liable in a lawsuit?\n\nThank you all in advance!\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The contract is enforceable\n---------------------------\n\nNo one is in any doubt that the parties to the contract are you and Smith Homes and everyone knows that Smith Homes means Smith Homes LLC. The written document is only evidence of the contract, the contract is the entire commercial relationship.\n\nContracts are not invalid because they have typos or minor irregularities\\- otherwise virtually no written one would be. The law can be very pragmatic sometimes.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner enters into a contract with a general contractor for home construction. The contract is signed under the contractor's DBA name \"Smith Homes\" instead of the full legal name \"Smith Homes, LLC\". After construction, there are defects, and the homeowner considers legal action. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the enforceability of the contract and potential liability?\n\nA) The contract is unenforceable due to the missing LLC designation, and the contractor cannot be held liable.\n\nB) The contract is enforceable, but only against the individual contractor personally, not the LLC.\n\nC) The contract is unenforceable, but the contractor can still be sued personally for negligence.\n\nD) The contract is enforceable against the LLC, despite the missing designation, as the intent of the parties is clear.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The contract is enforceable against Smith Homes LLC, even though the full legal name with the LLC designation was not used. The law takes a pragmatic approach, recognizing that minor irregularities or omissions do not invalidate a contract when the parties' intent is clear. In this case, the use of the registered DBA name \"Smith Homes\" on the contract, along with the contractor's registration number, sufficiently identifies the contracting entity as Smith Homes LLC. The courts would likely find that both parties understood they were entering into an agreement with the LLC, not the individual contractor personally. Therefore, the contract remains valid and enforceable against the LLC."
