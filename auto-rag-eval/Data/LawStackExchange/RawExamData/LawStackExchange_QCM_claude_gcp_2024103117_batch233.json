For example, Colorado can impose state income taxes on income earned by a Texas baseball player while playing at a stadium in Denver.\n\nThe lack of a salary or employee status shouldn't change the fact that the income received by the company from performance of services in the U.S. is effectively connected with the United States.

I've seen books like the one linked below which are guides to an existing product that don't seem to come with any sort of official seal of approval. I'm wondering if these are just sitting ducks in a legal grey area, or if these are protected by fair use or some other legal defense.\n\n[Here](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B08LCZS49M) is an example of what I'm talking about.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two main kinds of Intellectual property (IP) that might be relevant in writing such a guide: Trademark and Copyright.\n\nTrademark Protection\n====================\n\nA Trademark protects against the use of an identifying word, phrase, design, logo or symbol in the course of advertising or trade by someone who is not the trademark holder without permission from the holder. Specifically, one may **not** use a trademark to make it appear that goods or services are produced, authorized, or endorsed by the trademark holder. One may not use or imitate a trademark in such a way as to confuse consumers or potential consumers about the source of a product or service. If, for example, you use an apple logo on a computer product. and you are not Apple Inc, nor have permission from them, you may well have committed infringement. Infringers may be sued, and significant damages recovered.\n\nThere are, however, some key limits to trademark protection.\n\nNominative use\n--------------\n\n**[Nominative use](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42273/how-are-programming-books-written-if-language-names-are-trademarked/42289#42289)**, also known as \"nominative fair use\" in the US, is the use of a trademark to identify the product or service being referred to. It is not an infringement to use a trademark to refer to another's goods or services, provided that consumer confusion does not occur.\n\nSpecifically, [15 U.S.C. 1125 (Section 43 of the Lanham Act)](https://www.bitlaw.com/source/15usc/1125.html) (Paragraph (c)(3\\)) provides that the following are *not*\\* infringements:\n\n> (A) Any fair use, including a nominative or descriptive fair use, or facilitation of such fair use, of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the person's own goods or services, including \u2026\n> \n> \n> \n> > (i) advertising or promotion that permits consumers to compare goods or services; or (ii) identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner. (B) All forms of news reporting and news commentary. (C) Any noncommercial use of a mark.\n\nIn the US court case [*New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Pub., Inc.*, 971 F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1992\\)](https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/newkids.htm) the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that\n\n> a commercial user is entitled to a nominative fair use defense provided he meets the following three requirements: First, the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; second, only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; \\[FN7] and third, the user must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.\n\nThe footnote (\\#7\\) says:\n\n> Thus, a soft drink competitor would be entitled to compare its product to Coca\\-Cola or Coke, but would not be entitled to use Coca\\-Cola's distinctive lettering.\n\nThus the general rule that [Logos don't constitute nominative use](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46531/why-cant-logos-of-companies-be-used-by-referring-to-nominative-fair-use). This limitation on nominative use may be different outside the US.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nA specific form of nominative use is using the trademarked name of a product to show that the product being advertised or sold is compatible with the referenced product.\n\n> WonderBatteries can be used with BrandX tools.\n\nSuch a statement may be made without permission of the trademark holder on \"BrandX\".\n\n### Comparative advertising\n\nA claim such as:\n\n> BrandA provides a better user interface than BrandX.\n\nMay be made while marketing BrandA and is not an infringement of the trademark on \"BrandX\", provided that it is made clear that BrandA is not supported or endorsed by BrandX.\n\nUse Not in Trade\n----------------\n\nA publication, such as a user's guide, or a third\\-party (independent) review, which is not selling or advertising a product, may use trademarks to refer to the products that they represent without infringing those marks, because trademarks only protect against the use of the marks \"in trade\". This is rather like nominative use, but is broader. If the person using the mark is not selling or advertising anything, there is no protection at all, and graphic marks may be used as well as mere names. So a Book \"All about Windows 10\" could only be advertised with the name \"Windows 10\", but the book itself could make use of the windows or Microsoft logos, provided that the book is not itself advertising any product or service.\n\nUS First Amendment limitations on Protection\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIn *Matal v. Tam*, The IS Supreme Court ruled that trademark protection, as a restriction on speech and writing, is limited by the US First Amendment. This means that many traditional \"dilution\" and \"tarnishment\" actions will no longer stand up under US law. See sources cited in [What is trademark tarnishment or dilution under US law?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39072/what-is-trademark-tarnishment-or-dilution-under-us-law). Such limits apply only under US law.\n\nCopyright Protection\n====================\n\nThe author of a guidebook must also be concerned with copyright protection. Short phrases, such as titles of books, and the names and slogans of products, are not protected by copyright at all.\n\nPassages of significant length, however, are generally subject to copyright protection. Facts and ideas are not protected, but the language used to express facts and ideas often is protected. Unless permission has been secured, an author may not copy extensively from a source, nor closely paraphrase the source. The author must rewrite in original language, although the ideas my be taken from a source or sources.\n\nFair Use or Fair Dealing\n------------------------\n\nLimited quotations, which should normally be clearly marked as quotations, and clearly attributed to their authors, may be used without permission under the concepts of **Fair Use** (in the US) or **Fair dealing** (in several Commonwealth and European countries). The exact scope of these exceptions to copyright protection is different in different countries, and is highly fact\\-based, so that there is no clear formula which will mark out legitimate fair use from infringement. Short quotes, clearly attributed, which would not substitute for the source nor harm the market for the source are likely to be considered as fair use or fair dealing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: An author is writing a guidebook about using Microsoft Windows 10.

I was arrested for \"evading arrest\" and after the police car that I had been put in left my house, the sheriffs had my car towed. CAN THEY DO THAT?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming, pending information about the jurisdiction, that this happened in the US, the answer is it depends. As described in Justia's [Vehicular Searches](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-04/16-vehicular-searches.html) article and Wikipedia's [Motor vehicle exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_exception) article, Under US law police can search a motor vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause. This doctrine was first stated by the US Supreme Court in [*Carroll v. United States* 267 U.S. 132 (1925\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_v._United_States) and later modified or repeated in *Husty v. United States*, 282 U.S. 694 (1931\\); *Scher v. United States*, 305 U.S. 251 (1938\\); *Brinegar v. United States*, 338 U.S. 160 (1949\\). All of these cases involved contraband, but in *Chambers v. Maroney*, 399 U.S. 42 (1970\\), the Court broadened the rule to evidentiary searches. See also *Coolidge v. New Hampshire*, 403 U.S. 443, 458\u201364 (1971\\)\n\nIn *Preston v. United States*, 376 U.S. 364 (1964\\) the Court ruled that the search must be reasonably contemporaneous with the stop, so that it was not permissible to remove the vehicle to the station house for a warrant\\-less search at the convenience of the police. \n\nSubsequent cases have widened the scope of the exception, although the probable cause requirement has remained, and stops must have at least \"articulable and reasonable suspicion\". In the case of an ordinary traffic stop, the police may conduct a *Terry*\\-type search, based on \"articulable suspicion\". However, if the police arrest the driver, that is grounds to search the car under *Atwater v. City of Lago Vista*, 532 U.S. 318 (2001\\) and *New York v. Belton*, 453 U.S. 454 (1981\\)\n\nUnder *Michigan v. Thomas*, 458 U.S.(and *Chambers v. Maroney*, 399 U.S. 42 (1970\\); *Texas v. White*, 423 U.S. 67 (1975\\); *United States v. Ross*, 456 U.S. 798, 807 note 9 (1982\\).) police may remove the car for a search elsewhere if they have probable cause to believe that there is contraband (such as alcohol, drugs, or weapons) in the car.\n\nThus the arrest justified a search, as described in the question. It might not have justified the tow if there was not probable cause to suspect contraband. But that depends on the detailed facts, and judging those is beyond the scope of this site.\n\nIn [*Collins vs Virginia* (2018\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_v._Virginia) the Court ruled that a warrant\\-less search of a car parked on the owner's property and within the curtilage was not justified. (The \"curtilage\" is the area near the house which gets additional Fourth Amendment protection, almost as if it were inside the house). However, in that case no arrest was made at the time of the search, and the search was based on an officer recalling the car having been used to elude arrest some *two months* previously, not just a few minutes before, so that case may not apply in the situation described above.\n\nIf there was no probable cause, any evidence found might be subject to suppression, and a suit for damages under sec 1983 might be brought against the officers and the police force, but that would depend on the specific facts, and would in practice require a lawyer skilled in such matters.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A driver is followed by a police vehicle and, fearing it might be an impersonator, speeds home.

However, this question does not aim to find out whether any laws were broken in that particular incident.

A guy in his 30s\\-40s driving a car stops by a 16\\-year\\-old girl and asks for directions;\n2. He then asks her inappropriate questions;\n3.

The police wanting to speak to someone **does not mean that they think the person has committed a crime**.\n\n### What do I think of this incident?\n\nThe polices response, is good. Exactly what they should do. I would hope that the police would try to find an older individual who is driving around town and asking inappropriate questions/making what sounds like sexual suggestions to young teenage girls... Regardless of said teenage girls being over the age of \"consent\". Sounds like this individual is a bit of a pedophile... And I do not use that term lightly.

I will only address the slight differences.\n\n> I walked up to the cashier and asked was this a veggie burger? He said\n>  no. I stated that it was I ordered. He said he would make a new\n>  burger.\n\nA claim of *fraud* would fail in court because you will be unable to prove that the restaurant *knowingly misrepresented* to you (that is, *despite knowing it to be false*) that it was serving you a veggie burger with the *intention that you would rely* on that representation. Two hints indicate that the restaurant didn't act with that fraudulent intention: \n\n(1\\) When asked, the cashier told you that yours was not a veggie burger; and \n\n(2\\) he promptly indicated his intention to mend their mistake by telling you that he would make a new burger.\n\nA claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) would also fail. You wrote:\n\n> After we left, my daughter who was still in the restaurant stated that\n>  they started laughing at my husband and I.\n\nThe fact that the employees waited till you and your husband left reflects that they refrained from intentionally inflicting any emotional distress. A significant factor that will favor them is the fact that they stopped laughing once your daughter asked them why they were laughing:\n\n> My daughter asked why were they laughing, when her parents were in the\n>  car sick from eating meat. They stopped laughing.\n\nEven if you genuinely feel disrespected by their subsequent laughter, there are no legal remedies because their laughter insofar an expression was neither obscene nor disparaging nor threatening/harassing. Laughter can be an understandable way, and possibly a psychological need, to relieve the stress from a situation like this in a context of hours of hard work in exchange for low wages with which to pay their bills.\n\nMoreover, the same fact \\[that they waited till you and your husband left] contradicts the allegation that they laughed \"*at*\" you. Strictly speaking, the restaurant could viably sue your daughter for defamation if the restaurant incurs any losses (including court\\-ordered sanctions against the restaurant) as a result of falsely attributing to it the hostile or belittling behavior implied by the particle *at*.

According to the documentation, if an employee refuses to provide an updated passport, the company may face legal consequences. Many countries have laws requiring companies to ensure and provide evidence that their employees have the right to work there. Without a valid passport on file, the company might not have sufficient legal documentation to continue employing the individual. This puts the company in a difficult position where they must choose between potentially breaking the law, risking fines, or terminating the employee's contract.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the employee themselves wouldn't face legal charges for simply refusing to provide a passport to their employer. Option B is too extreme and immediate; while termination is a possibility, it's not necessarily an immediate or required action.

Some things I've found:\n\n* **Hebrew bible text**: There is a **public domain** codex for the Hebrew bible available online in text format.\n* **Hebrew bible dictionary**: There is the \"Strong's Hebrew Dictionary\" which is **public domain** as well, made in the late 1800's.\n* **Interlinear translation**: I found the [Berean Bible](http://berean.bible/terms.htm), which is not public domain, that link takes you to the license which says you can use it in software but can't sell it directly basically, as long as you attribute them. Interlinear translation are basically the literal meaning of each Hebrew word in English.\n* **Part of speech mapping**: The [OpenScriptures](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb/blob/master/LICENSE.md) project has mapped the Hebrew bible text with the Hebrew dictionary, which I think you can do pretty easily automatically given the two data sources are public domain and online in text format usable by software. But they put a [CC v4 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) on it (attribution but commercial use is okay).\n* **Combining it all**: The [OpenHebrewBible](https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible) project combines all of that stuff into one package, and puts a [CC v4 non\\-commercial license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) on it, partly because the interlinear translation says something to that degree in the free rendition of their product.\n\nNow, the first part of my question is, say I want to create the same thing as \"Combining it all\", but I also want to release it as **public domain**. I can use the public domain Hebrew bible text and dictionary to get started, mapping words to definitions basically. But I can't use the interlinear translation. But **I could hire some people** to make an interlinear translation, and it would probably end up being pretty close to the Berean Bible, because interlinear translations mean like 1\\-3 word translations per word, and so you are going to have a lot of same translations. Then we have the part of speech mapping which I could hire people to help write for each word.\n\nSo say I hired people to make an interlinear version, and part of speech tagging, and I released it as public domain. How is that any different than just using the \"Combining it all\" project, and releasing *that* as public domain? I mean, just the data (not any software related to it).\n\nSecond part of the question is, isn't all this type of stuff marked as \"generic data\" in legal terms, stuff which is \"public common knowledge\" and so isn't copyrightable? For example, the part of speech tagging is common knowledge to anyone who speaks Hebrew. And the interlinear English translation is *pretty much* common knowledge to any translator, although you could have translators come up with different end results.\n\nSo I don't understand how I can safely/effectively go about creating a public domain version of the annotated bible written in Hebrew, given this data is common knowledge and yet there are projects which have put licenses on various aspects of this common knowledge. What are the laws or high\\-level factors to consider in such a dilemma?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Limiting this to the legal question, it is actually extremely simple. The Hebrew Bible is in the public domain, end of story. Therefore you can freely create a derivative work, a translation to English if you like, based on that original text. You may have to use some copyrighted aids, such as a dictionary, but that's okay, because \"using a dictionary\" is not copyright infringement. You may want to use some copyrighted software to format the result, but again using software is not itself copyright infringement. It would be infringement to lift someone else's protected English translation, but it would not be infringement to consult competing translations as a means of better understanding the original text.\n\nIt is true that in the case of a translation from language to language, there is going to be a substantial similarity in translations to a particular language. This is especially true when dealing with a text that has been independently translated to English hundreds of times.

The moment you are placed under arrest you are handcuffed and detained. Not only for officer safety, but also for that very reason (so you cannot destroy or secret away evidence).\n\n> The officer asks me to produce the evidence, and I refuse. Consider several scenarios:\n> \n> \n> 1. Do I have grounds to refuse to produce it because it would be incriminating; I am under no obligation to incriminate myself?\n\n**No.** If the officer is searching you pursuant to arrest (and under your scenario he need not get a warrant as there is evidence in plain view, although he could begin cursory search and have a warrant executed and brought over within an hour, just to be safe). Regardless, you are not consulted as to whether it's OK or not, hence no right to refuse. Further, your 5th amendment right against self incrimination gives you the right not to answer, but you can expect your dwelling to be completely destroyed if they know there is evidence there. Since we are supposing: suppose you actually did get away from the police, before they cuffed you, and were able to get to evidence before being searched and without getting shot (unlikely). They would tear your place apart and would find it.\n\n> 2. The officer, perhaps not knowing the risk involved, attempts to retrieve the evidence and fails, causing the evidence to be destroyed. If the officer can show that I knowingly put the (alleged) evidence in such a situation and allowed him to destroy it, what might the repercussions be after the fact?\n\nYou would be charged with destruction of evidence, on top of whatever you were originally arrested for that they saw in plain view. Further, forensics would almost certainly find some trace of what you were hiding. This scenario is highly unlikely.\n\n> 3. The officer, perhaps understanding the risk, goes to a court and asks them to compel my cooperation. Could this happen and, if so, how?\n\nThe officer, if he knew it, would just find a way to get at it that wouldn't allow for its destruction. They can literally take out pieces of walls, pipes, whatever. They have the resources to get to anything. If the search would become unreasonable lest the Court knew of your dastardly plan, they would just expand the scope of the search via the warrant.\n\n> 4. Suppose I intend to cooperate but accidentally cause the evidence to be destroyed. What might the repercussions be for me, and who would bear the burden of proof?\n\nSame result. You hid it. You destroyed it. You decided to potentially destroy it when you put it in that place, so the outcome is not different.\n\n> 5. Suppose the device has another function which produces some other items which are not incriminating. Suppose the officer retrieves these instead of the real evidence. Am I under any obligation to tell the officer whether those are the only items to be found, if I am hiding other items, etc.?\n\nYour only obligation if you're being searched is to *be quiet*! You have no obligation to help, nor should you help, with the search of your property. But this is not something out of James Bond or Batman. What? Your secret device turns cocaine into sugar? Seriously, this wouldn't happen. If the police thought evidence to be in a place, they wouldn't stop looking because they found something innocuous.

As I understood it, a single senator can call the Senate to order and then immediately adjourn the session. While there is not a quorum of senators present, a quorum is presumed to exist unless someone makes a quorum call; and so one senator can call the Senate to order and adjourn it so long as they \"don't notice\" that there's nobody there.\n\nWould it be possible for another senator to throw a monkey wrench into the works in the following scenario?\n\n1. After an adjournment of three days, Senator A calls the Senate to order for they assume to be a pro forma session. Senator B is sitting in the back row. No other senators are present.\n2. Senator B immediately raises a point of order: the Senate cannot be called to order without a quorum. This session cannot occur without 51 senators present.\n3.

Everything else pretty much depends on the contract. As an example, on a web page, an exhortation \"Free Shipping!\" is not false advertising when they charge for shipping, because that exhortation doesn't mean \"we always ship everything for free\", it means that free shipping is a possibility. When you look at the details of the contract, it will specify when there is free shipping. Some state might enact a very strict deceptive practices law that prohibits advertisement that says \"Free Shipping\" unless there are no conditions attached to getting free shipping, but that isn't the way it is now.\n\nOnce you actually have an agreement, then the parties can be held to that agreement. Whether you actually have a legal agreement can be a little murky with online sales: you may instead have an invitation to treat. A website is an advertisement, not an offer, so you have to investigate to determine what constitutes an offer and acceptance. Clicking something doesn't necessarily count. Actually paying generally does; entering a credit card does not (was the charge just pending?). An express acceptance counts. This would be the primary legal question \u2013 do you have an actual offer and acceptance (and how would you know)? I presume that there was a step where you had to check a box and click \"submit\", and the check box said that you agree to the terms of sale. There should be something in there that addresses what constitutes an agreement (should be, but might not be).\n\nYou could try suing the company to get a court order requiring them to send the goods for the agreed on price (\"specific performance\", but the courts are unlikely to do that, instead they will order \"compensation\", i.e. a refund. You can read up on Chinese contract law [here](https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/52923/108022/F1916937257/CHN52923%20Eng.pdf), to see how your situation is addressed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: In the context of online purchases from international retailers, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal enforceability of advertised \"free shipping\" offers?\n\nA) Any advertisement of \"free shipping\" on a website is legally binding and must be honored for all purchases, regardless of conditions.\n\nB) \"Free shipping\" advertisements are never legally enforceable and companies can always charge for shipping at their discretion.\n\nC) The enforceability of \"free shipping\" offers depends on the specific terms of the contract formed during the purchase process, not just the advertisement.\n\nD) Customers can always sue for specific performance to force companies to honor advertised \"free shipping\" offers, regardless of contract terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The documentation explains that a \"Free Shipping\" advertisement on a website is not automatically false advertising if shipping is charged, as it may indicate that free shipping is a possibility under certain conditions. The enforceability of such offers depends on the specific terms of the contract formed during the purchase process. The actual agreement between the buyer and seller, typically formed when payment is made and terms are explicitly accepted, determines the legal obligations. Simply seeing an advertisement or entering credit card information doesn't necessarily constitute a binding contract.

The \u201cdata controller\u201d of a processing activity is responsible for GDPR compliance. A hosting service is a processor but not a controller with respect to the hosted websites. A processor becomes GDPR\\-compliant by only processing personal data as instructed by the controller.\n\nMore specifically:\n\n* Controller is whoever participates in determining the purposes and means of processing. There can be more than one data controller for an activity.\n* Controllers can outsource processing activities to a \u201cdata processor\u201d. Per Art 28 GDPR, there must be a contract that requires the processor to only use the data as instructed by the controller, never for the processors' own purposes. The processor's duty is primarily to the controller, not to the data subjects.\n\nThe data processor cannot make decisions about the lawfulness of processing, and cannot respond to data subject requests unless instructed to do so by the controller.\n* Within the scope of such outsourcing, the data processor can determine some non\\-essential means of processing without becoming a controller as well.\n\nThe processor can also prepare a standardized service where a lot of decisions are made up front by the processor. But the client would still be the controller because the client made the decision to use that standardized service with all the features it entails. In this context, a standardized service could e.g. be a hosting contract that was not negotiated individually. This concept of a standardized service does not originate from the GDPR, but was used by the EDPB to explain responsibilities in a cloud computing context.\n\nA hosting provider would still be controller with respect to its own website and activities like billing, but will typically act only as a data processor with respect to the client's websites.\n\nRecommended further reading: [EDPB Guidelines 07/2020 on the concepts of controller and processor in the GDPR (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-072020-concepts-controller-and-processor-gdpr_en)\n\nA lot of services advertise that they are \u201cGDPR compliant\u201d. But data processors have drastically simplified compliance responsibilities.

Even though GoDaddy provides the hosting service, they act as a data processor, not a controller, with respect to the hosted websites. The data controller (the small business) is primarily responsible for GDPR compliance, regardless of their location.

It is an invaluable tool, especially because it allows me to pick the type of court, offence type, and even the age of the defendant. The output would show defendants that have pleaded, or been found, guilty and their subsequent sentence. Unfortunately, this website is only for offences and sentences in the United Kingdom.\n\nAre there any websites similar to [TheLawPages](https://www.thelawpages.com/) for American criminal Law? Preferably, I would like to search by state and perhaps even at the Federal level.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The U.S. has no such website, at least at either the federal or the state level. It is possible that some local courts allow their records to be searched on that basis although I am not aware of any that do so.\n\nProbably the closest database to that in the U.S. accessible to the public is the non\\-governmental non\\-profit organization operated [Transactional Record Access Clearinghouse](https://trac.syr.edu/) for federal criminal justice records (and other federal government records). It has lots of data on federal government matters from a variety of sources but isn't quite as comprehensive or as easy to use as the website described in the question. The problem with that is that the federal courts handle only a small percentage of the criminal cases in the United States, and it is a highly skewed mix of cases (e.g. with lots of immigration cases but few ordinary \"blue collar crime\" cases outside Indian Reservations and federal parks).\n\nThe information necessary to build such a website is largely a matter of public record, but no one has taken on the task of making such a website.\n\nIn part, this is because the task is so daunting. While the federal courts have a comprehensive electronic database called PACER, each state has at least one separate court case data base system, and many states have trial court case databases only at the county level and not at the state level, or have different databases for different kinds of courts. Even in states that do have statewide databases, there are often some courts that aren't included. For example, Colorado's state courts are part of a single statewide database, but its municipal courts each have their own separate court by court databases. Some rural areas in the U.S. still keep trial court records in paper form only.\n\nThe data has been gathered from time to time of important subsets of this kind of data, but it isn't publicly available.\n\nFor example, a media consortia in Florida gathered information to examine the consistency of sentencing and the extent of racial discrimination in sentencing in Florida, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission in the United States gathers such information selectively to make sentencing decisions. Neither of those compilations, however, including making the raw data available to the public.\n\nSimilarly, there is a separate private academic database that tracks case level state general jurisdiction trial court data in 75 of the largest urban counties in the United States (including state law felony cases). But, that database is only available to members of the academic consortium that maintains it (basically, professors at affiliated universities and other professors granted privileges to use it from consortium member professors).\n\nThe Westlaw division of its parent company, and Lexis\\-Nexus collect some trial court level data on U.S. courts, state and federal, on a non\\-comprehensive, basically opportunistic basis, but don't have complete data from any jurisdiction (although Westlaw's federal data basis has a pretty significant share of reasoned federal trial court orders). Both of these services require paid subscriptions.\n\nIn contrast, comprehensive databases of precedent making appellate court decisions at the state and federal level are widely available on both a commercial basis (with better search tools, headnote analysis, and correlations of the data like records of cases citing other cases and statutes), and on a non\\-commercial basis (with just the bare bones text of the cases).

Unlike the UK's TheLawPages, the U.S. does not have a centralized, comprehensive database for criminal cases. This is due to several factors:\n\n1. The federal court system uses PACER, but this only covers federal cases, which are a small percentage of total criminal cases.\n2.

Your steps 3 and 4 are wrong.\n\nBut, a will can not take effect after the death of someone who wrote it until the original Will (or a copy of the Will accompanied by testimony explaining why the original cannot be produced if the Will was not revoked, *see* [Surrogate's Court Procedure Act \u00a7 1407](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/SCP/1407)) is filed with a court with probate jurisdiction (which in New York State is the Surrogate's Court) after the death of the person who wrote it.\n\nThe requirements are set forth at [Estate, Powers and Trusts Law (EPTL) \u00a7 3\\-2\\.1](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EPT/3-2.1).

A will notarized at the time it is executed is sometimes called a \"self\\-proving will\". But notarization is not legally required for the will to be valid in New York State (or for that matter, in any other U.S. state).\n\nA will is not generally filed with the Surrogate's court until after the death of the person who wrote it, and then it is usually filed in the Surrogate's court for the county in which the person who died was domiciled at death. (There are exceptions to the rule about which county the probate case should be filed in that are beyond the scope of this question and answer.)\n\nThere are two main exceptions to the rules cited above:\n\n1. Members of the military, certain civilians attached to deployed military units, and mariners at sea, can make an oral will (called a \"nuncupative will\") to two witnesses, or can make a will entirely in his or her own handwriting (called a \"holographic will\") which is valid for one to three years after returning from that situation depending on the circumstances as set forth in [EPTL Section 3\\-2\\.2](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EPT/3-2.2). The requirements for a holographic will in New York State are more strict than in most other U.S. states.\n2. Secondly, a will which was validly executed in the place where it was executed may often be recognized as valid at the time of death, (even if it wouldn't be validly executed under the law in force in New York State at the time of death), particularly if the person who died wasn't domiciled in New York State at the time when the will was signed, because that person had no good reason to think that New York State law would apply to the execution of the will. This is a \"choice of law\" issue and would be used to apply the law of another state or country where the will was signed and/or where the person who died was domiciled at the time the will was signed, rather than current New York State law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John, a New York resident, created his Last Will and Testament.

The documentation suggests that having the victim's lawyer handle the matter, such as writing a letter to the landlord, is the standard solution to such problems. While there might be jurisdiction-specific solutions or anti-discrimination laws that could help in some cases, these are not universally applicable. Option A is incorrect because there is no universal court order that can prohibit everyone from revealing the person's information. Option B is false because typically only state and local governments are required to accept substitute addresses, not private landlords.

Many biographies are \"unauthorized\", which simply means that the subject, or in some cases the subject's heirs or family, did not cooperate with the biographer. Sometimes this is even considered to be a point in favor of such a work, on the assumption that an \"authorized\" biography would tend to slant or even censor things to meet the approval of the subject or the subject's family.\n\nThere are some restrictions on an unauthorized biography.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the law of defamation. A biography that includes statements that are both false and defamatory about a living subject could be the subject of a winning lawsuit. Damages in such cases can sometimes be sizable. However, the person suing must show false facts in the work. In many cases damage to reputation must also be shown, although there are some categories of statement that are considered defamation *per se*, where injury to reputation is assumed and need not be proved. These include a false statement that a person committed a crime, and a statement that a person was guilty of professional misconduct. It used to be considered defamation per se to allege that a woman had had sex outside of marriage, but I doubt that a court would so hold today.\n\nBeyond that, in the US, if the subject is a public official or public figure, s/he must show *actual malice*, that is that the false statement was made knowing that it was false, or with reckless disregard for its possible falsity. This can be hard to prove.\n\nIn most jurisdictions only the person defamed can sue for defamation. Once that person is dead, no such suit can be brought.\n\nMoreover, in the very rare case where a person's reputation is so bad that a court finds that it can suffer no meaningful further injury for certain allegations, even if these were found to be false, the court may dismiss such a suit. See [*Dykstra v St. Martin's Press* New York Superior Court, New York County, Docket Number 153676](https://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/other-courts/2020/2020-ny-slip-op-31813-u.html) for an example. However this would only be relevant in the very unusual case of a \"libel\\-proof\" plaintiff, and even then if the conduct of the author or publisher was egregious, the court might hold that punitive damages were possible. The defenses of truth, lack of actual malice, and newsworthiness are far more common.\n\nIndeed defamation suits in general are hard to win and expensive to bring.\n\nIn some US states there is available the tort of publication of private facts. This is different from defamation in that it can still be brought when the facts published were true, while truth is a total defense against a defamation suit. However a private facts suit must establish that the facts were in fact private, or at least not widely known, and that they were published in a way that would be grossly offensive to a reasonable person. Facts that are considered of \"legitimate public interest\" or \"newsworthy\" are also not generally protected. Moreover, not every US state allows such suits at all. See *Diaz vs Oakland Tribune, Inc* 188 Cal Rpt 762 (1982\\) for a case in which a Private Facts case was sustained, and the steps taken by the subject to keep a sex transition private were a significant issue in the case. In *Hawkins vs Multimedia inc* 344 SE 2nd 145 (1986\\) a South Carolina court held that a news story identifying a teenage boy by name as the father of an \"illegitimate\" child was not newsworthy and a private facts judgement including punitive damages was upheld.\n\nIn the US, First Amendment protections have been taken to indicate that the courts will not suppress or punish speech or writing without good reason. This makes it harder to win suits over biographies.\n\nThere have been cases of magazine articles about a particular person who is in no way famous but who was considered \"typical\". Such stories have in several cases been upheld against challenges as of \"legitimate public interest\". See *Arrington vs New York Times Company* 434 N.E. 2nd 1319 (1982\\) In that case the objection was to the use of a person's photo on the cover of the *New York Times Magazine* who was not actually mentioned in the story, and who alleged that he was not similar to those who were mentioned.

In the United States, there is no general right for a person to control or approve a biography or account of their life. However, the subject can sue for defamation if the work includes statements that are both false and defamatory. For public figures like famous athletes, they must also prove actual malice, meaning the false statements were made knowing they were false or with reckless disregard for their truth. The other options are incorrect because: A) Truth is a defense against defamation; B) Explicit permission is not required for all private information, especially for public figures; D) Generally, only the person defamed can sue for defamation, not family members, and defamation suits cannot be brought after the subject's death."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60431/paying-material-and-labour-costs-v-full-quote", "docs_id": 60431, "title": "Paying material and labour costs v. full quote", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was given a quote by my contractor (approx. 30K) which included both a labour component (18K) and a material component (12K).

Every city has 3 types of carpet cleaner available.\n\n1. Mr Cheap: Your $160 quote is from Mr Cheap. Mr cheap is a churn and burn operation. He quotes low prices to win work, then has to rush through 4, 5, or even 6, jobs in a day to make any profit. He mostly just goes \"through the motions\" of cleaning. He doesn't go slowly to ensure proper steam injection. he doesn't go back over the wet carpet 3 times to extract left over water to make the carpet dry faster. He doesn't treat different carpets in different ways depending on type and other factors. He might not do stain removal, he might not use the best or any chemicals. He certainly doesn't get lots of repeat business or good online reviews. Lastly, there's a high chance he'll be using a portable machine that comes into the house. These machines are WEAK compared to high powered truck mounted cleaning machines.\n2. Mr Middle: Mr middle can be a good option for many home owners and even more so for tenants. He is charging a around 50% more than mr Cheap. Because of this, he can make the same money in 3\\-4 jobs as the other guy makes in 6 jobs. Because of this, he takes a bit more time and care to do the job properly. He balances service with price and gets most little marks and stains as he goes. He should do the job properly without going to extremes in regards to customer service or fancy extras.\n3. Mr Premium: Your landlord being the owner of the property and the one who cares most is going to call Mr Premium. Mr Premium is amazing if you can afford him. His vans are well branded and in good condition. He lays on the extra special treatment to justify the price. He'll do all sorts of stuff like, pre\\-vacuum before cleaning, do extra treatments on high traffic areas, he will use commercial grade deodorizers to eliminate smells and other mess from pets, kids, and spills. He has a wide range of (sometimes) expensive chemicals to treat and get rid of every kind of stain. He is fully insured, properly trained, and WON'T damage the property by dragging hoses against walls.\n\nSo, as far as the price difference goes, I hope the above is enlightening...\n\nNow, for your specific situation. \n\nThe Dog: as sweet as he is and well trained and not shedding etc... it simply doesn't matter. if the dog has been hanging out on the carpet he has put into it all sorts of doggy oils, doggy sweat and doggy slobber. The second the steam from the cleaner hits the carpet all you're going to smell is WET DOG. The use of special chemicals to break down these organic compounds from the dog is a must if the property is changing hands. You could really ruin the day of someone with dog allergies if this is not done properly.\n\nWhat If...\nWhat if you hire Mr Cheap and he damages the carpet?  \n\nWhat if you hire Mr Cheap, and he does such and average job the landlord is forced to bring in his on guy... now you've paid to clean the carpet twice! (i see this often)\n\nI hope you sort out your situation, armed with this new information perhaps it may be easier to understand the difference in price and why your landlord goes for premium while you go for Mr Cheap... \n\nI think the key for anyone else in this situation is Mr Middle.

We can at least say (somewhat) what the legal situation is, esp. what would constitute a violation of the law. To get to the bottom line, if there is any legal recourse, an aggrieved party would have to sue POTUS, and win the suit (compelling the president to do something different); or, the president could be impeached. \n\n[The War Powers Resolution of 1973](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-87/pdf/STATUTE-87-Pg555.pdf), statutorily encoded in [ch. 33 of Title 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-33) limits the president's authority to engage in military action. First, Congress must be notified within 48 hours of the action, second, armed forces cannot remain more than 60 days (plus 30 days for withdrawal) without a declaration of war, or congressional authorization (such as took place in 2001, and currently exists). In one instance, Clinton continued bombing in Kosovo two weeks beyond the 60 day limit, but the administration maintained that because Congress approved funding for the operation, they had implicitly approved the operation. There was a [lawsuit](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2803714193388437750&hl=en&as_sdt=6&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr) by Congress, but the court ruled that the complainants did not have standing. The court also found that\n\n> Congress certainly could have passed a law forbidding the use of U.S.\n>  forces in the Yugoslav campaign\n\nand indeed there was such a measure, but it was defeated. The opinion continues:\n\n> Congress always retains appropriations authority and could have cut\n>  off funds for the American role in the conflict\n\nand again, that was attempted, but failed. The court found that\n\n> Congress has a broad range of legislative authority it can use to stop\n>  a President's war making, see generally John C. Yoo, The Continuation\n>  of Politics by Other Means: The Original Understanding of War Powers,\n>  84 CAL. L. REV. 167 (1996\\)\n\nso *if* suitable veto\\-proof legislation is passed, then a military action could be stopped (by specifically prohibiting use of US funds for military action). \n\nOr, at least it seems that way. [31 USC 1341](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/31/1341) forbids an officer of the government from making or authorizing expenditures or obligations unless authorized by law. Consequently, when Congress fails to pass a budget, government operations must cease. This is related to Art. 1 Sect 9 Cl. 7 of the Constitution, which says\n\n> No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of\n>  appropriations made by law\n\nThe aforementioned statute does not allow an officer to create an obligation: it does not prohibit an officer from doing a thing, which would ordinarily imply an expenditure or obligation. Notice that while previous federal shutdowns did result in unpaid furloughs to civilian workers, it did not completely close down the military. The [military (accountants)](https://www.dfas.mil/pressroom/govtshutdown.html) explains\n\n> In case of a potential government shutdown, the Department of Defense\n>  has no legal authority to pay any personnel \\- military or civilian \\-\n>  for the days during which the government is shut down...\n>  Military members cannot be paid for duty performed after the\n>  expiration of the current CRA on September 30th. Once a CRA or an\n>  appropriations act is signed into law, normal disbursement of military\n>  pay will resume.\n\n(Congress could of course authorize back pay when it's all sorted out, and they did). If Congress were to specifically prohibit any expenditure of US funds for action against North Korea, that might simply mean that soldiers would be ordered to work without pay.\n\nIt is unquestionably within the power of the president to order soldiers into combat. I don't believe that there has been a case pertaining to the power of the president to compel soldiers to fight if they are not paid, but it is pretty much unimaginable that the courts would hold that the president lacks authority to order soldiers to work without pay.

The law generally operates on the premise that people can understand statutes, regulations and contracts, and that if they don't understand a contract, they won't agree to it. Therefore, if they agreed, they understood: this is a fundamental premise of contract law. However, there are a couple of loopholes, \"unconscionability\" and \"public policy\", which could provide an escape. In the proposed scenario, we would assume that there is a huge difference in bargaining power between the customer and company, that some term is unfair (a highly subjective matter reduced to expressions like \"shocks the conscience\"), and the language of the contract is clearly confusing. \"Public policy\" generally involves a requirement in a contract that is statutorily prohibited: either the required action is itself illegal, or the law has banned any such clauses in a contract (very commonly, residential leases are statutorily prohibited from including clauses waiving statutory protections of rights).\n\nI think that if a contract for some internet thing (e.g. an ISP) had a clause that \"unahitaji kukulipa $1 kwa kila siku unayotumia huduma zetu\" (you must pay $1 for every day you use the service) that this is not a shocking price, so the contract would be enforceable, even if it ought to be a bit confusing.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A tech company creates a user agreement that is intentionally convoluted, including unnecessary cross-references, excessive length, and even a section in Swahili.

The law generally assumes that if people agree to a contract, they understood it. However, there are two main exceptions that could make such a contract unenforceable:\n\n1. Unconscionability: This requires a significant disparity in bargaining power between parties and terms that are extremely unfair.

Although that sounds reasonable, it also seems a bit meaningless to me. How could you ever prove what would or would not have happened in a hypothetical alternate reality?\n\nWhy don't police \"stings\" qualify as entrapment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Consider the the popular mid\\-00s \"To Catch a Predator\" segments on Dateline NBC, which allowed Chris Hansen to interview men caught in pedophile stings to provide better understanding of the mindset behind the people. Most entries into the series will have a very early on walk through of the basic sting operation: A citizen group would set up fake profiles of underage children (normally in their early or pre\\-teens) and would go into local area chat rooms... normally just to talk in public space or just lurk, they would be contacted privately by the suspect in the chat room, and would keep logs as the discussion turned lewd... at some point, the suspect and the decoy would arrange a face to face meeting (and the decoy would often ask for certain distinct gifts such as brand name alcoholic drinks or in some cases when the suspect would offer, that the suspect enter the decoy house naked).\n\nIt's important to note that, prior to even showing up, the lewd conversation with a minor over the internet was a criminal offense... showing up just shows that the criminal was intending to commit a more serious crime and the specified gift requests were further identifying the person didn't happen to be a case of wrong place wrong time. But it's always fun to seen them leave and get tackled and arrested on camera.\n\nThis is a sting and not entrapment and what makes it a sting is that the decoy actors never once initiated contact with the suspect. In every case, the suspect first reached out to the decoy child and made their intentions known. In many longs, the suspect would admit it that they know what they are doing is even illegal but they didn't care... and at least one even references the show to the decoy, which the decoy actor was amused by.\n\nEntrapment would have happened if the decoy actor initiated the conversation with a \"suspect\" and continued on the conversation's topics until the suspect broke the law at which point they were now arrestable. By seeding the idea in the criminal's mind, the police are now actively encouraging the lawlessness, rather than the other way around... The guilty mind existed prior to any knowledge of the suspect by the cop and the crime only occured because the cop told the suspect to commit the crime.\n\nOnce the intent to offend is established by undercover police, however, they can remain \"in character\" in so far as they can appear only to facilitate the crime, not influence it (i.e. they can provide \"explosives\" or bomb making skills to an unsuspecting terrorist in so long as they aren't helping pick the target or encouraging a bomb attack. Or they can make purchases from a drug dealer so long as they aren't selling the drugs for them.). The reason behind this is that the criminal is already committed to the illegal action (bombing something, selling illegal drugs) and that in the event the cops cannot arrest by the time the suspect completes the goal, they at least are preventing the bad thing happening by removing the threat (the bomb won't work... had they not facilitated help, the terrorist would find a legit bomb maker and that's a big problem. SImilarly, had the dealer not sold, that substance would just be sold to someone else. And in the example from the Sting, had the offender not talked to the decoy, they would have found a real child... in fact, there were a few examples where Dateline had repeat offenders, the first being an early segment (at the time they were handing over the evidence after the shooting of the segment wrapped) where the suspect was let go and went back into the same chat room and hit on a second decoy. A later example would have a suspect show up who turned out to have been awaiting trial for appearing on a Dateline sting prior to the current appearance.).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of entrapment and police sting operations, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered entrapment?\n\nA) An undercover officer poses as a drug dealer and sells drugs to a person who approached them asking to buy illegal substances.\n\nB) A police officer, disguised as a civilian, initiates a conversation in an online chat room and gradually persuades someone to engage in illegal activities.\n\nC) Law enforcement creates a fake online profile of an adult and waits for potential criminals to contact them and propose illegal activities.\n\nD) An undercover agent infiltrates a criminal organization and participates in illegal activities to gather evidence, without suggesting new crimes.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) This is not entrapment because the person initiated the illegal activity by approaching the officer to buy drugs.\n\nB) This is the correct answer and would likely be considered entrapment.

The primary or \"senior\" lien is typically a mortgage lender.

My understanding is that once approved by a court, foreclosed property is typically sold at auction, and the proceeds awarded to the lienholders in order of lien seniority.

This process involves a face-to-face operation with a trusted staff member who confirms the person's real identity. These certificates are accepted as proof by most European law courts and are typically used by medium to large organizations. While other methods like scanned ID cards or small financial transactions may be used, they are not considered legally acceptable proof of identity. The smartcard certificate method provides a higher level of assurance and is backed by a secure delivery procedure and record-keeping, making it the most legally reliable option among the choices presented."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/83887/why-do-lawyers-not-represent-themselves-in-their-own-areas-of-expertise", "docs_id": 83887, "title": "Why do lawyers not represent themselves in their own areas of expertise?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand why a criminal defense lawyer would not represent himself in a personal injury case, or a patent attorney would not defend herself against criminal charges.

Other notable figures have reiterated that advice since then.\n\nThe modern language of the saying that \"A man who represents himself, has a fool for a client,\" is often attributed to Abraham Lincoln, although the attribution is probably false.\n\nPractically speaking, one reason is that it doesn't work very well to elicit testimony from yourself as opposed to a third\\-party at trial. Another is that a lawyer is stronger when the lawyer's personal credibility isn't subject to being questioned in the case. A third is that it is hard to exercise independent judgment in an accurate fashion when you own case is involved. A fourth is that negotiations are often easier when made through third\\-parties.\n\nThis said, lawyers do routinely represent themselves in areas where they have expertise anyway. It is arguably unwise, but it is rarely, if ever, legally prohibited or improper. Indeed, generally speaking, everyone has a legal right to represent themselves without a separate lawyer.

The documentation emphasizes that while it's not legally prohibited for lawyers to represent themselves, it's generally considered unwise due to several factors. The key reason highlighted is the difficulty in exercising independent judgment when one's own case is involved. This aligns with the principle that \"he who will be his own Counsellor, shall be sure to have a Fool for his Client.\"\n\nOption A is incorrect because the text explicitly states that self-representation is \"rarely, if ever, legally prohibited or improper.\"\n\nOption B is not accurate as the issue isn't about lawyers lacking skills, but rather about the challenges of maintaining objectivity in one's own case.\n\nOption D is false as there's no mention of any bar association requirement to hire other attorneys for personal cases.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the nuanced reasons behind the advice against self-representation in legal matters, focusing on the importance of objectivity and independent judgment in legal proceedings."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/11858/why-arent-all-people-with-warrants-arrested-immediately", "docs_id": 11858, "title": "Why aren&#39;t all people with warrants arrested immediately?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I've been watching a lot of episodes of the TV series *Cops* lately.

California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen_v._California): A young man was arrested for wearing a jacket with the words \"Fuck the Draft\" and SCOTUS decided, that that was First Amendment\\-protected speech and the arrest illegal.\n\nThe phrase **\u05de\u05e0\u05d0 \u05de\u05e0\u05d0 \u05ea\u05e7\u05dc \u05d5\u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d9\u05df** is in Akkadian or Aramaic language but Hebrew script (as opposed to the Akkadian Cuneiform) and can be transcribed as Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin. It is also known in German as \"Menetekel\" or in English as the \"Writing on the wall\". It stems from the biblical episode of [Belshazzar's feast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshazzar%27s_feast). Literally, the text would be read as \"counted, counted, weighed, distributed\". Its meaning elaborated in *Daniel 5* is generally understood as \"Your days are numbered; Your days are numbered; You have been measured and found wanting; Your kingdom will fall and be divided\". While stemming from religious texts, in the depicted situation it is more likely meant as political speech, and in that fashion indistinguishable from a [flag](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/78237/10334).\n\nIt also does not call for imminent lawless action \\- the so\\-called Brandenburg Test after [Brandenburg v Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio) \\- and thus remains in the protected speech area. Remember, that [even preaching genocide can be First amendment protected](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/90142/10334), as long as that line of imminent lawless action is not overstepped.\n\nAs this phrase does neither, it is protected speech.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the legal status of holding a sign with the phrase \"MENE MENE TEKEL UPHARSIN\" in front of government buildings like the White House, Capitol, or Supreme Court?\n\nA) It is illegal because it uses a foreign language that could be seen as threatening.\nB) It is protected speech under the First Amendment, regardless of its potentially ominous meaning.\nC) It is only legal if the holder can prove they are using it in a religious context.\nD) It is illegal because it could be interpreted as a call for overthrowing the government.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The phrase \"MENE MENE TEKEL UPHARSIN\" is protected speech under the First Amendment, regardless of its potentially ominous meaning. This conclusion is supported by several key points:\n\n1. The Cohen v. California case established that even potentially offensive language is protected by the First Amendment.\n\n2. The phrase, while stemming from a biblical context, can be considered political speech in this setting, which is highly protected.\n\n3. It does not call for imminent lawless action, thus passing the Brandenburg test established in Brandenburg v. Ohio.\n\n4. The mere use of a foreign language or script does not make speech unprotected.\n\n5. The potentially threatening or ominous interpretation of the phrase does not remove its protected status, as even speech advocating for abstract concepts like revolution can be protected as long as it doesn't incite immediate lawless action.\n\nTherefore, holding such a sign would be considered legal and protected under the First Amendment."}}
