I may have missed some out and may edit those in later.\n\nCommon law refers to the judgments of courts. So here we come to your question:\n\nSeveral legal principles and precedents were established by this judgment, and you may consider this new \"law\":\n\n1. The court held that prerogative powers are justiciable \\- courts can limit the scope of these powers\n2. The prerogative power in question had limits. It can be limited when its use has an extreme detrimental effect on the democracy of the UK and parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nWhat is important with point one is that the court *recognised* that this power has *always* existed, stemming as far back as the bill of rights in the 17th century. As such, the court is implying that it is creating nothing new, but recognising a law that has always existed.

Based on the Supreme Court's ruling on prorogation, which of the following statements most accurately reflects the legal implications?\n\nA) The government has unlimited prerogative power to prorogue Parliament for any duration it chooses.\nB) The courts have no jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of prorogation, as it's purely a political matter.\nC) The courts can review the lawfulness of prorogation, but only if it exceeds a specific predefined time limit.\nD) The courts can review and potentially limit prorogation if it significantly impedes Parliamentary sovereignty and democracy.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis and application of the Supreme Court's ruling on prorogation to a hypothetical scenario. The correct answer is D, which aligns with the key principles established in the ruling:\n\n1. The court held that prerogative powers, including prorogation, are justiciable - meaning courts can review and limit their scope.\n2. The ruling established that prerogative powers have limits, particularly when their use has an extreme detrimental effect on democracy and parliamentary sovereignty.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ruling explicitly states that the government's power to prorogue is not unlimited and can be subject to judicial review. Option B contradicts the court's decision that prorogation is justiciable. Option C introduces a specific time limit, which wasn't part of the ruling; instead, the court focused on the effect of prorogation rather than its duration alone.\n\nThis question tests the candidate's ability to apply the legal precedent to a new situation, understanding the nuances of the court's decision and its implications for the balance of power between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. It also requires recognition that while the court views this as interpreting existing law stemming from long-standing principles (like parliamentary sovereignty), it effectively creates new legal precedent in how these principles are applied to modern governance issues."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/36898/can-we-identify-the-main-source-of-new-law-in-the-uk", "docs_id": 36898, "title": "Can we identify the main source of new law in the UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: IIUC the primary sources of law in the UK are:\n\n* statute (acts of Parliament)\n* delegated legislation (statutory instruments)\n* case law\n* EU law\n\nBut can we pick one of those as being the main source of new laws?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: By volume, it's almost certainly Statutory Instruments (SIs).\n\nFrom the [relevant page on legislation.gov.uk](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi), we can see that the number since 2010 has ranged from 1241 to 3485 per year.

The correct answer is D because Statutory Instruments (SIs) are the most prolific source of new laws in the UK. \n\nThe documentation states that \"By volume, it's almost certainly Statutory Instruments (SIs)\" that are the main source of new laws. It provides data showing that SIs range from 1,241 to 3,485 per year, far outpacing Acts of Parliament (23 to 41 per year).\n\nOption A is incorrect because while EU directives were significant, they often required implementation through domestic legislation, typically via SIs. Post-Brexit, this option is even less relevant.\n\nOption B, while important, would result in fewer individual pieces of legislation. Acts of Parliament are much less numerous than SIs.\n\nOption C is unlikely to result in numerous changes quickly.

Under the common law of the time, a person who owns the soil also owns the space indefinitely upward, \"ad coelum or to the heavens\". There had previously been successful lawsuits for trespass and/or nuisance for, among other things, bullets that passed over land without touching it.\n\nAviation in the early 20th century was largely unregulated in the United States, partially due to the issue of Federalism but primarily due to the question of if private citizens would be able to claim compensation for the government seizing their airspace. Neither state nor Federal governments wanted anything to do with it. The question *was* resolved in Europe before the First World War because national governments there were (largely) not federal, did not have the same sanctity of private property rights as the US and could see enormous national security issues in foreigners flying over your military installations, gathering intelligence about them and \\- as events ultimately showed \\- dropping bombs on them.\n\nWhen the US finally decided that aviation needed regulation it passed the [Air Commerce Act of 1926](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government_role_in_civil_aviation#Air_Commerce_Act). There was never any issue about its constitutionality as the Federal government can rely on the [Necessary and Proper Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_and_Proper_Clause) of Article 1, Section 8 which the Supreme Court has interpreted permissively since [*McCulloch v Maryland* 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland):\n\n> Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.\n\nBasically, the Constitution is permissive in the powers it gives Congress \\- they have the power unless it says they don't.\n\nThe validity of the law with respect of the private property issue was settled in [United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Causby) which overturned the common law that landholders owned airspace \"to the heavens\" but rejected that the government could seize it all down to ground level without compensation \\- in that particular case the government had to pay compensation for flights between 83 feet (the lowest that was made) and 365 feet (where the owner's property was deemed not affected by the flights). \n\nThe current state of the law is that you own as much airspace as is necessary for your current usage \\- this is higher in an office building in Manhatten than it is over a cornfield in Idaho.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided documentation about aviation regulation in the United States:\n\nQuestion: A state government is challenging the Federal Aviation Administration's authority to regulate small, unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) that operate entirely within the state's borders.

The correct answer is B, based on the Necessary and Proper Clause. As explained in the documentation, there is no specific constitutional amendment about aviation, ruling out option C. The Interstate Commerce Clause (option A) is mentioned as a possible justification for interstate flights, but it's not the primary basis for all aviation regulation. The \"ad coelum\" principle (option D) was actually overturned and is not the basis for federal authority.\n\nThe Necessary and Proper Clause, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in McCulloch v. Maryland, allows Congress broad powers to legislate on matters not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, as long as the end is legitimate and within the Constitution's scope. This interpretation has been applied permissively, allowing Congress to regulate aviation as a legitimate end, even when flights don't cross state lines.

The defendant's action of transferring their house to their spouse for a nominal amount ($1) just after losing a lawsuit strongly suggests an attempt to evade paying the judgment. This is likely to be considered a fraudulent transfer under most jurisdictions' laws.\n\nThe correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Fraudulent conveyance is primarily a civil matter, not a criminal one. While it's a serious violation of civil law, it doesn't automatically constitute a criminal offense.\n\n2. The plaintiff has civil remedies available, such as seeking to void the transfer or obtain a prejudgment attachment, as mentioned in the documentation. These are civil procedures, not criminal ones.\n\n3. The transfer is not legal just because it's documented (A is incorrect), as the intent and timing make it suspicious.\n\n4. Immediate arrest (B) is not typically possible in such cases, as this is not automatically a criminal matter.\n\n5.

I'd like to be informed before I go so I know what to do with my family.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Legally, they cannot just nab you. The usual (?) option is that authorities in the US request extradition pursuant to the [US\\-Mexico extradition treaty](http://www.oas.org/juridico/MLA/en/traites/en_traites-ext-usa-mex.pdf) via the Department of Justice, and if the paperwork is in order, this can result in a Provisional Arrest Warrant (and arrest) in Mexico, which will be carried out by the Mexican federal police. This is true whether or not you go to the US consulate. After a hearing in the Mexican courts you might be extradited (or not, but DoJ presumably doesn't proceed with cases that they will lose). Extradition is not possible for every offense, so you would have to look at the offenses listed in the treaty, and whatever the Arizona warrant is about. You can't be extradited for parking tickets, you can be extradited for murder: whatever it is, it has to be a crime in both places, and has to be subject to a minimum one year imprisonment. Also, if you are a Mexican citizen as well, you cannot be extradited unless the Mexican authorities agree to (whereas there is no choice if you are only a US citizen). An alternative is deportation, which would overcome limitations related to extradition, but it's not clear what the requirements for deportation from Mexico are (typically illegal presence, unclear whether Mexican authorities can or would try an end\\-run around official extradition procedure).\n\nAlthough consulates enjoy a degree of immunity from local law, a consulate in Mexico is still Mexican territory, subject to Mexican law. If you are *in* the consulate, Mexican authorities cannot enter without permission to arrest you. They also cannot arrest you without a warrant (see Art. 16 of the [Mexican constitution](https://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/mex/en_mex-int-text-const.pdf)). Consular staff also cannot arrest you (if you are not caught *flagrante delicto*).

The key point from the documentation is that if a logo is \"likely to be confused with the original trade mark it is infringing if it is used to promote trade.\" Even though the startup's logo is flipped upside down, it's still highly likely to be confused with the original trademark.

(A sovereign state can set their own laws by virtue of being a sovereign state.) In the early days of copyright, such efforts were not uncommon. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, for instance, was notorious in 19th century Italy for disregarding the copyright of other states. This was a deliberate policy choice that led to a burgeoning reprint business. Giuseppe Verdi was repeatedly warned by his publisher not to bring any of his scores to Naples for that was tantamount to having them spread across the world. Needless to say, when the first international copyright treaty was adopted between Austria and Sardinia (in 1840\\) and they invited the rest of Italy to join, the Two Sicilies were the only state to refuse.\n\nLater on, the industrial heavyweights of the world have of course made sure this doesn't happen. The Berne Convention today has roughly 180 member states and there are several other copyright\\-related treaties in place as well (WCT, WPPT, TRIPS ...). Simply put, the strategy consists of two elements: First, no one gets a trade agreement without ensuring and properly enforcing the IP rights of foreigners. Second, if you don't protect our authors in your country, we don't protect your authors in our country. This has led to a fairly high standard of protection across the world.\n\n> In other words, if a country did this and a citizen of this country built a server filled with recent Hollywood movies, would users in that country legally be allowed to download those movies, and would the US have any right to seize and shut down that server (as they have done with torrent sites in the past)?\n\nIn purely legal terms, you cannot simply seize property in foreign countries. You always need a country that cooperates (is required to cooperate) with you, be it based on international law or as a \"courtesy\". If, hypothetically, there were some super\\-rogue country that for some reason is completely autarch and doesn't want to do business with the rest of the world, you couldn't force them to let you seize anything. (The military surely could ...)\n\nHowever, even then, the operator of the server in your example would have some trouble of his own. Because if you operate a server in country X and offer Hollywood movies, without permission, you would expect that the rest of the world can download these movies as well, either directly or through a VPN service. In many countries, that would be enough to bring the action (the communication to the public of the content, see eg WCT, art 8\\) within the purview of their own jurisdiction.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. While the island nation has sovereignty over its laws (as mentioned for the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies example), modern international relations are heavily influenced by trade agreements and treaties.\n\n2.

The value of a single pizza slice is likely too low to justify court proceedings.\n\n4. Option A is incorrect because civil action is possible, not just criminal complaints.\n\n5.

The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The agreement prohibits working with entities \"in direct competition\" with SpecialCorp for 6 months. However, as noted in the top answer, a broad restriction on all IT work would likely be unenforceable.\n\n2.

Who is responsible for making this decision? What if there is disagreement among the Justices as to which interpretation is, in fact, the \"narrowest\" interpretation?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: ### When *Marks* is relevant\n\nThe *Marks* rule is direction from the Supreme Court to lower court judges as to how to deduce the controlling position when the Court itself can't come to a majority position. When a majority of justices agree in the outcome of a case, but not on the law that gets them there, the *Marks* rule comes into play to determine what *reasoning* should be followed by lower courts.\n\n### An example\n\nI'll explain with an example that was at the center of the appeal in *[Hughes v. United States](https://casetext.com/case/hughes-v-united-states-105)* (2018\\).\n\nThe issue arose in *Hughes* because lower courts did not know how to deal with the 4\\-1\\-4 split in [*Freeman* (2013\\)](https://casetext.com/case/freeman-v-united-states-13). The *Marks* rule says to look at the positions of the members that concurred in the outcome. In *Freeman*, there were two positions that together accounted for the outcome: that of four justices (written by Justice Kennedy) and that of Justice Sotomayor, in a solo concurrence. Her position was arguably decided on a \"narrower\" ground. However, neither the Kennedy plurality nor the Sotomayor concurrence was a logical subset of the other. Justice Sotomayor was not merely agreeing with some but not all of the plurality's reasoning. She came to the same conclusion, but based on a different understanding of the law. Yet some circuits were treating Justice Sotomayor's concurrence in *Freeman* (with which no other justice had agreed) as the controlling opinion. This is apparently what *Marks* required.\n\n### *Marks* has always been confusing\n\nThe *Marks* rule has been a source of confusion in the jurisprudence and academia ever since it was announced. It was not reasoned nor explained by the Court when it was announced. It hasn't been reasoned or explained by the Court since. To the extent that the *Marks* rule has arguably clear application, it is in cases where the various reasons for judgment of the Court form a \"logical subset\" or \"common denominator\" structure. But many times, the reasons don't relate to each other that way (e.g. *Freeman*). There is sometimes no identifiable \"narrowest ground\" in that sense, and even where there is, it reflects a minority position of the court: one that none of the other justices agreed with.\n\n### The *Re* brief in *Hughes*\n\nProfessor [Richard M. Re](https://www.law.virginia.edu/faculty/profile/rmr6w/2914854) filed an [*amicus* brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) in *[Hughes v. United States](https://casetext.com/case/hughes-v-united-states-105)* (2018\\) on the topic of the *Marks* rule arguing that the *Marks* rule should be abandoned and replaced with the following:\n\n> A precedent of this Court should form only when most Justices expressly agree on a rule of decision.\n\nRe notes that the *Marks* rule \"applies precisely when this Court issues a decision that lacks any majority agreement on a rationale.\" He argues that \"there is no persuasive reason to treat views that lack majority support as binding, nationwide precedents.\"\n\nThe Court itself has said the *Marks* rule is \"easier stated than applied.\" And the Court has never attempted to explain the rule since. Re cites his own paper, \"[Beyond the Marks Rule](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090620)\" which he says further shows the rule has \"defined consistent application by lower courts.\" At [page 16 of the brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf), he describes [circuit splits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_split) that have developed over an attempt to apply the *Marks* rule to the reasons of the Court.\n\n### *Hughes* gave us no answer\n\nBoth parties in *Hughes* presented alternatives to the *Marks* rule. It was discussed extensively at [oral argument](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2017/17-155_2co3.pdf). Counsel for the petitioner acknowledged that, \"Whatever guidance Marks may have provided, it's probably caused more confusion than \\-\\- than guidance.\" The arguments contained analogies to Venn diagrams and Russian nesting dolls. Ultimately, the Court in *Hughes* found it unnecessary to resolve the \"proper application of *Marks*.\" Despite granting certiori to address those questions, they were able to resolve the case by skipping directly to the the merits of the substantive question about sentencing.\n\n### *Ramos* did not clarify things\n\nIn [*Ramos v. Louisiana*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-5924_n6io.pdf), 590 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2020\\) some members of the Court commented on what *Marks* might mean. Ironically, the Court in *Ramos* itself was split without a majority on the meaning of *Marks*. Justice Gorsuch, writing for three on this issue, said that *Marks* in fact does *not* ever result in a single justice's opinion becoming the controlling position. He presented this example:\n\n> Suppose we face a question of first impression under the Fourth Amendment: whether a State must obtain a warrant before reading a citizen's email in the hands of an Internet provider and using that email as evidence in a criminal trial. Imagine this question splits the Court, with four Justices finding the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant and four Justices finding no such requirement. The ninth Justice agrees that the Fourth Amendment requires a warrant, but takes an idiosyncratic view of the consequences of violating that right. In her view, the exclusionary rule has gone too far, and should only apply when the defendant is prosecuted for a felony. Because the case before her happens to involve only a misdemeanor, she provides the ninth vote to affirm a conviction based on evidence secured by a warrantless search.\n\nThis is a 4\\-1\\-4 split, in which the solo Justice holds the arguably narrowest grounds of decision, one which would be overruling precedent in this hypothetical. Justice Gorsuch says though that *Marks* \"never sought to offer or defend\" a rule that \"a single Justice's opinion can overrule prior precedents.\"\n\nJustice Kavanaugh, writing in concurrence, but not agreeing with Justice Gorsuch on his *Marks* point, said that the *Marks* rule is \"ordinarily commonsensical to apply and usually means that courts in essence heed the opinion that occupies the middle\\-ground position between (i) the broadest opinion among the Justices in the majority and (ii) the dissenting opinion.\" He noted that the members of the Court in *Ramos* had notably differing opinions about how to apply *Marks* to *Apodaca*: \"six Justices treat the result in *Apodaca* as precedent for purposes of *stare decisis* analysis. A different group of six Justices concludes that *Apodaca* should be and is overruled.\"\n\nThe dissent in *Ramos*, written by Justice Alito, was of the view the *Marks* applied to the ruling in *Apodaca* and that it produced precedential value that the Justice Gorsuch majority was ignoring. The dissent said that *Marks* clearly stands for the proposition that \"the position taken by a single Justice in the majority can constitute the binding rule for which the decision stands.\"\n\n### Further reading\n\nIf you're really interested in this, I suggest reading Richard Re's [brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/33360/20180126134313770_17-155%20Re%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf) and his [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3090620), read the parties' briefs in *Hughes* ([petitioner's](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/28738/20180122155818808_Hughes%20Merits%20Brief.pdf), [respondent's](http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/36187/20180221203622477_17-155bs%20UnitedStates.pdf), [petitioner's reply](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-155/38841/20180313194715620_Hughes%20Merits%20Reply.pdf)), and listen to the [oral argument](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/17-155).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation about the Marks rule and its application in Supreme Court decisions, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A circuit court judge is presiding over a case that involves interpreting a recent Supreme Court decision with a 4-1-4 split. The plurality opinion (4 justices) argues for a broad interpretation of the law, while a single justice's concurrence provides a more limited rationale. The dissenting opinion (4 justices) argues for no change to the existing law. How should the circuit court judge apply the Marks rule in this scenario?\n\nA) Always follow the plurality opinion as it represents the largest bloc of agreeing justices\nB) Treat the single justice's concurrence as binding precedent if it represents the \"narrowest grounds\"\nC) Consider the decision non-binding due to the lack of a clear majority rationale\nD) Apply the common points between the plurality and the concurrence, ignoring areas of disagreement\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question tests the application of the Marks rule in a complex scenario, requiring analysis and integration of multiple concepts from the documentation. The correct answer is B, based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. The Marks rule states: \"When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\"\n\n2. In this scenario, we have a 4-1-4 split, similar to the Freeman case mentioned in the documentation. The single justice's concurrence, if it represents the \"narrowest grounds,\" would be considered the controlling opinion according to Marks.\n\n3. This interpretation is supported by the example in the documentation where some circuits treated Justice Sotomayor's solo concurrence in Freeman as the controlling opinion, despite no other justice agreeing with her reasoning.\n\n4. The question challenges the reader to apply this principle even when it might seem counterintuitive that a single justice's opinion could become binding precedent.\n\n5. Option A is incorrect because the plurality opinion doesn't automatically become controlling under Marks. Option C is incorrect because Marks provides guidance for interpreting split decisions, rather than dismissing them as non-binding. Option D represents a misunderstanding of how Marks is applied.\n\n6.

I'd like to exclude that, unless it's pivotal to the answer.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Water law is complicated and detail intense, but the basic principle is \"prior appropriation\".\n\nIn other words, you gain a water right by taking water from a river or other body of water and appropriating it for your use on a particular date, and then continuing to do so going forward. The older the date at which you first started using water in a river basin, the higher priority your water right will be.\n\nState officials (including a corps of civil engineers) and the courts with judges trained in water law, engage in the complicated matter of determining who has water rights from particular dates in particular river basins, in determining which prior appropriation date will provide the cutoff date for a particular snowmelt season, and in punishing people who use water from a river basin that their priority is insufficient to allow them to use.\n\nOnce established, water rights may be purchased and sold like property. So, for example, if a farming has water rights to X units of water dating with a 1891 appropriation date, and a developer wants to build a new subdivision whose residents need water in the same river basins, the developer can purchase the X units of water with an 1891 appropriate date from the farmer (who goes out of business without these water rights) and can give it to an HOA or water district for the developer's new subdivision.\n\nThere are special rules that tweak this general principle. The Western states have interstate compacts, which are basically treaties between U.S. states, that govern how much water upstream states must allow to pass to downstream states. These are not infrequently litigated in the original jurisdiction of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThere are also special rules governing when and how much precipitation one can store in a cistern or rain barrel, treaties with Indian tribes regarding water rights, rules on storage of water you are allowed to use with your water rights, rules about wasting water, and rules about how groundwater aquifers are handled.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided water rights documentation:\n\nQuestion: A rapidly growing city in Arizona is facing severe water shortages due to prolonged drought.

According to this principle, water rights are based on the date when water was first appropriated for use, with older rights having higher priority. The question specifically asks for a legally sound and effective approach.\n\nOption B is the correct answer because it aligns with the explanation that \"water rights may be purchased and sold like property.\" The example given in the documentation describes how a developer can purchase water rights with an older appropriation date from a farmer and transfer these rights to a new subdivision. This approach respects the existing legal framework of prior appropriation while allowing for the reallocation of water resources to meet changing needs.\n\nOption A is incorrect because water rights are not determined by the amount of taxes paid, but by the principle of prior appropriation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because establishing a new charter would not override the existing system of water rights based on prior appropriation. The CAPLTER mentioned in the original question is not relevant to determining water rights.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the age of a property might correlate with its water rights, it's not the construction date itself that determines the rights, but rather the date when water was first appropriated for use in that location.\n\nThis question requires the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, applies them to a real-world scenario of urban development in a water-scarce region, and tests critical thinking about how water rights can be legally transferred and utilized in new contexts."}, "26": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59434/are-midi-files-copyrighted", "docs_id": 59434, "title": "Are Midi files copyrighted?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: If I have a midi file of a public domain work, it the midi file copyrighted?

How is an affirmative defense different from a defense (sans any adjective modifier)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Generally an affirmative defense raises some ground other than an element of the offense or civil claim, such as justification (e.g. self\\-defense), privilege (I'm a soldier acting under lawful orders so I'm immune from liability), the invalidity of a law, statute of limitations, insanity, a pardon, bankruptcy, a settlement agreement, or payment of the amount owed in full. In a civil case, an affirmative defense has to be raised in the answer to the complaint failed by the plaintiff or a timely amendment to that answer.\n\nThe prosecution/plaintiff has to overcome an affirmative defense **only if the defendant raises it**, and in a civil case, at least, the burden of proof for an affirmative defense is on the defendant. The **requirement that a defendant raise the defense** going to something beyond the elements of the crime or civil claim **is what makes it an \"affirmative\" defense**. **Affirmative defenses are conclusively presumed to be unavailable to the defendant if not raised**.\n\nUsually, it is possible to prevail in a civil or criminal case by establishing a complete affirmative defense, even if the defendant admits all of the elements of the crime or civil claim against the defendant have been proven.\n\nAlso, many affirmative defenses (e.g. failure to mitigate damages, or heat of passion) are incomplete affirmative defenses that reduce the consequences that a defendant will face if the prosecution/plaintiff establishes a prima facie case (i.e. proves all the elements of the crime or civil claim), but will not completely eliminate all consequences of the prosecution/plaintiffs' proof of all elements of the crime or civil claim for the defendant.\n\nBut the prosecution/plaintiff must always prove each and every element of a crime or civil claim (beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases, and by preponderance of the evidence or by clear and convincing evidence in most non\\-criminal claims) even if the defendant fails to present any evidence or make any arguments related to the element of the crime or civil claim to prevail on the merits.\n\nSomething that undermines an element of the crime or civil claim is a mere regular defense, because it doesn't have to be raised affirmatively, although in civil cases, facts that are alleged in a plaintiff's complaint are deemed admitted if they are not affirmatively denied, making the distinction between affirmative defenses and ordinary defenses in civil cases rather subtle.\n\nOf course, the term \"defense\" can be used to encompass both affirmative defenses, and other defenses which are not affirmative defenses (such as defenses that disprove an element of the crime or civil claim).\n\nJust to complicate matters further, there are a small number of ordinary defenses that still have to be raised affirmatively in advance in a criminal case despite the fact that it disproves an element of the crime, rather than advancing some other matter.

The documentation states that \"Affirmative defenses are conclusively presumed to be unavailable to the defendant if not raised.\" However, it also mentions that in civil cases, an affirmative defense \"has to be raised in the answer to the complaint failed by the plaintiff or a timely amendment to that answer.\"\n\nThe correct approach (C) recognizes that while the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, the court should still allow the defendant to prove it, even if raised later in the proceedings. This is because affirmative defenses are powerful tools that can completely bar a lawsuit, even if all elements of the claim are proven.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the statute of limitations can bar a lawsuit, it's not automatic and must be proven by the defendant. Option B is wrong because admitting to the elements of a claim doesn't negate affirmative defenses. Option D goes too far by assuming the defense is waived without considering the possibility of a timely amendment or the court allowing the defense to be raised later.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking about procedural aspects of civil litigation, the nature of affirmative defenses, and the balance between strict procedural rules and the substantive right to present a valid defense. It requires integrating concepts of burden of proof, timing of defenses, and the effect of affirmative defenses on litigation outcomes."}, "28": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78596/can-tucker-carlson-be-penalized-or-punished-by-the-us-government", "docs_id": 78596, "title": "Can Tucker Carlson be penalized or punished by the US government?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Tucker Carlson has often shown much bias in his reporting and opinions.

Giving people the freedom to say \"our government is wrong\" without being afraid of repercussions is the reason why this amendment exists. And yes, freedom of speech includes the freedom to be wrong. When someone makes false claims in public to sway public opinion, then it's the responsibility of their peers to [point out those falsehoods](https://www.politifact.com/personalities/tucker-carlson/) and let people decide by themselves who to believe. The government can of course also engage in counter\\-speech, for example by holding a press conference where they address claims made about them and present their side of the debate. But it is not the job of the government to use force to suppress falsehoods, because the government can not be expected to be impartial in this matter.\n\nThe government not suppressing public discourse is one thing which separates libertarian states like the United States from [authoritarian states where uncomfortable speech is suppressed](https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/71414/which-statements-about-the-war-in-ukraine-are-now-criminal-in-russia).\n\nThere are [a couple exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_free_speech_exceptions).

Options A and B would likely be unconstitutional as they involve direct government intervention in speech content. Option D, while more subtle, would still likely face constitutional challenges as compelled speech. \n\nThe correct answer, C, represents the government's most constitutionally sound approach. By engaging in counter-speech through official channels, the government can present its side of the debate and address claims made by Carlson without infringing on First Amendment rights. This approach aligns with the principle that the remedy for speech the government disagrees with is more speech, not enforced silence. It also maintains the separation between authoritarian states that suppress speech and libertarian states like the U.S. that protect it, even when that speech is controversial or perceived as false.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the constitutional limits on government action, application of First Amendment principles to a real-world scenario, and understanding of the distinctions between permissible government responses and those that would likely violate free speech protections."}, "29": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/31900/copyright-of-recorded-sport-events", "docs_id": 31900, "title": "Copyright of recorded sport events", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I understand that music concerts are copyrighted and you can't post the music online if you record it with phone or whatever, but how about sport events?\nSay I attended a tennis match and recorded some of it or even fully with my camera, can i post it online ? without getting copyright flagged of course. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I do not believe it is a violation of copyright.

Although certain matters pertain to the states, federal laws trump those laws.

IE state laws regulating birth (either forcing them or preventing them) would not be constitutional as they are regulating immigration separate from the Federal govt.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: While in many areas of law the federal government and states have concurrent jurisdiction, immigration is not one of them.\n\nThe federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over immigration, and the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution makes birth in the United States an event relevant for citizenship, although Congressionally enacted immigration law also makes birth to a U.S. citizen or U.S. national parent relevant for immigration law.\n\nSo far as I know, state laws sometimes state that life begins at conception, but never say that birth occurs at some other time such as conception, and birth is the relevant event for immigration law. But that doesn't mean that a state couldn't enact a law that stated that birth occurs at conception (indeed, something close to that concept is the law in South Korea where historically you have been counted as one year old at birth and you get one year older for legal purposes each New Year's Day, regardless of when you were actually born, a law it is thinking of reforming in the near future to the global norm).\n\nBut, even if a state did this, it wouldn't matter. In the United States, words routinely mean different things in different laws. Words don't even always have the same meaning in different laws enacted by the same government. The fact that a state enacts a law defining something, for the purposes of some or all state laws, has no legal effect on the meaning of the same thing for purposes of a particular federal law. States legally define terms in a manner inconsistent with particular federal laws for their own purposes all the time.\n\nOn the other hand, this state law would not be unconstitutional, except to the limited extent that it purports to make its definition effective for purposes of federal law.\n\nFor example, a definition enacted for purposes of a homicide statute, would not conflict with an immigration law that uses a different definition, and would not be unconstitutional on the grounds that it regulated immigration which is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government.\n\nIf the state statute were ambiguous regarding whether it applied to terms in federal laws, it would be interpreted to only apply to the use of that term under state law to avoid the constitutional question that would otherwise arise.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A state legislature is considering a bill that would define \"birth\" as occurring at the moment of conception for all state legal purposes.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. States have the authority to define terms for their own legal purposes, even if those definitions differ from federal definitions. This aspect of the law would be constitutional.\n\n2. However, as stated in the documentation, immigration is under exclusive federal jurisdiction. The federal government has sole authority to determine citizenship and immigration status.\n\n3. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution specifically ties citizenship to birth in the United States, and federal immigration law interprets this as physical birth, not conception.\n\n4. Even if a state law defines \"birth\" differently, it would not impact federal interpretation or application of immigration and citizenship laws. As the documentation notes, \"Words don't even always have the same meaning in different laws enacted by the same government.\"\n\n5.

The correct answer, C, reflects the nuanced reality of trademark law regarding personal names.\n\nAccording to the documentation, trademark law generally allows individuals to use their own names in business, even if similar trademarks exist. This is evidenced by the Canadian Trademark Act Section 20(1.1)(a) and the TRIPS Agreement Article 24, paragraph 8, which both protect the right to use one's personal name in trade.\n\nHowever, this right is not absolute. The key phrase in the Canadian law is \"in a manner that is not likely to have the effect of depreciating the value of the goodwill attaching to the trade-mark.\" Similarly, the TRIPS Agreement specifies \"except where such name is used in such a manner as to mislead the public.\"\n\nTherefore, Sarah Smith can use her name, but she must do so in good faith and in a way that doesn't harm the established company's goodwill or mislead consumers.

Lastly, under [Army Regulation 601\\-280](https://armypubs.army.mil/epubs/DR_pubs/DR_a/pdf/web/ARN19733_R601_280_FINAL.pdf), enlisted personnel who are conscientious objectors *generally* can\u2019t reenlist unless they\u2019re in the medical field (in which case they can reenlist with a contract that will keep them in the medical field).\n\nOf course, the fact that conscientious objectors are potentially eligible to serve doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be accepted. That depends on the needs of the Army. If the Army has plenty of people, they might not want someone who\u2019s restricted to noncombatant roles. If they\u2019re desperate for people, they\u2019re much more likely to accept applicants.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A soldier in the US Army develops a strong conscientious objection to violence during their service. They wish to continue serving but in a non-combat role. What is the most likely outcome if they apply for conscientious objector status?\n\nA) They will be immediately discharged from the Army with no option to re-enlist\nB) They will be reassigned to a non-combat role, most likely in the medical field\nC) Their application will be denied as conscientious objection is only considered at enlistment\nD) They will be required to complete their current tour of duty before being considered for reassignment\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to Army Regulation 600-43, serving personnel can apply for conscientious objector status if they develop such beliefs during their service. They can either ask to be discharged or request noncombatant service. The documentation states that \"if their application is approved then they'll get whichever one they asked for.\" In this case, since the soldier wishes to continue serving but in a non-combat role, they would likely be reassigned to noncombatant service if their application is approved. \n\nThe Army's policy is to keep such personnel, typically assigning them to the medical field. This is reinforced by the information that enlisted personnel who are conscientious objectors can generally only reenlist if they're in the medical field. \n\nOption A is incorrect because immediate discharge is not the only option, especially if the soldier wishes to continue serving. Option C is false because the regulation explicitly allows for developing these beliefs during service. Option D is incorrect as there's no mention of completing the current tour before reassignment, and immediate reassignment is possible upon approval of the application.\n\nThis question requires analysis of the given information, integration of multiple concepts from the documentation, and application to a specific scenario, thus targeting higher cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy."}, "35": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/21715/can-a-company-be-defined-as-the-data-controller", "docs_id": 21715, "title": "Can a company be defined as the Data Controller?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In our company training on Data Protection this statement is made\n\n> A data controller is the person (legal or natural) who decides on the\n>  purpose for which data is to be collected, held or processed. is the data controller for all the personal data held by\n>  us.\n\nIs it correct that the \"entire company\" by name can be the Data Controller?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes. \n\n[Under the Data Protection Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/key-definitions/) in the United Kingdom, data subjects are individuals whose data is collected and data controllers are those upon which duties are placed to decide how and why that data is processed. \"A **data controller** means ... a person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons) determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed.\" A data controller must be a \"person\" under the law, meaning it could be an individual, an organization, and other corporate and unincorporated bodies of persons.

It is a prosecutor who would file such a charge. The next question is whether there are criminal offenses subsumed under the rubric of anti\\-discrimination laws. There are a lot of anti\\-discrimination laws: numerous types at the federal, state and municipal level and different domains of discrimination (employment, public accommodation, education, voting...). Anti\\-discrimination laws generally describe civil consequences resulting from impermissible discrimination, not criminal penalties. [52 USC\u202f10308a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/10308), part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, provides criminal penalties for anyone who (attempts to)\ndeprive any person of any right secured by section 10301\\-10304 or 10306\\. 10301 is the provision that people cannot be denied the right to vote on the basis of race of color. That is an example of a form of discrimination that can result in criminal charges, which are filed by a prosecutor. There is a broad class of criminal laws, the [hate crime laws](https://www.justice.gov/crt/hate-crime-laws), for example it a crime to (threaten to) use force to interfere with housing rights based on race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin: but not age (it would be a different, non\\-federal crime). In all of these cases, it not bare discrimination, but discrimination in committing a crime.\n\nCivil actions based on violation of anti\\-discrimination laws are often undertaken by the city attorney, attorney general of a state, or US Department of Justice. They may have various names such as \"District Attorney\", \"State's Attorney\", \"County Prosecutor\", and there isn't a strict segregation between the attorneys who prosecute criminal cases for the government and those who do other kinds of legal work.

The correct answer is D for several reasons:\n\n1. Age discrimination is not covered under federal hate crime laws, ruling out option A. The documentation specifically mentions that age is not included in the list of protected characteristics for federal hate crime statutes related to housing rights.\n\n2.

We can, however, address the question of legality. Federal regulations apply to \"public water systems\". In the salient definitions, [42 USC 300f(4\\)(A)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/300f) says that\n\n> The term \u201cpublic water system\u201d means a system for the provision to the\n>  public of water for human consumption through pipes or other\n>  constructed conveyances, if such system has at least fifteen service\n>  connections or regularly serves at least twenty\\-five individuals.\n\nAssuming that there are at least 25 individuals being so served, it must be determined whether the water is being \"provided to the public\", and that isn't obvious.

This does not preclude there being state regulations, which may well be more stringent (though they tend to copy the federal rules), but we'd need to know the state. \n\n\\[Addendum]\n\nNew Jersey adopted the federal regulations unchanged. The issue over lead in the water is that corrosive water can leach lead from the plumbing into the water. There is a testing procedure and a threshold of acceptable lead where the town doesn't have to do anything, and above that they are supposed to treat the water (and if they don't, you have the Flint problem). The testing involves sampling at the tap, and if there is more that 0\\.015 mg/L lead in more than 10% of samples, the supplier is supposed to take corrosion\\-control steps. There are also lead service line regulations. There being regulations which put the onus of the problem on the water supplier, and no rules which obligate owners of buildings to rip out existing lead plumbing, the public has not generally been aware of the potential hazard, and it is unlikely that a university could be sued because / if it has some lead in its plumbing that leached into the water (assuming that the lead comes from the university, and not the city supply lines).

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. Listing factual information about businesses, including their names and locations, is generally protected as free speech and doesn't inherently violate trademark laws. This is similar to how directories or review sites operate.\n\n2. However, charging for the app adds a commercial element that could potentially be seen as profiting from others' trademarks, which is why some precautions are advisable.\n\n3. Implementing an opt-out system allows businesses to control their presence in the app, addressing potential concerns about unauthorized use of their names or information.\n\n4. Clearly stating that the app is not endorsed by listed entities helps avoid confusion and potential claims of implied endorsement, which is a key aspect of trademark protection.\n\n5. This approach balances the developer's right to create and sell an informational product with the trademark holders' rights to control the use of their marks in commerce.\n\nOption A is incorrect because merely listing factual information about businesses doesn't necessarily constitute trademark infringement.

The court found that the US did not provide an adequate level of data protection, in particular due to national security / surveillance laws like FISA 702 and EO 12333\\. While European countries also have surveillance laws, the US laws are fundamentally different because the affected (non\\-US) persons have no real recourse: they can't really sue against overbroad or illegal surveillance.\n\nAdequacy decisions are only one of many \u201ctransfer tools\u201d that can allow international data transfers. Other tools include Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), \u201ccodes of conduct\u201d, \u201ccertification mechanisms\u201d, or as a last resort Art 49 derogations.\n\nSCCs are a pre\\-formulated contract template provided by the EU that sort out responsibilities between the data exporter in Europe and the data importer in the non\\-European country. In essence, SCCs translate enough of the GDPR into contract law.\n\nBut SCCs are not necessarily valid, and this was also discussed as part of the Schrems II judgement. In [their opinion on the new 2021 SCCs, the EDPB\\+EDPS](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/edpbedps-joint-opinion/edpb-edps-joint-opinion-22021-standard_en) summarize the post\\-Schrems challenges to SCCs (edited to add bullet points):\n\n> In order to be valid, SCCs must incorporate effective mechanisms\n> \n> \n> * that make it possible, in practice, to ensure compliance with the level of protection required by EU law\n> * and that transfers of personal data pursuant to these clauses are suspended or prohibited in the event of the breach of such clauses or if\n> it is impossible to honour them.\n\nIn essence, a company can't sign SCCs if they are also subject to laws (such as US spy laws) that are incompatible with these SCCs.\n\nWhether SCCs are valid in a particular context is not for the EU to decide, but for the data controller to determine.\n\n* In particular, it is possible that SCCs alone are not sufficient. They are just a contract and cannot bind the authorities in the host country of the data importer. Thus, it may be necessary to implement supplemental measures to protect the transfer that makes the personal data worthless if it falls into the wrong hands. After Schrems II, the [EDPB published recommendations on such supplemental measures](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/recommendations/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en), for example end to end encryption where the data importer never gets access to the keys. But this prevents use of nearly all SaaS/cloud services, perhaps with the exception of dumb backup storage.\n* In a different direction, industry has focused on a \u201crisk based approach\u201d to data transfers. For example, the IAPP has a [transfer impact assessment template](https://iapp.org/resources/article/transfer-impact-assessment-templates/). While this departs from the CJEU/EDPB interpretation, it might be a valid approach for EU\u2013US transfers if and ony if you believe that US laws have since changed, so that Schrems II would be outdated.\n\nIn all of this, the new 2021 SCC templates do not quite help. I think the new SCCs are very good since they address many issues with the previous (pre\\-GDPR) templates, but they do not magically negate Schrems II issues. Nothing the EU commission can do by itself can help here, whether this is new SCCs or negotiations for a new Privacy Shield treaty. The Schrems II issues can only be resolved (a) by amending the GDPR to drastically lower the protections for international transfers, or (b) by an act of the US Congress introducing stronger checks and balances into relevant spy laws, in particular providing real legal recourse for affected non\\-US persons.\n\nSo yes, you can absolutely use the US\\-based Google Firebase Auth service, if one of the following holds:\n\n* Your analysis has determined that Google is not subject to problematic surveillance laws.\n* The EU or US legal environment have significantly changed since Schrems II.\n* You believe that you and Google have implemented sufficiently strong supplemental measures so that the US couldn't get their hands on your user's data even if it wanted to.\n* You subscribe to the \u201ctransfer risk assessment\u201d school of thought and, as a result of such an assessment, believe that Google is unlikely to receive problematic requests from US intelligence agencies regarding your user's data.\n* (unethical: considering how unlikely it is to get sued or fined, do the transfer anyway)\n\nGiven all of this trouble, it might end up being easier using a different authentication service.

Financial statements are said to be materially misstated if the misstatement would affect the choice of a typical decisionmaker. There\u2019s no explicit standard for what is or isn\u2019t material, but in practice, auditors often choose some small fraction of net income as the threshold. Materiality can also be caused by positive vs. negative earnings, or other thresholds, like financing agreements which might oblige the company to keep its current ratio above a certain level, for example. In the US, the rules to which the statements have to be materially correct are known as GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) and they are codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC).\n\nDepending on how the scheme is arranged, issues in the realm of \u201cbuying stuff as a \u201ccustomer\u201d to make the business look good\u201d include:\n\nSubstance over form: it may not be appropriate to recognize as a sale at all.

Somebody in management moved a truckload of product to his storage unit, only to return it after year end? That might be more accurately characterized as a loan, not a sale. I don\u2019t know of any specific terms for this exclusively, but there have certainly been cases where companies moved inventory to undisclosed warehouses in an effort to hide fictitious sales from their independent auditors. **Edit**: Another term for certain sales without commercial substance is a \u201c**roundtrip transaction**\u201d or \u201c**roundtripping**.\u201d\n\nDisclosure notes: even if there is commercial substance to the transaction, it may require disclosure notes, such as those for related party transactions, as required by ASC 850\\. Transactions with related parties must be disclosed even if they are not given accounting recognition (ASC 850\\-05\\-5\\). Examples of related parties are given in ASC 850\\-05\\-3, including \u201can entity and its principal owners, management, or members of their immediate families,\u201d among others. Under the relevant definition, a person does not need a formal title to be considered a member of management (ASC 850\\-10\\-20\\). The related party disclosure is not required in consolidated financial statements, for transactions that are eliminated in the consolidation process (ASC 850\\-10\\-50\\-1\\). For sales from a public company to a bona\\-fide external customer, there\u2019s also the major customers disclosure, but the threshold for that is 10% of revenue, which is much more than enough to materially impact the bottom line.\n\nGenerally, transactions between a parent company and a subsidiary will be eliminated in the preparation of the parent\u2019s (consolidated) financial statements (ASC 810\\). This means if the parent company A sells goods with a carrying value of $30 to its subsidiary, B, at a price of $50, A doesn\u2019t recognize that $20 gross profit until B sells the goods to an outside party. Internally, B might carry the goods at $50 on B\u2019s books, but A would have to cancel it out so that only $30 of that appears on A\u2019s consolidated balance sheet. The consolidation method is applied when one business has a controlling interest in another, and in summary it means that the parent company reports A\\+B\u2019s financials as if it was all a single entity. That means B\u2019s assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, are all reported as part of A. It also means any transactions between B and A are transactions within the entity; you wouldn\u2019t recognize a gain or loss (nor revenue and GP) if your marketing department sold office equipment to your engineering department, and you don\u2019t get to with subsidiaries either. Consolidation requires not only eliminating revenues, cost of goods sold, and excess carrying value of inventories on intra\\-entity transactions; it's also gains and losses on things like equipment, meaning the same transaction could require a consolidation adjustment twenty years later to eliminate excess depreciation expense. Long story short, ASC 810 deals with consolidation, and those rules apply when you create or purchase a subsidiary to buy your stuff, or use a subsidiary to pass the same $200,000 back and forth.\n\nWhen the parent entity does not have a controlling interest in the investee (the basic threshold is 50% of voting shares, or by some other agreement) but does have significant influence (representation on the board or other factors in ASC 323\\-10\\-15\\-6\\), then it will be treated as an equity method investment. Instead of adding the line items together, it's a single asset and A's portion of B's earnings are a single line item on the income statement, but the adjustments are similar to those in a consolidation.\n\nAnother kind of revenue recognition game which companies used to play involved bill\\-and\\-hold arrangements, wherein the customer (or the \u201ccustomer,\u201d or a salesperson without any real input from the supposed customer) would place an order, and the company would send (or at least, prepare and book) an invoice (revenue), but not ship the goods until the customer actually asked for them. These days, the rules on revenue recognition are fairly guarded against these kinds of things, but some other examples of \u201csales\u201d that aren\u2019t really sales include consignment arrangements, repurchase agreements (could be a sale with right of return, or depending on terms could be effectively a lease or a financing arrangement), and the gross vs net revenue issue for principle/agent situations (airline and hotel booking sites are a popular example. If they\u2019re an agent they\u2019re required to report their commission on a net basis but would likely prefer to look bigger by calling it a $110 sale and $100 cost of goods sold, instead of just $10 revenue).\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in management schemes to mislead the users of financial statements, check out the SEC\u2019s online archive of Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Releases (AAERs) [here](http://sec.gov/divisions/enforce/friaction.htm).

The CEO devises a plan where EagleEye sells $10 million worth of software licenses to its newly created subsidiary, FalconSight LLC, which EagleEye owns 60% of. FalconSight then resells these licenses to actual customers for $12 million over the next year. What is the most accurate assessment of this situation from an accounting and legal perspective?\n\nA) This is a legitimate business strategy, and EagleEye can recognize the full $10 million as revenue immediately.\nB) This is a roundtrip transaction and should be disclosed as a related party transaction, but EagleEye can still recognize the $10 million as revenue.\nC) EagleEye should only recognize revenue when FalconSight sells to external customers, and must eliminate intercompany transactions in consolidated financial statements.\nD) EagleEye can recognize the $10 million as revenue, but must report FalconSight as an equity method investment rather than a consolidated subsidiary.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves several key accounting and legal concepts:\n\n1. Consolidation: Since EagleEye owns 60% of FalconSight, it has a controlling interest and must use consolidated financial statements (ASC 810).\n\n2. Elimination of intercompany transactions: In consolidated financial statements, transactions between the parent (EagleEye) and subsidiary (FalconSight) must be eliminated to avoid overstating revenue and assets.\n\n3. Revenue recognition: Under proper accounting principles, revenue should only be recognized when earned from external parties. The sale to FalconSight is an internal transaction and doesn't represent true revenue generation.\n\n4. Substance over form: The arrangement appears to be designed to artificially inflate revenue, which violates the principle of substance over form.\n\n5. Related party transactions: This would require disclosure as a related party transaction under ASC 850, but disclosure alone is not sufficient.\n\nThe correct approach (C) is to only recognize revenue when FalconSight sells to external customers, and to eliminate the intercompany transactions in the consolidated financial statements. This ensures that only genuine, arms-length transactions with external parties are reflected in the reported revenue.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they would result in premature and overstated revenue recognition. Option D is incorrect because with 60% ownership, full consolidation (not equity method) is required, and the intercompany transaction must still be eliminated.\n\nThis question tests understanding of complex accounting principles, their application in a real-world scenario, and the ability to identify potentially deceptive financial practices."}, "55": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/13113/what-if-my-roommate-doesnt-pay-his-rent", "docs_id": 13113, "title": "What if my roommate doesn&#39;t pay his rent", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm a student and I've co\\-leased an apartment with another person.

The correct answer, C, is the most strategic approach for several reasons:\n\n1. Joint and several liability: As mentioned in the documentation, in a shared lease, tenants are typically jointly and severally liable. This means the landlord can pursue either tenant for the full rent amount.\n\n2.

Some cities have passed laws that deem trash to be city's property as soon as it is placed in a city\\-supplied trash bin, because the city (or a private contractor) hauls to and owns the landfill.

Which of the following best describes the legal standing of this situation?\n\nA) IndieCraft can sue Blizzard for damages due to detrimental reliance on the license\nB) Blizzard's revocation is likely legally valid, but they may face public backlash\nC) IndieCraft has acquired an implied perpetual license due to long-term use\nD) The license revocation is invalid unless Blizzard provides a 90-day notice period\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the legal implications of revocable licenses in the context of video game assets. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, game companies can indeed revoke their licenses at any time. This is a standard practice and is legally allowed.\n\n2. The license granted by Blizzard is not an obligation on their part to continue providing the product, nor does it create a right for IndieCraft to use it indefinitely.\n\n3. While Blizzard's action may seem unfair, especially given IndieCraft's investment of time and resources, this doesn't change the legal validity of the revocation.\n\n4. However, such actions can lead to negative public perception and backlash against the company, which is an important consideration for businesses.\n\nOption A is incorrect because detrimental reliance typically doesn't apply to explicitly revocable licenses.

In [2014 Microsoft bought Nokia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mobile). Part of Nokia's value was that it held [a whole bunch of fundamental patents for cellular communications](https://www.nokia.com/licensing/patents/).

These cases are assembled by legal publication companies in what used to be long sequential series of hard bound books called \"reports\" although this is not predominantly done electronically.\n\nBut every court case produces a court file which is maintained by a court clerk. Historically this has usually been done at the trial court clerk level in each county, with appellate court filing that are not published maintained by court clerks for each appellate court.\n\nThe federal courts have modernized this into a single online record keeping system for non\\-sealed court documents available to the general public over the Internet for a modest charge known as PACER (there is a parallel system linked to it in which lawyers and parties and judges can file documents after getting an account in that system).\n\nSome states have partially or fully consolidated state court files into on online system and there is considerable variation in the degree to which non\\-lawyer can access these files over the Internet (anyone can go to a court clerk's office and get copies of the non\\-sealed court files maintained by that clerk in paper form at a modest charge). But most state court records aren't searchable by members of the general public and aren't available to members of the general public over the Internet.\n\nIf there is an equivalent database to the one you mention that collects state\\- and local\\-government initiated lawsuits against corporations on a comprehensive basis, I've never seen it or heard about it.\n\nIf I wanted to, I could do a search of the court records of all of the post\\-digitized court cases brought by a particular governmental entity in Colorado's court records (except in municipal courts and the Denver County Court which are not part of the state record keeping system). I could likewise do a search of all post\\-digitized court cases brought against a particular corporation in Colorado's courts (with the same exceptions).\n\nBut I could not do a search of all records of all cases brought by any governmental entity (there are about 30,000 of them in the U.S.) against any corporation (there are several million corporations in the U.S.), and there really isn't an efficient way to compile such a list. It would take pure brute force pouring through case captions, without cooperation in a research agreement with the state court e\\-filing system administrator and a human subject committee review approval (which could probably both be obtained with enough work).\n\nThere are private companies, primarily credit reporting agencies for business debtors, such as Dun and Bradstreet, and Standard \\& Poors, that systemically pay for and process bulk downloads of all case fillings in almost every court at great expense to prepare a system of credit reports, and their data is available for a substantial fee, generally on a per party search basis, or on a subscription basis, which also isn't cheap. I had a subscription to D\\&B for a year or two since I had a case where this was necessary to finance the expense, and it wasn't crushingly expensive, but it wasn't cheap either.\n\nAnother private database is Lexis Nexus. It is best known for its legal search database, mostly of published and unpublished appellate court decisions that competes primarily with Westlaw, the other major online commercial database of published and unpublished court decisions. But Lexis Nexus also maintains a database of newspaper and magazine and scholarly research articles, and an appropriate search of that database would reveal lawsuits by governments against corporations that were reported upon, not only in the national news, but by local media sources and in industry journals. It isn't the most expensive of private sources, but it isn't the cheapest either, unless you have an academic subscription.\n\nThere is also a service called the jury verdict reporter the maintains as comprehensive a list of civil jury verdicts as it can, but that wouldn't be a great fit to the search criteria and would also be quite expensive to utilize outside paper copies in a law library.\n\nIt might be somewhat manageable for someone with a lawyer's access to the e\\-filing system to set out to list all lawsuits filed against 100 to 500 large publicly held corporations in a single state, and then to manually purge those lists by the governmental or non\\-governmental character of the plaintiffs, during the e\\-filing era, although it would still be an epic and expensive task. But there isn't any free source that has done it. Any publicly available databases are extremely fragmentary.\n\nAnother way to dramatically focus the search would be to limit the scope of government plaintiffs searched. There are roughly 30,000 state and local governments in the United States. But State governments would bring the lion's share of interesting lawsuits against publicly held corporations and there are only 50 of those (plus D.C. and territorial governments) to search. If you limited it to state criminal prosecutions against corporations (which are extremely rare), that would narrow your search even further, although it would still be cumbersome to winnow down.\n\nAfter state government plaintiffs you'd want to focus on the county and municipal governments in the place where each corporation has its headquarters, on county and municipal governments in state capitols, and on county and municipal governments in places where each corporation has its largest operations other than its headquarters (especially central cities in major metropolitan areas).\n\nFor cases filed prior to the e\\-filing system, you would have even more work, realistically, having to go from court house to court house in every single county to review paper based indexes of court files (although at least you could sort cases based upon case names alone without reviewing the content of the files).\n\nFinally, there is a non\\-court record source that is available for publicly held corporations, of which there are several thousand. This is EDGAR which is the databased of federal corporate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that contains annual and quarterly reports from publicly held companies and also supplemental disclosures from those companies in some circumstances. Publicly held companies are required to mention in their SEC reports available on the Internet via EDGAR all material lawsuits against the company. So, if you wanted to develop a database of material lawsuits in all jurisdictions filed by governments against say, all corporations in the S\\&P 500, EDGAR reports would be a fairly efficient way to go about it, even though these reports also contain lots of non\\-lawsuit related information.\n\nBut closely held companies don't have to file reports with the SEC so an EDGAR search would not reveal lawsuits filed by governments against privately held corporations.\n\nIf you were primarily interested in criminal cases against corporations, select reports of the U.S. Sentencing Commission and a handful of U.S. states also have similar commissions that might sometimes discuss sentences for corporations as criminal defendants, although these would be quite rare.\n\nThere are also likely to be databases specific to suits commonly brought by governments against corporations, such as anti\\-trust cases, labor law cases, and environmental cases.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A legal researcher is tasked with compiling a comprehensive database of state and local government-initiated lawsuits against corporations across the United States.

Not having that much money of his own, Ishmael hires a financial advisor, William Simpson. Simpson sets up a company with nine shares of stock, each with a face value of ten million credits. He arranges for four venture capital investors to buy one share each at face value, which would give Ishmael the purchase price plus additional start up funds. In return the stock will pay 5% dividends annually, starting after five years. But at the last moment, one investor backs out of the deal. Simpson arranges a 90\\-day loan of 8 million, at 6%, backed by one share of the company.\n\nAs the end of the 90\\-day period approaches, the company ios doing well, but has not earned the required eight million credits. Here is the relevant conversation between Ishmael Wang and William Simpson (from chapter 65 of *Oner's Share*)\n\n> \u201cSo, how can I help you today, Captain?\u201d Mr. Simpson asked with a small smile and a sidelong glance.\n> \n> \n> \u201cI\u2019ve come about the note, sir. It\u2019s due in a couple of days and the ship hasn\u2019t earned enough in so short a time. I wondered if you\u2019d found a buyer for the stock so that we might avoid default.\u201d\n> \n> \n> He reached over and patted my forearm with one bony hand. \u201cHere\u2019s what will happen on the twenty\\-sixth, my boy.\u201d He laced his fingers together across his chest and continued. \u201cAssuming you haven\u2019t the liquid assets needed to repay the loan, you will default. Larks, Simpson, and Greene will take ownership of the single share of stock that you\u2019ve assigned as collateral. Once that happens we\u2019ll sell it to an investor, removing ourselves from ownership, and leaving you to deal with your board of directors.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \u201cYou already have an investor, sir?\u201d\n> \u201cWe do, my boy. We do.\u201d\n> \n> \n> \u201cThen why not sell them a share of unencumbered stock, and let me pay off the loan without incurring the default?\u201d\n> \n> \n> He turned his head toward me. \u201cIf we did that, we\u2019d forego the opportunity to earn a profit of two million credits.\u201d He shook his head, and turned back to gaze out through the armorglass. \u201cWe\u2019ve invested a great deal of time and money in getting you started up, Captain. You\u2019ll walk away with an unencumbered company, and the opportunity to succeed or fail on your own without long\\-term liabilities. Please don\u2019t deny us a modest profit on the transaction.\u201d\n\nIt seems to me that the Simpson character, a paid financial advisor who knows that Wang is relying on his advice, is in the position of a fiduciary (or would be under current law) and would be ethically and legally required to but his client's interest first, and not take the two million additional profit, on top of his fees and the 6% interest on the loan. Is that correct?\n\n\\[I will add that I recommend this series, which consists of the novels *Quarter Share*, *Half Share*, *Full Share*, *Double Share*, *Captain's Share*, and *Owner's Share*. Buty I would not advise starting with the sixth of these.]\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Is this person a [fiduciary](https://www.13wentworth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Fiduciary-Duties-010518.pdf)?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou describe Simpson as a financial advisor, however, I believe that is a mischaracterisation. His role appears rather to be that of a business advisor: a financial advisor offers investment advice whereas a business advisor offers business and corporate capital advice. In most jurisdictions, financial advisors are heavily regulated, business advisors aren\u2019t.\n\nTo be a fiduciary, the person must come from a recognised class where the relationship is fiduciary by its nature, or the relationship must be one of special trust and confidence.\n\n> Such relationships will possess the \u201ccritical feature\u201d spoken of by Mason J in *Hospital Products Ltd v United States Surgical Corporation* (1984\\) 156 CLR 41 at 96\\-97, namely:\n> \n> \n> \u201c... that the fiduciary undertakes or agrees to act for or on behalf of or in the interests of another person in the exercise of a power or discretion which will affect the interests of that other person in a legal or practical sense. The relationship between the parties is therefore one which gives the fiduciary a special opportunity to exercise the power or discretion to the detriment of that other person who is accordingly vulnerable to abuse by the fiduciary of his position.\u201d\n\nIs Simpson in a class recognised to have a fiduciary duty?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nProbably, but not to Wang.\n\nOne class the law recognises as owing a fiduciary duty is that of Promoter of a company: *Tracy v Mandalay Pty Ltd* (1953\\) 88 CLR 215, Dixon CJ, Williams and Taylor JJ at 241\u2013242\\.\n\nHowever, that duty is owed to the *company*, not to any particular shareholder. Indeed, a duty to the company is incompatible with a duty to potential investors in that company, If the loan default is by the company, this would appear to breach that duty.\n\nHowever, Wang is not owed such a duty if the loan is in his name.\n\nWe can\u2019t really tell if the loan is owed by the company or by Wang: either is possible on the information given.\n\nDoes Simpson\u2019s relationship to Wang possess the \u201ccritical feature\u201d?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the facts given (here and probably in the book), it\u2019s impossible to say.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that this relationship is a contractural one and fiduciary duties are rarely found in such relationships. As with most things involving contract law, the terms of the contract are critical.\n\n> The imposition of fiduciary duties in contractual relationships can be problematic. In *Hospital Products*, Mason J spoke in terms that came to be endorsed by the High Court in *John Alexander\u2019s Clubs v White City Tennis Club* (2010\\) 241 CLR 1 at 36; \\[2010] HCA 19\\. Sir Anthony Mason examined cases where contract provides the foundation for a fiduciary relationship:\n> \n> \n> \u201cIn these situations it is the contractual foundation which is all important because it is the contract that regulates the basic rights and liabilities of the parties. The fiduciary relationship, if it is to exist at all, must accommodate itself to the terms of the contract so that it is consistent with, and conforms to, them. The fiduciary relationship cannot be superimposed upon the contract in such a way as to alter the operation which the contract was intended to have according to its true construction.\u201d\n\nIf the terms of the contract create a fiduciary relationship, either explicitly or implicitly, then there will be one. However, almost all contracts don\u2019t do this: the rights and responsibilities in most contracts are incompatible with a fiduciary relationship.\n\nWhat does the contract say?\n---------------------------\n\nIf the contract explicitly allows Simpson to behave in this manner then that\u2019s the end of it. It says he can so he can.\n\nIf the contract gives Simpson discretion to act in this manner, or if it is silent, then it gets a bit jurisdiction specific. In the US, there is an obligation to act in good faith to achieve the purposes of a contract. Other common law jurisdictions do not impose this positive duty: they impose a negative duty to not act in bad faith.\n\nWhile Simpson\u2019s actions are certainly not those of a good faith actor, they are not obviously bad faith. Good faith requires powers to be exercised reasonably and not arbitrarily. Bad faith requires an intention to mislead or deceive by performing the contract dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a gap in between and Simpson might be in that gap.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the LawStackExchange documentation provided:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described from the novel \"Owner's Share,\" Captain Ishmael Wang faces a financial dilemma involving his advisor William Simpson. Given the information provided and applying current legal principles, which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal implications of Simpson's actions?\n\nA) Simpson has clearly breached his fiduciary duty to Wang and is liable for damages.\nB) Simpson's actions are legally sound as he is acting in the best interest of the company, not Wang personally.\nC) The legality of Simpson's actions depends primarily on the specific terms of their contractual agreement.\nD) Simpson's role as a business advisor exempts him from any fiduciary responsibilities to Wang.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The scenario presents a complex legal situation that cannot be definitively resolved without more information. However, the most accurate assessment based on current legal principles is that the legality of Simpson's actions primarily depends on the specific terms of their contractual agreement.\n\nThe documentation emphasizes that the relationship between Wang and Simpson is likely contractual, and fiduciary duties are rarely found in such relationships. As stated, \"If the terms of the contract create a fiduciary relationship, either explicitly or implicitly, then there will be one. However, almost all contracts don't do this.\"\n\nFurthermore, Simpson's role appears to be that of a business advisor rather than a financial advisor, which affects the nature of his potential obligations. The distinction between these roles and their respective regulatory frameworks is significant.\n\nThe answer is not A because without knowing the specific terms of their agreement, we cannot definitively state that Simpson has breached a fiduciary duty. It's not B because Simpson's duty to the company (if it exists) doesn't necessarily override potential obligations to Wang.

What is the law concerning how one should behave if a wild animal is in the road you are driving on?\n\nWhen I was learning to drive (many years ago, in an area that frequently has wild animals in the road) I learnt that if a human is in the road you do whatever you can to avoid them, and if that causes a crash then so be it, people in cars are better protected than pedestrians. If a (non\\-human) animal is in the road you continue on until you have ascertained that it is safe to take avoiding action, as a crash is likely to hurt humans and they are infinity more important than wild animals.

It does not mean that employees excluded by these rules would be unable to whistleblow at all. Rather, the government channels through which they are able to seek protection are likely through a different office. In so far as I can tell, USOSC might restrict the FBI from protection services because they protect employees who go to the Media. FBI agents often handle classified material which would not be allowed to be disclosed to the media and many intel agency employees are required to submit any documents they intend to publish based off knowledge aquired from their employment for a pre\\-publishing review to make sure no classified material is leaked, and would thus limit the way the employee could whistleblow.\n\nJust because this particular office does not provide protection services to the listed employees, it does not mean there is an agency or department that does provide them (Usually the Office of General Inspector for the particular agency in question. While they are attached to the agency they cover, they are not within the chain of command of the agency itself and are independent to them.).\n\nFor that reason, just because the rules that apply to most do not cover FBI Whistle Blowers, it does not mean an FBI employee cannot become a whistle blower.

And here the legal trouble starts:\n\nWholesale copying the code or even the significant portions is copyright infringement and illegal.\n\nTricking the US copyright office to get a hold of the trade secret copyrighted code, like Atari did? **Highly** illegal. Copying portions of that illegally obtained code? [Copyright infringement and illegal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Games_Corp._v._Nintendo_of_America_Inc.), and the court even denied Atari many defenses because they had fooled the copyright office to get the code. [You can read the verdict here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15866317401594691669), but I want to quote this paragraph (emphasis mine):\n\n> In this case, the source code obtained from the Copyright Office facilitated Atari's intermediate copying of the 10NES program. To invoke the fair use exception, **an individual must possess an authorized copy** of a literary work. See Harper \\& Row, 471 U.S. at 562\\-63, 105 S.Ct. at 2232 (Knowing exploitation of purloined manuscript not compatible with \"good faith\" and \"fair dealings\" underpinnings of fair use doctrine.). **Because Atari was not in authorized possession of the Copyright Office copy of 10NES, any copying or derivative copying of 10NES source code from the Copyright Office does not qualify as a fair use.**\n\nBut reconstructing a workaround chip? That actually is legal, as the very case determined in the very next paragraph:\n\n> Reverse engineering, untainted by the purloined copy of the 10NES program and necessary to understand 10NES, is a fair use. \\[Explanation of the process used before Atari resorted to tricking the Copyright office] This \"reverse engineering\" process, **to the extent untainted by the 10NES copy purloined from the Copyright Office**, qualified as a fair use.\n\nAnd deconstructing the chip to show the results? That's actually legal. Even the court in the Atari\\-case said so, and had Atari succeeded in their tries, they would have not had to result to illegal methods to get a hold of the code.\n\n### Zapping the chip\n\nWhile Atari's \"Rabbit\" chip was ill\\-gotten gains, other companies made different legal workarounds: Interrupt the function of the chip by *shocking* the CIC? That's legal.\n\n[GameBoy Authentification](https://youtu.be/I1cUIGHZLGA?list=TLPQMjQwOTIwMjK-hrfOcqorbQ)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe [GameBoy](https://youtu.be/I1cUIGHZLGA?list=TLPQMjQwOTIwMjK-hrfOcqorbQ) used a variant system.

The GB BootROM relied on loading and then checking if the game was offering the Nintendo logo. If the logo wasn't readable, it would not boot. To make a game run, the most simple way would be to include the Nintendo Logo. There is a more complex solution that first displays the maker's logo and then offers the Nintendo Logo for verification in the second step.\n\n### The simple solution: just display Nintendo\\-TM\n\nIf the game simply offered the official, registered Nindendo logo, it would offer to be endorsed or made by Nintendo. This would be a violation of the Nintendo trademarks, and illegal.\n\n### Tricking the chip\n\nBy displaying the own logo on the step 1 but offering the Nintendo\\-TM Logo in the 2nd step, the solution is very akin to the [Lexmark Cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexmark_International,_Inc._v._Static_Control_Components,_Inc.).

It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape. Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so.\n\n> Where the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.\n\nThis case does not generally prohibit using deadly force to arrest someone who is fleeing in a vehicle, as vehicles are deadly weapons. A person fleeing police in a car poses a threat to pursuing officers and the general public so it is up to local policy and the officers on scene to weigh the risk of public harm against the interest of taking suspects alive and the risk of attempting to use deadly force against them.

Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The officer's actions are justifiable as the fleeing vehicle posed an immediate threat to public safety\nB) The officer violated federal law, as there is a bright-line rule prohibiting shooting at all fleeing suspects\nC) The officer's actions likely violate both department policy and constitutional standards for use of deadly force\nD) The officer's actions are permissible because school safety officers have full law enforcement authority off-campus\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex legal considerations. According to the Tennessee v. Garner precedent, using deadly force against fleeing suspects is only constitutionally reasonable if the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious physical harm to the officer or others. While fleeing in a vehicle can potentially pose such a threat, the circumstances described don't clearly indicate an immediate danger.\n\nMoreover, the documentation mentions that the Long Beach Police Department policy prohibits firing at moving vehicles and fleeing suspects. The officer's actions appear to violate this policy.\n\nThe question also touches on the issue of off-campus authority. While the full extent of a school safety officer's off-campus authority isn't clear from the given information, their actions are still bound by constitutional standards and department policies.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the scenario doesn't provide enough information to justify the claim of immediate threat. Option B is wrong because there isn't a federal bright-line rule prohibiting shooting at all fleeing suspects; the law is more nuanced. Option D is incorrect because, even if the officer had full off-campus authority, their actions would still be subject to constitutional standards and department policies.\n\nOption C best captures the complexity of the situation, acknowledging both the likely policy violation and the constitutional issues raised by the use of deadly force in this scenario."}, "72": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/19189/when-must-a-document-be-kept-confidential", "docs_id": 19189, "title": "When must a document be kept confidential?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I applied for a job and received an offer.

Factual impossibility occurs when a person intends to commit a crime but fails due to a factual circumstance unknown to them at the time of the act. In this case:\n\n1. John had the intent (mens rea) to commit theft and trespassing.\n2. He performed actions that would typically constitute these crimes.\n3.

I'm also equally assured of users' familiarity with the Amendment that follows, and they are thus aware of the rights it affords to the defendant, which includes one to confront adverse witnesses and obtain favourable ones via a compulsory process.\n\nIn my opinion, the rights that I have stated in the previous paragraph are in conflict with each other in certain scenarios. For example, what happens if the state's witness invokes their Fifth Amendment right on cross\\-examination or a defence witness, whom the state refuses to give immunity, does the same on direct examination?\n\nI am aware that a witness may not want to expose themselves to prosecution, but would they deprive a defendant's right to a full defence in doing so?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes, there is indeed a conflict, often described as a balancing act. Similarly, the principle of free speech protected by the First Amendment requires that the public tolerate lies in political rhetoric, and hateful public speech and insults, but can be balanced against an individual's interest in reputation in a libel case. See *Near vs Minnesota* and *NY Times vs Sullivan* for leading cases on this issue. There is also tension between the right of a newspaper to report on a current criminal case again under the First Amendment, and the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial before an unbiased jury, which might be influenced by newspaper publicity.\n\nIn these and similar situations, there is no way to fully serve both protected interests, and courts must strike a balance and prefer one right over another, or find some compromise.\n\nIn the 5th vs 6th situation, courts have mostly favored the 5th. That is, the court will not require a witness to give up the right not to self\\-incriminate, and usually will not grant a defendant an acquittal because desired testimony is unavailable.\n\nIt might be that a defendant expected to rely on the testimony of a witness who has since died, or has fled the country and cannot be brought before the court. The sixth does not and cannot assure perfect justice, and the courts do not attempt to make it do so.\n\nIn the situation described, the defendant may compel the witness to appear and be asked the relevant questions. The jury will hear the answer, and may assume what it would have been without the invocation of the Fifth. The defendant's lawyer can try to find a question that the witness will answer, and can argue that the refusal to answer is consistent with a not\\-guilty verdict. That is all that the courts provide.\n\nWhen the **prosecution** calls a witness, knowing or having good reason to know that the witness will invoke the 5th on more or less every relevant question, the US Supreme Court in *Namet v. United States* 373 U.S. 179 (1963\\) has held that this may be error requiring overturning the conviction. This was confirmed and expanded in *Douglas v. Alabama* 380 U.S. 415 (1965\\).

How might this scenario most likely be resolved in court, considering the tension between Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights?\n\nA) The court will compel the witness to testify, prioritizing the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a full defense\nB) The judge will declare a mistrial due to the irreconcilable conflict between constitutional rights\nC) The witness will be allowed to invoke the Fifth Amendment, and the defense can argue inferences from this invocation\nD) The court will grant automatic immunity to the witness to ensure the defendant's right to a fair trial\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the complex interplay between Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights in a real-world scenario. The correct answer is C, which aligns with the documentation's explanation of how courts typically handle this conflict. \n\nThe answer reflects that courts generally favor the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination over the Sixth Amendment right to a full defense. As stated in the documentation, \"the court will not require a witness to give up the right not to self-incriminate, and usually will not grant a defendant an acquittal because desired testimony is unavailable.\"\n\nThe defendant can still compel the witness to appear and be asked questions, even if the witness invokes the Fifth Amendment. This allows the jury to hear the invocation and potentially draw inferences.

Disbursements can include 'fees' which are paid by a lawyer on a client's behalf \u2013 the dictionary definition includes the example of expert witness fees, but a more common example is a filing fee charged by a court to commence a lawsuit. However, when used in contrast to 'disbursements,' 'fees' often refer to lawyers' professional fees. These tend to be charged by the hour and form the majority of litigation costs. Wikipedia calls them [attorney's fees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney%27s_fee).\n\n**Costs** are the combination of fees and disbursements which the losing party can be ordered to pay to the winning party. The source you have quoted from explains a common feature of the law of costs in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada: disbursements are often recoverable in full, while professional fees can only be recovered in part. This ensures that the loser is not responsible for the winner's decision to hire unusually expensive lawyers, although in many jurisdictions even an average lawyer will charge fees well in excess of the recoverable amount.

Under the new rules effective January 1, 2011, how should these expenses be categorized and what is the maximum amount that can be claimed for them?\n\nA) $225 as a single disbursement for preparing and filing the claim\nB) $100 as a disbursement for preparing the claim, and $75 as a separate fee for filing\nC) $100 as a disbursement for preparing the claim, with no recovery for filing costs\nD) $150 as a fee for preparing the claim, and $75 as a disbursement for filing\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the new rules and understanding the distinction between disbursements and fees. The key points are:\n\n1. The new rules changed the categorization of claim preparation costs from a fee to a disbursement.\n2. The maximum allowable amount for preparing pleadings is now $100, regardless of actual costs.\n3. The new disbursement covers only the preparation of pleadings, not filing them.\n4. Filing costs are no longer recoverable under this provision.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the $100 cap or the exclusion of filing costs. Option B incorrectly categorizes the filing cost as recoverable. Option D incorrectly categorizes the preparation cost as a fee rather than a disbursement and wrongly includes the filing cost.\n\nOption C is correct because it properly categorizes the preparation cost as a disbursement, limits it to the maximum $100 despite the higher actual cost, and excludes the filing cost. This reflects the change in the rules that aims to provide partial compensation for legal fees in preparing claims while limiting the overall recoverable amount.\n\nThis question tests the ability to integrate multiple concepts from the documentation, apply the new rules to a specific scenario, and understand the nuanced changes in how costs are categorized and limited in Small Claims Court."}, "81": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/32282/what-makes-a-stock-exchange-private", "docs_id": 32282, "title": "What makes a stock exchange \u201cprivate\u201d?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I\u2019m trying to understand the difference between a public and a private stock exchange, or any exchange for that matter.\n\nI guess that I and another 10 people made an agreement and started trading some stocks among ourselves, that would be a private exchange... and we could apply any trading/investment rules we decide, right ?\n\nNow, if we allow more people on our platform (of course they would have to sign our agreement), would that still be a private exchange?

In practice, there is very little middle ground. \n\nMost companies either have just a handful of owners and investment debt holders (i.e. are closely held), or have a great many (typically thousands), while few are near the threshold between being closely held and public held.

Isn't the actual moment of the shooting the most important part of the video?\n\nWas this to prevent bias? Why was the video evidence of the not used in the case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The non\\-release of video evidence prior to the trial's completion would be to prevent potential jurors from being tainted, because jurors are required to obtain their knowledge of the facts of the case solely from what is presented to them at trial. Someone who saw the full video prior to the trial would be ineligible to serve as a juror in the case in much the same way that witnesses of a crime can not serve on the jury in a trial arising from that crime.\n\nThe fact that he was acquitted meant that the case could never be retried.

If not, the defendant may move to change the venue of the case to a court less familiar with the case.\n\nYou are incorrect in your belief that the video evidence was not used in the case. \n\nThe fact that the video was \"under seal\" doesn't imply that it wasn't used at trial.

The correct answer, B, aligns with the information provided in the documentation and best practices in criminal proceedings.\n\nKeeping the video under seal until after jury selection addresses several key points:\n\n1. It prevents potential jurors from being tainted by pre-trial exposure to crucial evidence, as mentioned in the documentation: \"jurors are required to obtain their knowledge of the facts of the case solely from what is presented to them at trial.\"\n\n2. It allows for the full video to be used as evidence during the trial, which is crucial for a fair proceeding. The documentation notes that \"the full video was the highlight of the trial.\"\n\n3.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, \"The taxpayer (employee, in this case) is liable for tax on income earned by him.\" This fundamental principle places the primary responsibility on John.\n\n2. The documentation also specifies that \"Failure by the payor to withhold the required amount of tax does NOT excuse the taxpayer from paying tax on the income he earned.\" This directly addresses the situation with Company Y's failure to withhold.\n\n3.

The employee remains responsible for paying the correct amount of tax on their total income.\n\n4. The scenario mirrors the example given in the documentation, where Company B (analogous to Company Y in our question) correctly asserts that the employee is responsible for paying the tax.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring the integration of multiple concepts and applying them to a real-world scenario.

Co\\-founders B and C will be continuing their work on the same startup project, and wouldn't want to deal with any future consquences.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The three partners presumably created some variation of an \u00a7 705 BGB partnership (*Gesellschaft b\u00fcrgerlichen Rechts*). Their rights and obligations are established via their mutual contract, which does not even have to be written as long as no real estate is involved. However, this contract is bounded by the BGB.\n\nThe partner A who wants to leave can terminate the partnership contract at any time. Depending on the terms of the contract, this will dissolve the partnership (default consequence), or the partnership will continue with the other members B and C. In either case, A will receive their share of the assets of the partnership. The BGB provides a default procedure:\n\n* objects that were handed over to the partnership are returned, without compensation for use or accidental loss\n* outstanding debts of the partnership are discharged, or sufficient assets are set aside for later discharge\n* from the remaining assets, A's capital contributions are returned. This includes both monetary and non\\-monetary contributions, but not services performed by A.\n* if there is a surplus/profit, it is divided among the members. However, the correct division can be difficult to determine since it shall depend on the member's share/contribution to the profit, not necessarily on their capital contributions to the partnership.\n* similarly, if there is a deficit, everyone has to make further contributions to the degree that they are responsible for those losses\n\nSo this means that yes, for all practical purposes the partners B and C can \u201cbuy out\u201d A, if A voluntarily terminates the contract. B and C would have to pay to A either according to the terms set out in the contract, or by default:\n\n* A's capital contributions to the partnership\n* plus/minus the profit/losses for which A is responsible\n\nSince you mention that the founder's agreement describes an allocation of \u201cequity\u201d, this may help with the division of profits.\n\nBut starting with a non\\-notarized partnership and presumably shoddy bookkeeping, trying to reconstruct all contributions and everyone's share of the profit/losses is going to be an utter mess \u2013 the typical divorce is probably easier to sort out. If there are non\\-negligible sums involved, everyone (and especially A) should get a lawyer to represent them in the ensuing negotiations. Nothing prevents the partners from reaching an unanimous agreement, but everyone would still be interested in getting this agreement negotiated by legal professionals to make sure that no future demands remain. Legal professionals are costly, but if this startup idea works out these DIY contracts will end up being far more costly.\n\nFurther potential factors that might complicate things:\n\n* depending on the goals or the structure of the partnership, different rules might apply. In particular, this might be the case if the goal of the partnership was trade.\n* Some of the non\\-monetary assets that would return to A might be essential for the continuation of the partnership by B and C. This would give A substantial leverage during negotiations, unless there are already contractual provisions for continued use. For example, the comments point out issues around intellectual property.\n* A is not required to exit the partnership. B and C can exclude A from the partnership only with cause, and only if the partnership will continue to exist when one member leaves. Of course, B and C have the same termination rights as A, so they could terminate the partnership and start a new partnership.

But I gather that the last bullet encompasses the sense of your question *whether the calculation of overtime depends on the sequence of schedules*. The answer is no.\n\nThe language in (iii) has no indication that the 11\\-hour schedule needs to precede the 9\\-hour schedule even if it is written in that order. Notice how (iii) is in terms of \"*any **other** day*\" instead of \"*a **later** date*\". The term \"*other*\" is more flexible or wider encompassing \\-\\-in terms of chronology\\-\\- than a term such as \"*later*\".\n\nThus, as an example, suppose an employee worked three days giving a total of 27 hours in a week. Clearly he did not exceed 38 hours (also assume for simplicity that (ii) and the clause on \"roster cycle\" are inapplicable). If the employee's schedules were 10, 10, and 7 hours, he gets no overtime because he never exceeded 11 hours.\n\nBy contrast, if the employee's schedules were 12, 2, and 13 hours, respectively, then gets (13\\-11\\) \\+ (12\\-9\\) \\= (13\\-9\\) \\+ (12\\-11\\) \\= 5 hours at overtime rate.

Let's break down each option:\n\nA) Results in 70 hours total. 32 hours of overtime due to exceeding 38 hours per week (subclause i), but no additional overtime from subclause iii.\n\nB) Results in 72 hours total. 34 hours of overtime from subclause (i), plus 1 hour from the 12-hour day (subclause iii), totaling 35 overtime hours.\n\nC) Results in 70 hours total. 32 hours of overtime from subclause (i).

Are there prior lawsuits related to this? I'm mostly interested in the particular case where the copy is not reproduced, but kept private.\n\n---\n\nI've recently learned that this is indeed the case. This came as a huge surprise to me since:\n\n1. \\[First of all] most browsers retain a copy of the HTML (for the period of the visit or much longer, if caching is enabled)\n2. Proxy servers often keep cached copies of these files\n3. Web archives (like Google's) not only copy all assets of a site it find to keep historical versions of these pages but also make available to the general public these historical copies.\n4. Programs that scrape external sites often have in their repositories copies of (likely copyrighted) HTML for testing purposes\n\nNumber (4\\) is the one that directly affects the company I work for, since we do web analysis and therefore write programs that visit other sites. For example, we make extensive use of [vcrpy](https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy) library to record external accesses and test our code against these \"frozen\" HTMLs.\n\nAlso, specifically in our case, we don't really copy the entirety of any site, since we are only concerned with a subset of its pages, but from what I've been informed, that doesn't seem to qualify as \"fair use\", such as quoting a passage of a book (where, in a sense, the book would be analogous to the entire site with all its public assets). We don't even copy assets like CSS files or images, so we can't reproduce the actual content in full.\n\nAfter I was told that such copies are likely unlawful, we are not only being limited to explore more robust testing methodologies (which would likely make use of a large amount of HTML copied from the web in a local storage) but the current use of vcrpy library has become something that demanded analysis (as it's not clear if our use of it is unlawful).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *You are clearly seeking legal advice. Answers on this site come from anonymous people on the internet and are not legal advice. You should not act based on information from this site.*\n\nI am unaware of any lawsuit where one would be sued for merely storing and reading HTML for personal use. \n\n**Downloading a webpage is probably not a copyright violation.** Most things you create, including HTML source code, are protected by copyright and copyright includes the exclusive right to choose who can read what you created. I couldn't find any actual reference to this but I would hazard a guess that displaying an HTML webpage online is implicitly allowing others to read that code. I believe this guess is correct because all modern web browsers have the capability to view source that nobody considers illegal and browsers also include the capability to save webpages to disk.

Services such as Google, Bing or the Wayback Machine go far beyond what you are doing.

He left saying: \u201cI have no idea what happened\u201d. Next day, another guy \\- \u201csomeone\u201d just to quote what the landlord said \\- came over, left with the same result. Nothing happened for 8 days, and then, at 3rd of September another investigator came, who also left with: \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d.\n\nHe's just asking for the property management company, and... they repaired the lift in 2 months, so not much hopes.\n\nAs I\u2019ve read, in the UK law, the landlord must carry out repairs in a reasonable period of time. Not too sure if carry out means completing the works, or just starting the process, but if he chooses the cheapest slowest workers, it may end up even one year, and I\u2019ll have to live in a hotel for that long just because the landlord says: \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any delay on my side\u201d.\n\nSo when can I sue the landlord for disrepair \\- not fixing the problems in time?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Pretty much any time a contractual, statutory or case law precedent uses the word \"reasonable\" what it means is that the decision regarding what is and is not reasonable is vested in the trier of fact (i.e. the judge in a U.K. landlord\\-tenant case) to decide on a case by case basis in light of all of the facts and circumstances presented at trial, rather something to be decided as a matter of law by an appellate court absent of extreme abuse of discretion by the judge in determining what is reasonable.\n\nPut yourself in the judge's shoes and consider the range of opinion that people who are judges in a case like this might have, and you have your answer.\n\nA reasonable amount of time balances out factors like the availability of repair contractors at a reasonable price, the magnitude of the repair, and the extent to which the repair impairs the habitability of the premises, and assumes a time frame that would apply if the landlord is diligent and trying to solve the problem in good faith. A reasonable time to fix a broken heating element is different in July than in January.\n\nIf three different inspectors failed to determine the cause of the problem, that is going to work in favor of the landlord for a longer period of time. So will the significant extent of the damage (apparently). On the other hand, the fact that the repair rendered the premises completely uninhabitable argues for a shorter time period.\n\nStarting late to address an urgent problem could be breach, although it doesn't sound like this has happened here if some action has been taken that would seem to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results have been inconclusive about what to do. Unnecessary foot dragging could also be a fact in reasonableness, because ultimately the duty is to get the job done.\n\nThere may also be a parallel duty of the landlord to provide a habitable premises and to compensate you for time when this is not provided, in addition to the duty to repair within a reasonable time. Asking to be paid for alternative accommodations while diagnosis and repairs are underway would be a logical demand to make before suing for a fairly small dollar amount in an ongoing lease.\n\nYou would probably focus on failure to repair in a reasonable time more if you seek to terminate the lease entirely and rent elsewhere instead in the face of repair delays, hoping to avoid the duty to pay rent for the remainder of the lease term due to the landlord's breach of the duty to repair under the lease.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Certainly!

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate next step because:\n\n1. It acknowledges the landlord's duty to provide habitable premises and compensate for periods when this is not met, as mentioned in the documentation: \"There may also be a parallel duty of the landlord to provide a habitable premises and to compensate you for time when this is not provided.\"\n\n2. It represents a balanced approach, neither rushing to litigation (as in option A) nor being overly passive (as in option B).\n\n3. It aligns with the advice given: \"Asking to be paid for alternative accommodations while diagnosis and repairs are underway would be a logical demand to make before suing.\"\n\n4. It allows for continued negotiation and potentially avoids unnecessary legal action, while still asserting the tenant's rights.\n\nOption A is premature, as the documentation suggests that \"reasonable time\" is subjective and considers factors like the complexity of the problem and the landlord's efforts.

Which of the following approaches would best address the potential conflict of interest while complying with FTC guidelines?\n\nA) Write objective reviews of the products without mentioning the payment, focusing solely on technical specifications and features.\n\nB) Accept the payment but only write posts targeting corporate buyers, avoiding individual consumers who might be more easily misled.\n\nC) Disclose the payment relationship prominently in each post and ensure all opinions expressed are honest and not exaggerated beyond claims the company could legally make.\n\nD) Decline the paid opportunity but request free product samples to review, without disclosing this arrangement to readers.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the FTC guidelines and application to a real-world scenario. The correct answer, C, aligns with the FTC's core principles as outlined in the documentation. The FTC emphasizes that \"if there's a connection between an endorser and the marketer that consumers would not expect and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement, that connection should be disclosed.\" Furthermore, the guidelines state that \"an endorsement must reflect the honest opinion of the endorser and can't be used to make a claim that the product's marketer couldn't legally make.\"\n\nOption A violates the disclosure requirement by not mentioning the payment. Option B attempts to sidestep the issue by targeting only corporate buyers, but this doesn't exempt the blogger from disclosure requirements and could still mislead individual consumers who might read the posts. Option D involves accepting free products without disclosure, which still falls under the FTC's guidance on material connections that should be disclosed.\n\nThe correct approach (C) addresses the key elements of the FTC guidelines: prominently disclosing the paid relationship, ensuring honest opinions are expressed, and not making claims beyond what the company could legally make. This option demonstrates the integration of multiple concepts from the documentation and applies them to a realistic scenario, testing critical thinking rather than mere recall."}}
