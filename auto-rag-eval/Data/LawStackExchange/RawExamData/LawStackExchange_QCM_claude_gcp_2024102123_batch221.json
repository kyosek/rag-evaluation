We live in the US while my wife finishes school (2\\-3 years) on an F1 visa and then plan to move to back to the EU. My wife will give birth to our child in the US, but I would like to not register my child as a US citizen.\n\nUS citizenship has a lot of benefits, but those come with added responsibility. I want that to be my child's choice.\n\nCan I choose to not register my child as a US citizen? Can I register them with an 18yoa deadline for them to choose citizenship?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can I choose to not register my child as a US citizen?\n\nNo. Your child will be a US citizen regardless of whether you register anything, and (unless you have spent less than 5 years in the US, or less than 2 years after you turned 14\\) *regardless of the place of birth,* because (in that case) even if the child is born outside the US he or she will be a US citizen under [8 USC 1401(g)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1401#g).\n\n> Can I register them with an 18yoa deadline for them to choose citizenship?\n\nNo. Your child probably (depending on your wife's citizenship, and assuming birth in the US) will be a dual citizen from birth without the need or the ability to choose. On turning 18, the child will be able to renounce either citizenship, but will not be required to renounce US citizenship and will probably not be required to renounce the other citizenship either.\n\n(I am not familiar with all EU countries' citizenship laws, so the law of that country might have a requirement to choose, but there is no such requirement in the countries whose laws I am familiar with. If the other country is the Netherlands, the child will risk losing Dutch citizenship on turning 28 unless he or she takes steps to avoid that or unless the law changes.)\n\nAs pointed out in a comment on Putvi's answer, if you successfully avoid letting the US know about your child's birth, you would be in the awkward position of needing to get a visa for the child if you ever want the child to leave and reenter the country. Otherwise, the child would be an illegal alien in the eyes of the US (this assumes you've managed to hide the child's place of birth). There is no process available to get visas in the US for (non\\-diplomatic) children born in the US, of course, because such children are citizens of the US.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A US citizen and his EU-citizen wife have a child born in the United States. The parents want to give their child the option to choose US citizenship at age 18. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the child's citizenship status?\n\nA) The parents can choose not to register the child as a US citizen, allowing the child to decide at age 18.\nB) The child will automatically be a US citizen, but the parents can file for a special 18-year deferment on citizenship decision.\nC) The child will be a dual citizen of the US and the EU country, with no requirement to choose between them at 18.\nD) The parents can avoid US citizenship for their child by not informing US authorities about the birth.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The child born in the US to a US citizen parent automatically becomes a US citizen at birth, regardless of registration. There is no process to defer or postpone this citizenship, nor can parents choose to not make their child a citizen. The child will likely be a dual citizen of both the US and the EU country (depending on the specific EU country's laws). At 18, the child may choose to renounce either citizenship but is not required to do so. Options A, B, and D are incorrect as they suggest ways to avoid or defer US citizenship, which is not possible under these circumstances."

I'm not aware of any such prosecutions.\n\n[Section 15 (3\\) of the Terrorism Act 2000](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/15) makes it an offence for a person to provide money or other property if he knows or has reasonable cause to suspect will or may be used for the purposes of terrorism. \n\n[Section 17](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/17) makes it an offence for a person to enter into or become concerned in an arrangement as a result of which money or other property is made available or is to be made available to another, and the person knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that it will or may be used for the purposes of terrorism. \n\n[Section 17A](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/17A) makes it an offence for an insurer to make a payment under an insurance contract against kidnapping and ransom if he knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that the money or other property has been, or is to be, handed over in response to a terrorist demand.\n\n[Section 18](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/18) makes it an offence for someone to enter into or become concerned in an in an arrangement which facilitates the retention or control by or on behalf of another person of terrorist property.\n\nIf a person becomes aware in the course of his trade, profession or business (e.g. the banker assembling the money) that someone may be arranging a ransom to pay a terrorist, [section 19](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/19) makes it an offence for that person to not disclose to a constable as soon as reasonably practicable his belief or suspicion and the information on which it is based.\n\nIn terms of maritime piracy kidnappings in the area of Somalia for example, although the Government has tried to link them to terrorism there is no direct evidence of systematic links. But if it became known that such a connection exists, then the knowledge or suspicion element of the terrorist financing offences might be provable. \n\nIn [Masefield AG v Amlin Corporate Member \\[2011] EWCA Civ 24](https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2011/24.html) (a case partly about whether ransom payments by shipowners to pirates were as a matter of English law against public policy) the Court of Appeal was not aware of illegality in the payment of ransoms under international law.\n\nThe UK Government supported the adoption of [UN Security Council Resolution 2133 in January 2014](https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2133%20%282014%29), which among other things \"Calls upon all Member States to prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments or from political concessions and to secure the safe release of hostages\".",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Under UK law, which of the following scenarios would most likely be considered illegal when paying a ransom?\n\nA) A family paying kidnappers to release their child, with no known terrorist connections\nB) A shipping company paying Somali pirates to release a captured vessel and crew\nC) An insurance company paying a ransom to a known terrorist group for the release of an insured individual\nD) A businessman personally negotiating and paying a ransom to release his kidnapped employee from a criminal gang\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is likely legal as there's no known terrorist connection, and paying ransoms is generally not illegal in the UK.\nB) is probably legal based on the Masefield AG v Amlin Corporate Member case, which found no illegality in shipowners paying ransoms to pirates.\nC) is illegal under Section 17A of the Terrorism Act 2000, which prohibits insurers from making payments they know or suspect will be used for terrorist demands.\nD) is likely legal as it involves a criminal gang rather than terrorists, and there's no indication the businessman is acting as an insurer.\n\nThe key distinction is the involvement of terrorism. While paying ransoms is generally not illegal in the UK, the Terrorism Act 2000 creates specific offenses related to financing terrorism, including ransom payments to terrorist groups."

Even if there were no external factors was the poor state of the roof something the owners could or should have known?\n3. It is highly likely that even if the first 2 are proven, that damage to M would not be reasonably foreseeable in a legal sense.

So does Title VI\n----------------------------------\n\nThe US Department of Justice (DoJ) has issued a [*Title IX Legal Manual*](https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix#IV.%C2%A0%20Discriminatory%20Conduct). This reads in the section  [Scope of Coverage](https://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix#III.%C2%A0%20Scope%20of%20Coverage):\n\n> Title IX prohibits, with certain exceptions, any entity that receives \"federal financial assistance\" from discriminating against individuals on the basis of sex in education programs or activities. The clearest example of federal financial assistance is the award or grant of money. However, federal financial assistance may also be in nonmonetary form. See *United States Dept of Transp. v. Paralyzed Veterans*, 477 U.S. 597, 607 n.11 (1986\\).\n\nMuch the same is true of Title VI of the Civil Rights act of 1964\\.\n\nThe term \"federal financial assistance\" is interpreted quite broadly, and most, perhaps all, community colleges will be within the scope of Title IX and Title VI.\n\nFederal Anti\\-discrimination Law\n--------------------------------\n\n[Nolo's page](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/federal-antidiscrimination-laws-29451.html) lists several laws (all should spply to any community college) and their scope, including:\n\n* **Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964** (42 U.S.C. 2000e and following)\n\n> prohibits employers from discriminating against applicants and employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin (including membership in a Native American tribe). It also prohibits employers from retaliating against an applicant or employee who asserts his or her rights under the law.\n* **Pregnancy Discrimination Act**\n\n> amended Title VII to make it illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, or a related medical condition\n* **Age Discrimination in Employment Act** (29 USC 621\\-634\\).\n* **Americans With Disabilities Act** (42 U.S.C. 12101\\-12213\\).\n* **Equal Pay Act** (29 U.S.C. 206(d))\n* **Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986** (IRCA) (8 U.S.C. 1324\\).\n\n> IRCA prohibits employers from discriminating against applicants and employees on the basis of their citizenship or national origin. IRCA's prohibition on discrimination applies to all terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, including hiring, firing, compensation, benefits, job assignments, promotions, and discipline.\n* **Civil Rights Act of 1866** (Section 1981\\)\n\n> Although the law's original purpose was to protect African Americans, courts have interpreted it to protect people of all races from discrimination and harassment. Section 1981 has also been interpreted to prohibit discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, if the discrimination is racial in character.  \n> \n> Section 1981 protects all private employees and all employees of state and local governments. It also protects independent contractors from discrimination by hiring firms and protects partners in a partnership from discrimination. It does not apply to federal employees, however.\n* **Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act** (42 U.S.C. 2000ff and following).",

Both the instructor and the college can potentially be held liable under various anti-discrimination laws, including Title IX. Community colleges that receive any form of federal financial assistance (which most do) are subject to Title IX and other federal anti-discrimination laws. These laws prohibit discrimination based on sex, gender identity, and sexual orientation, among other protected characteristics. \n\nThe instructor's actions would likely violate Title IX and potentially other federal and state anti-discrimination laws. The college could be held liable for the instructor's discriminatory behavior if it knew or should have known about the conduct and failed to take appropriate corrective action. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while the college can indeed be sued under Title IX, individual employees can also be named in lawsuits for their discriminatory actions.\n\nAnswer B is incorrect because the college is not exempt from liability. In fact, the institution often bears significant responsibility in such cases.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because community colleges are not exempt from Title IX or other federal anti-discrimination laws regardless of their tuition costs.

The agent we're going through wanted a holding deposit when we agreed to start the process (fine), which came with an agreement that the deposit is returned if we sign the tenancy agreement (reasonable), but *not* returned if we don't (ok, so they're protecting themselves against some loon block\\-reserving their entire property listing. Fine). I agreed because the justification sounded reasonable (with hindsight: I am not a smart man).\n\nThe fees had to be paid before seeing the tenancy agreement. The agency has thus far refused to negotiate terms on any bit of paper it's got me to sign (so we're clear: not asking about that. I ultimately agreed to the conditions, I understood the implications).\n\nThe question: **Is it legal to have a deposit that is non\\-returnable on the basis of not signing a contract that the consumer hasn't had a chance to read before agreeing to the deposit terms?**\n\nI understand that a contract, in principal, needs to be fair (<http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/2083/introduction/made>), but what if it wasn't fair? Could they have claimed it was fair, and refuse to amend any terms (at which point, I'd have had a \"take it or leave it\" contract that if I don't sign, I'm out of pocket)?\n\nI'm aware the situation described is at least ethically dubious, but it seems to me that if they refused to negotiate, if I do sign it would be under some sort of duress (?) for the sum of money I'd be out\\-of\\-pocket by?\n\nLikewise, this looks similar to the EULA sort of question that arises (pay money for a product behind terms that you can't read until you pay money).\n\n(again, so we're clear: it's a situation that happened to me, but if I want actual legal advice I'll call a solicitor. The question is more that I don't understand enough about contract law to work out whether or not this was legally questionable rather than just the agency screwing me).\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Competent parties can contract for any terms that are not forbidden by law, and a contract is valid if each party provides consideration (i.e., something of value). It sounds like the contract you're questioning is essentially, \"I will give you money in exchange for you showing me an agreement and giving me the option to sign it.\" The act of \"showing an agreement\" evidently has some value, as does the \"option to sign,\" so your counterparty has provided consideration. Therefore, the high\\-level answer is that the only way this contract would be inherently flawed would be if a law explicitly forbids it.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the UK rental market, an agency requires a non-refundable holding deposit before allowing potential tenants to view the tenancy agreement. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice?\n\nA) This practice is illegal because it violates the consumer's right to informed consent before entering into a financial agreement.\n\nB) The practice is legal as long as the agency clearly communicates the terms of the holding deposit before accepting payment.\n\nC) This practice is only legal if the agency allows negotiation of the tenancy agreement terms after viewing.\n\nD) The practice is illegal because it constitutes a form of duress, forcing tenants to sign unfavorable contracts to avoid losing their deposit.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The practice of requiring a non-refundable holding deposit before allowing potential tenants to view the tenancy agreement is likely legal, as long as the agency clearly communicates the terms of the holding deposit before accepting payment. This aligns with the principle that competent parties can contract for any terms not forbidden by law, as long as both parties provide consideration. In this case, the agency provides the consideration of showing the agreement and offering the option to sign, while the tenant provides the monetary deposit. The key is that the terms of the holding deposit must be clearly communicated upfront. While this practice may be ethically questionable, it is not inherently illegal unless there are specific laws forbidding it. Options A, C, and D incorrectly assume that this practice is illegal or requires specific conditions to be legal, which is not necessarily the case under contract law principles."

However, in the case of a tenant being responsible for repairs and maintenance, does the tenant own the parts they used to repair an appliance or air conditioner or any other item that was attached to / included with the home? If they do, can they take those parts with them if the lease ends?\n\n(Assume there is no clause in the lease that defines any item's expected condition before or after the lease term.)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: For rentals, lacking any language in the rental agreement, the general rule is any modifications (repairs or upgrades) or installations of permanent fixtures become part of the house and are no longer the property of the tenant. Any of those repairs belong to the house that your landlord owns and as a result belong to your landlord. Further if you go out and buy a wonderful $2,000 glass chandler and hardwood floors for the entrance hall, you cannot take those with you when you leave, unless you have an arrangement with the landlord. A TV wall mount probably wouldn't count though since it is not truly permanent.\n\nIn any case, Its always best to decide terms in the agreement up front than to make a judge decide it latter.\n\nBesides, for your obligation to perform repairs, you probably (/should) get a discount in your rent compared to the counterfactual of the landlord performing repairs.",

The tenant replaces the broken dishwasher with a new, more expensive model. When moving out, the tenant wants to take the new dishwasher. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The tenant can take the dishwasher because they paid for it and installed it themselves.\nB) The tenant must leave the dishwasher but can request compensation from the landlord for the upgrade.\nC) The tenant can only take the dishwasher if they replace it with a model of equal value to the original.\nD) The tenant must leave the dishwasher as it has become a permanent fixture of the property.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the general rule for rentals, any modifications, repairs, or upgrades that become permanent fixtures of the property belong to the landlord, not the tenant. This applies even if the tenant paid for and installed the item themselves. A dishwasher is considered a permanent fixture as it is typically built into the kitchen cabinetry and connected to the property's plumbing. Therefore, the tenant must leave the new dishwasher when moving out, as it has become part of the landlord's property. Options A and C are incorrect because they go against this general rule. Option B, while potentially negotiable with some landlords, is not a legal right of the tenant and thus not the most accurate answer."

The creditors or whoever acquires these rights through the bankruptcy process can then decide how to handle the intellectual property, including continuing to sell the game, licensing it, or even preventing others from using it. The rights don't automatically enter public domain (A), cease to exist (B), or revert to individual employees (D).

This reasoning sounds counterintuitive, but the legislators of the time had noticed that unanimous agreement often indicates the presence of systemic error in the judicial process, even if the exact nature of the error is yet to be discovered. They intuitively reasoned that when something seems too good to be true, most likely a mistake was made.\"\n\nAnd then the article just gets even more surprising from there.\n\nThis isn't a winger website, this is proven scientific material which is either peer reviewed or will be very soon.\n\nI am curious what kind of an impact a talented attorney could have with this kind of material?\nHow flawed are we really?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First \"everything in the legal system\" is much, much more than \"police lineups and a unanimous decision by 12 of your peers\". For a start, police are rarely involved in civil litigation and even in criminal matters lineups are unusual \\- in most criminal cases there is no doubt who should be charged. However, this is tangential to your questions.\n\n**I am curious what kind of an impact a talented attorney could have with this kind of material?**\n\nFile it as a historical curiosity. Ancient Jewish law has much less relevance to modern US law than modern North Korean law does; and since that has two tenths of bugger all I guess about one tenth?\n\n**How flawed are we really?**\n\nIncredibly flawed. \n\nEven setting aside the possibility of corruption; court decisions are influenced by things like when the judge last ate, how long it has been since juror number 4 had sex and if the defence attorney fought with his wife that morning.\n\nFocusing on the relatively simple matter of guilt or innocence; that is simple when compared with sentencing or damages, it is [estimated](http://www.thenation.com/article/how-many-innocent-people-have-we-sent-prison/) that the error rate for false conviction is about 6%. Some of the proximate causes of false conviction are discussed [here](http://www.innocenceproject.org/causes-wrongful-conviction). Root causes go to misaligned incentives for police and prosecutors; they want to close cases and get convictions; In the words of Terry Pratchett, \"If there was a crime, there should be punishment. If the specific criminal should be involved in the punishment process then this was a happy accident, but if not then any criminal would do, and since everyone was undoubtedly guilty of something, the net result was that, in general terms, justice was done.\" <http://www.azquotes.com/quote/473109>\n\nThe error rate for false acquittals should be considerably higher because of the presumption of innocence and the burden of beyond reasonable doubt, however, most defence lawyers would agree that the mere fact that their client is sitting in the box has them half convicted before the jury is empaneled. \n\nHowever, none of that is something you can argue in court.

Therefore, because the objective\n>  principle did not apply, the court looked at the parties\u2019 actual intention.

The essence of mutual mistake is that the parties are at cross\\-purposes; each party has made a different mistake concerning a fundamental element of the contract. \n\nIn this case, the plaintiff was buying hemp but the defendant was selling tow. The defendant did not mislead the plaintiff1 but the circumstances were such that the plaintiff's erroneous conclusion from the available information was reasonable.\n\nWith misrepresentation, the parties are not at odds about the fundamentals but rather one party has caused the other to believe something that is not true. For example, in [Leaf v International Galleries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_v_International_Galleries) 1950, the plaintiff bought a painting that the defendant said was a [Constable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Constable). It wasn't, so the statement was misleading; however, there was no mistake because both parties were in agreement that it was *this* painting that was the subject of the sale.\n\nConsider this example. I mention that I'm thinking of selling my car (my Porche). You've always appreciated my Ferarri and express interest in buying. We agree on a price: you to buy the Ferarri, me to sell the Porche. That is pretty much the textbook definition of mutual mistake. No one misled anyone, we were both not understanding what was being offered and what was being accepted \\- mistake is fundamentally tied to the offer and acceptance in that it is a mistake when they don't line up. \n\nIn contrast, if we realize the mistake and you are still interested in the Porche and ask \"What year is it?\" \\- if I say \"2017\" when it is actually 2016, then that is a misrepresentation. It's not a mistake because we are not at cross\\-purposes; we are both talking about the Porche.\n\n1Silence is not a \\[mis]representation unless there is a legal obligation to divulge information and absent a deliberate attempt to mislead by the silence. For example, if I know the house I'm selling has termites, I don't have to tell you that but I also can't say \"I've had a recent pest inspection\" and then remain silent about what it found because a reasonable person would conclude from my statement that the house has no pests.",

So, is this considered legal in the United States?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Note that \"pedophilia\" is a psycological or social term, and not a legal term. What laws prohibit is the creation, distribution, and possession of [child pronography](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/child-pornography.html) Under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251](https://codes.findlaw.com/us/title-18-crimes-and-criminal-procedure/18-usc-sect-2251.html)\\- Sexual Exploitation of Children:\n\n> Any person who employs, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or coerces any minor to engage in, or who has a minor assist any other person to engage in, or who transports any minor in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, or in any Territory or Possession of the United States, with the intent that such minor engage in, any sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing any visual depiction of such conduct or for the purpose of transmitting a live visual depiction of such conduct, shall be punished as provided under subsection (e), if such person knows or has reason to know that such visual depiction will be transported or transmitted using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or mailed, if that visual depiction was produced or transmitted using materials that have been mailed, shipped, or transported in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce by any means, including by computer, or if such visual depiction has actually been transported or transmitted using any means or facility of interstate or foreign commerce or in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce or mailed.\n\nThis means that there is no offense if no real child is involved, and this is also true of the various other US laws on child porn. Since the case of [*Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition*, 535 U.S. 234 (2002\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition) erotica which appear to depict a minor engaging in sexual activity, but which are **not** depictions of any actual child are protected speech under the US *First Amendment* and are therefor not criminal.\n\nSo called \"furry cub porn\" might include modified images of actual minors, in which case it would seem to be covered under US laws against child porn. But if the character is totally invented, or is based on an adult rather than a minor, then it would seem to come under the rule of *Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition*.\n\nNote, the law in other countries is significantly different. In particular in the UK a realistic drawing may be considered to be a \"pesudo\\-photograph\" even if not based on an actual person, and may be punishable in the same way as an actual photo of an actual minor.\n\nNote also, the making, distribution, or posse ion of 'child porn' is a very serious criminal offense. I am not a lawyer, and one should not rely on this post to determine what acts are and are not legally safe. If there is any question, consult a lawyer.\n\nNote also that under the above statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251\\), something may be \"child pornography\" if the person involved is a minor, even if that person is old enough under local law to consent to sexual activity, and even if the person did in fact so consent, and even if there was no intent to distribute the image or video. So a person taking, say, a cell\\-phone video of him\\- or herself having sex with a 17\\-year\\-old, intended for personal watching only, in a state where the age of consent to sex is 16, can still be found guilty under this law, and such cases have occurred.",

United States* <http://export.cr.yp.to/>), is it legal to use crypto in an area marked by a parking\\-like sign that reads \"***THIS IS A WEAPON FREE ZONE***\"?\n\nFor example, there's some sitting rest area at Austin Seminary in Austin, TX, that has such a sign, should you enter it from the sidewalk on 27th St.\n\nWould the legality of the prohibition in regards to crypto depend on the location of the sign, or on property type? E.g., would it the term \"weapon\" include crypto only if the sign is erected by the federal government?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The definition of munitions includes weapons but is not restricted solely to weapons. From dictionary.com:\n\n> noun\n> \n> \n> 1. Usually, munitions. materials used in war, especially weapons and ammunition.\n> 2. material or equipment for carrying on any undertaking.\n>  verb (used with object)\n> 3. to provide with munitions.\n\nJust because cryptographic technology is listed as a munition doesn't mean it's a weapon. Further, the list of restricted munitions is related to the definition created within the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).\n\n[Part 21 of ITAR](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=86008bdffd1fb2e79cc5df41a180750a&node=22:1.0.1.13.58&rgn=div5), the part that lists and defines munitions for purposes of the regulations, lists \"cryptographic devices\" under Category XIII \\- Materials and Miscellaneous Articles.\n\nFurther, Texas defines weapons, for purposes of a \"Weapons Free School Zone\", in [Texas Penal Code, Title 10, Chapter 46](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PE/htm/PE.46.htm). A \"Weapons Free School Zone\", by itself, doesn't prohibit weapons. It increases the penalty for committing an offense described in the above chapter.\n\nNote: it may still be illegal to take a weapon into a \"Weapons Free School Zone\" depending on other statutes \\- both federal and local. However, the definition of the \"Weapons Free School Zone\" does not, by itself, prohibit the weapon.)\n\nSummary:\n\n* The definition of cryptographic equipment being a munition is one created as part of ITAR.\n* A munition does not always mean weapon\n* The definition of weapons for Texas \"Weapons Free School Zones\" is provided by Texas law, not federal law or regulation (ITAR)\n* The application of the ITAR definition of munitions does not apply to the Texas \"Weapons Free School Zones\" law",

The \"Weapons Free Zone\" sign at a private institution in Texas does not have legal bearing on the use of cryptographic technology for several reasons:\n\n1. While cryptographic technology is classified as a munition under ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), not all munitions are weapons.\n\n2. The definition of weapons in Texas, particularly for \"Weapons Free School Zones,\" is determined by Texas state law (Texas Penal Code, Title 10, Chapter 46), not by federal regulations like ITAR.\n\n3. Cryptographic technology is not included in the Texas legal definition of weapons.\n\n4. The ITAR classification of cryptographic technology as a munition does not automatically apply to state or private institution regulations.\n\n5. The sign itself, especially on private property, does not create law, but may reflect institutional policy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it conflates munitions with weapons and assumes ITAR definitions apply directly to state law. Option B is incorrect because the federal government's involvement in erecting the sign is not relevant to the legal definition of weapons in Texas. Option C is partially correct in its conclusion but incorrectly implies that Texas law explicitly addresses cryptographic technology in its weapons definition."

For\n>  example, if you steal a purse you go to jail, but if you steal a\n>  building you are rarely charged with a criminal offense. It is rarely\n>  to a civil litigant's advantage to bring up criminal matters and there\n>  are ethical rules limiting the interaction between the two.\n\nWhat are the ethical rules that limit interaction between civil and criminal proceedings on the same facts?\n\nThis does seem like a fundamental problem: To my knowledge there is little consideration in criminal code for victim compensation. I don't know what case law conventions exist for this. Every U.S. state has a \"[Crime Victim Compensation Board](http://www.nacvcb.org/)\" which attempts to reimburse victims of *violent* crimes, but that is a bureaucratic process and it appears designed only to cover direct costs resulting from such crimes.\n\nTherefore: If a criminal has significant assets, and the civil law provides for significant punitive damages, then a victim stands to gain far more from a civil judgement or settlement (correct me if I'm wrong) \u2013 to such an extent that a victim of a wealthy defendant would likely refuse to cooperate in any criminal prosecution that could jeopardize his financial gains from a civil action. And without the cooperation of the victim, even if the state wanted to pursue criminal charges, presumably it would decline to because of the difficulty of succeeding.\n\nThis situation runs somewhat counter to the interest of the criminal justice system, which is to punish the offender, not reward the victim. It also allows wealthy criminals to \"buy their way out of jail,\" which is [something the criminal justice system does not like](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/7212/10).\n\nSo is this conflict and result just an \"unfair\" fact of all common\\-law justice?

In many states, a private lawyer is not permitted to threaten to seek a criminal prosecution to gain an advantage in a civil action. A private lawyer, myself included, will often deliberately not pursue criminal charges in order to not impair the ability of a client to collect a judgment.\n\nA prosecutor has wide discretion to prosecute or not when the prosecutor is aware of a crime that there is probable cause to believe was committed. A complaint by the victim is not required in the U.S., but most prosecutors consider a victim's wishes. A prosecutor may ethically make prosecution dependent upon making a victim whole.\n\n> So is this conflict and result just an \"unfair\" fact of all common\\-law\n>  justice?\n\nWhat is \"fair\" is beyond the scope of Law.SE which deals in \"what is\", not in what is \"fair\".\n\n> Or are there mechanisms that exist to satisfy the demands of justice\n>  despite this conflict?\n\nNot really.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A European e-commerce company wants to implement a feature that shows a pop-up to non-European visitors, informing them about their American website. This pop-up would be triggered based on the visitor's IP address geolocation, without storing the IP in cookies or sessions. Under GDPR, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this practice?\n\nA) This practice is strictly prohibited under GDPR and cannot be implemented without explicit user consent.\nB) This practice is always permissible under GDPR and requires no special considerations.\nC) This practice may be permissible under GDPR Article 6(1)(f) as a legitimate interest, provided it doesn't override the user's fundamental rights and freedoms.\nD) This practice is only permissible if the company obtains explicit consent from every visitor before checking their IP address.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to GDPR Article 6(1)(f), processing personal data (in this case, the IP address for geolocation) can be lawful if it's necessary for the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller, as long as these interests are not overridden by the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. Informing users about a potentially more relevant website based on their location could be considered a legitimate interest. The processing is minimal (only using the IP for geolocation without storing it), which reduces the potential impact on users' rights. While explicit consent isn't required in this case, the company should still ensure transparency about this practice in their privacy policy.\n\nOption A is incorrect because GDPR doesn't strictly prohibit this practice. Option B is too broad and ignores the nuances of GDPR requirements. Option D is overly restrictive, as explicit consent isn't always necessary under GDPR if another lawful basis (like legitimate interest) applies."

Copyright protects the specific expression of an idea, not the idea itself. Creating original artwork based on the concept of a grumpy cat with a Santa hat is permissible.\nC) While giving credit is good practice, it does not negate copyright infringement if the image is used without permission.\nD) While linking to content is generally allowed, incorporating such links into a commercial game may still pose legal risks without proper permissions.\n\nThe key point is that creating one's own original work inspired by a concept or idea is allowed, but directly copying others' specific creative expressions without permission is generally not permitted under copyright law, even for popular internet memes."

According to the principle stated in the passage, if the substantive conclusion of the Court of Appeal is correct, the UK Supreme Court is bound to affirm it, regardless of how the Court of Appeal arrived at that conclusion. This is because the UKSC's primary duty is to ensure the correct application of the law, rather than to police the EWCA's adherence to precedent.

Company B did not consent to anything.\n\nCompany B is having its hardware/software check the USB descriptor of the peripheral in various ways before accepting to use it.

Long story short, let's say the product will only function if its USB descriptor entirely mimicks company A's product's USB descriptor.\n\nWhat does the law say about mimicking USB descriptors ? Is there a uniform law over countries on this subject ?\n\nTo give a concrete example, let's consider third party controllers for a video game console.

TechInnovate would need to join the USB Consortium and obtain their own Vendor ID to legally market their product as a USB device, rather than using GameGiant's identifiers.

In this case, the author published on January 1 but didn't register until July 1, which is more than three months later. The infringement began on March 1, before the registration.

Making off without paying is a crime in most if not all jurisdictions, but if you dispute the charge then the usual procedure is to provide proof of identity and contact details. At that point it becomes a civil matter. A car park will have your license plate and likely CCTV, so tracing you is not an issue, and in this case they probably also have your details from when you bought the pass.\n\nHowever in this case it sounds like they were actually holding your car rather than you; in theory you could have walked away and left your car where it was. They may be able to hold on to your car as surety for payment depending on the small print in the contract. However if they do so and lose then they are likely to be on the hook for any costs that could be reasonably be foreseen as a result of depriving you of the use of your car.\n\nThe parking attendant's behaviour *might* be considered to be demanding money with menaces, which is a crime in itself (that's the UK term; I imagine the US has similar laws).",

Our client has recently been made aware that you have registered a confusingly similar domain name: example.co (the \u201cInfringing Domain Name\u201d). Our client is not aware of you having any rights or legitimate interests in respect of that domain name. The Infringing Domain Name links to a site that features emails that were intended to be sent to example.com email addresses (the \"Infringing Site\").\n4. Your use of the Infringing Domain Name and Infringing Site infringe our client's intellectual property rights. The registration of the Infringing Domain Name and the use of the Infringing Site are also likely to mislead and deceive consumers, in breach of the Fair Trading Act 1986, as they represent that the proprietor of the domain name is associated with our client. Consumers may believe there is a connection between \"Example Corp\" and your business, or that your use of the Infringing Domain Name and the Infringing Site is otherwise endorsed by \"Example Corp\".\n5. Our client considers that the Infringing Domain Name has been registered in bad faith to gain some commercial advantage. \n\nWhere example and Example Corp are their name and the domain name. I DO NOT have any ads on that blog. I never made a dime or a penny from that site. The only possible monetary issue is that I used to have (no canceled) an automated email response to all the incoming emails stating that they sent an email to Example.CO and that Example.CO is for sale by me. Couple months ago I added to that automated reply that if anyone is interested in removing any Blog Post, there is a processing \"fee\" of some $$$.\n\n.\n.\n\n***Does it sound like they have any grounds to a win? They never approached me prior to this.***\n\n.\n.\n\n### Dot CO Background\n\nThe .CO TLD was originally owned by the Republic of Columbia. The\n Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigned the .CO to\n Columbia around late 1991\\. In 2001 there was shown a public interest\n in the dot CO as it resembles the well known dot COM. In 2002 the\n delegated entity for dot CO, the University of Los Andes announced\n that it abandoned plans to commercialize the dot CO domain. After a\n long story short, the dot CO was transferred in 2010 to .CO Internet\n SAS, under the regulatory and policy supervision of the Ministry of\n Communications of Colombia. As a final step, in July 2010 the dot CO\n became available to the rest of the world. \n\n### Trade Mark Infringement\n\nThe United States Patent and Trademark Office ([USPTO](http://www.uspto.gov/page/about-trademark-infringement)) offers the following guidance on trademark infringement:\n\n> **What is trademark infringement?**\n> \n> \n> Trademark infringement is the unauthorized use of a trademark or\n>  service mark on or in connection with goods and/or services in a\n>  manner that is likely to cause confusion, deception, or mistake about\n>  the source of the goods and/or services. \n> \n> \n> **What will happen if someone sues me for trademark infringement**\n> \n> \n> \n> ```\n> A trademark owner who believes its mark is being infringed may file a civil action (i.e., lawsuit) in either state court or federal\n> \n> ```\n> \n> court for trademark infringement, depending on the circumstances.\n>  However, in most cases, trademark owners choose to sue for\n>  infringement in federal court. Even when a plaintiff chooses state\n>  court, it may be possible for the defendant to have the case \"removed\"\n>  to federal court.\n> \n> \n> If the trademark owner is able to prove infringement, available\n>  remedies may include the following:\n> \n> \n> * a court order (injunction) that the defendant stop using the accused mark;\n> * an order requiring the destruction or forfeiture of infringing articles;\n> * monetary relief, including defendant's profits, any damages sustained by the plaintiff, and the costs of the action; and\n> * an order that the defendant, in certain cases, pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.\n> \n> \n> Conversely, a court may find instead that\n> \n> \n> 1. you are not infringing the trademark,\n> 2. a defense bars the plaintiff's claim(s), or\n> 3. other reasons exist why the trademark owner is not entitled to prevail.\n> \n> \n> **How do I know whether I'm infringing?** \n> \n> \n> To support a trademark infringement claim in court, a plaintiff must prove that it owns a valid mark, that it has priority (its rights\n>  in the mark(s) are \"senior\" to the defendant's), and that the\n>  defendant's mark is likely to cause confusion in the minds of\n>  consumers about the source or sponsorship of the goods or services\n>  offered under the parties' marks. When a plaintiff owns a federal\n>  trademark registration on the Principal Register, there is a legal\n>  presumption of the validity and ownership of the mark as well as of\n>  the exclusive right to use the mark nationwide on or in connection\n>  with the goods or services listed in the registration. These\n>  presumptions may be rebutted in the court proceedings.\n>  Generally, the court will consider evidence addressing various factors to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion among\n>  consumers. The key factors considered in most cases are the degree of\n>  similarity between the marks at issue and whether the parties' goods\n>  and/or services are sufficiently related that consumers are likely to\n>  assume (mistakenly) that they come from a common source. Other factors\n>  that courts typically consider include how and where the parties'\n>  goods or services are advertised, marketed, and sold; the purchasing\n>  conditions; the range of prospective purchasers of the goods or\n>  services; whether there is any evidence of actual confusion caused by\n>  the allegedly infringing mark; the defendant's intent in adopting its\n>  mark; and the strength of the plaintiff's mark.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Yes it sounds like they have a case they could possibly win**\n\nAssuming their trade mark is valid it clearly pre\\-dates your usage. All that remains is for them to prove that a reasonable person might be confused by your usage \\- that will turn on the facts.\n\nYou have 3 options:\n\n1. Comply\n2. Wait until they start legal action and then comply\n3. Lawyer up!",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A domain owner receives a cease and desist letter claiming trademark infringement for a .co domain similar to an established .com domain. The owner has been posting redirected emails on a blog without monetization. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential legal situation?\n\nA) The domain owner is protected from infringement claims because the .co domain differs from the .com domain.\n\nB) The lack of monetization on the blog eliminates any possibility of trademark infringement.\n\nC) The trademark holder likely has grounds for a case, as confusion and unauthorized use are key factors in infringement.\n\nD) The domain owner's use constitutes fair use and is protected from infringement claims.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nC is correct because the trademark holder appears to have a pre-existing, valid trademark, and the key factors in trademark infringement are likelihood of confusion and unauthorized use. The similarity between the .co and .com domains, along with the posting of misdirected emails, could potentially cause consumer confusion.\n\nA is incorrect because simply having a different top-level domain (.co vs .com) does not protect against infringement if there's still a likelihood of confusion.\n\nB is incorrect because lack of monetization doesn't necessarily prevent infringement. The unauthorized use and potential for confusion are more critical factors.\n\nD is incorrect because the described use doesn't clearly fall under fair use protections. Posting misdirected emails and potentially confusing consumers are not typically considered fair use in trademark law."

While the right to life is generally considered absolute, it does not obligate individuals to accept all medical treatments to prolong life. A DNR order is considered a form of refusing medical treatment, which falls under the principle of patient autonomy and informed consent. This is different from actively ending one's life (suicide), which is why law enforcement may intervene in suicide attempts but not in cases where a patient has a DNR order. The right to refuse treatment, even life-saving treatment, is recognized in medical ethics and law as part of an individual's right to make decisions about their own medical care.\n\nOption A is incorrect because DNR orders apply to patients who are still alive but may experience cardiac or respiratory arrest. Option C is incorrect because DNR orders are not a form of euthanasia, which involves actively ending a life. Option D is incorrect because the Human Rights Act does consider the right to life as fundamental, but this right is interpreted to include the right to refuse treatment in certain circumstances."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the process of researching the legality of coil guns in Massachusetts (University engineering project), I stumbled across Cornell's Legal Information Institute, which offers what appears to be a complete rendition of the entire United States Code, and decided to do a little exploring.\n\nWhile I learned a lot of interesting tidbits of information perusing the U.S.C., I was amazed at how poorly it was structured. I know politics is sticky business, and not everything is going to be clean, but what I saw struck me as exceptionally bad.\n\nIn software design, there's a widely used phrase to describe certain particularly jumbled programs: spaghetti code. This term can be applied to programs which have poor data structure designs, are poorly organized, or simply just don't make logical sense in terms of the way they are laid out. The name comes from how these attributes can be applied to a bowl of spaghetti; it's jumbled and tangled together, and you would be required to really dig deep to find, say, the two ends of a single strand.\n\nAs someone who is very active in open\\-source programming, a development style that fundamentally breeds spaghetti code, my first reaction upon seeing the U.S.C. in its entirety was, **\"Oh my god, this is spaghetti code.\"** The organization is so horribly jumbled.\n\nFor example, in regards to the Titles, why would topics that sound so incredibly broad, such as Title 6 \\- Domestic Security, and Title 12 \\- Banks and Banking, be in the same structural level as Title 23 \\- Highways, or Title 24 \\- Hospitals and Asylums?\n\nWhy do we have Title 14 \\- Coast Guard and Title 32 \\- National Guard when there is Title 10 \\- Armed Forces? The Coast Guard and the National Guard are clearly both a subset of the Armed Forces.\n\nWhy is a \"machine gun\" defined under Title 26 \\- Internal Revenue Code, when every single other type of firearm seems to be defined under Title 18 \\- Crimes and Criminal Procedure? It's not as if Title 26 is redefining a machine gun for the purpose of tax law; Title 18 actually states something along the lines of \"Machine gun, as defined in Title 26 / Section etc etc\".\n\nI could go on and on about the various inconsistencies that I see in regards to how the U.S.C. is structured. Maybe I see it as more of a problem due to my involvement in software development, a field in which structure is paramount to success, but this just doesn't sit right with me. That leads me to my questions (finally):\n\n**1\\. Are there any underlying reasons behind the nonsensical structure of U.S.C. titles? Is it simply a case of \"This is how it's been for awhile, don't fix what isn't broken.\" or is there more to it than that?**\n\n**2\\. Pretend that over the next few election cycles, a super majority of software engineers and computer scientists are elected to the House and Senate. These people take structure very seriously, and they are very unhappy with the structure of the U.S.C. Barring the even more ridiculous case of Congress repealing everything and passing the exact same laws again, just under different Titles/Chapters/etc, would it be possible for Congress to arbitrarily merge, combine, and delete Titles, and to rearrange the location of laws, definitions, etc? Are there laws/regulations governing this?**\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Are there any underlying reasons behind the nonsensical structure of\n>  U.S.C. titles? Is it simply a case of \"This is how it's been for\n>  awhile, don't fix what isn't broken.\" or is there more to it than\n>  that?\n\nFirst of all, the United States Code is generally not designed to be used by non\\-lawyers.\n\nSecond, one of the main ways to research case law interpreting a statute is by doing a boolean search on the code section of that statute. Every time you change a title or section number, you impair the ability of people doing legal research (both judges and lawyers) to find previous case law interpreting the meaning of the statute. \n\nThird, you make it much harder to determine when the substance of the provision was originally enacted (e.g. if you want legislative history or to determine which of two conflicting statutory provisions was enacted first) since an annotated statute will often show when the current section was enacted but will not explain what it was derived from.\n\nFourth, the location of a statute within the context of other statutory sections often informs its meaning. Machine gun may have one definition in two or three laws, and a different one in two or three other laws, and there may be yet other laws where machine gun is an undefined term. Moving a statutory section from one part of the code to another could influence the default definition that one uses for an undefined term changing substantive law.\n\nFifth, usually a new codification will also involve some drafting standards, for example, to add gender neutrality or to avoid notoriously ambiguous constructions (like 250 word sentences). But, it isn't at all uncommon for very slight changes like the position of a comma or the formatting of a section with multiple indents, to result in a change of the likely meaning of a somewhat ambiguous statute and it is pretty much impossible to know a priori when a statutory section is ambiguous until you are confronted with a fact pattern that makes the ambiguity in that context clear. This isn't confined to obscure laws of little importance. For example, the question of whether Obamacare applied in states that hadn't set up their own exchanges hinged on these kinds of issues.\n\nNone of this is to say that you should never recodify the statutes. But, a basically aesthetic motivation that mostly matters to people who make up a tiny portion of the main users of the product (non\\-lawyers) that poses multiple threats to how statutes will be located using legal research tools, and how it will be interpreted once located, means that reorganizing statutes is not something to be done lightly.\n\nIn short, there are a lot of serious, substantive costs that can accompany a recodification of a law.\n\nAs a result, re\\-codification is most often done only as part of an overall omnibus reform of an area of law on the merits where the interest in being able to track prior interpretive caselaw and determine the original meaning of a statute enacted long ago is at its lowest.\n\n> Barring the even more ridiculous case of Congress repealing everything\n>  and passing the exact same laws again, just under different\n>  Titles/Chapters/etc,\n\nThis is not so ridiculous. \n\nMost states have done exactly that one or two times in their history (sometimes more for older states). Also, many newly admitted to the union states also do something similar. For example, the basic template for the statutes in Colorado was the statutes of the state of Illinois. Basically, the first time around, somebody started with an Illinois statute book, eliminated Illinois specific laws and laws that they didn't like, rearranged them and adopted them as the original statutes of the State of Colorado (it may have actually been version 2\\.0 after a stopgap set of statutes, I don't recall which).\n\nAlso, most states completely repeal and readopt all of their statutes in codified form on the recommendation of the codifier to a legislative committee, to reflect the acts passed in the previous session, every year. This doesn't involve overhauls really, but in principle is a complete repeal and reenactment.\n\nWhile the federal government has never overhauled the entire U.S. Code in this manner, it has been done at the level of individual titles of the U.S. Code. \n\nFor example, the most recent major reorganization and overhaul of the structure of the Internal Revenue Code (Title 26\\) was in 1986\\. The copyright laws were overhauled in the late 1970s. Both of those accompanied major substantive changes in those areas of law.\n\nAnother major recodification of many parts of the U.S. Code took place following 9\\-11 in connection with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, which reorganized both the bureaucracy and the associated U.S. Code language associated with dozens of federal agencies.\n\n> would it be possible for Congress to arbitrarily\n>  merge, combine, and delete Titles, and to rearrange the location of\n>  laws, definitions, etc? Are there laws/regulations governing this?\n\nYes. Congress can do so any time it wants by passing a bill (it would be the longest bill ever \\- dozens of volumes long) doing so, and getting the President to sign it. The legislative process would be exactly the same as any other bill.",

Reorganizing the United States Code is complex because it could potentially alter the interpretation and application of laws due to changes in context, numbering, and wording. This is supported by several points in the passage:\n\n1. Changing title or section numbers can impair the ability to find previous case law interpreting statutes.\n2. The location of a statute within the context of other statutory sections often informs its meaning.\n3. Even slight changes in wording or formatting can result in changes to the likely meaning of somewhat ambiguous statutes.\n4. Moving statutory sections can influence the default definitions used for undefined terms, potentially changing substantive law.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because the passage states that the USC is generally not designed to be used by non-lawyers, contradicting this option.\n\nAnswer B is an exaggeration. While reorganization would make researching case law more difficult, it wouldn't make it impossible.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because the passage indicates that Congress does have the authority to reorganize the USC through the normal legislative process, without necessarily repealing and re-enacting all laws."

I'm asking about US laws specifically.\n\nSuppose someone is accused of a crime and the police have sufficient evidence to obtain a search warrant for his computers. However, all of the suspect's activity and data are \"in the cloud,\" hosted remotely by third\\-party servers, data stores, and virtual machines.\n\nCan the police get a search warrant for such third party systems? For instance if he has a virtual machine hosted by Amazon, would they serve the warrant on Amazon, or on the suspect?\n\nWhat could police do if the suspect was using hosts located outside of the U.S.?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Although the USA don't like it, there's a department called INTERPOL which is composed by about 150 countries.\n\nWhen a crime is committed and you need to involve another country to solve it, the sovereignty of each County prevents a police officer from one country acting upon another country. That's when the INTERPOL comes in. They usually requests the police from that country to act up. A judge from that country will grant their local police access to the data to be delivered to the country that requested it.\n\n> Can the police get a search warrant for data 'in the cloud'?\n\nYes. If the servers are located within the boundaries of your own country, it's a normal procedure. But like the above answer states, it's easier to subpoena the records than to execute a search warrant. In a subpoena, the company itself is bound to provide everything the police asks.\n\n> Can the police get a search warrant for such third party systems?\n\nYes. If there's enough probable cause, the investigation can lead to allow the police to try and discover files that are held by servers that store the cloud data. But if the servers are located outside the country and the company does not have any office opened in the country, a search warrant won't have validity in another jurisdiction and the police can't act without breaking the sovereignty principle. That's where the INTERPOL services are handy. The department is built in the principle of polices from different countries helping each other. The downside is that it's too bureaucratic and it takes a lot of time.\n\n> For instance if he has a virtual machine hosted by Amazon, would they serve the warrant on Amazon, or on the suspect?\n\nLike mentioned by @Viktor, if the company has an office within the bounds of your country, it's easier to subpoena the records because that way the company will filter and provide only the data linked to the suspect being investigated. That is, the subpoena will have both the name of the company (Amazon) and the name of the Suspect, so the company can provide only the necessary files.\n\nUpdate\n------\n\n> If the police lack sufficient evidence for a search warrant, but an interpol country was, for some reason, willing to work with the police to collect and provide that information would they be able to use it even if they wouldn't have been able to subpoena a US country?\n\nHypothetically speaking, I see your follow\\-up as a company that **do have** a local office and the Federal Police was turned down by a judge on a warrant/subpoena. In that case, there's no reason for another's country police to act on their own country. The suspect is a foreign suspect, the crime is a foreign crime and the police has no reason to work on it.\n\nBut for the sake of argument, let's say that the local police was turned down by a judge for lack of evidence or something and the suspect has been investigated by a foreign country or whatever. If the information that the local police desires to obtain is available through the INTERPOL, it's most likely to be accepted since it's a data stored by an international police department. In your scenario, the foreign police was granted a legal right to search and collected the data for legal purpose.

When data is stored in foreign countries, U.S. law enforcement must respect international sovereignty. INTERPOL facilitates cooperation between law enforcement agencies of different countries. If a foreign agency obtains the data legally under their jurisdiction and shares it through official INTERPOL channels, it's likely to be admissible in U.S. courts. This maintains the chain of custody and avoids issues of fruit of the poisonous tree. Options A, C, and D involve illegal or unethical methods that would likely make the evidence inadmissible in court."

That way, to view it as intended, the viewer will need to obtain a personal license for the music, for example from a streaming service, and start the music track at the same time as the video starts. The video metadata could point viewers to ways to legally listen to the song, and that it is recommended to view the video with the audio in the background.\n\nWhat license, if any, would this usage require? My intuition is that this still requires the synchronization license, as the video is still synchronized to the audio, it's just that they're stored separately. On the other hand, an argument could be made that a sync license is made available for a specific recording while this video works with any cover version.\n\nI'm interested in answers both specific to the [youtube](/questions/tagged/youtube \"show questions tagged 'youtube'\") environment as well as for general distribution.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Copyright right prohibits the creation of derivative works as well as copies of copyrighted material.\n\nThis video might be a derivative work, but the mere timing of the video in line with the music probably isn't suggestive enough to by a copyright violation in the case of most popular music, because genre specific conventions about tempo (beats per minute) and meter are so strong in most pop music genres that the connection with the source song, based upon pacing alone, would be [impossible to link to a source song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2MkIpg6Zik) and would be protected by the [sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc%C3%A8nes_%C3%A0_faire) doctrine (which is a principle in copyright law in which certain elements of a creative work are held to be not protected when they are mandated by or customary to the genre).\n\nIf your source song has a very distinctive collection of tempos and meters, such as Bohemian Rhapsody, or perhaps its [Maori language cover](https://boingboing.net/2019/02/25/a-te-reo-maori-cover-of-bohe.html), on the other hand . . . you might have a problem.\n\nSo, usually, to cross the line over into being a derivative work, the content of the music video, and not just its pacing, would have to establish the connection (e.g. visuals that match the content of the lyrics at each moment of the song).\n\nUltimately, of course, the answer the question of whether a work is an infringing derivative work, or is just a similar work whose similarities are due to genre conventions, or is protected by the fair use doctrine, is more art than science.\n\nThe set of pairs of works for which you could claim an infringement plausibly enough to overcome a motion for summary judgment in a court case and get to a jury to make a decision on the merits, is much larger than the set of works which a jury would actually find to be infringing. The less open and shut a derivative work case is, the less likely it is to be the subject of an infringement suit, but people are motivated to bring infringement suits for reasons that go beyond economic rationality and the strength of the case on the legal merits.\n\nThere is a large gray area and how potential infringements in that area are handled in practice is subject to all sorts of complicated, context specific considerations.\n\nI was approached once to bring a somewhat similar infringement case, and declined to do so, in part based upon legal analysis, and in part, based upon gut feeling.

According to the provided information, merely matching a video's pacing to a song's tempo and meter is usually not enough to constitute copyright infringement, as these elements are often genre conventions protected by the sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire doctrine. However, if the video content closely matches the song's lyrics or follows a highly distinctive structure (like Bohemian Rhapsody), it could be considered a derivative work and potentially infringe on copyright.

Then, at a later time, the owner of the wallet who originally left it on the ground in a public place comes over and picks up their wallet, and notices that for some odd reason someone decided to put money inside of their wallet that was left in a public place. Can the owner of the wallet keep the money that was put in their wallet? Or would it be illegal to take the money being that the person (not the owner of the wallet) who put the money in the wallet wasn't planning on giving it away? Or would the law state that because the wallet was in a public place at the time of the person putting money in the wallet, the person that put money inside has no expectation of someone not taking the money?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If a person **intentionally** places a wallet with money in it on the ground and walks away, that money is *abandoned property* and the person leaving it no longer has a legal claim to it.\n\nHowever, someone finding such money will not know that it was abandoned and should treat it as *lost*.\n\nA person who finds the wallet and realizes that it contains someone else's property (or finds any other apparently lost property) must, in most US states, report that fact. The procedures for reporting vary from one state to another, and may also vary depending on the value of property (in this case money) found. A person who does not report but just takes the property and treats it as his or her own may be guilty of *Theft by Finding* or a similar offense.\n\nHowever, a person who finds his or her own previously lost wallet, and does not realize that someone else has added money to it probably would suffer no penalty for treating the money as his or her own, provided that it is reasonable not to realize the addition.

I filled out all the necessary paperwork and cleared my state\\-mandated background check. Three weeks later, after I had quit my former job, hired a long\\-distance moving company, and nearly sold my car, the school board denied approval of my contract but gave no reason for it. The principal and school board chair ardently argued for approval of my contract but the board was steadfast. When pressed repeatedly, the board gave no adequate reason given.

I've also seen it used in the phrase *without prejudice, save as to costs*.\n\nWhat is the purpose and legal effect of this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: *Without prejudice* in a legal communication has a similar effect as *off the record* does in journalism. Without prejudice can be applied to any form of communication written or verbal; mediations, for example, are almost always conducted on a without prejudice basis.\n\nThe legal effect is that anything said or written in the communication is inadmissible in a court. A typical example is in a settlement offer: \"We have your claim for $1,000,000 and we think its a load of c\\*\\*p for reasons A, B \\& C, however, without prejudice we offer the amount of $3\\.50 as full and final settlement of your claim. This offer remains open for 7 days.\" The party that receives such a letter can not use or rely on anything it says in legal proceedings.\n\nIt is a practical and invaluable method of allowing real negotiation and concessions to be made without the risk that these will be used against you if it all falls in a heap and you end up in court.\n\n*Without prejudice, save as to costs* has the same effect with the addition that you are specifically making a settlement offer (like my example above). If a matter is resolved by a trial the judge will award costs either against each one party or order that each party pays their own costs; in general, the costs \"follow the event\" i.e. the losing party usually gets stuck with the costs. If the \"losing\" party can show that they made a reasonable offer of settlement then they can apply to have the \"winning\" party pay their costs from that point on. For example see [NSW Costs](http://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/civil/costs.html).\n\nNow, a document either is or is not *without prejudice* irrespective of if it carries the words or not \\- you can\u2019t make a document that is not part or a bona fide negotiation *without prejudice* just by writing the words on it and one that is part of a negotiation is *without prejudice* even if it omits the words.",

This is because the letter effectively carries the meaning of \"without prejudice, save as to costs\" even if it doesn't explicitly state so. If the trial outcome is less favorable than the offer, the party who made the offer can use this to argue for a more favorable cost allocation.\n\nOption A is incorrect because \"without prejudice\" communications are not admissible as evidence in court for the main proceedings.\n\nOption C is incorrect because while the letter is inadmissible for the main proceedings, it can be used for cost allocation purposes.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the phrase \"without prejudice\" alone is sufficient to make the letter inadmissible in court for the main proceedings. The additional phrase \"save as to costs\" is implied in settlement offers, even if not explicitly stated."

The jacket has name tags, unit patches, and lieutenant rank insignia. He wears it to a local bar on Veterans Day, but does not claim to be a veteran or attempt to receive any benefits. Under current US law, could John face legal consequences for wearing this jacket?\n\nA) Yes, wearing any part of a military uniform is illegal for civilians under all circumstances.\nB) No, as long as John doesn't claim to be a veteran or attempt to receive any benefits.\nC) Yes, but only if the jacket is from a currently active military unit.\nD) No, but only if John removes all name tags, patches, and rank insignia from the jacket.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, wearing military uniforms or parts of uniforms is only illegal if done with the intent to deceive. The Stolen Valor Act of 2013 specifically targets those who falsely claim military service or awards for personal profit. In this scenario, John is not claiming to be a veteran or attempting to receive any benefits, so he is not violating the law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because wearing parts of a military uniform is not universally illegal for civilians. \n\nOption C is incorrect because the age or current use of the uniform is not a factor in determining legality.\n\nOption D is incorrect because removing insignia is not necessary to make wearing the jacket legal, as long as there's no intent to deceive."

A month or two into the contract, my wife formally accepted a contract for a position 800 miles away (expensive move). We flew out to the new area, shopped for homes and purchased one (normal life).\n\nWhen we moved into our new place I called the service provider to transfer our service to our new home. Unfortunately, at that time the company stated they do not service our new property address (fwiw \\- my account is paid in full and good standing for services used). ...Long story short a few weeks later I get a notice for an early termination fee.\n\nI've been fighting this for 2\\+ months now. I've spent hours with countless phone reps and getting the boilerplate, \"these charges are valid due to termination of service.\" I stated in many words I didn't terminate the contract, I asked for my service to be transferred to my new address.\" I asked the question in a few different ways and the service rep states, \"moving to avoid a service charge is not valid.\"\n\nI asked a phone rep manager, \"how can a customer be held responsible for where a service provider provides service?\" The answer given was, \"to avoid ETF you should call \\[us] before purchasing a home.\" \n\nThis seems unreal, unjust, and possibly unconstitutional. Am I crazy?\nHow is it that \"blah blah blah big company\" can place their interests above a citizen's choice of where to live (school district, neighborhood, etc.)?\n\nAm I off base for thinking that I did not terminate the service? On the contrary the service provider terminated the service by not continuing to provide service for my account.\n\nHere's the only copy of the service agreement I could find:\n[AGREEMENT FOR RESIDENTIAL\u202fSERVICES](https://www.xfinity.com/corporate/customers/policies/subscriberagreement)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is actually pretty standard. You have a contract with a business to provide some service, and you get a bargain on the price of the service as long as you stay with them for some period, such as 2 years. You could get the 'pay as you go' option which doesn't have a termination fee, but that costs more *if* you are sure you can commit to what you signed up for, for that period. So it's not that you can't terminate the contract, it's that you can't just walk away from your obligation (what they call a \"minimum term agreement\"), cost\\-free. The early\\-termination fee is part of the cost of moving.\n\nYou have to look in the Legal Agreements \\& Contract part of Account Details on your account to get the specific agreement that you are bound by. Generally, you are subject to that fee, unless the subscriber dies, or is in the military and is shipped out. You can also transfer your service from area to area \u2013 I assume you either are moving to an area without Xfinity service, or you elected to not use Xfinity in that location.\n\nIt is legal for a business to put their business interest above that of a customer, even in the case of regulated \"utilities\".",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The customer can avoid the ETF by arguing that they didn't terminate the service, but rather the provider terminated it by not offering service in the new location.\n\nB) The provider's requirement to pay an ETF in this situation is likely unconstitutional and can be successfully challenged in court.\n\nC) The customer is generally obligated to pay the ETF as per the agreement, unless specific exceptions like military deployment or death apply.\n\nD) The provider is legally required to transfer the service to any new location the customer moves to, regardless of service availability.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, early termination fees are standard in such agreements and are typically enforceable. The customer agrees to these terms when signing up for a minimum term agreement in exchange for lower prices. The agreement usually specifies limited circumstances (such as military deployment or death) where the ETF can be waived. Moving to an area where the provider doesn't offer service doesn't typically exempt the customer from the ETF.

They started talking on kik and Liv sent some explicit photos and videos. When she asked the other girl to send something, she did, but then later Liv realizes that those photos are actually screenshots and the pictures arent of the person she is speaking to. She asked her about it and the person bolted. Stopped replying to her texts. Ghosted her for a week. Liv finally deactivated her account permanently. Now her worst worry is that this other person is much younger or something. They are also from different countries( continents) . Liv is from India. The other person is from Missouri, USA. So,\n 1\\) could Liv get into legal trouble if the person is, say young? To what extent is it likely to go? ( The other person said she was 25\\. Nowhere did she say any other age. And she did not send pics of herself. The ones she sent were screenshots of pics of someone else)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Most likely the other girl was a fat bloke in his forties, so Liv hasn't done anything illegal as far as the age of the other person is concerned. In some places sending explicit photos of yourself as a twenty year old woman to another adult person may be illegal, but since she's not worried about that, I assume it's not. \n\nThere is of course the very real danger that her photos and videos get distributed. So if she doesn't like the idea of any random person seeing these photos and videos, that's too late now. However, unless she also gave information about her address, then these photos are unlikely to be seen by anyone she knows. And there is so much stuff on the internet, that it is unlikely anyone would recognise her. \n\nFor any legal danger, the other person would have to be underage (not very likely), someone would have to find out who and where she is, and then somebody would have to be willing to spend the time and money to prosecute someone in India from Missouri. I don't think the police in Missouri would be bothered to even try, because the chances of succesful conviction would be very slim compared to the cost.

Based on the information provided, Liv is unlikely to face legal consequences for her actions. The reasons for this include:\n\n1. The person she interacted with claimed to be 25, and there's no evidence to suggest they were underage.\n2. The geographical distance (India to Missouri) makes prosecution extremely unlikely due to jurisdictional issues and the high cost of international legal proceedings.\n3. Local law enforcement in Missouri would likely not prioritize this case given its complexity and low likelihood of successful conviction.\n\nHowever, the answer notes that while legal consequences are unlikely, there is a real risk that Liv's explicit photos and videos could be distributed online without her consent. This is a common risk in such situations and represents the most likely negative outcome for Liv.\n\nOptions A and B are incorrect because they overstate the likelihood of legal action.

Your neighbor has no legal obligation to be knowledgeable or helpful, or to provide you with internet service.

The court held in that lawsuit that the \"release and hold harmless\" portion of the waiver was null and couldn't be presented to the jury. However, the parts of the waiver that did not release LSU could be weighed by the jury; these included an obligation of the participant to have adequate health insurance among other provisions.\n\nAnother [article from 2012](https://www.beankinney.com/publications-articles-enforceability-waivers-prospective-liability.html) regarding such waivers in Virginia mentions:\n\n> ...,most, if not all states prohibit waivers of liability based on willful or wanton misconduct, gross negligence or intentional acts.\n\nA web site titled Sport Waiver has a page, [www.sportwaiver.com/about\\-waivers](http://www.sportwaiver.com/about-waivers/), that gives advice to businesses which want to use waivers. On the linked page, which is from 2009, it lists each of the states and how they treated such waivers at that time.\n\nA business that caters to inherently risky activities will often have participants sign waivers and hold harmless agreements even when those agreements are null as a matter of law. This is done to discourage lawsuits and also, in case of a lawsuit, as a means of demonstrating that the participant knew the risks associated with the activity.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In which of the following scenarios would a liability waiver for a martial arts class most likely be considered enforceable?\n\nA) A student in Louisiana signs a waiver that excludes the martial arts studio from liability for any physical injury caused during training.\n\nB) A student in Virginia signs a waiver that releases the martial arts studio from liability for gross negligence or intentional harm.\n\nC) A student signs a waiver acknowledging the inherent risks of martial arts training and agreeing not to hold the studio liable for injuries resulting from ordinary negligence.\n\nD) A student in any state signs a waiver that prevents them from suing the martial arts studio under any circumstances, including death caused by the instructor's actions.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is the most likely to be enforceable because it involves acknowledging inherent risks and waiving liability for ordinary negligence, which is generally allowed in most jurisdictions. Option A is incorrect because Louisiana specifically prohibits waivers that exclude liability for physical injury. Option B is incorrect because most states, including Virginia, do not allow waivers for gross negligence or intentional acts. Option D is too broad and would likely be considered unenforceable in any state, as it attempts to waive liability even for extreme circumstances like death caused by the instructor."

Does that still constitute a murder\\-for\\-hire charge? Is that a technicality a good lawyer could fight and win in court?\nThe game law is based off of California's.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes to attempted murder and conspiracy to murder. No to murder\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAlthough the particular example you raise looks like [entrapment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrapment) and law enforcement can\u2019t do that in the United States.\n\nPutting that aside, *factual* [impossibility](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossibility_defense) is not a defense in common law jurisdictions. Conspiracy to murder someone who can\u2019t actually be murdered (because they are already dead or, as here, don\u2019t actually exist) is still a crime.\n\n*Legal* impossibility, however, is a defense. Something is legally impossible where it is impossible to meet one of the elements that define the crime.\n\nMost crimes require that something physical be done, for example, murder requires the perpetrator to kill the victim (among other things), so you can't commit murder on a dead or non\\-existent victim. However, crimes in the nature of \"Conspiracy to X\" or \"Attempted X\" often only rely upon intention even if it is impossible to do the thing intended.\n\nTo illustrate the difference:\n\n* if it\u2019s illegal to smuggle cocaine across the border and I, being an idiot, get caught smuggling what I think is cocaine but is actually table salt, I\u2019m guilty of attempted drug smuggling. This is factual impossibility but a legal possibility.\n* I'm not guilty of drug smuggling because that crime requires that I actually smuggle drugs. This is both a factual and legal impossibility.\n* if, however, the day before I do it, the law against cocaine is repealed, then whether I smuggle table salt or actual cocaine, I\u2019m not guilty of either crime even if I think it\u2019s still a crime. This is legal impossibility.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the potential charges you might face?\n\nA) You cannot be charged with any crime because the target didn't exist, making the entire scenario legally impossible.\n\nB) You can only be charged with conspiracy to commit murder, but not attempted murder, due to the non-existence of the target.\n\nC) You can be charged with both conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder, despite the target's non-existence.\n\nD) You can only be charged with fraud for accepting money under false pretenses, but not for any murder-related crimes.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In this scenario, you can be charged with both conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder, even though the target doesn't actually exist. This is because factual impossibility (the target not existing) is not a defense in common law jurisdictions. Your intent to commit the crime and taking substantial steps towards its completion (accepting money and agreeing to the contract) are sufficient for these charges. The non-existence of the target makes it impossible to charge you with actual murder, but it doesn't prevent charges related to the attempt and conspiracy. Additionally, this scenario likely constitutes entrapment, which could be a separate legal issue, but doesn't negate the potential charges mentioned."

There are many [articles](https://www.google.com/search?q=z06%20engine%20blows%20at%2053%20miles&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS1030US1030&oq=z06%20engi&aqs=chrome.1.0i131i433i512j0i3l3j69i57j0i512j69i61l2.12390j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) about this incident, as well. Barring anything being the owner's fault, the lawyer in the video said that the dealer would put in a new engine and that would be that. He did mention about collectabity of the car could be damaged. However, he said he would not get into that.\n\nHowever, I am curious. People buy new cars as investments and not for driving. Having matching VINs on the car and engine demands higher prices upon resale.\n\nWhile no one can see into the furure and no what something will actually be worth, there is no lack of evidence that certain cars will increase in value. Some cars go up in value by orders of magnitude. Take the Lamborghini Miura, which was $20,000 new. Now some are worth over $2,000,000\\. Of course, all this can apply to more than cars as there are other things that follow suit.\n\nI definitely feel that Chevrolet has no obligation to do anything other than replace the engine. However, this does theoretically hurt the long term value of the car. Is there any legal recovery for this loss?\n\nIrrelavent, to the question, this guy said he is done with Chevy and will sell the car when its repaired. He will likely make more than he paid for it as well, as these vehicles are heavily in demand. So that is a positive for him.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Barring manufacturer negligence (and even this is a dubious theory, given that recovery would be for [pure economic loss](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_economic_loss)), there is probably no legal theory that would allow recovery of any loss of resale value.\n\nI am assuming that the promise to replace/repair the engine if it fails is part of the contract of sale. [This is typical for a warranty that the manufacturer will repair certain failures](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/auto-warranties-service-contracts).\n\nAssuming the manufacturer fulfils what it agreed to in the warranty, then the buyer is getting exactly what they contracted for and there is no contractual theory that would support any further recovery: there is no breach.\n\nThe buyer bought a car that included a warranty to repair.

As long as the manufacturer fulfills its warranty obligations by replacing the engine, the customer has no further legal recourse. The warranty typically covers repair or replacement of defective parts, not potential loss of future value. There is no breach of contract if the manufacturer honors the warranty terms.

On the witness stand, Hussain said Rahman was \u201cdomineering, paranoid, weird and had a lot of contact with MI5\u201d.\n\nIs there really any law that makes it illegal to own copies of a publication? We punish thoughtcrime, these days? Is this an error in the newspaper or is there actually a law that permits people to be prosecuted (and even jailed for years!) for simply possessing a document?\n\nPlease note that I am not asking about cases where the possession of the document was presented as evidence of someone's worldview when they have been caught committing a crime. I am asking if the possession of a document1 can ever be considered criminal.\n\n---\n\n1Obviously, I am not talking about stolen documents or even certain classes of pornography whose very existence (photographs) implies an illegal act took place. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **\"Is there really any law that makes it illegal to own copies of a publication?\"**\n\nI couldn't find exact confirmation of which law Rahman was prosecuted under, but [an article from 2012](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/terrorists-who-tried-to-blow-up-661178) describes it as \"possessing an article for a terrorist purpose\". [A BBC article from 2007](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7084801.stm) uses the same phrase, with regard to \"Section 57 of the Terrorism Act\", which appears to refer to the [Terrorism Act 2000](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/11/section/57):\n\n> 57 Possession for terrorist purposes.\n> \n> \n> (1\\)A person commits an offence if he possesses an article in\n>  circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that his\n>  possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation\n>  or instigation of an act of terrorism.\n> \n> \n> (2\\)It is a defence for a person charged with an offence under this\n>  section to prove that his possession of the article was not for a\n>  purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of\n>  an act of terrorism.\n> \n> \n> (3\\)In proceedings for an offence under this section, if it is proved\n>  that an article\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a)was on any premises at the same time as the accused, or\n> \n> \n> (b)was on premises of which the accused was the occupier or which he\n>  habitually used otherwise than as a member of the public,\n> \n> \n> the court may assume that the accused possessed the article, unless he\n>  proves that he did not know of its presence on the premises or that he\n>  had no control over it.\n> \n> \n> (4\\)A person guilty of an offence under this section shall be liable\u2014\n> \n> \n> (a)on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not\n>  exceeding 15 years,\\* to a fine or to both, or\n> \n> \n> (b)on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six\n>  months, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum or to both.\n\n\\*Interestingly, the maximum term of imprisonment appears to have originally been 10 years, [but was increased in 2006](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/11/section/13#section-13-1).\n\nThat law's not specific to publications, but in an attempt to answer your question more fully there does seem to be at least one law that \"makes it illegal to own copies of a publication\": the [Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Section_63_of_the_Criminal_Justice_and_Immigration_Act_2008&oldid=788945290), for example, renders possession of 'extreme pornography' illegal, and the definitions do not require (to reference your footnote) that the materials \"imply an illegal act took place\". Rather, the materials are illegal because (to quote a government consultation, via the Wikipedia page linked above)\n\n> such material may encourage or reinforce interest in violent and aberrant sexual activity to the detriment of society as a whole\n\nThat may or may not bother you from a freedom of speech point of view, but it leads me nicely onto a discussion of the underlying ethics/morality/rights debate that you impled in your question:\n\n**\"We punish thoughtcrime, these days?\"**\n\nAs far as I understand, Rahman was in physical possession of the magazine. So no \u2013 not \"thoughtcrime\". Merely thinking about the magazine \u2013 or believing the views expressed in its contents \u2013 would not, of itself, be illegal. Indeed, as the article points out in its description of main case under discussion (*i.e.* the \"Three Musketeers\" case, not Rahman's prior conviction),\n\n> the prosecution described as the defendants\u2019 \u201chateful beliefs\u201d \u2013 but the judge, Mr Justice Globe, told them they could not convict based on \u201cmindset evidence\u201d alone.\n\nHowever, like hate speech (speech, not thought), or conspiracy to commit a crime (which is what the men in the Three Musketeers case were being charged with), saying (or writing) certain things is, quite reasonably, illegal, if the intent of those words is incitement to commit a crime.\n\nRestrictions on free speech exist everywhere, and any (political) debate around it generally centres less on an *absolute* right to free speech, and more on where the line should be drawn. Even in the US \u2013 which tends to draw the line at the permissive end of the spectrum \u2013 speech intended solely to cause damage is not immune from reproach. The classic example is \"[\\[falsely] shouting fire in a crowded theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater&oldid=776960550)\":\n\n> The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic. \\[...] The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger\n\nSimilarly, the publication of a magazine, the sole purpose of which is to (inspire or facilitate) damage, can be illegal. It would then seem reasonable for *supplying* that magazine to others to be illegal. Possession with a clear intent to supply (like with drugs) would also, reasonably, be illegal. And if drug possession, with no intent to supply, can be illegal, then why not possession of illegal material, even if there's no intent to supply?\n\nI make no attempt here to justify (nor even to outline fully) the *exact details* of English law when it comes to these matters; however, there's an important distinction between freedom of speech (with regard to which nearly everyone accepts *some* restriction or regulation) and freedom of thought or conscience. To the best of my knowledge, there's no law (in Britain) that restricts either of those.",

But a border search that extends beyond a routine search and inspection may require at least reasonable suspicion.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Recent years have seen legal challenges to border searches of electronic devices such as cell phones and computers, which\n> often contain more personal and sensitive information than other items frequently searched at the border, such as a wallet or briefcase. The Supreme Court has not yet addressed this issue. Lower courts have generally held that government officers may conduct relatively limited, manual searches of such devices without a warrant or any particularized suspicion. The courts, however, are split over whether more intrusive, forensic searches require at least reasonable suspicion.\n> \n> \n> ...\n> \n> \n> Federal statutes and implementing regulations confer designated law enforcement officers with broad authority to conduct searches and seizures at the border and surrounding areas without a warrant. These searches commonly occur at designated ports of entry along the border, such as\n> border crossing points.\\[1] But searches may also occur in other places along or near the border.\\[2]\n> To enforce U.S. customs laws, federal law enforcement officers may inspect and search individuals, merchandise, vehicles, and vessels arriving at the border, as well as further into the\n> interior of the United States and within U.S. waters.\n> \n> \n> Under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1496, a customs officer may examine \u201cthe baggage of any person arriving in the United States in order to ascertain what articles are contained therein\u201d and whether those items are subject to taxes or otherwise prohibited.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legality of this situation and the citizen's rights?\n\nA) The citizen has the right to refuse the search unless the agent has a warrant, as the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches.\n\nB) Border searches are exempt from typical Fourth Amendment protections, and agents can conduct routine inspections of electronic devices without any particularized suspicion.\n\nC) The citizen can legally destroy or reset their phone to protect their privacy, as long as they don't believe there's evidence of a crime on the device.\n\nD) Border agents need at least reasonable suspicion to conduct any search of electronic devices, including manual searches of phones.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is B. According to the information provided, border searches are considered \"qualitatively different\" from searches within the interior of the United States. Federal officers may conduct routine inspections and searches of persons attempting to cross the international border without a warrant or any particularized suspicion of unlawful activity. This includes relatively limited, manual searches of electronic devices like phones.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because border searches are an exception to typical Fourth Amendment protections.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because intentionally destroying or resetting a phone when an agent demands to search it could be seen as obstruction or destruction of potential evidence, even if the citizen doesn't believe there's evidence of a crime on the device.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because while some courts have ruled that more intrusive, forensic searches may require reasonable suspicion, routine or manual searches of electronic devices at the border generally do not require any particularized suspicion."

It is up to the judgment of the judge to determine what constitutes \"Le fait de provoquer directement \u00e0 des actes de terrorisme ou de faire publiquement l'apologie de ces actes\". I would not have predicted that the act constituted \"faire publiquement l'apologie\", but if that expression can reasonably construed as meaning \"indicating approval of\", then I understand the conclusion. The law does not mention SSIDs, that simply falls under the penumbra of \"publicly approving of terrorism\", and there isn't a specific list of forbidden acts. Analogously, [Holocaust denial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial#France) is against the law in France, and there is not a specific list of things that you can't say, there is a general rule from which specifics can be inferred.

In France, there is no exhaustive list of forbidden Wi-Fi SSIDs. Instead, the legality of a network name is determined by judicial interpretation of laws against publicly approving terrorism. The case mentioned in the question, where a person was convicted for using \"Daesh 21\" as their Wi-Fi name, demonstrates that judges have the discretion to interpret what constitutes \"public approval of terrorism\" broadly. This approach is similar to how other speech-related laws, such as those against Holocaust denial, are applied in France. While certain names (like those directly referencing terrorist groups) are more likely to be problematic, the law's application is not limited to a specific list or only to direct mentions of terrorist organizations. Wi-Fi SSIDs are considered a form of public expression and are thus subject to these laws, contrary to option D."

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Sarah receives an unsigned contract from a potential business partner outlining terms for a joint venture. Without signing or formally accepting the contract, Sarah begins acting in accordance with some of the terms. Two weeks later, she decides not to proceed with the venture. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal status of this contract under UK law?\n\nA) The contract is fully binding because Sarah acted on some of its terms, even without signing.\nB) The contract is void because it was never signed, regardless of Sarah's actions.\nC) The contract may be partially enforceable for the terms Sarah acted upon, but not for others.\nD) The contract is not legally binding, but Sarah's actions may have created a separate implied contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nIn UK law, a formal contract typically requires offer, acceptance, consideration, and intention to create legal relations. While the unsigned contract wasn't formally accepted, Sarah's actions in accordance with some terms could be interpreted as creating an implied contract for those specific actions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because mere action on terms without formal acceptance doesn't necessarily make the entire contract binding. \nOption B is too absolute; lack of signature doesn't automatically void a contract if there's evidence of acceptance through other means. \nOption C misunderstands contract law; contracts are generally treated as whole entities, not enforceable in parts. \n\nOption D recognizes that while the original contract isn't binding due to lack of formal acceptance, Sarah's actions may have created a separate implied contract for the specific terms she acted upon. This aligns with the principle that acceptance can be communicated through conduct, even if the original contract wasn't formally accepted."

What would happen to the sentence? Would the President continue to be the President in jail? (Admittedly, this leaves out the whole \"wouldn't they have been impeached before this\" question...but let's assume that Congress is doing something weird again.)\n\nTo reiterate: This question does not ask if a sitting President can be convicted of a crime. This question asks what happens to the sentence if and when a sitting President *is* convicted of a crime, which appears to be possible according to [Can the US president be charged of crime such as murder while in office?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/17025/can-the-us-president-be-charged-of-crime-such-as-murder-while-in-office)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To start, for this hypothetical to happen, a whole bunch of decisions contrary to sanity have to happen:\n\n1. The Vice President and President Pro Tempore do not invoke the 25th Amendment to temporarily remove the President from office\n2. Congress does not issue Articles of Impeachment\n3. The President does not pardon himself\n4. The District Attorney decides to prosecute the sitting President rather than waiting for his term to be over\n\nThere are probably more I'm missing. With that out of the way, in theory there's no law that says a President cannot serve while in prison, and simply being a felon does not disqualify him from the Presidency. The judge might order that while he was still serving as President, he serve his time under house arrest \\- he'd constantly be surrounded by police officers, so it would be pretty difficult for him to run, and it would keep him as as able as possible to keep performing the official functions of the office. The judge could also just defer his sentence. Putting him in regular prison would have serious national security implications, both in terms of protecting his person and in allowing him to effectively serve as Commander\\-in\\-Chief, so the government could probably make a compelling case against putting a sitting President in prison.\n\nAccording to [this Senate Report](https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/98-249.pdf), the President will also continue to receive Secret Service protection once he leaves office, so long as he is not removed by Impeachment. There doesn't seem to be a provision against that protection if the President is in prison, so the Secret Service would be obliged to find a way to protect him while he is in prison. Most likely this would mean he would be put in an isolated prison wing, possibly with Secret Service protecting his section.",

It may be that the landlord has to approve any subleasing, but the original obligation remains. Therefore even if you have been paying the rent, it is essentially paying on behalf of the tenant (in exchange for you getting the use of the unit). If you don't pay what you owe, the landlord will go after the legal tenant. You have no obligation (debt) to the landlord, you have an obligation to the tenant. The tenant has a debt to the landlord.\n\nIf the (remainder of the) lease was assigned to you, that's a contract between you and the landlord, and the original tenant may be out of the picture. Or not: you have to look at the agreement. There could be a clause holding the original tenant financially responsible for your default. Or a clause saying that the original tenant is *not* responsible. If there is no specific statement about that in the agreement, it would depend on state law whether the original tenant is held liable.

The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The sublease agreement is between John and Sarah, not between John and the landlord.\n2. Sarah's original lease obligation to the landlord likely remains intact unless explicitly stated otherwise in the sublease agreement.\n3. John's bankruptcy discharge would affect his personal debts, but it doesn't necessarily impact the contractual obligations between Sarah and the landlord.\n4.

So they are authenticated to my server and those accounts are saved in a database (Microsoft SQL Server).\n\n---\n\nAnd thats the point where my problem starts. I know that I need one CAL license for every person logged into my server. And that means for me, that i have to buy a CAL license for every user account. But how should i be able to buy e.g. 100,000 cal user licenses for 100,000 users? Or even a bit more concrete, if the amount of customers registered grow\u00b4s steadily how should I ensure providing the exactly right amount of CALs?\n\n---\n\nI found this site [\"Client Access Licenses and Management Licenses\"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Licensing/product-licensing/client-access-license.aspx#tab=2).\n\nAnd if I have a look at the rows \"Windows Server\" and \"SQL Server\" I can see that those servers are licensed per core / per processor. Does that mean I dont need CAL licences If i only run a database and a webserver (IIS)?\n\n---\n\nBecause there is this site as well: [Licensing How To: When do I need a Client Access License (CAL)?](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/volume-licensing/2014/03/10/licensing-how-to-when-do-i-need-a-client-access-license-cal/)\n\nAnd there it says:\n\n> 5 \u2013 Do I need a CAL when my Windows Server is used to run a web\n>  server?\n> \n> \n> Windows Server 2012 R2 configured to run Web Workloads \\*\\* do not\n>  require CALs or External Connectors. Web workloads, also referred to\n>  as an internet web solution, are publically accessible (e.g.\n>  accessible outside of the firewall) and consist only of web pages, web\n>  sites, web applications, web services, and/or POP3 mail serving. \n>  Access to content, information, and/or applications within the\n>  internet web solution must be publically accessible.

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company runs an e-commerce website on Windows Server 2012 R2 with Microsoft SQL Server. The website allows customers to create accounts, browse products, and make purchases. Which licensing model is most appropriate for this scenario?\n\nA) Per-user Client Access Licenses (CALs) for every registered customer\nB) Per-device CALs for each unique device accessing the server\nC) Per-core licensing for Windows Server and SQL Server, with no additional CALs required\nD) External Connector license for Windows Server, plus per-core licensing for SQL Server\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA) is incorrect because per-user CALs are not required for public-facing web workloads.\nB) is incorrect for the same reason as A; per-device CALs are not needed for this scenario.\nC) is correct because Windows Server 2012 R2 configured to run web workloads does not require CALs or External Connectors for public access. The e-commerce functionality, including user authentication and database operations, can be considered part of the web workload if it's publicly accessible.\nD) is incorrect because an External Connector license is unnecessary for public web workloads, though per-core licensing for SQL Server is appropriate.\n\nThe key point is that publicly accessible web workloads, including e-commerce functionality, do not require CALs or External Connectors when using Windows Server 2012 R2. Per-core licensing for both Windows Server and SQL Server is sufficient in this scenario."

The car looks fine, it just has no plates and was sitting in my driveway. Without any warning, while I was out, park management towed my car. It was on a Friday, so I had to wait until Monday to contact anyone about this. My roommate, who owns the trailer I rent a room in, said this happened to someone else. AFTER the car was towed, management told her since her car had to tags, she should have covered it up. I'm sure what they are doing is illegal. Not only towing people's cars from their private driveways, but then forcing them to pay fees to get them back. Is what they're doing legal? I don't think it is.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: It is legal, unless it is a violation of the rental agreement. Generally, a property owner can have a vehicle towed from their property, although there may be a requirement in the state to post a towing notice. If the lease agreement says that cars must always be street\\-legal, that is the end of the discussion. If the agreement says that cars without tags or plates can be stored in a person's spot, towing it would be a violation of the agreement. If the agreement doesn't say anything, then the property owner's rights would be the default deciding factor. Since your roommate seeks to override the park owner's ordinary control over the surrounding spaces, there needs to be an explicit provision for that in the lease.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in a mobile home park has their unregistered vehicle towed from their private driveway by park management without warning. Under what circumstance would this action most likely be considered legal?\n\nA) If the tenant had been verbally warned about unregistered vehicles in the past\nB) If the park has clearly visible signs stating that unregistered vehicles will be towed\nC) If the lease agreement explicitly states that all vehicles must be street-legal at all times\nD) If the tenant had been living in the park for less than 30 days\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nThe correct answer is C. According to the documentation, if the lease agreement explicitly states that cars must always be street-legal (which would include having valid registration and tags), then the park management would be within their rights to tow an unregistered vehicle, even from a private driveway.\n\nOption A is incorrect because verbal warnings, while potentially helpful, do not override the legal rights established in the lease agreement.\n\nOption B, while a good practice, is not necessarily required if the lease agreement already covers the issue of unregistered vehicles.\n\nOption D is irrelevant, as the length of tenancy doesn't impact the legality of towing in this context.\n\nThe key factor is the lease agreement. If it specifies that vehicles must be street-legal, this overrides the tenant's assumption of control over their private driveway space within the park property."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The GDPR gives users the right to have their stored data deleted.\n\nHow does the GDPR handle situations where the data controller needs the data to fulfil their obligations to users (specifically by allowing a software to function)?\n\n---\n\nFor example:\n\nAssume a software (\"aggregator\") that aggregates and displays information from a social network, to provide a more useful dashboard and notifications than what's built into the platform.\n\nUsers of the social network authorize the aggregator to access, store and display their friends' activity, and the service then notifies them when something interesting happens. This would make the aggregator (more precisely, the entity behind it) a \"data controller\" under the GDPR, right?.\n\nNow if a user's friend requests deletion of their data from the aggregator, can the aggregator claim a \"legitimate interest\" reason to not delete that data? Since omitting friend activity from users' dashboards/notifications would mean not fulfilling the contractual obligation to the aggregator's users.\n\nAs a compromise, would it be permissible to substitute deleted information with anonymous records, like \"An anonymous user commented in your discussion\", given a user can trivially reference the discussion on the original platform and identify this \"anonymous\" user?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I think in the example you mention, the aggregator is the controller because it \"*determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data*\", see [Art. 4(7\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/). Typically the aggregator would be a [joint controller](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-26-gdpr/) with the user, however the user probably uses this for [purely personal reasons](https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/) only, so the GDPR does not apply to the user.\n\nThat would also mean, the controller is required to [inform](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-14-gdpr/) the data subject where that is feasible.\n\n> The GDPR gives users the right to have their stored data deleted.\n\nOnly in some specific situations. See [this](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/37916/18215) answer for more details.\nIn this situation it boils down to whether [Art.21(1\\)](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/) applies:\n\n> 1. The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of [Article 6](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/)(1\\), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.\n\nIt is difficult to say whether such \"compelling legitimate grounds\" exist, but in this example, the aggregator processes data which is either publicly visible, or at least visible to the user which receives the information. So as long as the user is able to get the data also in a different way, there are not much rights taken away from the data subject. So I would say that the controller has a compelling legitimate ground to process the data. Of course, the aggregator may not use the data for other purposes, unless it also has a compelling legitimate ground to process it for that purpose.\n\nHowever if advanced data analytics like [profiling](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) is done on the aggregated personal data, it may shift towards having no compelling legitimate ground to process the data.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided GDPR information:\n\nQuestion: A software company creates an application that aggregates and displays information from various social networks to provide users with a customized dashboard. A user's friend requests deletion of their data from this aggregator app. Under GDPR, what is the most appropriate action for the aggregator?\n\nA) Immediately delete all data related to the friend, as GDPR gives users an absolute right to data deletion.\n\nB) Refuse to delete the data, citing a blanket \"legitimate interest\" in fulfilling contractual obligations to other users.\n\nC) Evaluate if there are compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing the data, considering factors such as data visibility and the purpose of processing.\n\nD) Replace the friend's data with anonymous placeholders without further evaluation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct approach under GDPR is to carefully evaluate the situation. While GDPR does provide a right to erasure, it's not absolute. The aggregator needs to consider if they have \"compelling legitimate grounds\" to continue processing the data that outweigh the interests and rights of the person requesting deletion. \n\nFactors to consider include:\n1. Whether the data is already publicly visible or accessible to users through other means\n2. The extent to which processing this data is necessary to fulfill the service's core function\n3. Whether the processing involves advanced analytics or profiling\n4. The potential impact on the rights and freedoms of the data subject\n\nOption A is incorrect because the right to erasure is not absolute under GDPR. \nOption B is too broad and doesn't involve the necessary careful evaluation.\nOption D might be a potential compromise but shouldn't be implemented without first evaluating the situation.\n\nThe correct approach (C) involves a case-by-case assessment to balance the various interests and rights at stake, as outlined in GDPR Article 21(1)."
