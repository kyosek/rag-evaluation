It allows for a brief, informative summary that can help developers quickly understand the gist of the license, while explicitly stating that it's not legally binding and directing users to the full license text. This balances practicality with legal caution.\n\nOption A is incorrect because detailed, legally binding summaries in each file can be problematic if they're not perfectly aligned with the full license, and they may become outdated.\n\nOption B is not ideal because it misses an opportunity to provide useful licensing information directly where developers are working.\n\nOption D is risky because creating a new, simplified license could lead to legal inconsistencies and might not adequately protect the software or its users.\n\nThe correct approach, as illustrated in the original post, provides a concise summary that gives useful information while clearly deferring to the full license text for legal matters."

In those circumstances, no separate university policy to restate the applicable law is required.\n\nBest practices are to make students and teachers aware of any applicable laws, because knowing that, the the parties are less likely to be involved in illegal conduct.

The consequences and potential liability for unpaid franchise taxes when a corporation dissolves can vary significantly depending on the state's specific laws. As mentioned in the documentation, different states have different approaches to franchise taxes and their enforcement. Some states may impose personal liability on directors in certain circumstances, while others may consider the forced dissolution of the corporation as sufficient punishment. The answer also notes that the magnitude and nature of franchise taxes differ between states, ranging from small annual filing fees to significant corporate income taxes.

Uber is active in cities like [London](https://www.uber.com/cities/london/), [Birmingham](https://www.uber.com/cities/birmingham/), [Bristol](https://www.uber.com/cities/bristol/), [Manchester](https://www.uber.com/cities/manchester/), [Glasgow](https://www.uber.com/cities/glasgow-uk), etc. and has a sizeable base of both riders and drivers, indicating a regulatory environment that is favorable or at least not sufficiently hostile to such a model.\n\nLondon has regulations restricting use of taximeters, but last fall the [high court ruled](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/16/uber-wins-high-court-case-taxi-app-tfl) that Uber's app does not constitute a taximeter that would violate the regulations. The mayor said this was the primary issue around the legality of the service there, and this is the main regulatory dispute in [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_protests_and_legal_actions#United_Kingdom) (which may not be all inclusive). [January headlines from this year](http://fortune.com/2016/01/20/london-avoids-uber-crackdown/) heralded the lack of regulatory obstacles to Uber's operations in that city. \n\nYou should probably first check with your insurance company, especially if there are FAQs on their website or details in your insurance policy, because you might not be covered under that policy on those drives without some additional premium. \n\nCheck out the [UK's Licence Finder](https://www.gov.uk/licence-finder) to help find out what licences you might need for business activities.

The service described is similar to ride-sharing platforms like Uber, which operate legally in many UK cities, suggesting it may be permissible under certain conditions.\n\n2. The legal status can vary by city, so local regulations need to be checked.\n\n3.

I didn't catch it until it had charged my card, and then afterwards they refused to correct the charge saying all sales are final. I then threatened to commit suicide if they didn't correct the charge and they called the police. I ran away but now I'm wondering, am I in any legal peril? \n\nMy understanding is that suicide is not illegal in California and therefore threatening it is of no consequence. It also is not a criminal threat according to my understanding as a criminal threat is only applicable towards another person or people.\n\nIn addition, this is money they legally owe me and are refusing to pay, not some attempt at extortion.

Other jurisdictions will no doubt have similar laws. \n\nOn arrival, being informed that you ran away \\- but thankfully paid with a credit card \\- the police will try to find you. They are not allowed to make a determination that you are just being foolish, but must assume you are a danger to yourself. \n\nAt some point in the extensive bureaucratic matter, they will probably come to the conclusion that you have acted in a **negligent** manner. Once that has been done, you will be made liable for all entailed costs to the taxpayer. \n\nSo your fear of being charged for threatening to commit suicide is the least of your problems. \n\nYour claim against the store is probably justified (the listed price is in most jurisdictions binding).

The correct answer, C, reflects that the customer's actions, though not directly illegal, could result in financial liability for the emergency response costs. This aligns with the concept of being held responsible for negligent behavior that causes unnecessary use of public resources. \n\nOption A is incorrect because, although suicide itself may not be illegal, making threats that result in police action can have consequences. \n\nOption B is wrong because stores generally have a duty to report potential threats to safety.\n\nOption D is incorrect as the described actions, while inappropriate, do not meet the legal definition of criminal extortion.\n\nThe question tests understanding of potential indirect legal consequences of actions, even when the actions themselves may not be directly illegal."

However, if you are a business like Starbucks that goes out of its way to make its environment welcoming and inviting for customers to stay, do you have the right to kick people out because of their race after you serve them?\n\nIs the ability to stay in the store considered part of the purchase; or did the manager who called the cops to remove the two black men still had that right if they had purchased something from the store?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Were two black men legally removed from a Philadelphia Starbucks?\n\nMaybe \\- its complicated.\n\nThe crime of [trespass](http://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=35&sctn=3&subsctn=0) in Pennsylvania relevantly involves:\n\n> 3503 (b) Defiant trespasser.\\-\\-\n> \n> \n> (1\\) A person commits an offense if, knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so, he enters or remains in any place as to which notice against trespass is given by:\n> \n> \n> (i) actual communication to the actor;\n\nAt face value, the store manager asked them to leave and by refusing to do so they committed the crime. However:\n\n> (c) Defenses.\\-\\-It is a defense to prosecution under this section that:\n> \n> \n> (2\\) the premises were at the time open to members of the public and the actor complied with **all lawful conditions imposed on access to or remaining in the premises**; or\n\nIf the condition imposed was \"buy something or get out\" then that would be a lawful condition and trespass would have been committed. If the condition was \"because you're black\" then that would be an unlawful condition and trespass would not have been committed.\n\nNow, the evil and insidious thing about unlawful discrimination is that there are lots of perfectly lawful masquerades that it can wear. Indeed, except in egregious cases, the unlawful discrimination can only be inferred by a holistic look at a large number of interactions to see where any particular one falls on the scale.\n\nThat said, this particular case *feels* like racial discrimination.\n\nWith respect to Starbucks, if they could show evidence that it routinely asks people of all ethnicities who did not make a purchase to leave then this would not be racial discrimination \\- just bad business practice. However, given the particular business model of providing a place to rest *along* with an opportunity to buy sub\\-standard coffee it seems unlikely that this was the case (I'm Australian so I completely fail to understand why Americans insist on drinking bad coffee).\n\nWith respect to the police, this is a little less clear. It is not their job to determine how a court (or DA) might decide a case: its their job to determine if they have probable cause to believe a crime is or has been committed. They have a store manager who has asked people to leave and people who are refusing to do so \\- probable cause for trespass. That said, police have discretion as to how to handle the situation: they could talk to the manager, they could ask the patrons to leave or they could arrest them. They can use their discretion however they like: unless it is based on unlawful discrimination. Which brings us back to the beginning.",

If the condition was \"buy something or leave,\" it would be lawful. However, if the condition was based on race, it would be unlawful. The complexity arises from the fact that unlawful discrimination can often be disguised as lawful conditions. \n\nOption A is incorrect because it oversimplifies the situation and ignores the possibility of racial discrimination. \n\nOption B is incorrect because the police can act on probable cause based on the store manager's complaint, even if Starbucks generally allows non-paying customers to stay. \n\nOption D is incorrect because businesses can generally ask non-paying customers to leave, but the key issue is whether this request was applied discriminatorily."

The driver now lives in San Francisco and was unaware of the court summons due to moving.

This approach allows the driver to resolve the issue remotely without the need for travel. Many courthouses offer online payment options for fines, which can quickly clear up such matters. Option A is unnecessarily time-consuming and expensive. Option B is illegal and will only worsen the situation. Option D is inappropriate as the San Francisco DMV is not responsible for Los Angeles court matters. Always attempt to resolve such issues directly with the court that issued the citation before considering more drastic measures."

It must be witnessed by 2 persons, who witness the testator signing the will (or legal substitute such as a \"mark\", or an instruction to a third party to sign).

The key factors for validity are that the testator must be an adult of sound mind, creating the will voluntarily, and disposing only of their own property. The will must be witnessed by two persons who see the testator sign (or mark) the document. There are no specific restrictions on who can be a witness, as long as they can attest to the signing. The testator's wife can be a witness if she's not a beneficiary, and a homeless person's status does not disqualify them as a witness. Ultimately, the probate process will determine the will's validity, but based on the information provided, this will could potentially be valid if it meets all other legal requirements."

But they simply asked me to send the mail to another department, then asked to wait for their call, and some blah blah stuff. \n\nSince I got busy, I didn't bothered to ping them again and again. And this January 2017, I have mailed them again. A couple of months ago, I have mailed them again asking why they delayed it and requested to refund it at the earliest. Then they said that the company is under new management(June 2016 onwards) and they need to verify whether am eligible for the refund.

Even if you went to court and got a default judgment against them for $92 plus court costs plus interest, it would cost an immense amount of time and money to identify assets from which you could collect and then use writs of execution and writs of garnishment to collect it. If the amount of money were $92,000 it would be worth it, but it would probably not be worth it even to get $9,200 returned and there is no way that it is cost effective to pursue this for $92, even if that is a lot of money for you.\n\nYour time is better spent giving them bad social media reviews and then moving on.",

Filing a lawsuit in India or Canada would involve significant time, effort, and expenses that would likely exceed the refund amount. Continuing to contact customer service has proven ineffective. The most practical solution, as suggested in the documentation, is to leave negative reviews on social media to warn others and then move on, as pursuing the matter further would likely result in more wasted time and resources without guaranteeing a refund."

He's being audited by both states for tax purposes. Which of the following would be the LEAST effective method for John to prove his primary residency is in New York?\n\nA) Providing affidavits from neighbors in New York testifying that they regularly see John at his NYC apartment\nB) Showing his New York driver's license and voter registration card\nC) Presenting utility bills from both his New York and Connecticut addresses\nD) Offering school records for his children enrolled in New York City public schools\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While all of these methods can contribute to proving residency, option C (presenting utility bills from both addresses) would be the least effective in this scenario. Here's why:\n\n1. Option A provides direct testimony from witnesses, which is strong evidence of John's regular presence in New York.\n2. Option B shows official documentation linking John to New York, which is typically considered strong evidence of residency.\n3. Option D demonstrates a significant tie to New York through his children's education, implying long-term commitment to living in the state.\n4. Option C, however, shows John maintains residences in both states, which could actually weaken his case for exclusive New York residency. Utility bills from both locations don't clearly establish which is his primary residence and could be used to argue he splits his time between the two states.\n\nThis question tests understanding of the various forms of evidence used to establish residency, as well as the ability to evaluate the relative strength of different types of proof in a complex residency dispute."

If negotiations fail to reach an agreement, the authority currently holding the prisoner may have de facto priority. This complex process allows for flexibility in handling such cases, taking into account various legal and practical considerations rather than following a rigid, predetermined order of sentence enactment."

The issue is they usually say no. I was wondering if it was legal to record public officials doing their job as they are employees of the public school district, which in turn is part of the state DoE? If you can record police officers while they're doing their public duty, you should be able to record public school officials during private meetings inside their offices, right?\n\nEDIT 7/20/18: While reading some case law, I came across this quote:\n\n> \u201cThe filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a\n>  public place, including police officers performing their\n>  responsibilities, fits comfortably within \\[the] principles \\[of the\n>  First Amendment].\u201d Glik, 655 F.3d at 82\n\nNot sure why no one pointed this out, but does this not give the right to record any public official in a public place (i.e public property such as school grounds)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I would say no, it's not the same. There's a reasonable expectation of privacy that you have in an office that isn't present when you're standing on a roadside or in a city park.\n\nIn [Glik v. Cunniffe](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1578557.html), the First Circuit said \"The filming of government officials engaged in their duties in a public place, including police officers performing their responsibilities\" was in the spirit of the First Amendment. And this is not limited to police; an arrest \"in the course of filming officials in the hallway outside a public meeting of a historic district commission\" was found to be a First Amendment violation in Iacobucci v. Boulter (1st Cir. 1999\\).\n\nBut a private meeting in an office is *not* a \"public place\" as it is meant in Glik (even if the building is owned by the government.) And the Glik decision says \"To be sure, the right to film is not without limitations. It may be subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.\"",

Based on the information provided, recording a public school official would likely be legal when they are speaking at a public school board meeting. This aligns with the principles outlined in Glik v. Cunniffe, which states that filming government officials engaged in their duties in a public place is protected under the First Amendment.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a private office, even in a public building, is not considered a \"public place\" in this context and there's a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nOption B is questionable because while a classroom is more public than a private office, it's not clear if it would be considered a fully public space like a school board meeting.\n\nOption D is overly broad and incorrect. Simply being on public property doesn't negate all expectations of privacy or override two-party consent laws.\n\nThe key is that the recording must be in a truly public place where the official is performing their duties openly, such as a public meeting. This balances the public's right to information with reasonable privacy expectations."

Is it because the posts are made by anonymous users?\n\nMy problem is this. My forum is visited by people from EU as well, and according to upcoming EU regulations, EU is increasingly pressuring it's controllers (like forum owners) to anonymize personal data (because if you don't \\= good luck to you), so that's what I'm trying to do right now regardless of the varying opinions on the matter, but on the other hand, I'm afraid that laws in the US will require me to store full IP once my users are anonymous which would inevitably defeat the purpose, unless such law (if truly existent) would allow me to store truncated IP addresses?\n\nI've searched the web for hours trying to find any info on this, but nothing suggests that there is any such law. Could it be that Wikipedia is simply wrong?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Anyone can say anything on Wikipedia \u2013 even *they* tagged that claim as requiring a citation. There's no way to directly prove that there is no such requirement, but [these guys](https://torrentfreak.com/how-long-does-your-isp-store-ip-address-logs-120629/) maintains that there are no such laws in the US, and [EFF](https://www.eff.org/issues/mandatory-data-retention/us) says the same thing. [This Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_data_retention#Failed_mandatory_ISP_retention_legislation_attempts) agrees, giving details about a specific [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Safety_Act) introduced in the [House](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1076/text) and also in the [Senate](https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/senate-bill/436/text) in the 111th Congress that did not become a law (it did not survive the scrutiny of the judiciary committee in either case).

When and who can a doctor disclose medical information about a patient to, and when do they need consent?\n\nAt the university I used to go to there was a medical clinic on campus and though I sometimes saw different doctors, they all had all of my medical history. I asked about it and they said it's confidential, but confidential to the clinic. What are the laws regarding this? I also found out they changed the university policy so the counselling department can share information with the doctors (and vice\\-versa). Seeing as the counselling department helps with things like course selection (and not just mental problems) does that mean if I asked a counselor if I needed a course, he would know I only have one kidney? \n\nWhat laws apply to situations like this where confidential information in one entity (medical office) decides to share it without the consent of the patients to another entity (the counselling dept.)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [http://www.healthinfoprivacybc.ca/confidentiality/when\\-can\\-and\\-cant\\-they\\-tell\\-others](http://www.healthinfoprivacybc.ca/confidentiality/when-can-and-cant-they-tell-others) is a pretty good summary. Different rules apply to private practices than public clinics and hospitals. I will assume that the clinic on campus is private. This is a summary of the summary about who your information can be shared with:\n\n1. Health care professionals can share information within your \"circle of care\". Specifically, they are allowed to assume your consent to this but you can explicitly withdraw that consent. This would include doctors within the same practice.\n2. Admin staff can access your information for administrative purposes.\n3. Anyone you have authorised them to share it with e.g. relatives, friends etc.\n4. The Medical Services Plan for billing and admin\n5. If you are unable to drive\n6. If there is suspected of child abuse\n7. If you are wounded by a gun or a knife\n8. If you are a danger to others\n\nFor your specific questions:\n\n> I asked about it and they said it's confidential, but confidential to the clinic.\n\nCorrect, unless you *explicitly* revoke this.\n\n> the counselling department can share information with the doctors\n\nThis is tricker, these people *may* be either within your \"circle of care\" or they *may* be part of the same organisation. Notwithstanding, councillors are not doctors and are governed by the everyday laws related to confidentiality i.e. information given in confidence is confidential and everything else isn't. If you are *told* the limits of the confidentiality i.e. they tell the doctor, then those are the limits unless you renegotiate them.\n\n> he would know I only have one kidney?\n\nWell you said \"the counselling department can share information with the doctors\" and this would require the information going the other way i.e. the doctor sharing with the councillor. Even if this type of sharing was OK in general (and I'm not sure it is, see above); the information shared should only be what is required for the councillor to do their job \\- the number of kidneys you have is probably irrelevant to this.\n\n> What laws apply to situations like this where confidential information in one entity (medical office) decides to share it without the consent of the patients to another entity (the counselling dept.)?\n\nWell, we are not sure there are 2 entities: legally there may only be 1 \\- the university. Anyway, the laws are the Personal Information Protection Act and common law (Smith v. Jones, \\[1999] 1 SCR 455\\)",

There is no legal basis for denying a person the right to obtain a birth certificate, and a law prohibiting issuance of a birth certificate to a person who owed money to a hospital would be contrary to the Equal Protection clause of the Constitution. However, the hospital is not obligated to give copies of birth certificates, and probably cannot issue a certified copy (\"(d) No person shall prepare or issue any certificate which purports to be an original, certified copy or duplicate of a vital record except as authorized in this chapter or regulations adopted under this chapter\"). [USCIS states](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/i-9-central-questions-answers/faq/birth-certificate-issued-hospital-acceptable-list-c-document) that \"The only birth certificate acceptable for Form I\\-9 purposes must be an original or certified copy of a birth certificate issued by a state, county, municipal authority or outlying possession of the United States, bearing an official seal (hospitals register births, on which basis government registrars certify births).

But then I remembered that a couply years ago Oracle had successfully sued Google over their commercial use of a reimplementation of one of their APIs (see [this](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/762/what-are-the-implications-of-the-google-vs-oracle-case-on-the-state-of-public) post for reference). While I don't believe any of my personal projects will ever have enough impact to incentivize a large corporation to sue me and I'm also not to sure about the actual licencing/copyright of the library in question this made me wonder whether this court result also sets a precendent for cases like mine in which the functionality of some API is replicated in a sufficiently different technology.\n\nI live in Europe but I would be content with an answer based on US\\-law, this is solely a matter of interest.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I was following the Google\\-Oracle case for a while, to make sure the courts weren't creating an undue obstacle, so I know a little about the US law.\n\nIn the US, an API is a written work requiring originality, so it's copyrighted. In the US, copyright is generally not allowed to stop you from doing something. If I were to write a Java program that can be expected to use existing Java libraries, or a library that can be expected to be used by existing Java programs, the API copyright would not matter because that would prevent anyone from writing Java programs or libraries without Oracle's permission.\n\nGoogle was at least alleged to be doing something different on Android, so Android Java programs would not be expected to use standard Java APIs, and Android libraries would not be expected to be used by standard Java programs, and in that case Google would be infringing on Oracle's copyright. The allegation was that Google just took the language and API because they were already familiar to programmers, who wouldn't have to learn something new in order to program for Android. The language is free to implement, but the APIs aren't necessarily. (I don't know how the case turned out, since I stopped following after the appeals court ruled on the law.)\n\nYou appear to be writing a library so you have the same functionality with additional language bindings, but using the same API. There are doubtless programs out there that use this API to call the closed\\-source implementation. If these programs would be able to use your implementation (the programs and the library do not have to be in the same language), you should be OK in the US.

The answer explains that in the US, while APIs are copyrightable, reimplementing an API is generally allowed if it enables compatibility with existing programs. This is because copyright law is not intended to prevent the creation of interoperable software.\n\nOption A is incorrect because API copyrights do not always prevent reimplementation, especially when it's for compatibility purposes.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the Google vs. Oracle case did not definitively settle that all API reimplementations are infringement. The case was more specific to Google's use of Java APIs in Android, where compatibility with existing Java programs was not the primary goal.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the information clearly states that in the US, APIs are considered copyrightable written works requiring originality.\n\nThe correct answer aligns with the explanation that reimplementing an API for compatibility purposes is generally permissible under US copyright law, as it allows existing programs to use the new implementation without modification."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A month ago I had a hit\\-and\\-run on my property and car, and a few hours later they were found at his mother's house. Car owned by mother, driver is her adult son. Mother finally gave investigating officer an insurance card for traffic tickets. That insurance company informed me the policy expired ten months before, and mailed an official letter about it. A different officer told me the mother is also responsible for being the car owner and not having insurance. I don't know if she really has no insurance, or if she gave the old insurance to avoid a claim against her new insurance. Investigating police officer said both are uncooperative, won't answer phone calls or knocking on door. An arrest warrant was issued for son a few weeks ago.\n\nPolice records won't give me information because it's an active case under investigation. I've spoken to the primary officer and prosecuting attorney office about the expired insurance, and requested they ask the mother if she has a new insurance, and if not can they charge her for not carrying insurance. They seemed to dodge the question and finally said I should fill out a restitution form or I can take them to small claims court. However, both options will take years to recoup my damage expenses whereas a current insurance policy can pay within a month.\n\nSon was finally arrested on two misdemeanors a few days ago, so a court case now exists against him, but nothing about his mother. She does not have an arrest warrant, nor a court case. Idaho law requires proof of insurance to register a vehicle. Vehicles can be registered for one or two years, but most drivers opt for one year since there's no discount for two years. I asked, but understand the DMV can't give me any insurance information they have on file for the car's VIN and owner. It's been ten months now, so there's a decent chance it's been registered with a new insurance company.\n\nMy goal is to try to find current insurance, whether from the DMV, or to get them to cite/arrest mother for not carrying insurance, in which case she'll have to admit to no insurance or produce current insurance. Do I have any options to get the police or prosecuting attorney's office to do these things for me? If so, what's the quickest and most effective path?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The criminal charges against the driver and his mother are police business, not yours. You have a civil case for damages against the driver, and possibly his mother on the theory that she enabled her son's behaviour. Depending on the amount you should either sue them in the [small claims court](https://courtselfhelp.idaho.gov/Forms/claims) or else hire a lawyer.\n\nIf you win the case and the driver was uninsured at the time of the accident then there are two outcomes: either they pay the damages or they go bankrupt. If the latter then sorry, you are out of luck.\n\nAlso talk to your insurance company; if you are insured for this kind of event then they will take the case off your hands, pay you, and then litigate to recover the money themselves.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: In a hit-and-run case where the driver is uninsured and uncooperative, what is the most appropriate course of action for the victim to recover damages?\n\nA) Repeatedly request the police to arrest the driver's mother for not having insurance\nB) Contact the DMV to obtain insurance information for the vehicle\nC) File a civil lawsuit against the driver and possibly the mother in small claims court or with a lawyer\nD) Wait for the criminal case against the driver to conclude before taking any action\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most appropriate course of action is to file a civil lawsuit against the driver and possibly the mother. The criminal charges are handled by the police and are separate from the victim's pursuit of damages. The victim cannot compel the police to arrest the mother or obtain insurance information from the DMV. Waiting for the criminal case to conclude may unnecessarily delay the recovery of damages. Filing a civil lawsuit, either in small claims court or with a lawyer (depending on the amount), is the most direct way for the victim to seek compensation for the damages incurred."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Attorneys often write letters to third parties, in order to get something for their client. E.g. if A trespasses against B, B's attorney may write a letter to A stating that the trespass must be remedied, lest the matter end up in court. I will refer to the situation where an attorney implies that there may be legal action against a person as a \"lawyer threat\". The crucial thing about a lawyer threat is that it is simply an implication of possible legal action communicated to a third party, and it is distinct from to actually taking an action (filing a lawsuit, for instance). What, if any, are the enforceable limits on lawyer threats? By \"enforceable\", I mean that appropriate law boards in a state have the power to penalize (including officially reprimand) an attorney for violation of rules. I don't want to limit this to just formal demand letters (unless there's a rule against communication with third parties not via formal demand).\n\nI presume that if a claim has legal merit, the attorney can represent to the third party that a lawsuit may arise if the situation is not remedied. My interest is the situation where this is not true, and I am specifically interested in established legal principles. [ABA Model Rule 3\\.1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_3_1_meritorious_claims_contentions.html) is related:\n\n> A lawyer shall not bring or defend a proceeding, or assert or\n>  controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis in law and fact\n>  for doing so that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith\n>  argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law. A\n>  lawyer for the defendant in a criminal proceeding, or the respondent\n>  in a proceeding that could result in incarceration, may nevertheless\n>  so defend the proceeding as to require that every element of the case\n>  be established\n\nHere is a hypothetical example. A sells widget X; B has some belief of a property interest in widget X (by patent, contract, or whatever); B's attorney \"knows\" that B's claimed interest is not going to succeed in court, because (if the basis is a contract) there is actually no contract between A and B. The attorney might run into legal problems if he files a meritless suit against A, but could sanctions be imposed for simply implying in a letter that the client may pursue a (meritless) lawsuit?\n\nOne part of the rule (which isn't clearly applicable to letters, anyhow) is where it says \"includes a good faith argument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law\". This strikes me as a large escape clause allowing attorneys to contradict established law, if they think they can make a case for the contradiction.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The main limitations on sending demand letters against the bona fide target of the demand (one can imagine sending a demand letter to someone who isn't a true target of the demand as a sneaky way to engage in defamation or to violate privacy laws but that doesn't seem to be the context here), do not arise from the professional ethics of an attorney, although attorneys are ethically forbidden in communications with third parties from [making statements of fact that are actually false](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_1_truthfulness_in_statements_to_others.html) (Rule of Professional Conduct 4\\.1\\) or [misleading someone into thinking that they are their attorney](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_3_dealing_with_unrepresented_person.html) (Rule of Professional Conduct 4\\.3\\). Actually, the model rule 4\\.1, is broad enough to cover your scenario: \n\n> In the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not knowingly:\n>  (a) make a false statement of material fact or law to a third\n>  person\\[.]\n\nBut, not all states adopt the false statement of law standard at all, and those that do often apply it leniently. The official comments to that rule doesn't add any clarity regarding the question of what constitutes a false statement of law. This is observed in an extended analysis of how Rule 4\\.1 has played out in practice [here](https://law.yale.edu/system/files/documents/pdf/Intellectual_Life/Hinshaw_AttorneyNegEethics.pdf).\n\n> Misrepresentation\n> \n> \n> [1](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_1_truthfulness_in_statements_to_others.html) A lawyer is required to be truthful when dealing with others on a\n>  client\u2019s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inform an\n>  opposing party of relevant facts. A misrepresentation can occur if the\n>  lawyer incorporates or affirms a statement of another person that the\n>  lawyer knows is false. Misrepresentations can also occur by partially\n>  true but misleading statements or omissions that are the equivalent of\n>  affirmative false statements. For dishonest conduct that does not\n>  amount to a false statement or for misrepresentations by a lawyer\n>  other than in the course of representing a client, see Rule 8\\.4\\.\n> \n> \n> Statements of Fact\n> \n> \n> [2](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/model_rules_of_professional_conduct/rule_4_3_dealing_with_unrepresented_person.html) This Rule refers to statements of fact. Whether a particular\n>  statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the\n>  circumstances. Under generally accepted conventions in negotiation,\n>  certain types of statements ordinarily are not taken as statements of\n>  material fact. Estimates of price or value placed on the subject of a\n>  transaction and a party\u2019s intentions as to an acceptable settlement of\n>  a claim are ordinarily in this category, and so is the existence of an\n>  undisclosed principal except where nondisclosure of the principal\n>  would constitute fraud. Lawyers should be mindful of their obligations\n>  under applicable law to avoid criminal and tortious misrepresentation.\n\nRule of Professional Conduct 3\\.1 which is referenced in your question, does not apply to demand letters.\n\nInstead, the main limitations arise from the [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Debt_Collection_Practices_Act), which prohibits debt collectors (a term of art that includes most attorneys) from making false or misleading statements to collect a debt, or attempting to collect a debt that is not due, and also imposes other restrictions related to demand letters.\n\nA recent decision of the U.S. Supreme Court involving a zombie debt claim in bankruptcy ([Midland Funding v. Johnson](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/16-348_h315.pdf)), which held that it was not wrongful to make a claim for a debt that the creditor knew was long ago barred by the statute of limitations in a bankruptcy case (since that is only an affirmative defense to the debt that might be otherwise owed) somewhat limits the application of what would be false, however. But, the fact that Midland Funding was decided on a 5\\-3 basis by the U.S. Supreme Court illustrates how controversial the legal limitations on making claims that are arguably false statements of law can be.\n\nThere are also some state deceptive trade practices laws (and the mail fraud statute combined with RICO) that have been used to punish attorneys he make unjustified demand letters in support of invalid patent claims. This approach has not had consistent success, however, with [a 2014 case on that theory dismissed](https://www.law360.com/articles/539450/judge-dismisses-rico-claims-against-patent-troll-lumen), for example, although the complaining company [later won their case on a different theory](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/graphiq-finally-beats-patent-troll-will-get-100k-payment/). Some states have specifically amended their laws to make sending a demand letter related to an invalid patent an actionable deceptive trade practices.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the ethical and legal implications of this action?\n\nA) The attorney has clearly violated ABA Model Rule 3.1 and will face disciplinary action from the state bar.\n\nB) The attorney's actions are completely protected under the First Amendment and cannot be subject to any legal or ethical scrutiny.\n\nC) The attorney may be at risk of violating ABA Model Rule 4.1, but the application of this rule varies by state and is often interpreted leniently.\n\nD) The attorney's actions are only problematic if they file an actual lawsuit, not for sending a demand letter.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While the attorney's actions in sending a demand letter with a likely meritless claim don't directly violate ABA Model Rule 3.1 (which applies to actually bringing proceedings), they may run afoul of Model Rule 4.1. This rule prohibits knowingly making false statements of material fact or law to third parties. However, the application of Rule 4.1 varies by state, and it's often interpreted leniently, especially regarding statements of law.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because Rule 3.1 specifically applies to bringing or defending proceedings, not to sending demand letters. \n\nAnswer B is overly broad; while there are First Amendment protections, attorneys' communications are still subject to ethical rules and potential legal consequences.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because ethical and legal issues can arise from demand letters, not just from filing lawsuits. Various laws, including the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and some state deceptive trade practices laws, can apply to demand letters."

When her story is \"shaky\", she is reminded that she is under oath and not allowed to lie.\n\nIs this authentic? Could it actually happen in American courts?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The Testimony Of Children Under Oath\n====================================\n\n### Do Children As Young As Seven Years Old Testify In U.S. Courts?\n\n> Could it actually happen in American courts?\n\nYes. It can and does happen on a regular basis, although a seven year old is at the very lower end of the range at which children are called to testify as witnesses with any regularity.\n\nAny witness which a court determines is competent to testify, which includes many, but not all, minors, testifies under oath.\n\nSome jurisdictions have a hard and fast minimum age at which someone can be competent to testify (often age seven is the minimum), while other states make it a rule of reason for the court to evaluate on a case by case basis.\n\nChild testimony can be used in any kind of case, not just sex offenses against children or child abuse and neglect cases, although those cases are the kind of cases where child testimony is most common.\n\n### Special Arrangements Sometimes Made For Child Testimony\n\nWhile special arrangements for the form and circumstances of that testimony can sometimes be ordered by a court (sometimes raising constitutional issues regarding whether the \"[confrontation clause](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4212261/)\" right of a criminal defendant is violated in a criminal case under U.S. Constitutional law), the default rule is that a minor testifies in the same manner as anyone else.\n\nOften the exact wording of the oath is changed when a child can't reasonable be expected to understand the normal wording.\n\n### Perjury In Cases Of Child Testimony Under Oath\n\nIf the person testifying under oath is a minor, a perjury offense would be presumptively tried in juvenile court rather than an adult criminal court.\n\nAlso, it is possible that even if a child is sworn and testifying under oath, that a child will not be old enough to prosecute for the crime of perjury, even in juvenile court, if the child intentionally commits perjury.\n\nAn oath has symbolic value and is believed by many people to have an effect, even when there is no credible threat of a perjury prosecution for lying under oath.\n\nIn practice, perjury prosecutions, even for adults, for court testimony, are vanishingly rare even in pretty clear cases, even though the crime is committed basically every day that courts are open for business.\n\nFor example, there are dozens of such prosecutions a year in Colorado including both in court and out of court sworn statements, and there are tens of thousands of evidentiary hearings and evidentiary trials each year in Colorado, or which perjury is actually committed in perhaps 5%\\-10% of such hearings and trials.\n\nAlternatives To Child Testimony Under Oath\n==========================================\n\n### Evidence Of Unsworn Out Of Court Statements Made By Children\n\nIt is also possible for things that a minor says to be recounted by someone who heard them said or a transcript of a conversation with someone that was not under oath (in which case it is hearsay, but may come within an exception to the hearsay rule), or via a videotape of a child saying something (which is a record to be authenticated prior to its admission). But, in both of those cases, what the child says that the court considers as evidence is not testimony.\n\n### Interviews In Chambers Of Children\n\nAnother process by which courts obtain information from children, often in child custody cases, is for the judge to personally interview the children, not under oath and not with testimony taken down by a court reporter, either in or outside the presence of counsel for the parties (and almost always not in the presence of parents or any audience present at a hearing) in the judges chambers.\n\nThis is primarily done not to elicit evidence of facts, per se, so much as to discern the preferences, desires and concerns of the children themselves as expressed directly. Statements of preferences, desires and opinions of children, because they are not statements of fact and are instead statements of opinion, are by definition not capable of being prosecuted for perjury, since their truth or falsity is not objectively determinable.\n\nThese interviews are given more weight in the case of older children than in the case of younger children and this process would not be used at all for infants or pre\\-schoolers.",

This can be done without any kind of Federal approval what so ever.\n\nAfter proposal, an amendment must be ratified by three\\-fourths of state legislatures.\n\nEDIT: Regarding how to \"get a convention started\": This hasn't been tested, since a non\\-Congressional amendment has not, to my knowledge, been attempted, but I would imagine a Convention would be called if 2/3rds of the states submitted requests to Congress (which would probably either be a law or a joint\\-resolution, which is like a law without executive approval, but the form would probably be governed by each state's respective Constitution).\n\nAlternatively, it may be sufficient for state legislatures to designate delegates who meet up somewhere (as that is essentially what happened with the Constitutional Congress, i.e. the delegates who met and drafted the US Federal Constitution).\n\nA point has been raised in another answer that there may be an issue; however, I'm not convinced of this being a bar to a Convention. The delegates at the Constitutional Congress were original chosen to discuss changes to the Articles of Confederation, but wound up throwing the whole thing out and starting from scratch instead.\n\nTherefore, I do not see calls for a convention with differing but related objectives to be a problem; the whole point of a Convention in the Constitutional Amendment process is to discuss and compromise; otherwise, why require it before skipping to the 3/4ths of states ratifying, if the 2/3rds of states already have to agree on exactly what is being proposed before sending delegates.",

In the novel a lawyer receives an envelope addressed to him by a client, in the client's handwriting, which the lawyer knows well. But the letter inside is not addressed to the lawyer, or indeed to anyone. Enclosed are sheets of paper with a watermark of the sort used in printing paper money, strongly suggesting a counterfeiting operation. The unaddressed and unsigned note is consistent with the idea of a counterfeiting operation. The note is also in the client's distinctive handwriting.\n\nThe lawyer assumes that the contents of the envelope were placed there by a mistake of the client, and were intended to be sent to a confederate of the client in this illegal scheme. He further assumes that a letter intended for the lawyer was sent to the confederate.\n\nThe lawyer had not previously known or suspected that the client was engaged in forgery or any unlawful activity.\n\nThe lawyer decides to treat this as a confidential and privileged matter. But the narrator remarks that he is obviously wrong to do so. One passage reads:\n\n> The obvious inference was that the letter which had come to Penfield \\[the lawyer] contained incriminating matter. That would explain everything. For if Penfield had thus stumbled on evidence of a crime, either committed or contemplated, he would have to choose between denouncing the criminal or keeping the matter to himself. But he was not entitled to keep it to himself; for, other considerations apart, this was not properly a client's secret. It had not been communicated to him: he had discovered it by accident. He was therefore not bound to secrecy, and he could not, consequently, claim a lawyer's privilege. In short, if he had discovered a crime and chose to suppress his discovery, he was, in effect, an accessory, before or after the fact, as the case might be; and he would necessarily keep the secret because he would not dare to divulge it.\n\n(Source: Chapter IV of *The Shadow of the Wolf* by R.

Would the lawyer be required to divulge it if asked by the police or in a court? Would he be required to report the matter to the police on his own?

I understand that a statement by a client that the client has committed a crime in the past is privileged. But what about this sort of unintended disclosure by the client?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\") \\- present day...\n\n**Would the contents of the envelope be considered privileged?**\n\n**No** Although it is possible to argue that the letter is a communication to the lawyer (albeit by mistake) its purpose is not in relation to seeking or receiving legal advice, so it fails to meet the definition of legal privilege:\n\n[There are two forms of legal professional privilege](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_professional_privilege_in_England_and_Wales):\n\n> * Legal advice privilege protects confidential communications between lawyers and their clients for the purposes of giving or obtaining legal advice.\n> * Litigation privilege protects confidential communications between lawyers, clients and third parties made for the purposes of litigation, either actual or contemplated.\n\n**Would the lawyer be required to divulge it if asked by the police or in a court?**\n\n**Yes, No, Maybe** If the lawyer is a suspect/defendant then there is no requirement to answer any questions whatsoever. Similarly, there is no obligation on a witness to answer questions unless a statutory provision has been triggered, such as the lawyer being given a Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 [Disclosure Notice](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/15/part/2/chapter/1/crossheading/disclosure-notices?timeline=false).\n\n**Would he be required to report the matter to the police on his own?**\n\n**Yes** Although there is no general requirement to report a crime (of this nature) to the police, the lawyer's profession is in the \"regulated sector\" which requires [Suspicious Activity Reports](https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/what-we-do/crime-threats/money-laundering-and-illicit-finance/suspicious-activity-reports) to be submitted to the authorities:\n\n> ... in respect of information that comes to them in the course of their business if they know, or suspect or have reasonable grounds for knowing or suspecting, that a person is engaged in, or attempting, [money laundering](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/29/part/7/crossheading/offences?timeline=false)...\n\n**What difference, if any does it make that the client apparently did not intend to send these contents to the lawyer?**\n\n**None** that I can see\n\n---\n\n**ETA** The status of legal privilege in 1925 seems to have been the same as now, and this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_professional_privilege)\narticle, under the heading *History* offers this in support:\n\n> The common law principle of legal professional privilege is of extremely long standing.

The lawyer is not required to voluntarily disclose the information to the police or answer their questions without proper legal procedures. However, as a member of a regulated profession, the lawyer is obligated to submit a Suspicious Activity Report to the authorities regarding potential money laundering activities. This balances the lawyer's professional obligations with legal requirements for reporting suspicious activities in regulated sectors."

According to the information provided, recent prosecutions of former Nazi war criminals in Germany have been made possible due to a new legal interpretation established in the cases of Demjanjuk in 2011 and 2015. This legal reasoning holds that being a camp guard is sufficient to be found guilty of accessory to murder, even without specific evidence of individual crimes. This approach was later applied in other cases, such as the Rehbogen trial, allowing for the prosecution of elderly former Nazi personnel who served as camp guards.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the prosecutions are not based on new evidence of specific crimes. Option B is incorrect as there is no mention of changes in international law enabling these prosecutions. Option C is incorrect because the issue is not related to a statute of limitations expiring, but rather a new interpretation of existing law."

I put up a trampoline in the back yard but the safety net is over the height of the fence. The HOA has a rule that I can not have anything taller than the fence. \n\nThere are some exceptions to the rule of having something taller than the fence (e.g umbrella, trees). I asked for an exception for the safety net and was denied and was instructed to take it down. I was told that the trampoline itself is not a violation. The safety net is 95% see through. \n\nIt's clearly an attempt to persuade me to remove the trampoline all together. Again the trampoline itself is not considered a violation.\n\nThere have been noise complaints. The kids get loud sometimes. This is not a violation of any rules either.\n\nIt is possible for me to take the net down and put it back up when the kids want to jump. It's a bit of a pain in the butt though. Each time I put it back when the kids want to jump. I get a message from the HOA to take it down\u2026 which I do.\n\nMy girlfriend doesn't want me to remove it completely for safety. I'm at a point where I want to remove it completely though.\n\n1. If I remove the net and someone gets hurt, can I sue the HOA?\n2. Can I fight the HOA as a renter? Can I be evicted?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer depends in part on your relationship to the HOA, and your lease. Normally, you would have no direct relationship to the HOA, instead your legal relationship is with the owner (who has a relationship to the HOA). The owner of the condo has a legal obligation to follow certain rules, the violation of which will result in a penalty (imposed on him). You presumably are leasing the place from an owner, so the HOA won't impose any penalty on you, since you have no direct connection with the HOA. You then have to look at your rental agreement, to see what obligations were stated, whereby you have to follow the HOA rules. If there is a clause that says \"You must follow the rules\", then if you don't, it's possible you can be evicted by the owner. If there isn't such a clause, the owner would suffer the consequences of your rule\\-breaking.\n\nYou can try to sue the HOA if someone gets hurt, but that would be a waste of your time and money since the suit would be dismissed (the HOA is not responsible for injuries that you are legally responsible for). Whether or not you *should* try such a lawsuit is between you and your attorney. You can try to fight the HOA (politically), within limits, e.g. by writing letters, or speaking to the HOA or board of directors, as long as they allow it (since you aren't a homeowner, they don't have to listen to you). Again, whether you should do this is between you and your attorney, and anyhow that's not a legal question. You could not, however, sue the HOA to force them to change the rules.",

While the renter can attempt to sue the HOA if someone gets hurt after removing the safety net, such a lawsuit would likely be dismissed. The HOA is not legally responsible for injuries that occur on private property for which the renter (or property owner) is liable. The HOA's rule enforcement doesn't transfer liability for personal injuries to the HOA. Options A and D are incorrect because they suggest the HOA could be held liable under certain circumstances, which is not supported by the information provided.

In the US at least, making [minor changes to a trademark generally doesn't get you off the hook for unlicensed use](http://seattletrademarklawyer.com/blog/2018/8/16/minor-changes-to-a-trademark-usually-dont-avoid-a-likelihood.html). The owner of the \"Risko!\" trademark could bring suit against you for trademark infringement and it would be up to a judge or possibly a jury to decide whether \"Risko\" is different enough from \"Risko!\" that confusion would be unlikely. If they won the suit they could collect damages and their legal costs.\n\n[There was a protracted and important trademark lawsuit in the US over the names \"Monopoly\" and \"Anti\\-Monopoly\" for board games](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/intellectual_property_law/publications/landslide/2014-15/march-april/not-playing-around-board-games-intellectual-property-law/). An economist, [Ralph Anspach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Anspach), had introduced a game he called \"Anti\\-monopoly\". He was sued by the Parker Brothers company for infringing on their trademark for \"Monopoly\". After 10 years the US Supreme Court ruled in Anspach's favor, finding that \"Monopoly\" had become a generic term for a type of board game and was no longer a valid trademark.\n\nYou can't necessarily count on being \"small potatoes\" so that they'll simply ignore your possible infringement. In US law, [failure to enforce their trademark rights can lead to the loss of trademark rights and remedies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliverherzfeld/2013/02/28/failure-to-enforce-trademarks-if-you-snooze-do-you-lose/#3545351d6c22), so companies are less likely to let minor infringements slide. The situation in Italy may be different.\n\nYour artwork and graphical components are another potential problem. Those probably are covered by copyright. Again, the holder of the copyright for the \"Risko!\" artwork could sue you for violating their copyright on the artwork. A judge or jury would then evaluate whether your artwork was \"derivative\" of the \"Risko!\" artwork. If the court finds that your artwork is derivative, you might have to pay damages and legal costs.\n\nThere are actually a ton of Risk inspired games already available online, but they seem to stay away from names that sounds anything like \"Risk\" and anything that looks like the Risk artwork.",

For trademarks, even minor changes (like \"Risko\" vs \"Risko!\") may not be sufficient to avoid infringement claims. Trademark owners often actively enforce their rights to prevent losing them. For copyright, independently produced artwork that is very similar to the original could still be considered \"derivative\" and infringe on the copyright holder's rights. The fact that the game is free to play does not protect against these intellectual property concerns. Fair use typically doesn't apply to commercial products or direct copies of games, even if inspired by the original. Therefore, option C most accurately describes the potential legal risks faced by the developer."

Certainly, there is no way for us to verify their claims without an extremely rigorous independent audit. But even that can be sabotaged.\n\nRegardless though, many VPN service providers vehemently claim that they do not keep logs. An example is NordVPN, which is based in Panama and so there is no domestic legislation that forces it to keep logs:\n\n[NordVPN Privacy Policy:](https://nordvpn.com/privacy-policy/)\n\n> \"Our top priority is customer data security. Operating under the\n>  jurisdiction of Panama allows us to guarantee our no logs policy,\n>  which means that your activities while using the privacy solutions\n>  created by NordVPN.com are not monitored, recorded, logged, stored or\n>  passed to any third party.\"\n\nWhat I do not understand is companies like NordVPN have hundreds of servers around the world, most of which are not in the country that they are originally based in. Surely, no\\-logging is impossible for most of their servers? Or are companies compelled to log depending on where they are based? So US legislation would not apply to a VPN server in the US which is run by a company based in Hong Kong \\- but this doesn't make sense \\- wouldn't US legislation apply to them regardless of where they are based? \n\n[This link](https://www.bestvpn.com/best-hong-kong-vpn/) says, again, that one of the pros of VPN servers being based in Hong Kong is that companies are not compelled to keep logs (I assume this is in contrast with servers in the US and other countries):\n\n> \"There are no mandatory data retention laws in Hong Kong. Most Hong\n>  Kong\\-based providers offer a \u201cno logs\u201d service, and international\n>  companies are not required to keep logs relating to their Hong Kong\n>  servers (although some companies, notably US based ones, choose to do\n>  so).\"\n\nSurely legislation does not discriminate based on where a company is based? Eg. all companies that operate in the UK are forced to abide by the Data Protection Act (DPA). Whether or not they are based in the UK does not matter. As long as the data that that company possesses remains in the UK, it has to be treated in compliance with UK law.\n\nAlso, why would US companies with servers in Hong Kong willingly keep logs if the law is not forcing them to? Sounds like a great marketing tool if they were able to claim they intentionally choose not to log. \n\nMy assumption here is that any legislation regarding mass surveillance of private citizens is followed by companies the same as legislation regarding anything else (DPA, legislation about the treatment of employees, etc.). Chinese companies with offices in the UK cannot treat their employees according to Chinese law, so why does are they allowed to treat legislation pertaining to internet traffic differently?\n\nAs for who would do the forcing, the local governments. Eg. the US government, that passes mass\\-surveillance legislation. If the US government argues they need logs to keep track of the movements of criminals and especially terrorists, wouldn't a company saying \"we do not keep logs by choice\" be condemned as impeding government counter\\-terrorism efforts? If the law requires all VPN servers in the US to keep logs, wouldn't a company not keeping logs be in violation of the law and hence 'criminal'?\n\nIf it's a legal loophole, it sounds like a dumb loophole if politicians are trying to claim they need logs to track down criminals (including terrorists), while allowing VPN providers to not keep logs.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: This is tied up in the concept of [sovereignty](http://nationalunitygovernment.org/pdf/Sovereignty-Guidelines-Alessandro-Pelizzon.pdf) \\- nation states have control over their territories and citizens and they recognise the right of other nation states to do likewise. \n\nThe USA, China (Hong Kong) and Panama are all sovereign states, they each decide what the law is within their own territory and they can\u2019t tell each other what to do; they can *ask*, however, that\u2019s what diplomats *do*.\n\nIf a HK domiciled company provides HK based servers then they have to comply with HK law irrespective of where their customers are located. The USA could pass a law requiring US companies (like ISPs) to keep logs of traffic to and from HK servers but they cannot force a HK company to do *anything*, unless and until it operates in a place where the US has jurisdiction which means both the right *and* the ability to enforce their law.",

Which statement is most accurate regarding the logging requirements for this company?\n\nA) The company must follow US logging laws for its US-based servers, regardless of where the company is headquartered.\nB) The company is only subject to Panama's logging laws, even for its US-based servers.\nC) The company is not required to keep any logs because it is headquartered in a country without mandatory data retention laws.\nD) US authorities can directly compel the Panama-based company to keep logs on its US servers.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The concept of sovereignty means that countries have control over activities within their territories. While the VPN company is based in Panama, its servers located in the US are subject to US laws and regulations. The US government cannot directly force a Panama-based company to take action, but it can regulate the operations of servers physically located within US borders. This means the company would need to comply with US logging requirements for its US-based servers, even if it follows different rules for servers in other countries. Options B and C incorrectly assume that the company's home country laws apply everywhere, while option D overstates the US government's direct authority over a foreign company."

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A homeowner orders timber for a construction project with a specified delivery date. The timber arrives two days late, causing the homeowner to incur additional costs for labor and equipment rental. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the homeowner's ability to claim compensation for these additional costs?\n\nA) The homeowner is automatically entitled to full compensation for all additional costs incurred due to the late delivery.\n\nB) The homeowner has no legal recourse and must accept the company's offer to refund only the delivery cost.\n\nC) The homeowner's right to compensation depends on the specific terms of the contract with the timber supplier.\n\nD) The homeowner can only seek compensation through a small claims court or credit card company, regardless of the contract terms.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the homeowner's ability to claim compensation for additional costs due to late delivery primarily depends on the specific terms of the contract with the timber supplier. If the contract included penalties or compensation clauses for late delivery, the homeowner might be entitled to claim these additional costs. However, if the contract only specified a delivery date without any consequences for delays, the supplier might not be legally obligated to cover these extra expenses. The other options are incorrect because they either assume automatic entitlement (A), no legal recourse at all (B), or limit the options for seeking compensation unnecessarily (D). The contract terms are the key factor in determining the homeowner's rights in this situation."

This argument has been unsuccessfully raised in US v Hitselberger and in Private Manning's case regarding 18 USC 793(e).\n\nB) The gross negligence standard violates due process rights, as demonstrated in the Supreme Court case Brady v Maryland, which established the prosecution's obligation to disclose exculpatory evidence.\n\nC) The statute infringes on First Amendment rights, as argued in New York Times Co. v United States, which dealt with the publication of classified information.\n\nD) The law violates the separation of powers doctrine, as ruled in INS v Chadha, where the Supreme Court struck down the legislative veto.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: Option A correctly identifies the potential argument of unconstitutional vagueness, which is supported by the information provided. It mentions the relevant case of McDonnell v US, where similar arguments were made about a different statute.

According to the information provided, even for works produced after 1973 (when the Soviet Union began entering into copyright treaties with western countries), they would need to be registered for copyright in the United States to claim protection there. This means that Soviet films from the 1970s are not automatically protected by copyright in the US, but could be protected if they were specifically registered.

In my own state of Colorado, covenant violations and small debt collections can be brought in a court of limited jurisdiction called a county court that also handles evictions and money claims up to $15,000 and temporary restraining orders, while other disputes are brought in a court of general jurisdiction called a district court.\n\nI have seen charts of organization for court systems in England, Scotland and New Zealand in the past, as well as all U.S. jurisdictions, and don't recall any courts specifically devoted to condominium disputes in any of them. \n\nEven in civil law countries, specialized courts with jurisdiction over condominium disputes are quite uncommon as I have seen organizational charts for many of those. I seem to recall one or two in the Benelux countries, however.\n\n**Alternative Dispute Resolution Programs For Condominium Owners**\n\nSome condominium associations, however, do have an arbitration agreement included in them that requires that such disputes be referred to a private arbitrator, although binding arbitration provisions aren't very common in condominiums in most parts of the U.S.\n\nFlorida recently adopted [mandatory non\\-binding arbitration](http://www.stevenmasonpa.com/jurisdiction-in-condominium-disputes/) of condominium disputes which is a pre\\-requisite to taking a condominium case to court.\n\n[Connecticut](http://www.ctcondonews.com/2015/04/21/legislation-to-establish-a-pilot-program-to-mediate-condominium-disputes/) has or is contemplating a pilot condominium dispute mediation program as part of the services provided by its probate court, but rejected adding jurisdiction over these cases to its general purpose small claims or limited jurisdiction court as Colorado does. Mediation is a form of non\\-binding settlement discussion which is facilitated by a third party mediator.\n\n**Housing Courts**\n\nI also review below several housing courts in the U.S., none of which appear to clearly have condominium dispute jurisdiction.\n\n*Stand Alone Housing and Land Courts*\n\n[Massachusetts](http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/trial-court/hc/) has a stand alone court whose jurisdiction over condominium matters is at best not well advertised and at worst absent or unclear. Massachusetts also has a [Land Court](http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/trial-court/lc/lc-faqs-gen.html), but that also doesn't seem to have jurisdiction (it handles foreclosures, partition actions, and zoning cases). It is the only state of which I am aware that has a stand alone housing court as opposed to a specialized division of another more general purpose court.\n\nThe [City of Providence](https://www.municode.com/library/ri/providence/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_CH8CO_ARTIIHOCO), Rhode Island has a housing court on the Massachusetts housing court model with similarly vague jurisdiction, established as part of its authority to create municipal courts, rather than as part of a state court system as in Massachusetts, but not as a mere division of a municipal court either. Again, it probably lacks condominium dispute jurisdiction.\n\n*Housing Courts As Divisions Of General Purpose Courts*\n\nNew York City has [a division of the limited jurisdiction city court](https://www.nycourts.gov/courts/nyc/housing/) for New York City handles such cases (up to $25,000 in controversy) but I don't know if it has jurisdiction over condominium disputes or just landlord\\-tenant and housing code violations. [Cleveland](http://clevelandhousingcourt.org/) similarly has a division of its municipal court called housing court with similar jurisdiction that also doesn't appear to have jurisdiction over condominium disputes, just housing code violations and landlord\\-tenant disputes. There is a [housing court division](http://www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/civil/realproperty/housing-court) in Superior Courts in San Francisco, California (which also seems to lack condominium dispute jurisdiction although it isn't entirely clear).\n\n*Housing Courts In Name Only*\n\nThe [City of Baltimore](http://www.baltimorehousing.org/), Maryland appears to use the term \"housing court\" more figuratively to reference to the docket of cases brought by city officials in the housing department, rather than as a true administratively distinct court.",

Instead, these cases are typically handled in general civil trial courts, the same as other contract or property disputes. Some jurisdictions offer alternative dispute resolution options, such as Florida's mandatory non-binding arbitration or Connecticut's pilot mediation program.

        "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John is planning to visit his family in New Jersey for a week. He owns a legally purchased handgun in his home state and wants to bring it with him. Under which of the following circumstances would John be in compliance with New Jersey firearm laws?\n\nA) John can bring his handgun as long as it's unloaded and locked in the glove compartment of his car.\nB) John can bring his handgun if it's unloaded, in a locked container, and kept in the trunk of his car or as far from the driver as possible if there's no separate trunk.\nC) John can bring his handgun if it's unloaded and stored in a locked container, but he must also obtain a New Jersey firearms permit before entering the state.\nD) John cannot bring his handgun into New Jersey under any circumstances if he plans to stay in the state, even temporarily.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: According to the New Jersey State Police FAQ, firearms can be transported through New Jersey if they are unloaded and contained in a closed and fastened case, gunbox, securely tied package, or locked in the trunk of the automobile. If the vehicle doesn't have a separate trunk compartment, the firearm must be in a locked container (not the glove compartment or center console) and kept farthest from the driver. Option A is incorrect because the glove compartment is not a suitable storage location. Option C is incorrect because John doesn't need to obtain a New Jersey firearms permit for temporary transport and possession during a family visit, as long as the firearm is legal in New Jersey. Option D is too restrictive and doesn't align with the stated regulations. Option B correctly describes the legal method of transporting a firearm into New Jersey for a temporary stay."

This could be a photo, video, skype session, or some other form of proof. The proof may be downloaded, mailed, or in person delivered. \n\nIf it is against the law, what law / regulation? I've seen several posts stating that it's against the law, but no one has mentioned an applicable law.\n\nAlso, what would be the legal difference between a spell and a prayer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Selling online is unclear.\n\nHowever, selling in the mail, the court has held that, based on [18 U.S.C.A. S1341](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1341) (Frauds and swindles):\n\n> Therein the weight of authority is that astrologers, conjurers, fakirs, magicians, mediums, and all variety of pretenders to supernatural power, and who assume to sell the same for money, are amenable to the criminal law of false pretenses. *United States v. Calwer*, 282 F. 1007 (D. Minn. 1923\\).\n\nIn prosecution for devising a scheme and artifice to defraud and using the mails in connection therewith, which scheme consisted of representations by defendant that he was gifted with supernatural powers, evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction. *Crane v. U.S.*, C.C.A.9 (Cal.) 1919, 259 F. 480, 170 C.C.A. 456\n\nNotwithstanding constitutional provision as to religious freedom, it was an offense to pretend to believe in supernatural powers for the purpose of procuring money and to use the mails in pursuance of such purpose. *New v. U.S.*, C.C.A.9 (Cal.) 1917, 245 F. 710, 158 C.C.A. 112, certiorari denied 38 S.Ct. 334, 246 U.S. 665, 62 L.Ed. 928\\.\n\nThese are mostly lower court cases (the last has a cert. denial from the Supreme Court, meaning the Supreme Court effectively upheld the lower court's decision without making it the law of the land), and both were from nearly 100 years ago.

The cases cited (United States v. Calwer, Crane v. U.S., and New v. U.S.) all indicate that claiming supernatural powers to obtain money can be prosecuted under fraud laws, specifically 18 U.S.C.A.

However, the proposed guarantor has not signed any agreement or provided their details to the letting agency. The tenancy agreement itself does not mention a guarantor.

This creates a binding tenancy agreement between the tenant and the landlord/agency. However, for a guarantor agreement to be legally binding, the guarantor must explicitly agree to the terms, usually by signing a separate guarantor agreement. In this case, the proposed guarantor has not signed anything or provided their details, so they are not legally bound as a guarantor. The absence of a guarantor doesn't invalidate the tenancy itself, as the lease doesn't mention a guarantor requirement. The agency's failure to secure the guarantor's agreement before allowing the tenant to move in doesn't change the legal status of the tenancy, but it does mean they don't have a guarantor to pursue if the tenant defaults on rent or other obligations."

Option B clearly demonstrates this intent, making it the correct answer."

They only accept electronic payments such as credit cards, local debit cards, etc. Is this legal?\n\nOn most currencies, it is written on the note something along the lines of \"*this note settles X dollars of debt*\". If a customer offers to purchase a product or settle the bill for a service they have consumed (e.g., food already is eaten, gas already pumped into the car) via cash, can the seller deny it?\n\nOn a related topic, must business entities accept cash for invoice settlements? I know that the party receiving the payment can charge a \"reasonable fee\" for processing the cash (e.g., thousands of coins). Can they, for example, demand the debt be settled by bank transfer only?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The [Bank of England](http://edu.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/what-is-legal-tender/) actually makes this pretty clear with the following line:\n\n> Legal tender has a very narrow and technical meaning, which relates to settling debts. It means that if you are in debt to someone then you can\u2019t be sued for non\\-payment if you offer full payment of your debts in legal tender.\n\nEssentially, if you are in debt (frequent examples are a taxi ride or a meal at a sit\\-down restaurant) then you can use legal tender to pay off that debt. **But that doesn't necessarily mean they have to accept it.** It only means that they cannot sue you if they do refuse to accept it. But the refusal wouldn't itself alleviate the debt either. They could technically return to you at some point and say \"ok, fine, we'll take the cash\" and you'd still be obligated to provide it to pay off your debt.\n\nIt's also worth emphasizing that this only applies to situations where the payment is to alleviate a debt, for services that have already been provided before you are billed. It would not apply while buying groceries at the supermarket. Even restaurants where you pay for your food up\\-front and then receive it afterwards can refuse cash payment. In those situations the services are prepaid and you are not ever alleviating a debt.",

You've finished your meal and when presented with the bill, you offer to pay with cash. The restaurant refuses. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The restaurant is legally obligated to accept your cash payment since you've already consumed the meal.\nB) You can leave without paying since the restaurant refused your legal tender.\nC) The restaurant can refuse your cash, but cannot sue you for non-payment if you offered full payment in legal tender.\nD) The restaurant's policy is illegal, and you can report them to authorities for refusing cash payments.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. According to the information provided, legal tender has a narrow technical meaning related to settling debts. While the restaurant can refuse to accept cash payment, they cannot sue you for non-payment if you offered full payment in legal tender (cash). However, this doesn't mean you can leave without paying or that the debt is canceled. The restaurant could still pursue payment through other means or eventually accept the cash. It's important to note that the restaurant's policy of not accepting cash is not illegal, and they are within their rights to set such a policy, especially for prepaid services. Options A and D are incorrect because businesses generally have the right to set their payment policies. Option B is incorrect because the debt still exists even if the restaurant refuses the cash payment."

If a corporation purchases a firearm, is the seller \"delivering\" the firearm to the corporation, or to the individual who is physically present to receive it?

The US has statute law dealing with lost money but that is not the question here.\n\n> Property is generally deemed to have been **lost** if it is found in a place where the true owner likely did not intend to set it down, and where it is not likely to be found by the true owner. At common law, the finder of a lost item could claim the right to possess the item against any person except the true owner or any previous possessors.\n> \n> \n> Property is generally deemed to have been **mislaid** or **misplaced** if it is found in a place where the true owner likely did intend to set it, but then simply forgot to pick it up again. For example, a wallet found in a shop lying on a counter near a cash register will likely be deemed misplaced rather than lost. Under common law principles, the finder of a misplaced object has a duty to turn it over to the owner of the premises, on the theory that the true owner is likely to return to that location to search for his misplaced item. **If the true owner does not return within a reasonable time (which varies considerably depending on the circumstances), the property becomes that of the owner of the premises.**\n> \n> \n> Property is generally deemed to have been **abandoned** if it is found in a place where the true owner likely intended to leave it, but is in such a condition that it is apparent that he or she has no intention of returning to claim it. Abandoned property generally becomes the property of whoever should find it and take possession of it first, although some states have enacted statutes under which certain kinds of abandoned property \u2013 usually cars, wrecked ships and wrecked aircraft \u2013 escheat, meaning that they become the property of the state.\n\nFor your specifics:\n\n> If I purchase merchandise in a physical store, and then (accidentally or not) leave the merchandise at the store after I've paid for it, is the store allowed to resell that merchandise to another customer?\n\nThis would be **mislaid** property and if they cannot find you and you do not return to claim it after a reasonable time (which would be different for a Mars bar and a [Boeing 747](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-35068145)) then it is theirs and they can do what they want with it: including sell it to someone else.\n\n> How does this scenario differ from leaving personal items at the store that I purchased elsewhere?\n\nIt doesn't.",

But Congress may by a vote of two\\-thirds of each House, remove such disability.\n\nis currently being invoked to block certain individuals from running for Congress in the 2022 election.\n\nHowever, some of these individuals and others\n\n1. Took an oath of office as a new member of Congress to uphold the Constitution;\n2. They then arguably participated in an insurrection, or gave aid or comfort to insurrectionists;\n3. They continued to hold office.\n\nWhy is Article 3 only being used to **block** their re\\-election, and not to stop them immediately from **continuing to hold** their position.\n\nNote: The question assumes that Article 3 applies; the question is why the power to remove is not also being used.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Suggestive Precedent\n--------------------\n\nOnly one person has ever had this section of the 14th amendment used against them since Reconstruction ended: to block [Victor Berger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_L._Berger) from taking his seat in the 1919\\-1920 House of Representatives; he had previously won a single term in the House in 1910\\.\n\nThis disqualification was done in the House of Representatives itself, with a near unanimous vote holding that he was not eligible for the seat on multiple occasions. Based on events leading to his conviction under the Espionage Act, he was held in violation of the 14th amendment clause in question, and was denied his seat.\n\nBerger (and others) [appealed this conviction to SCOTUS](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/295/78/), who overturned it in 1921, holding the judge had an impermissible appearance of bias against the defendants. Berger then went on to win three consecutive House elections from 1922\\-1926\\. The curious bit here is that no one seemed to have any problem with his taking the seat at this point, and no vote was ever held to remove the disability the 1919 Congress had asserted (as per the 14th amendment), nor any to deny him the seat yet again.\n\nThis creates a problematic precedent for anyone looking to deny a seat already won. First is that the enforcement of the 14th amendment provision was done by Congress itself, creating the question of whether that is the only Constitutional way to remove an elected congressperson under this clause. Second is that Congress created an implicit connection between a valid criminal conviction and a 14th amendment disqualification, by simply ignoring his prior disqualification after his conviction's overturning. This is a bit tenuous, but nevertheless a potential obstacle, as [the Congressional records for the House proceedings on Berger](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6/html/GPO-HPREC-CANNONS-V6-10.htm), a rather fascinating read, are explicit in declaring that they are operating independently of the actual criminal case and judgements.\n\nNo court has had opportunity to decide these for certain, but they provide a convenient defense for the accused. As such it is handy if you have alternative and additional paths to pursue your case under, so as to differentiate it. In Marjorie Taylor Greene's case, for example, there are explicit state laws for challenging if a candidate meets all valid legal and constitutional requirements. No such process was used, or perhaps available (I haven't tried to check this), in Berger's case. This creates a substantial legal difference, at least in principle, as it concerns disqualifying a candidate from future seats rather than denying a set to an already\\-sitting (or at least, already\\-elected, which SCOTUS has held is much the same thing) congressperson, and is utilizing a non\\-Congressional legal channel. MTG herself is challenging this law's constitutionality, I presume under the argument that in fact only Congress can effect and judge a candidate's compliance with the 14th amendment. The counter defense, presumably, would be that the case is not attempting to interfere with her currently held seat, which may conceivably be solely under Congress's control, but with potential future seats.\n\nTime constraints\n----------------\n\nFinally, as a practical matter, the few court cases we've had on denying someone a seat in Congress have all taken about the entire duration of a given Congress (2 years) to resolve. This means the case could become moot before a decision is ever finalized, and even if not the practical result would be a very small loss in the total time the accused Congressperson remains a valid and voting member. So it makes more sense to target all future candidacies instead of the presently held seat, as that will never be formally mooted short of Congressional action pursuant to the 14th amendment.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Based on the historical precedent of Victor Berger's case and its implications for modern applications of the 14th Amendment, Article 3, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding attempts to disqualify sitting members of Congress accused of participating in insurrection?\n\nA) Courts have clear authority to immediately remove sitting members of Congress under the 14th Amendment, Article 3.\n\nB) Only Congress itself has the established precedent to enforce the 14th Amendment, Article 3 disqualification against its own members.\n\nC) State laws challenging a candidate's eligibility for future elections are unconstitutional based on the Berger precedent.\n\nD) The 14th Amendment, Article 3 can only be applied if there is a criminal conviction related to insurrection.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: The case of Victor Berger provides the main historical precedent for applying the 14th Amendment, Article 3 to disqualify members of Congress. In Berger's case, it was the House of Representatives itself that voted to deny him his seat based on this constitutional provision. This creates a precedent suggesting that Congress, rather than the courts, may have the primary authority to enforce this disqualification against its own members.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is no clear court precedent for removing sitting members under this provision. Option C is not supported by the information given; in fact, the text mentions that state laws are being used in modern cases like Marjorie Taylor Greene's. Option D overstates the connection between criminal convictions and 14th Amendment disqualifications; while Berger's case showed some implicit connection, it's not an absolute requirement.\n\nThe correct answer reflects the most established precedent from the Berger case, while also explaining why current efforts focus more on future elections rather than removing sitting members."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the US, what is the process for passing a new law? What are the stages and what are the regulatory bodies involved? Does it depend on the type of law?\n\nAlso, once a law is passed, is there any legal procedure by which such law can be withdrawn?\n\nFinally, are there any international bodies which can override a US law?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \"Law\" is actually a very broad term, which encompasses statutes, rules, regulations, precedent and I'm sure some other things that I'm forgetting. The popular understanding of \"law\" is the statute, which involves Congress (at the federal level) or the legislature (and the state level). That is the kind of law that we say is \"passed\". At the federal level, some number of representatives or senators will introduce a bill into the House or Senate, and it is discussed in a relevant committee; if it is approved, it moves to debate by the whole House / Senate and if it passes it moves to the other house. Once it has passed both the House and Senate, it goes to the President where it may be signed, rejected, or ignored. If signed, it becomes \"a law\", if rejected (vetoed) it can become law anyhow if it gains a 2/3 majority vote in both houses. If the President ignores it (\"pocket veto\"), it becomes law in 10 days (Sunday is not a day), unless Congress is not in session. Oh, and, that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAt the state level, there is a similar process, with the further option of referenda and initiatives. In the former case, a particular law will have been passed by the legislature and then it is put to a popular vote for affirmation / overturning, and in the latter case a new law is proposed by the people (generally through a petitioning process) and then voted on by the populace. There is a [fair amount of variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiatives_and_referendums_in_the_United_States) on how this works and what can be done, by state.\n\nA law can be repealed (withdrawn) by passing a law that repeals a given part of the existing law, and it can be re\\-written. The Supreme Court of the jurisdiction can also withdraw a (part of a) law if it is found to be unconstitutional. No foreign body can override US law, although if the US is bound by treaty (which necessarily involves another country) then we might have to do whatever that treaty says, because we approved the treaty. One limit on what we can be forced into by treaties is that a treaty cannot violate the constitution.\n\nThe largest source of law in the US is actually not statutory, it is regulatory law, where a regulatory agency writes rules with the force of law (so really, it *is* law). In that case, there has to be a statutory basis, where at the federal level a law is passed empowering an agency to write rules, where the scope of the regulation is supposed to be related to the empowering statute in some manner. In that case, there is a vetting process, but basically no voting, just an announcement, some discussion, and eventually the rules are set. Analogous processes exist at the state level.\n\nWe also have various county and city governmental bodies, where e.g. the city council can vote to create a law; or, they can empower an agency to write regulations. \n\nYet another source of law is the Executive Order, where the president can decree that such and such will be the case (as long as it has something to do with what the executive branch does). These are somewhat limited in scope, but every president seems to like to test what that limit is. Governors get to do it too!\n\nAnd lastly, courts have an indirect power to make law, by ruling on how an existing law is to be interpreted (as well as ruling that a law or part of a law is unconstitutional).",

The Connecticut law in question, as quoted in the Griswold v. Connecticut opinion, stated: \"Any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception shall be fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned.\" This law applied to all individuals, not just unmarried people (eliminating option A), and focused on use rather than manufacture or sale (eliminating option B).

You do not need to wear a suit but you should not wear singlets, thongs, untidy, revealing or ripped clothing. \u200b\u200b\n\n[What to do, say and wear in court](https://www.lawaccess.nsw.gov.au/Pages/representing/getting_ready_for_court/lawassist_what_to_do_say_and_wear_in_court.aspx)\n\nFailure to adhere to the dress code is unlikely to be, of itself, [contempt of court](https://www.judcom.nsw.gov.au/publications/benchbks/local/contempt_in_the_face_of_the_court.html). Depending on the circumstances and the temperament of the presiding officer, it might be ignored or the person might be ordered to leave the court, possibly with an order to return suitably dressed. Failure to follow an order of the court *is* contempt. So, for example, if a person called for jury service was inappropriately dressed, the judge might order them to attend the next day correctly attired: if they didn\u2019t, then they might hold them in contempt for failing to follow the order, not for being inappropriately dressed.",

While inappropriate dress alone is unlikely to result in contempt of court, failing to follow a direct order from a judge can be considered contempt. In this scenario, the juror was specifically ordered to return in appropriate attire and failed to do so, which constitutes disobeying a court order. \n\nOption A is incorrect because simply dismissing the juror without consequences would not address the disregard for the court's authority. \n\nOption B is incorrect because inappropriate dress by itself is not typically grounds for contempt, according to the provided information. \n\nOption D is incorrect because the juror has already received a warning in the form of the judge's order and has chosen to disregard it, making a second warning unlikely."

You did not accept it, so the withdrawal is legal.\n\n> Can they hire someone who is not qualified ...\n\nThat depends on the particular law that mandates the qualification.\n\nAs a general principle, anyone is allowed to work at anything unless there is a law that says \u201cyou cant do job X unless you have qualification/licence/accreditation/whatever Y.\u201d\n\nSo you need to actually read that law. Some allow a grace period for a person to do X while they get Y and some are outright prohibitions. And there are some things that people *think* require a specific qualification because everybody has one but there is actually no legal requirement.\n\nFor example, I\u2019m a qualified arbitrator, adjudicator and mediator. I need the qualification to work as the first one in [australia](/questions/tagged/australia \"show questions tagged 'australia'\") and I it to work as the second in [queensland](/questions/tagged/queensland \"show questions tagged 'queensland'\") but not [new\\-south\\-wales](/questions/tagged/new-south-wales \"show questions tagged 'new-south-wales'\") but I don\u2019t need it anywhere to work as the last one \\- most mediators have qualifications but they are not legally required. I am not a qualified lawyer because I don\u2019t need to be to work as any of the above and, indeed, merely being a lawyer does not allow you to work as an arbitrator.\n\n> \u2026 and rescind my offer of employment?\n\nThe eligibility of the person they chose to hire has no bearing on their decision not to hire you.\n\nIf they have hired an unqualified person then that is for the relevant regulator to deal with and has nothing to do with you.\n\n> Are they not obligated to hire the most qualified applicant?\n\n**No they are not**.\n\nEmployers have the discretion to choose the applicant they consider the \u201cbest\u201d. And they can assess how your better qualifications weigh up against someone else\u2019s past history with the organisation.\n\nProvided they do not consider things that they are not permitted to consider under discrimination law and that the process is not corrupt, they can weight the various factors how they wish.\n\nHowever, if an employer has stated that they will weight various applications is a specific way, then they have to do that.",

After interviewing candidates, the principal called Alice at 6 PM to offer her the position. Alice said she wanted to speak with HR about the salary in the morning. That evening, the school board met and an internal candidate, Bob, who is not certified as a school counselor, expressed interest in the position.

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) The school district acted illegally by rescinding the job offer to Alice after she had verbally accepted it.\nB) The school district is legally obligated to hire Alice as she is the most qualified candidate for the position.\nC) The school district cannot hire Bob if he lacks the required certification, regardless of their decision about Alice.\nD) The school district can legally rescind the offer to Alice and consider hiring Bob, assuming no discrimination occurred in the process.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. The school district can legally rescind the offer to Alice because she had not yet accepted it. An offer can be withdrawn before it is accepted. Additionally, employers are not legally obligated to hire the most qualified candidate. They have discretion in choosing the \"best\" candidate based on various factors, including past history with the organization, as long as they don't violate discrimination laws. The eligibility of Bob for the position is a separate issue from the decision not to hire Alice. If Bob lacks required certifications, that would be a matter for the relevant regulatory body to address, but it doesn't affect the legality of rescinding Alice's offer. The key points are that the offer was not yet accepted, and employers have broad discretion in hiring decisions as long as they don't discriminate illegally."
