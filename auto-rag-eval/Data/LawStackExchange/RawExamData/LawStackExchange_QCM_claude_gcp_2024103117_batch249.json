This is true even if you file a lawsuit (I myself am a pro se litigant with cases currently pending review in the SCOTUS). And the attorney definitely knows the concept of *pro se litigant*. He is just trying to either intimidate you, or to lure you into wasting your money with some crooked member of his \"profession\" till you get frustrated/penniless and desist.\n\nIn your next email (remember that everything with those people should be in writing), you could remind the attorney that his tactics of evasion will tend to hurt his client's credibility if the matter is tried by a jury.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: According to the answer, what is the most effective way for the individual to compel the opposing lawyer to respond, given that the individual has chosen not to hire their own lawyer?\n\nA) Contact the bar association to report the lawyer's unethical behavior\nB) Continue calling and emailing the opposing lawyer until they respond\nC) File a lawsuit, which may prompt responsive pleadings from the opposing lawyer\nD) Hire a lawyer as requested by the opposing attorney\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The answer states that \"the closest option to 'compelling' the attorney to respond --perhaps with vexatious responsive pleadings-- is by filing a lawsuit.\" This is presented as the most effective way to force a response from the opposing lawyer. \n\nOption A is incorrect because the answer indicates that while the lawyer's behavior is unethical, there is \"basically nothing you can do at this point\" regarding reporting it to the bar association.\n\nOption B is not suggested in the answer and is unlikely to be effective if the lawyer has already been ignoring calls and emails.\n\nOption D goes against the individual's stated preference not to hire a lawyer and the answer supports their right to proceed without one, stating \"You are right in that you are not required to retain a lawyer.\"\n\nThe correct answer, C, aligns with the advice given in the answer and is presented as the most effective way to compel a response from the opposing lawyer."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46447/is-there-any-law-that-requires-private-companies-to-divulge-the-information-they", "docs_id": 46447, "title": "Is there any law that requires private companies to divulge the information they know/posses about you when formally requested?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: In the U.S., Is there any Federal or State law that compels private entities to hand over the information they have about the requester?

This serves as a negative obligation similar to Section 504's non-discrimination clause. Additionally, Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides a legal basis for positive action, allowing the Council to take \"appropriate action\" to combat discrimination, which can include introducing legislation. This combination of prohibiting discrimination and enabling positive action is the closest equivalent to Section 504 in the EU context.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the ADA is a U.S. law, not an EU regulation.

While some areas may be more open to the public (like libraries or certain outdoor spaces), this doesn't apply to all university spaces.

As far as I know, it is a requirement in every state that you declare that state your primary residence in order to receive a driver's license. As a practical matter, this makes it more difficult to register to vote in more than one place, and makes it easier to determine the best place to call you for jury duty, among other things. As part of that declaration, the state issuing the license is requiring that you surrender your other license because it prevents you from trying to use it to defraud the other state by claiming you are still a resident there. As was pointed out in comments, the states don't necessarily communicate to each other that a license was surrendered, but in order to get another copy you would have to certify that you are primarily a resident of the other state again, which would be perjury.\n\nThis doesn't really have to do with the Full Faith and Credit clause, since the states aren't refusing to accept the records of the other state. To the contrary, the few times I've changed my license I can use my old state's license to prove my ability to drive \\- the new state puts their faith in my proper testing by the old state, rather than forcing me to retake a test (in fairness, they also accept out of country licenses of their own volition, having to redo tests for everyone moving to the state would be a huge drain on resources for little gain). For what it's worth, while it seems like states usually ask that drivers change to the state's license within x days of moving to the state, I've never actually seen a penalty attached to failure to do that, and for the purpose of certifying your ability to drive valid out\\-of\\-state licenses are always accepted, even if there were a penalty for failing to change them after you move to the state.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best explains why New Hampshire's law requiring drivers to surrender out-of-state licenses before obtaining a New Hampshire license does not violate the Full Faith and Credit clause of the US Constitution?\n\nA) The law is designed to prevent fraud by ensuring a person cannot claim primary residency in multiple states simultaneously.\n\nB) New Hampshire refuses to recognize the validity of other states' driver's licenses.\n\nC) The law is intended to force new residents to retake driving tests in New Hampshire.\n\nD) The Full Faith and Credit clause does not apply to driver's licenses.\n\nCorrect Answer: A\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is A. The law's primary purpose is to enforce the requirement that a person can only claim primary residency in one state at a time. This helps prevent fraud, such as registering to vote in multiple states. It's not about questioning the validity of other states' licenses (B is incorrect), as New Hampshire actually accepts these licenses as proof of driving ability. The law doesn't require retaking driving tests (C is incorrect), as the state puts faith in the testing done by other states. Finally, while the Full Faith and Credit clause does apply to driver's licenses in some contexts, this particular law doesn't violate it because it's not about recognizing the validity of other states' records (D is incorrect).

So I setup booby\\-traps that are designed to either:\n\nA. Destroy any evidence I think they might look for, or, more extremely,\n\nB. Destroy the property *and anyone on it* in the event that it is raided.\n\nWe know from [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/3392/10) and [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/968/10) that I owe trespassers some duty of care. Being an (otherwise) law\\-abiding citizen, I post explicit warnings within the perimeter of my property, which I have secured against trespass by anybody but a very determined attacker. I.e., the only way the police could see the warnings is if they have entered for a raid, at which point the warnings state, \"If you go any further into this property you will trigger devices that will destroy the property and kill all persons therein.\"\n\nSure enough, the police get a no\\-knock search warrant, breach the outer perimeter, and stop at the warnings. At this point can I be compelled by a court to grant safe access for law enforcement to carry out the search warrant?\n\nAnd if, despite the clear warning, the police decide to press on with their search and an officer is injured or killed, can I be held criminally or civilly liable for that casualty?\n\n---\n\nNotes \\& clarifications from comments:\n\n* I'm revealing my *mens rea* in this question, but objectively I have merely secured the property and warned determined trespassers. The police can lawfully search, but do I have a *duty to make my premises safe to search*? Am I *ex ante* liable for their injuries, given the suitable warning? Or can they say, \"If you don't make it safe to search, you're liable for our injuries?\" At which point haven't they compelled me to incriminate myself, meaning that I can disarm the traps but all the premises' contents are then \"poisoned\" evidence?\n* Practically speaking it's not hard to rig thermite to destroy evidence without endangering anyone not in close proximity. But then, destruction of evidence is a crime, *and* I'd rather not destroy my valuable stash of whatever. Or, again, maybe I don't have anything to hide but on principle I *really* don't want police in my house. So part of the motivation here is to determine: can one construct a scenario that would flat\\-out deter the search?\n* One analogy that might illuminate this is to consider a hazmat factory: It is secured, it has warnings, and if police barge in and start tossing things without adequate protection they could be injured or killed. So in real life \u2013 even just approaching suspected meth labs \u2013 the police bring in hazmat specialists. They don't say, \"Please render your lab safe for us to search,\" and I don't *think* they say, \"We got hurt raiding your lab, so that's on you.\" In this hypothetical there is no specialist they can call because the exact threat is unknown, and designed to be unknowable in advance. In fact, *I could just be bluffing and not have any boobytraps*.\n* Another reference point that occurs to me: when police are confronted with non\\-trivial explosive devices, whenever possible it seems they prefer to just clear a safety perimeter and destroy the device than to try to approach and disarm it.\n* One last point of reference I came across: There is one such example in existence in the U.S.: [Fugitive John Joe Gray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Joe_Gray) has kept police from entering his property to arrest him for 16 years, simply because no sheriff has considered it worth the risk.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First off, you cannot booby trap your property, period. It is both illegal and tortious. But, as you noted, there are already questions/answers that deal with this issue.\n\nSure enough, if the police get a no\\-knock search warrant, that in and of itself is the Court order allowing entry by any means necessary. When the officers, there by right of law, breach the outer perimeter and stop at the warnings, **they will not be seeking any *other* court orders** to have you *allow* them \"safe entry\". Their warrant gives them all the right they need, as probable cause of crime and violent intent or intent to destroy evidence was already presented to a judge. If, in real life, you actually put up signage or state explicitly that they're being forewarned that you intend to harm, trap, maim, or otherwise make it unsafe to enter; or that doing so will result in an attempt to destroy evidence, that is something they have already assumed (hence the seeking and granting of the no\\-knock vs. a regular search warrant). However, the signs in and of themselves are not protected speech, but rather overt threats, and that would put you in a very precarious position indeed. \n\nIf the police get a \"no knock\" warrant (the most invasive, difficult to get warrants, whereby there is a grave risk of destruction of evidence or injury to persons), the police will ensure they have safe passage \u2013 they've come prepared for dangerous entry long before your signs, but once they see them, you could rest assured they will take them as they are intended: as a ***direct threat to their safety***, and they will deploy a SWAT or other heavily armed entry team (who is usually there anyway for these dangerous entries). You could expect things like smoke/out canister and teargas, flash bangs, and heavily armed and well armored officers attempting to force you from your dwelling. Presumably, if you need to disarm traps to escape the situation, they can enter. Assuming you're home when they invade with chemical weapons, whether you come out or not, they will force you to disarm whatever booby trapping you may have in place that may destroy evidence, likely walking you in as their human shield in the event you're lying about any dangerous ones. That is probably your best case scenario. They may just decide to throw you through the perimeter once they get their hands on you, just to see what happens!\n\nIf you don't exit and are home or if you are lucky enough to be out, the bomb squad, ATF, and SWAT will converge on your property in less than typical means. Because from your warning they can assume some incendiary or explosive device exists, bringing it into the jurisdiction of other agencies. If they cannot disarm the trap, they would send a robot in first to set it off, or cut through your roof, or knock down a wall \u2013 whatever it takes to get in without using a typical means of ingress/egress, so as not to chance your trap. Regardless, you can rest assured that they will get in, and you will pay for the trap you set for law enforcement. Further, to whatever charges you'd have been faced with from evidence flowing from the original warrant will now be added additional charges like attempted murder of a peace officer; if you have any roommates or known associates: conspiracy to do those things; attempted destruction of evidence, criminal interference with a police investigation ... all at a minimum. If anyone is *actually* harmed, your signage offers you no shield from criminal or tort liability, and you will be lucky to live through the experience once they get their hands on you. Police tend to not like being the targets of intentional maiming, dismemberment or death. \n\nYou have to understand that, according to this hypothetical, you are intentionally trying to harm law enforcement, or destroy evidence of your dangerous criminal activity. These are not invaders, or intruders according to the law; they are the people whose job it is to enforce the laws, collect the evidence (if you weren't getting arrested pursuant to the fruits of the warrant, you certainly would be at that point). The signs themselves would make excellent exhibits in the coming case of *State v. you*.\n\nBTW: The only reason they have left John Joe Gray alone is that he knows the Henderson County Sheriff Ronny Brownlow, who has been told that the ATF, FBI, and State SWAT, would all be happy to enter and get or kill Mr. Gray if need be. Since the Sheriff never filed any federal charges, and has determined that he doesn't want to breach (and it's in his jurisdiction to determine this), the Sheriff, aware that Gray's entire family is holed up in the \"compound\", decided it's not worth going in.

But if the contract simply says that you will get the job done and will \"make yourself available\" for some of those hours, then it's not obviously fraud.

US companies could self\\-certify under the Privacy Shield mechanism, and were then covered by an adequacy decision. However, this mechanism was deemed invalid in the Schrems II ruling.

This leads to the following situation:\n\n* Following the Schrems II ruling and subsequent guidance by regulators (e.g. [EDPB Recommendations 01/2020](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/public-consultations-art-704/2020/recommendations-012020-measures-supplement-transfer_en)), personal data cannot be transferred into the US unless substantial additional safeguards are implemented, such as only transferring the data in pseudonymized or end\\-to\\-end\\-encrypted form. SCCs alone are not sufficient.\n* In practice, nearly everyone in the industry is following the legal fiction that updated SCC terms are sufficient to authorize the international transfers.

I'm wondering about things like, could clearly harmless behavior (say, lifting a pack of gum with your left hand on a Tuesday) be criminalized without the law being unconstitutional, or how much discretion does the legislature have to determine whether it wants to consider behavior harmful.\n\nAs an example, in German law the Grundgesetz starts with an enumeration of fundamental rights that get divided into liberty rights and equality rights by legal theorists depending on what the individual right protects. [Art. 2 GG](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0026) acts as a generic right to liberty in case any of the specific liberty rights (such as freedom of [assembly](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0054), of the [press](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0037), of [religion](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_gg/englisch_gg.html#p0033)) don't cover something. A law criminalizing wearing blue lipstick for example would be a clear violation of Art. 2 GG, so the legislature is limited in that sense.\n\n**Question:** What constitutional limits exist for US lawmakers to criminalize behavior?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are a number of specific limitation on what can be made criminal in US law, derived from constitutional protection.\n\nSpecific Rights\n---------------\n\nExpressions of free speech, for example, cannot be made criminal, although there can be laws which regulate or impact speech to a degree. Similarly, the establishment clause of the First Amendment prohibits a law requiring people to attend a particular church, and he free Exercise clause prohibits any criminal penalties for any religious practice or lack of practice.\n\nMost of the other provisions of the Bill of right would impose similar limitations. The legislature cannot criminalize what people have a constitutional right to do.\n\nThre are also specific limitations not in the bill of rights, such as the prohibition of *Ex Post Facto* laws, the right to trial by jury, and the constitutional limitation of Treason laws.\n\n### Rational Basis\n\nBeyond that the Due Process clause of the 5th and the parallel clause of the 14th impose limits on criminal law generally. Criminal laws must have (at least) a *rational basis*. The legislature cannot just prohibit picking up papers because they felt like it, they must have articulated a problem and a plausible reason why a given law would address it. If they don't the law may be overturned as unconstitutional.\n\nIf a law is challenged as being unconstitutional, it will currently either be subject to rational basis analysis, or to one of the stricter levels. However a law which cannot pass rational basis analysis will not survive intermediate scrutiny or strict scrutiny either. Laws which appear to invade one of the enumerated rights, or a right that the Court has deemed \"fundamental\" are normally tested under either strict or intermediate scrutiny.\n\nAccording to the the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_basis_review):\n\n> Courts applying rational basis review seek to determine whether a law is \"rationally related\" to a \"legitimate\" government interest, whether real or hypothetical. The higher levels of scrutiny are intermediate scrutiny and strict scrutiny.\n\n...\n\n> laws implicating unenumerated rights that the Supreme Court has not recognized as fundamental receive rational basis review.\n\n...\n\n> In modern constitutional law, the rational basis test is applied to constitutional challenges of both federal law and state law (via the Fourteenth Amendment). This test also applies to both legislative and executive action whether those actions be of a substantive or procedural nature.\n> \n> \n> The rational basis test prohibits the government from imposing restrictions on liberty that are irrational or arbitrary, or drawing distinctions between persons in a manner that serves no constitutionally legitimate end.\n\n...\n\n> A court applying rational basis review will virtually always uphold a challenged law unless every conceivable justification for it is a grossly illogical *non sequitur*.\n\n(See Killian, Johnny H., George A. Costello, \\& Kenneth R. Thomas, co\\-eds., *The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation: Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002*, by Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress (Senate Document No. 108\\-17, 108th Congress, 2d Session) and specifically *Romer v. Evans*, 517 U.S. 620 (1996\\) at 635\\)\n\nRational Basis analysis became accepted after the demise of \"[substantive Due Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantive_due_process)\", mostly in a civil, rather than criminal context. A version of it was suggested in [*Lochner v. New York* 198 U.S. 45 (1905\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lochner_v._New_York), in the dissent by Justice Holmes. It was adopted as governing in \\[\\*Nebbia v. New York \\*\n\nIn *United States Department of Agriculture v. Moreno* 413 U.S. 528 (1973\\) The Court overturned, on a rational basis scrutiny, a law excluding households consisting of unrelated people from the Federal Food Stamp program, writing:\n\n> \\[A] bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.\n\nSpecific cases\n* In *Eisenstadt v. Baird* 405 U.S. 438 (1972\\) a law that criminalized the distribution of contraceptives to unmarried persons was overturned on a rational basis review. Similar cases are now generally treated with intermediate scrutiny.\n* In *James v. Strange* 407 U.S. 128 (1972\\). a Kansas law reclaiming payments for public defenders was overturens on rational basis review as \u201can impermissible burden on the right to counsel established in *Gideon v. Wainwright*.\"\n* In *Bowers v. Hardwick* 478 U.S. 186 (1986\\), rational basis analysis was employed to sustain a statute criminalizing homosexual activity. However, this was later overturned..\n\n### Vagueness\n\nAlso under Due Process, vague laws are prohibited. If a reasonable person cannot tell from the law what is or is not illegal, the law can be overturned for vagueness.\n\n### Procedural protections\n\nThen there are procedural limits, also largely derived from the Due Process clause(s). A law cannot automatically convict people without a genuine hearing, in which a person can present a defense to an independent, impartial judge or jury.

The claim is that the defendant states violated the Electors Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Due Process Clause. Texas claims that there is an injury in fact, citing various SCOTUS rulings e.g. [Wesberry v.

See the brief p. 65 ff. The court does not require that there be exact precedential analogs (otherwise, Roe v.

Feelings and opinions are strong on both sides. Many consider it an open\\-and\\-shut case (some celebrities even state that he should be convicted without a trial), yet on deeper examination it's not all that easy for the prosecution. It's the prosecution which has to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and several of the defense's arguments (for example, Floyd repeatedly saying he can't breathe even while he was still in the car) might become a tough nut to crack. This means the trial can still have surprises, and strong emotions could be stirred up in certain groups if the results fall far from their expectations. For example, many people strongly believe that if Chauvin is found not guilty, or if his sentence is not harsh enough, then significant riots will ensue.\n\nI presented the above example as a context to my question: by deciding on a verdict, a jury should concentrate on what really happened, and not on what feelings they think might be evoked by the public upon hearing their decision. Yet jurors are all human, and might consciously or unconsciously still take such things into account. Consider the hypothetical case the jury thinks that guilt cannot be proven beyond reasonable doubt, but they declare guilty anyway, for fearing a potential riot. They might rationalize that by sentencing a person they believe to be innocent, they save potentially hundreds or thousands from grievous harm.\n\nHow is such a dilemma handled by the courts?\n\nPlease note that this question is not about your opinion about what the verdict should be in the mentioned example. It's about the possibility when the judge or jury sincerely believe a defendant to be innocent but declare guilty (or sincerely believe a defendant to be guilty but declare innocent) solely because they personally believe that the correct verdict would lead to a violent riot where many innocents could die. Are such possibilities handled in any way, are there countermeasures against it, is there precedent for a case which was later overturned due to allegations of the verdict having been made for the above mentioned reasons?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The title question is overly\\-ambitious: it is not guaranteed, and nobody thinks that it is. The law does what is practical to achieve the desired result. Actual failure one way or the other is mostly irrelevant until a clear pattern to the failure is found, then there might be a legal resolution, but it might also require a political resolution.\n\nOne consideration is whether it is possible for a defendant to receive a fair trial in a certain jurisdiction. Generally, you are tried in the jurisdiction where the offense occurred, sometimes (rarely) the venue can be changed to a more neutral location. This consideration is significant in high\\-profile cases. For example, the trials of Lee Boyd Malvo and John Allen Muhammad took place relatively far away from the scene of the crime. The trial judge must weigh the arguments for an inconvenient trial location, and in this trial the judge refused a [petition for a change of venue](https://mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/High-Profile-Cases/27-CR-20-12646/MotionforChange08282020.pdf). The judge stated that \"As far as change of venue, I do not think that that would give the defendant any kind of a fair trial beyond what we are doing here today. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any place in the state of Minnesota that has not been subjected to extreme amounts of publicity on this case\"\n\nA second layer of protection is that prospective jurors may be excused. If a juror declares in advance (during voir dire or elsewhere) that the defendant is guilty, they will be excused for cause. The defense (or prosecution) also has some number of [peremptory challenges](https://casetext.com/rule/minnesota-court-rules/minnesota-rules-of-criminal-procedure/rule-26-trial/rule-2602-jury-selection) \u2013 in this case, the defense has 5 and the prosecution has 3\\. In this category, a seated juror can be excused for cause (this happened), when a juror admits that some news e.g. about the city's settlement had prejudiced the juror. Also related to juror selection is that juror must swear to follow the law in reaching a decision.\n\nThe third layer of protection is limiting testimony, for instance if the prosecution were to ask a witness something like \"Won't there be major riots if Chauvin isn't convicted?\", the defense would presumably object and prevent such testimony from getting uttered in the first place, or getting officially stricken if it somehow gets out.\n\nThe fourth layer of protection is that jurors are meticulously instructed as to the logic of decision\\-making. If you can find a copy, there are [here](https://mn.gov/law-library/how-do-i-find/jury-instructions.jsp) (MN does not make the instructions freely publicly available). [Here](https://www.courts.ca.gov/partners/documents/calcrim-2021.pdf) are the California instructions.\n\nAdditionally, a judge might attempt to limit what can be said by the media, or might sequester the jury so that they cannot hear any such publicity during the trial (but that's impossible for pre\\-trial publicity).\n\nAnother layer is that a mistrial can be declared. However, what goes on in the jury room is in a black box that the legal system cannot generally touch. If a juror was paid off, that could be touched by the legal system, but there is nothing that can be done if it turns out that a juror has a bias in favor of the prosecution, despite the premise of neutrality.\n\nFinally, if the facts are so clear, a judge might overturn a conviction on the grounds that a reasonable jury could not reach that conclusion, based on the facts and the law.\n\nBy \"final\" I ignore the possibility of an appeal.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following is NOT a protective measure typically used in high-profile court cases to ensure a fair trial and prevent external influences on the jury's decision?\n\nA) Changing the venue of the trial to a different jurisdiction\nB) Allowing jurors to consult with legal experts during deliberations\nC) Excusing prospective jurors who show bias during voir dire\nD) Instructing the jury on proper decision-making logic and procedures\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nA) Changing the venue is a valid protective measure used in high-profile cases to ensure a fair trial, especially when local publicity might prejudice potential jurors.\n\nB) This is not a protective measure used in trials.

For example, could the information be used in a suit against the USA or will the presiding judge throw out evidence obtained through the violation of executive privilege?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: A privilege is a right to prevent evidence from being used in a proceeding (even if it has been disclosed publicly by someone who does not \"own\" the privilege, e.g. the President in whose administration the communication that is privileged occurred, in the case of \"Executive Privilege\"), even when it is subpoenaed. It is enforced by a motion or request in a proceeding to prevent the evidence from being considered.\n\nSo, if information protected by Executive Privilege is leaked without the permission of the President, it still can't be used in court against the United States or the President.\n\nVoluntary disclosure by someone who \"owns\" the privilege (e.g. in a tweet or public speech or legal document filed with a court or Congress) waives a privilege, as does voluntarily placing a privileged matter at issue on the part of the person owning the privilege. For example, if you assert a defense of reliance on the advice of counsel, you voluntarily waive the right to assert attorney\\-client privilege with regard to what you were told by your attorney.\n\nThe existence and scope of a privilege is normally determined by the tribunal before which the proceeding is taking place, subject to any appeals available from the tribunal (if any).\n\nThere is no law criminalizing the disclosure of privileged information (including information subject to the common law executive privilege) *per se*.\n\nA privilege is separate and distinct from a duty to refrain from disclosing information, although the two often overlap.\n\nFor example, there is both (1\\) an attorney\\-client privilege that prevents confidential communications between an attorney and client about legal matters from being disclosed in a proceeding without the client's permission (in federal court this arises via court rule, in Colorado where I mostly practice, it is a matter of statute), and (2\\) a duty of an attorney to keep client information confidential except in special circumstances that arises from Rule of Professional Conduct 1\\.6\\.\n\nThere are matters that a lawyer has a duty to keep confidential in the absence of a valid subpoena, even if the information is not protected by the attorney\\-client privilege and/or has been publicly disclosed by someone other than the client. A lawyer could lose his license for violating Rule of Professional Conduct 1\\.6 (every state uses the same numbering system for such violations), and could be sued for violating the privacy rights of a client in a way that causes harm to the client, but it is not usually a crime to disclose such information (unless it is a trade secret or a national security secret).\n\nThe law governing what punishments an individual faces for disclosing information revealed in secret by the President to an individual is separate and distinct from the scope of the Executive Privilege and is governed by different laws. Often it is governed by case by case non\\-disclosure agreements entered into contractually by the person who is privy to the secrets (which usually have non\\-criminal remedies like lawsuits for money damages and injunctive relief). The consequences also depend on the nature of the material disclosed (national security matters and trade secrets are governed by different laws than other secrets) and the person to whom it is disclosed (a disclosure to a Taliban leader with whom the U.S. has an authorization for use of military force against is espionage, which is different than a disclosure to a member of Congress which is merely a \"leak\").\n\nTypically, punishments for violating a duty of confidentiality are imposed in a collateral case to one in which someone proposed to use information protected by a privilege.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A former White House staffer leaks confidential information about internal executive branch discussions to a journalist, who then publishes it.

Consider what the product of someone else's transcription would look like: would it be possible to distinguish it from yours?\n\nI don't know whether such a test would actually be useful in court, however; it's more of a thought experiment. In fact, I should note that I do not have any specific knowledge of Canadian copyright law, and in particular I am unfamiliar with how Canada treats copyright protection in new works derived from public domain materials.\n\nBased on a fairly cursory reading of [Authorship and ownership in copyright law in Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorship_and_ownership_in_copyright_law_in_Canada) on Wikipedia, and assuming that you were not working as an employee, you own any copyright in the work you produced. This would certainly be true of the other items you gave to the manuscript owner: \"the result of the historical research, copy of a public lecture based on the ms., and breakdown of the content.\" As noted above, the extent to which it is true of the transcription itself is not clear, but it is probably a small extent.\n\nIf you did the work as an employee, then the copyright in the work is owned by your employer, unless there is an agreement to the contrary. However, \"employee\" does not include freelancers, so the owner of the manuscript does not own the copyright in your work simply because he or she paid you.\n\nI would also note that I don't see any way for the manuscript owner to prevent you from \"publish\\[ing] the text of the transcription with an introduction, explanatory notes, etc.\" \n\nI hope someone who is more familiar with Canadian copyright law will answer, but to get a reliable answer you should ask a lawyer with a practice in Canadian intellectual property law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A researcher transcribes a 250-year-old anonymous Italian manuscript and provides historical research, a public lecture, and content breakdown to the manuscript's owner.

However, the transcription itself presents a more complex case. As it's a copy of a public domain work, only elements arising from the researcher's creative activity might be protected. The transcription may have limited copyright protection, if any.

For instance, roles classified as \"ministry\", such as a priest, will be given more leeway than a more secular role such as a construction worker who happens to be building a church.

So according to papers, Arnie sold some metal to Bob, but in reality, Arnie just gave the money back to Bob, in cash after taking a \"tip\". This makes a backdoor for manipulations like this one.\n\nSo it seems to me that Arnie basically launders stolen money. Is this true?\n\nAnd if it is, what would be the legal consequences of someone unconnected to the transaction who knows about it reporting or not reporting it? For example, does not reporting it give rise to a risk of civil or criminal liability?\n\nETA: the country is Ukraine.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: [united\\-states](/questions/tagged/united-states \"show questions tagged 'united-states'\")\n\nUnder U.S. law in almost every U.S. jurisdiction this would be illegal conduct. Arnie would be a co\\-conspirator with Bob in money laundering and in embezzlement of government funds. These would usually be criminal felonies.\n\nThe government (or a private whistleblower called a \"relator\" in what is called a \"[qui tam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam)\" action, conducted in a procedurally proper way which afford the government an opportunity to sue itself before bringing the private qui tam action) could also sue Arnie and Bob and hold them liable, jointly and severally, for the funds diverted to Arnie and Bob in this scheme, and probably for punitive damages and/or civil penalties as well.\n\nIf the role played by Arnie was instead played by a U.S. publicly traded multinational company doing business in another country (or by an official of such a company who has knowledge of or is involved in the transaction with Bob), and it was also illegal to do this in that country (whether or not that law was enforced in that country), then the U.S. multinational company involved would also have violated the [U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act) (FCPA). As noted at the link:\n\n> The FCPA is jointly enforced by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and\n> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which apply criminal and\n> civil penalties respectively.\n\nSo, in that case, it would be a violation of both U.S. and the other country's laws, in all likelihood giving rise to liability to both criminal and civil consequences in both countries.\n\nIt isn't patently obvious that this conduct would be illegal under the law of every country, although it seems likely.\n\nFor example, a sheriff operating a prison in Alabama can do something very similar (skim money off prison operation funds by obtaining low bids for prison service contracts) legally.\n\nSimilarly, if Arnie had actually gone out and purchased metal parts from a third party at Bob's direction and then delivered those metal parts to Bob's government employer, that would be entirely legal almost everywhere (although any kickback to Bob, if that was what was really happening would still probably be some form of embezzlement in which Arnie might be conspiring).\n\nAlso, while this is considered corrupt in most of the developed world, in many developing and undeveloped countries, civil servants are paid almost nothing and kick backs for supervising government contracts are tolerated at a minimum as a matter of unstated official policy by senior managers of the government entities that unofficially sanction or encourage this conduct by their subordinates. This reality is one of the main reasons that the U.S. FCPA is heavily criticized politically and in academic commentary.\n\n> what would be the legal consequences of someone\n> unconnected to the transaction who knows about it reporting or not\n> reporting it? For example, does not reporting it give rise to a risk\n> of civil or criminal liability?\n\nNormally, someone not involved in Arnie's company, like a family member of Arnie, would have no legal duty to report this conduct upon learning of it, and would face no legal consequences for failing to report it, if the person not reporting it wasn't actually involved in the scheme.\n\nSomeone who cared about Arnie might want to counsel him that he is engaged in very risky conduct that could have catastrophic consequences if discovered and prosecuted. They might advise him that while this scheme does generate funds for Arnie that might not be worth the risk. Ultimately, as a practical matter, if that person didn't want to harm Arnie, however, that person would have to let Arnie decide for himself what to do.\n\nIf subpoenaed to serve as a witness, someone who knew about Arnie and Bob's conduct (other possibly than Arnie's spouse and his lawyer if his lawyer learned about the conduct only after the fact), could be compelled to testify in a court of law against Arnie about what the person who knew about this scheme knew, possibly contributing to Arnie going to prison and facing monetary penalties.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the scenario described, where Arnie assists Bob in diverting government funds, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal implications in the United States?\n\nA) Arnie would only be liable for civil penalties, as he didn't directly steal from the government.\n\nB) Bob would be the sole party held responsible, as Arnie was merely following instructions.\n\nC) Arnie and Bob could both face criminal charges for money laundering and embezzlement, as well as potential civil liabilities.\n\nD) The transaction would be considered legal if Arnie actually sold any product to Bob, regardless of whether it matched the official documentation.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: Option C is correct because, under U.S. law, both Arnie and Bob would likely be considered co-conspirators in a scheme involving money laundering and embezzlement of government funds.

Is there a standard part of an indenture or credit agreement where I can check this, or a convention if not?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: To start with, this is a highly technical issue upon which different jurisdictions may differ, and in which different rules may apply in different circumstances either by agreement or by statute. Also, similar situations are sometimes treated differently in this regard in bankruptcy and out of bankruptcy.\n\nThe majority rule is that the lender may choose which remedies \\- such as collateral and guarantee rights, to enforce, and the lender may choose in which order to enforce them.\n\nFor example, most jurisdictions allow a lender to collect from a guarantor even when collateral is available to the lender, in lieu of foreclosing on the collateral. \n\nSometimes, however, special rules apply.\n\nFor example, if the guarantor is a government agency (e.g. the Small Business Administration or the Veteran's Administration), often the lender is required to take all reasonable efforts to collect from the borrower and recover the amount owed from collateral, before the guarantee can be invoked.\n\nSimilarly, sometimes the law distinguishes between an accommodation party who receives no consideration in a transaction who signs as a direct debtor, and one who signs in a guarantor capacity. Those jurisdictions may require a good faith effort to collect from direct debtors (often including attempts to foreclose upon collateral) before attempting to collect from guarantors who sign as such.\n\nThere are also arrangements, such as credit default swaps or a situation when a consumer provides a credit card payment authorization which a creditor can use in the event of a default (or the large dollar amount equivalent of such an arrangement called a \"letter of credit\"), in which the line between what constitutes collateral and what constitutes a guarantee can be blurred.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: Company X takes out a loan from Bank Z.

According to the majority rule mentioned in the documentation, the lender (in this case, Bank Z) typically has the discretion to choose which remedies to enforce and in what order. This includes deciding whether to pursue the collateral (Company W's assets) or the guarantee (from Company Y) first, or in any combination they see fit. \n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while this might be true in some specific cases (like with government agency guarantors), it's not the general rule.\n\nAnswer B is also incorrect for the same reason as A - while this could be a specific arrangement, it's not the standard approach.\n\nAnswer D is incorrect because simultaneous and equal pursuit is not typically required or even practical in most cases.\n\nIt's important to note that while C is the most accurate answer based on the general rule, there can be exceptions based on specific agreements, statutory requirements, or special circumstances (such as bankruptcy proceedings or government guarantees)."}, "34": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29266/compensation-for-custody-awaiting-trial-resulting-in-acquittal", "docs_id": 29266, "title": "Compensation for custody awaiting trial resulting in acquittal?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I was accused of a crime and held in custody for 8 months then acquitted at court, I missed the first 8 months of my only child's life, and lost both my job and my partner. Could I be entitled to compensation? \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In all but a few U.S. states the answer is that you are not entitled to any compensation. This is grossly unfair, but is the dominant rule by far in most jurisdictions in the U.S.\n\nAs a matter of legal doctrine this is justified on the grounds that a criminal prosecution requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and many people who are actually guilty may be acquitted anyway because the standard of proof in a criminal case is so high. The classic example of that distinction is the [O.J. Simpson murder case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case), in which O.J. Simpson was acquitted of murdering his wife in a criminal prosecution, but was found liable for murdering her by the lower civil action preponderance of the evidence standard in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by her family.\n\n(In reality, most acquittals involve juries who think that the defendant was innocent, but that isn't reflected in the choice before them to convict or acquit a defendant.) \n\nThe only compensation to which you are entitled as a matter of law if you are acquitted of a crime, per the U.S. Supreme Court, is a refund of any fines or costs payable only upon conviction of a crime, which you paid or had taken from your assets, prior to your acquittal. *See [Nelson v. Colorado](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/581/15-1256/opinion3.html)*, 581 U.S. \\_\\_\\_ (2017\\).\n\nThere would an exception if you can show that a law enforcement officer intentionally brought charges without probable cause [in a civil lawsuit you bring against the law enforcement officer](http://www.virginialawreview.org/sites/virginialawreview.org/files/Kossis_Book.pdf), which is realistically impossible in almost all cases. ([Prosecutors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutorial_immunity) and [judges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_immunity) and jurors (see, e.g. [here](https://www.oregonlaws.org/ors/132.210))) have absolute immunity from liability for their official acts related to the court process.)\n\nThere are a few jurisdictions where you could bring a civil lawsuit for compensation based upon \"actual innocence\", rather than law enforcement misconduct. In those places, you could receive compensation if you could prove by a preponderance of the evidence (or with a prosecutor's affirmation) that you were actually factually innocent, so you could get some compensation even in the absence of an intentional violation of your civil rights. Texas is one state that has such a scheme, with important limitations, as explained in [this linked case](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2009/dec/15/ex-prisoners-acquitted-for-insufficient-evidence-may-not-sue-texas/).\n\nYou would probably have to hire a lawyer with your own funds to bring either kind of lawsuit, and realistically, you wouldn't have been incarcerated for eight months pending trial if you had enough money to do that, because you would have posted bond and been released pending trial.\n\nThere may be one or two states (I can't recall any from memory) where there might be a right to compensation merely because you are acquitted, but this would be an extreme outlier in terms of U.S. law.\n\nOutside the United States, outcomes could vary dramatically from one country to another.

This is separate from simply being acquitted due to lack of evidence (B), which typically does not entitle one to compensation in most U.S. states.

That is, they request the warrant from a judge/magistrate/court, that then decides whether to grant the warrant or not. It is clear that this system is intended to prevent arbitrary searches, as the judge might simply decline a warrant request if there is no reasonable justification behind it.\n\nHow often does this actually happen? I've never heard of a warrant request being declined by a judge, but surely there must be statistics about it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Disclaimer: there are whole sections of criminal law courses that deal with this issue and the various laws and precedents that have shaped american jurisprudence relating to right of privacy, expectation of privacy, and search and seizure. So, this is more of a primer than a comprehensive answer. \n\nThat being said, the Fourth Amendment, which protects the people from unreasonable search and seizure by the government, dictates that there must be probable cause for a search warrant to issue. However, in addition to the restrictions that are imposed by the Fourth Amendment, several states\u2019 constitutions, as well as a variety of state and federal statutes, rules of procedure, and law court rulings interpret these edicts further, limiting the process for obtaining a search warrant (a state can add additional safeguards, or impose more stringent requirements, but not less than the 4th amendment demands). On the federal level alone, the laws on search and seizure are also limited in scope by sections appearing in Title 18, Part II, Chapter 205 \u2013 Searches and Seizures. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101\\-18\\. Federal warrants are further governed by Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\nOnly Judges and magistrates may issue search warrants. To obtain a warrant, law enforcement officers must show that there is probable cause (i.e. grounds) that search is legally justified. Officers must support this showing with sworn statements (affidavits) under oath, and must describe in particularity the place they will search and the items they will seize. Judges must consider the totality of the circumstances when deciding whether or not to issue the warrant. When issuing a search warrant, the judge may restrict how and when the police conduct the search.\n\nPolice officers (a broad term I'm using for ease of discussion to include all manner of state and federal investigators operating under color of law) seeking a warrant do not need to show that the people being searched (or those whose property is being searched) actually, or even probably, committed the crime(s) in question. Rather, officers merely need to show probable cause exists to show that the evidence sought\\-after is likely there and upon discovery may implicate some person or persons in criminal activity (that has been committed).\n\nA landmark case that resulted in some reforms is *Zurcher v. Stanford Daily*, 436 U.S. 547 (1978\\), in which the Supreme Court opined that a search conducted by the police at a student newspaper, where the newspaper was not implicated or connected to any criminal activity, was a legal search under the Fourth Amendment, because the police *suspected* it had photographic evidence of the identities of demonstrators who assaulted police officers. Afterward, however, some jurisdictions responded by passing laws restricting or forbidding these kinds of searches \\- so again, what stands as acceptable procedure is not static.\n\nWhile you may not often hear of requests for warrants being denied, it does happen if there is insufficient PC pled in the affidavit; General unawareness is not surprising as it is not something often made public, although there are instances. Most officers know when they have enough for a warrant and know how to adequately swear out an affidavit so that PC is present enough for the judge to sign the warrant in good faith.

Stanford Daily (1978) established that police can conduct a search of a third party not suspected of any crime if they have a valid warrant based on probable cause that evidence of a crime may be found there. In this scenario, even though the newspaper is not suspected of wrongdoing, a search could be legal if the police obtain a warrant showing probable cause that evidence (photographs) of criminal activity might be found there. However, it's important to note that following this case, some jurisdictions passed laws to restrict such searches, so the legality might vary depending on local regulations.

For instance, perhaps a 45% height wall is not considered a wall at all, and so if I have a 90% height wall, and two 49% height walls, in addition to the wall that contains the entrance, smoking can be permitted, even though there are walls on three sides and more than 50% of the total area is covered.

At the federal level, [chapter 119 of Title 18](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/part-I/chapter-119) is relevant. [Section 2511](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2511) generally prohibits \"wiretapping\", via the concept of \"intercepting\", so whether there is a physical wire for transmitting the signal or the the message wafts across the air, it's the same. Subsection 2 lists a vast collection of situations where interception is allowed. If the agent is a party to the communication, or has the permission of one party to the communication, then it (warrantless interception) is legal, as long as the purpose of the interception is not law\\-breaking. \n\nSubsection (e) allows a US agent \"in the normal course of his official duty to conduct electronic surveillance, as defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as authorized by that Act\". Subsection (i) allows interception in circumstances involving a computer trespasser, which does not seem applicable. Overall, a warrant is required for wire\\-tapping, and the existence of a physical wire is not required.\n\nA potential escape hatch is subsection (g)(i) which says that \"It shall not be unlawful under this chapter or chapter 121 of this title for any person to intercept or access an electronic communication made through an electronic communication system that is configured so that such electronic communication is readily accessible to the general public\". It turns out that \"readily accessible to the general public\" is a technical term defined in 18 USC 2510 (16\\). Certain things make a signal not readily accessible, one being encryption.

The full text of the directive is [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32002L0058:en:HTML)\n\nFirst of all, being a directive and not a regulation, the ePD is not itself legally binding. Instead it instructs the legislatures of member states to implement it, which they generally have done. So the actual binding law is the law of a particular country, which could vary from the wording of the directive. However, in this case, my understanding is that the implementations do not vary significantly. An updated and revised ePrivacy Regulation (ePR) has been proposed, which would replace the ePD and complement the GDPR. But there has been dispute over the proposed terms of the ePR, and it has not yet been passed.\n\nArticle 5 section (3\\) of the ePD reads:\n\n> 3. Member States shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC, *inter alia* about the purposes of the processing, and is offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller.

Cookies ar one form of such locally stored information (LSI).\n\nNote that the GDPR, which replaces Directive 95/46/EC, is used to define \"consent\" in the ePD.\n\nIn general, one must have consent to read or store, and consent must be sought only when the user has been given \"clear and comprehensive information ... about the purpose\" of the stored information. The relevant exception for this question is that information (including cookies) which is \"strictly necessary\" to provide a service specifically requested by the user.\n\nHere the user has requested access to the web site, and may have previously agreed to accept cookies. The site must prompt for consent if the user has not previously consented (and the site will store cookies not strictly needed), and should not if the user has. Therefore, it is strictly necessary to check for and read if present a cookie indicating that such consent has previously been granted. If such a cookie is not found, no consent has been granted.\n\nStrictly required LSI should not have a dual purpose where one purpose is not strictly needed. For example, an \"I accept cookies\" cookie should not also be used for tracking. That should be done (if at all) with a separate cookie, and only after consent is received.\n\nNote that there should be an easily found and easily used method or link on the site (preferably on each page of the site) to review the purposes of stored or accessed LSI, and to withdraw previous consent.

That is not relevant. Nor is the distinction between cookies that might be used to identify a person and those that do not. The legal distinction is between cookies (or other LSI) that are strictly needed to provide the services requested by the user, and all other LSI. Strictly needed LSI does not require consent, all other LSI does.\n\nFor example, a random string, used to determine the number of unique visitors, but not linked to any identifying info about the user, does not help to identify an individual user. But it is not strictly needed, so it can only be stored with consent.\n\nData that are associated with an identifiable natural person (human being, not a firm or organization), are governed by the GDPR (where it applies). There must be a lawful basis for processing such data, which includes reading them from LSI, and storing them. Consent is one of the six possible bases for such processing, but consent need not be obtained if another lawful basis applies. When consent is the basis, it must be easily withdrawn by the user. Note that this applies to **all** data (PI) that is associated with a person, not just data that can readily be used to identify the person (PII).\n\nNote that other workflows are also lawful. For one example, if a site is a strictly membership site, it could prompt for a login before reading or storing any LSI, and then read previous preferences stored on the server by that user to determine whether consent for cookies has been granted.\n\nConclusion\n----------\n\nA cookie indicating that consent to access and store cookies hs previously been given by a particular user can lawfully be read before a user is prompted for consent, under the ePD and its implementing laws.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner wants to implement a cookie consent mechanism that complies with the ePrivacy Directive (ePD).

I know that I need to do the following:\n\n1. Change insurance policy from CA to MD\n2. Get a MD drivers license\n3. Get a vehicle safety inspection test\n4. Get MD title and registration\n\nIn order to title and register my car I need a MD drivers license first. When I get this they will take my CA drivers license from me. Between receiving my MD drivers license and registering my car, will I be able to use my car with CA plates? If I get pulled over on CA plates and present a MD license, is this a problem?\n\nI understand that getting a license and registering a car are separate things, but I want to be sure I can legally use my car as I switch from CA to MD.\n\nFor context, I'm originally from the UK and have been in the US for 2 years, so I am not fully familiar with changing states. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: You have nothing to worry about. Your driver's license is only \"connected\" to your vehicle registration insofar as it is a valid form of identification proving your address in order to register your vehicle in many states. It is mainly used by states as a way of verifying that you actually *live in* that state. They generally don't want to register vehicles to people who don't live there.\n\n**Side note:** Not all states actually *require* a license to register a vehicle, but rather just proof of address. When you get a license, proof of address is a requirement in order to get the license, which transitively makes your license *also* proof of address since it was verified in order to obtain the license. There are some legitimate reasons why a person might register a vehicle *without* actually having a driver's license, and few states actively forbid the practice. The catch is that you'll have a much more difficult time getting an insurance company to issue you a policy when you're unlicensed in the state, and most states require auto insurance in order to register the vehicle.\n\nAt any point, you can surrender your driver's license and your vehicle registration will remain active until its own expiration date. You just won't be able to renew it without getting a new license. This is essentially what you're doing by getting a driver's license in Maryland \\- you are surrendering your California license to Maryland, and Maryland will notify California that you've done that so California can invalidate your license there.\n\nSo moving to a new state, your old vehicle registration continues to be valid from that state until its set date of expiration, *regardless* of what current license you have, until the state is notified otherwise. A police officer will think nothing of an out\\-of\\-state plate combined with an in\\-state license (or even vice versa), so long as both are currently valid.\n\n**What you need to worry about:** Most states have their own laws that require you to re\\-register your vehicle under that state within a set amount of time after you've moved (usually between 30 and 90 days), regardless of how much time is left on your out\\-of\\-state vehicle registration. **In Maryland, that grace period is 60 days.** So don't worry about your California registration \\- just make sure you get your car registered with Maryland within 60 days of your move and you're set.\n\nOnce your vehicle is registered in Maryland, you'll always want to contact the DMV in California about the registration. Some states require you to submit a form by mail claiming that you've moved, and some even require you to surrender your old license plates. The DMV will tell you what, if anything, you need to do after\\-the\\-fact.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: John has recently moved from California to Maryland and needs to update his driver's license and vehicle registration.

According to the information provided, there is no issue with having an in-state (Maryland) driver's license and out-of-state (California) license plates, as long as both are currently valid.

During this time, John can legally drive with his new Maryland license and his still-valid California vehicle registration and plates.

Is the landlord liable for theft?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'll take Washington state law to be typical. [RCW 9a.56\\.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.060) is the criminal law governing rubber checks. Writing a check which you know at the time of drawing or delivering a check that has insufficient fund with *intent to defraud* is a crime. That's not the case here. It might appear to be [theft](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.56.020) on the part of the landlord, except that\n\n> In any prosecution for theft, it shall be a sufficient defense that:\n> (a) The property or service was appropriated openly and avowedly under\n> a claim of title made in good faith, even though the claim be\n> untenable\n\nThat is, he quite reasonably believed that it was intended for him (it *is* made out to him). As for civil liability, your \"liability\" arises from your contract with your bank, and unless you have a remarkable \"not my fault\" clause in the checking account agreement, you can't sue the bank to avoid the overdraft fees (except if bank breaches a promise to not cash a postdated check until the date written on the check, and the check is dated for some time after the check was deposited). You might attempt to sue the landlord, since his action caused you harm: if his act was negligent. If the rent was already due and you were in arrears, the landlord's act of taking the check to apply to your rent obligation (thus saving you from rent late fees) is what a reasonable person would do. But if the check was for rent due a month in the future, a reasonable person would know that they are not owed the rent at this time, and it is highly unlikely that you intended to hand over the check right now: taking and depositing the check would be neglectful of the ordinary care that the landlord owes you as a tenant, and he could be found liable for the damage that he did.\n\nIt is suggested in a comment by Ryan M that violation of the [notice requirement](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=59.18.150) under the Residential Landlord\\-Tenant act negates a good faith defense. [State v. Hicks](http://courts.mrsc.org/supreme/102wn2d/102wn2d0182.htm), 102 Wn.2d 182 concludes that\n\n> \"Animus furandi\", or the intent to steal, is an essential element of\n> the crime of robbery\n> ...\n> the good faith claim of title defense negates the intent element of robbery\n\nNothing in the statutes or case law exists which demands completely clean hands in invoking a good faith defense. Use of force is illegal; but use of force in self defense is legal. The courts have not ruled that a person is deprived of that defense if they have committed a criminal act (landlord entering a residence is not a crime, it is a civil wrong), or if they have committed a tort act.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A tenant writes a rent check but leaves it on their desk, intending to deposit funds to cover it later.

The tenant is not criminally liable for writing a bad check because there was no intent to defraud. The landlord is not guilty of theft due to the \"good faith\" defense, as they reasonably believed the check was intended for them. However, the landlord may be civilly liable for damages if their actions were negligent, especially if the rent was not yet due. The landlord's entry without notice is a civil violation but not necessarily a crime.

While the ability to apply for asylum as a tourist can vary by country, generally, a person can apply for asylum if circumstances in their home country change dramatically during their stay abroad. In this case, the outbreak of civil war would constitute such a change. However, the tourist would need to explain this change in circumstances to support their asylum claim, as entering on a tourist visa might initially make their application seem less credible. Options A and D are incorrect because they make absolute statements that don't align with common asylum practices. Option B is incorrect because converting a tourist visa to permanent residency is typically not a simple process and often requires leaving the country to apply."}, "51": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29736/mistake-of-law-requisite-of-intent-distinguishing-nuance", "docs_id": 29736, "title": "Mistake of Law: Requisite of Intent - Distinguishing Nuance", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: **Background:** I am not a law student, I am a graduate student in mathematics who intermittently enjoys reading about law because I find it axiomatic, deductive and occasionally creative \\- similar to mathematics. You could say it is a hobby for me.\n\n**Context:** I was reading about 'mistake of law' defense on a website (I do not know how credible or outdated this website may be). In short, here is what they had to say \\-\n\n> \"Mistake of Law:\n>  A mistake involving the misunderstanding or incorrect application of law with regard to an act or transaction.

I answered the first two questions correct, but only because there were similar examples in the article that set a precedent for how I answered. I have a few closely related questions regarding the two scenarios in the quiz, and the defense in general. I provide screenshots of the quiz below:\n\n[![Question1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wUdaA.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wUdaA.png)\n\n[![Question2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cq9wN.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Cq9wN.png)\n\n**Analysis:** From the highlighted definition / explanation of 'mistake of law' defense above, and the green highlighted explanations in the pictures \\- this website is implying that the distinction between a successful application of mistake of law defense and unsuccessful mistake of law defense entirely boils down to 'requisite intent' \\- although they do not give a clear definition of this. My interpretation of the arguments for defense in the scenarios is as follows:\n\nArgument for Scenario 1:\n\n1. Defendant comes into possession of lost property.\n2. Defendant falsely believes that a law exists stating that if lost property is not claimed within two months finder gains ownership of lost property.\n3. Defendant waits two months.\n4. Because of the mistake, at this time defendant falsely believes lost property becomes defendants property.\n5. As defined in the question larceny requires the intention of permanently depriving an owner of their property.\n6. By (4\\) \\- at the time defendant made the transaction that would constitute permanently depriving plaintiff of ostensible property, defendant believed ownership was transferred to defendant.\n7. Defendant did not have intent to commit larceny\n8. By definition defendant is not guilty of larceny.\n\nArgument for Scenario 2:\n\n1. Defendant comes into possession of lost property.\n2. Defendant believes \"the law allows for someone to do whatever they want with lost property even if they know who the rightful owner is\".\n3. Defendant sells necklace \\- purposely and permanently depriving the owner of their property.\n4. By definition, defendant has committed larceny.\n\n> **Actual Questions:**\n> \n> \n> 1. In scenario 2, to say \"the law allows for someone to do whatever they want with lost property even if they know who the rightful owner\n>  is\" seems like a laymen way of saying the defendant believed that\n>  finders of lost property immediately acquired ownership. It also seems\n>  from the analysis that had this been the defendants statement \\- it\n>  would have been a 'successful' application of the defense. Is the\n>  wording of the defense the tipping point of what makes this an\n>  'unsuccessful' application?\n> 2. Both of these examples and scenarios are 'isolated' to help get a point across to a reader, that said \\- just because we have argued that\n>  defendant is not guilty *of larceny* in scenario 1, could the charge\n>  be adjusted to a crime that does not specifically require intent?\n>  Could a judge 'overrule' that defendants 'mistake' was 'unreasonable'?\n>  By the contrived example of scenario 1 it seems it would be a valid to\n>  defense to simply claim that every defendant thought a law existed\n>  that somehow removed their intent to commit the crime as defined, but\n>  surely this cannot be.\n> 3. No longer specific to the examples above, do mistake of law defenses actually occur in modern legal situations?\n\n**Closing Remarks:** Please note that I am new to this stack exchange community. I tried my best to keep my question on\\-topic as defined in the help page \\- but please feel free to offer advice regarding social norms of this community, e.g. feel free to tell me if my question is silly child's play and this community is for more serious questions. I also had a hard time choosing appropriate tags since 'legal defenses' is not a tag, please adjust as needed.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: 1. I don't think that's an accurate interpretation of the statement. The key difference between the two scenarios is the defendant's legal assessment of who owns the necklace. In the first he thinks he is the owner and can claim mistake of law; in the second, he he thinks someone else is the owner, so he cannot. To say he believes \"the law allows for someone to do whatever they want with lost property even if they know who the rightful owner is\" is very different from saying he thinks he's the owner. He doesn't think he's the legal owner, he just thinks he has legal rights that include some rights associated with ownership. \n\nSo if the defendant's statement had actually been, \"I thought I was the owner,\" that would have been a successful defense when the crime requires depriving the owner of the property. The defense was actually, \"I thought I was allowed to deprive the owner of the property,\" which is an admission of guilt when the crime requires depriving the owner of the property.\n2. There are a couple questions here:\n\n**a.** A different crime that did not require intent \\-\\- or even required a different kind of intent \\-\\- could still lead to a conviction. A legislature is free to define larceny differently, so it could say that anyone who recklessly or negligently deprives another of property is guilty. Or it could say that your state of mind doesn't matter and that depriving another of property is larceny regardless of intent. \n\n**b.** In most cases, the mistake of law defense requires that the defendant honestly believe in the mistake; unlike mistake of fact, it does not require that his belief also be reasonable. Either way, the question of reasonableness would probably be a question for a jury, so a judge wouldn't be able to reject it (except in a bench trial).\n\n**c.** Mistake of law is a potential defense to any crime that requires an intent to do something that requires an assessment of what the law is. So if it's illegal to intentionally have sex with a woman who is not your wife, and you mistakenly believed you were in a legal marriage, sex with your non\\-wife would not be a crime.\n\nIt has potentially very broad implications, but keep in mind that in many cases, the mistake a defendant would have to claim would be pretty far out there. If it were illegal to intentionally let anyone under 21 years old into your bar, I guess you *could* argue that you only let a 20\\-year\\-old in because you thought the law started calculating at conception, but I doubt you'll convince a jury.\n3. Mistake of law defenses still pop up pretty regularly. [Here's one just yesterday from the Tenth Circuit](https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/17/17-2008.pdf).

The Kansas case, though, uses the more modern definition of mistake of law, which also includes reasonable reliance on official statements from the government. In that case, the felon's parole officer had told him that it was OK to carry a pocketknife, but in reality, the law titled \"[Criminal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon](https://law.justia.com/codes/kansas/2014/chapter-21/article-63/section-21-6304)\" prohibited carrying knives, as well.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the information provided:\n\nQuestion: A defendant is charged with illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

And it sounds like your purpose in deleting the footage is to prevent it from being used in that lawsuit. So you'd be clearly guilty under this law.

I have personally come across such a scam on two occassions. The scammer rents a property short term (e.g. 2\\-3 weeks) on AirBnB. They then pose as a landlord or letting agent and advertise the same property as a long term let. They collect a deposit and rent from any person who wants to be a tenant. They may even copy the keys and give each \"tenant\" a set. On move in day, you arrive at the property to find that you are not the only person trying to move boxes in.\n\nIt has always struck me that landlords are generally very careful to vet their tenants by checking ID, proof of address, obtaining references, and running credit checks. Yet tenants rarely do any vetting at all of their landlords.\n\nA very basic and easy check you can do is to purchase the **title register** (not title plan) for the property [from the Land Registry](https://www.gov.uk/search-property-information-land-registry). This costs \u00a33 and will give you the name of the person who owns the property. If the property is an apartment then you will generally want the *leasehold* title register (not the freehold). Once you have the name, you can then ask your landlord to provide proof that they are that person.\n\nSecondly, you've tagged the question [united\\-kingdom](/questions/tagged/united-kingdom \"show questions tagged 'united-kingdom'\"), but the UK is actually comprised of multiple legal jurisdictions and housing law varies among them (particularly in Scotland). I'm answering this on the basis of [england\\-and\\-wales](/questions/tagged/england-and-wales \"show questions tagged 'england-and-wales'\").\n\nThird, questions asking for legal advice on real situations are off\\-topic here. My answer will just address the general issues and shouldn't be taken as advice for your situation.\n\nContract and due dates\n----------------------\n\nThere is nothing in contract law which prevents obligations from arising *before* the date that the contract is agreed. It is not unusual for parties to draft contracts which govern past behaviour. In that sense, it is perfectly acceptable to agree a contract on 12 August which requires rent to have been paid on 8 August (albeit it would be inadvisable to agree such a contract as you would immediately be in breach if you had not already paid). On the other hand, a contract which purports to have been agreed on a date which is earlier than when it was actually agreed, can amount to fraud.\n\nI would be wary of a subsequent email which purports to allow a later due date which contradicts the contract. Unless there is a clause in the contract allowing for the landlord to postpone due dates, the email is unenforceable and your real due date is still 8 August. The attempt to change the due date is effectively a variation of the contract, and a variation which is not permitted in the contract itself needs to be executed as a second contract. That means you need all the elements of a contract: offer/acceptance, intention to be bound, and consideration. The problem here is the latter. The landlord is providing consideration (a later due date) but you are offering nothing in return.\n\nHolding the room\n----------------\n\n\"*The agent told me they cannot hold my room too long due to the high volume of interest in booking the rooms.*\"\n\n\"*Once you have signed this agreement you will be liable for the full rent set out in the agreement unless released from your tenancy by the Landlord or Management Company.*\"\n\nThese two positions are contradictory. If you agreed a tenancy (as implied by the second quote), then you have a contract which is legally binding on both parties. The first quote is incorrect \\- there is nothing to \"hold\" because the room is already yours.\n\nOn the other hand, it may be that what you agreed was a *holding deposit agreement* (rather than a tenancy agreement) which is merely a commitment on the part of the tenant to forfeit a sum of money (which by law [cannot exceed 1 week's rent](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2019/4/schedule/1/paragraph/3)) in the event that the tenant (as opposed to the landlord) decides not to proceed with the tenancy.\n\nThe wording from the second quote (liability for full rent) implies that it is a tenancy agreement rather than a holding deposit agreement. Or, in the alternative, that it is an illegal holding deposit agreement which asks for more money to be forfeited than is lawful.\n\nYou'll need to read your full contract to understand what it is. If it's a tenancy agreement, it will be obvious from the wording that you have actually rented the property.\n\nObligation to pay rent\n----------------------\n\n\"*My question is do I have any legal responsibility to pay for the entire rent by the new due date (25 August) for APT1?*\"\n\nUnfortunately, if you have signed a tenancy agreement, then you are legally bound to fulfill your obligations under it (provided such obligations do not break the law). If it contains a clause stating that you must pay 51 weeks's rent, then that is what you must do.\n\n\"*If they told me they cannot hold my booking any longer, do I need them to confirm in writing that I'm released from the agreement?*\"\n\nAs a general rule of contract law, nothing needs to be in writing unless (a) the law requires it to be in writing or (b) the contract requires it to be in writing. You agree non\\-written contracts all the time when you go shopping, use the bus, etc. The same applies to taking actions which are governed by a pre\\-existing contract e.g. giving your taxi driver verbal directions once you are en\\-route.\n\nThe phrase \"*unless released from your tenancy by the Landlord or Management Company*\" says nothing about the release needing to be in writing; therefore it can be verbal (provided that there isn't another clause somewhere else in the contract which requires it to be in writing). Be aware however that verbal statements can be difficult to prove.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: An international student signs a tenancy agreement for an apartment (APT1) on August 12th, with a due date of August 8th for the full 51 weeks' rent payment.

Both parties sign at the bottom, as a way of signalling their agreement with the terms specified in the document.

Since both parties have a copy of the signed agreement, this is not strictly necessary. The potential issue would be that an unscrupulous person could cross out a clause after the contract was signed, and claimed that they aren't bound by that clause. A comparison of the two copies would then reveal that the unscrupulous person was attempting fraud. There is nothing special about handwriting in or crossing out conditions, except that it poses a potential evidentiary problem as to what exactly was agreed to, if for example one party threw away their copy and then maintained that the crossed\\-out clause had *not* been crossed out. (So, keep your copy).\n\nIn case you are proposing a scenario where one party is unaware of a change, i.e. at the very last minute Smith crosses something out and signs it, and Jones did not see that happen, then both copies would be the same and Jones would be legally bound to what's in the paper. Smith *should* announce to Jones that a clause was being deleted. We might suppose that there are innocent reasons why Smith made changes without making an announcement to Jones, in which case the parties do not have an agreement.

A very distinctive three note sequence with a very distinctive vocal or sound quality in a fast tempo piece might be only a fraction of a second long and still be infringing.\n\n> The specific use case I'm interested in involves build a database of\n> audio samples for a musical algorithm (e.g., detection of genre or\n> mood) with the intention of later distribution of the database.\n\nThe hard and close question, in my mind, is not the size of the individual audio samples, but whether the form in which the samples are used is sufficient to constitute an infringement of one of the specific sticks in the bundles of rights that come with a copyright (e.g. reproduction, distribution, performance, derivate works) that is protected by a copyright. In other words, is an audio clip that is buried as part of training set data for an app that only an IT professional can access with a device other than the one upon which it would be typically used really distribution of a copy, or a performance, or a derivative work.\n\nThe implication of this description of the proposed activity is that a user of the software can't actually listen to any of the audio samples, which simply constitute a training data set for a machine learning process.\n\nWhile copyright is broader than simply a right to prevent someone from commercially appropriating the value imparted by the creative innovations of the original work (e.g. copyright can be used to prohibit a charitable or free distribution of a copyrighted work), copyright law is also interpreted in light of its purposes. And, the primary purpose of copyright law is to prevent the commercial or non\\-commercial appropriation of the original work without permission from the author (or a mandatory license to perform one's own cover version of an original musical composition for a fee set by an administrative agency), and is interpreted in that light.\n\nThe value of this software to its users doesn't seem to meaningfully implicate this interest since the user doesn't benefit from any one particular individual work, so it isn't obvious to me that audio samples used in this manner are infringing.\n\nThe safer course of action, however, would be to do the machine learning process from the audio samples before distributing that software, and to include only the sound processing model that flows from that machine learning process, rather than the training set data of audio clips themselves, in the distributed product. To allow users to understand the training set and its influence on the end machine learning product, the software could be distributed with a bibliography citing to all of the works from which audio clips were taken that were used in the training data with pinpoint citations to the portions of the cited works from which audio clips were used.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A music technology company is developing an AI algorithm to detect genre and mood in songs.

The documentation suggests that even very short audio samples can potentially infringe copyright if they are recognizable. There is no universal \"safe\" duration for samples (ruling out A and D). Even generic notes could potentially infringe in some contexts (ruling out B). \n\nThe safest approach, according to the expert, is to use the audio samples for training, but only distribute the resulting AI model without the actual audio clips.

At least once, I've seen this on a public sidewalk, it wasn't clear where one might walk that would be subject to this release by poster, and the release purported to apply to unaccompanied minors. The language was written the way lawyers write. If the company was smart, they had a video camera to record who saw the poster in case of a lawsuit later, but I doubt most of the companies bother. No one talked to me about it. Since a person reading the poster and walking in the intended area does not thereby receive consideration, there is no contract.\n\nI wonder if this has wider implications. Suppose I have a house for sale and it has a walkway to the front door. Could I put up a poster saying that if you walk on the walkway you bought the house, including a mortgage with an interest rate I set, and would the poster be binding? Could I create a website offering website design services with my email address and say that if you email me that constitutes your buying my high\\-end service as soon as I access your email? Could I paint a poster on the side of a truck with a camera and photograph two million people and say that here are two million identifiable people every one of whom loves my brand of soda and urges you to buy a case? Suppose a park is frequented by published writers, musicians, artists, and inventors of some repute; could I put up a poster by which I acquire all of their intellectual property because they happen to be in the park? The possibilities of consent by poster seem infinite.\n\nOr, although I've seen posters like this for at least 5\\-6 years (one back then was in a business location open to most of the public), has this never been tested in court and is the poster system probably not a valid substitute for a signature, even for mentally competent English\\-fluent adults not in a rush and allowing that certain contexts wouldn't allow it (e.g., civil court settlements and plea bargains couldn't rely on the poster system)?\n\nOr if you didn't have a reason to read the poster (surely no one has to read every writing that's visible) and simply walked through the area in question without reading it you're not bound by it but someone who did happen to read it must accept its terms?\n\nIf the geographical boundaries are unclear so that reading the poster gives you no clear remedy by walking away, does that change the law on the validity of consent by poster?\n\nWebsite terms often say that using the website constitutes consent to the terms and often reading the terms to discover this requires using the website before you start reading, but I doubt that's legal consent, but maybe consent will be found after you've read them and didn't try to revoke consent, e.g., by not using the site any longer.\n\nIn the United States, this all might well vary by state and may depend on common law.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I gather that the numerous ramifications you outline are merely contexts and that your main concern is about the application of contract law (contract law in the U.S. does not really vary among states). Thus, I will not really delve in the intricacies of \\-\\-for instance\\-\\- privacy or copyright issues arising from the commercial use of a person's likeness that you mention in one of the scenarios.\n\nAs a starting point, one needs to bear in mind that:\n\n1. a contract is an exchange of considerations under terms and conditions entered *knowingly and willfully* by the parties, which can be evidenced by the parties' *subsequent conduct* (that is, not just by signing a document); and\n2. a contract is unenforceable if it contravenes public policy and/or the *covenant of good faith and fair dealing*.\n\nAccordingly, the questions are (1\\) whether a person knew or *reasonably* should have known about the terms \\& conditions at or by the time of those events which trigger obligations pursuant to the contract; and (2\\) whether the provisions therein are unreasonable, illegal, or tantamount to a penalty, especially in the event that the party breaches or repudiates the alleged contract (see the *[Restatement (Second) of Contracts](https://www.nylitigationfirm.com/files/restat.pdf) at \u00a7 356(2\\)*).\n\nThe scenario of *house for sale* entails various difficulties as per contract law and otherwise. Here are some of those issues:\n\n* Are visitors properly (including \"beforehand\") notified about the \"walkway clause\"? If not, the contract is void because it cannot be said that visitors knew about \\& accepted that condition.\n* Does the house provide alternatives for lawful \\& informed visitors to safely avoid the walkway? If not, then the seller/owner might end up incurring *premises liability* with respect to those visitors who get injured in making their reasonable effort not to trigger the \"walkway clause\".\n* Is the house owner realistically able to prove that use of the walkway by lawful \\& informed visitors is sufficiently \"*inconsistent with the offeror's ownership of offered property*\" so that triggering a house sale is a reasonable consequence (see *Restatement* at \u00a769(2\\))?\n* Is the owner\\-imposed mortgage rate compliant with state law pertaining to granting of credit \\& loans?\n\nThese exemplify only some of the burdensome complications when trying to enforce \"contracts\" which are extravagant or quite one\\-sided.\n\nLastly, as a side note, the presumption that \n\n> a person reading the poster and walking in the intended area does not thereby receive consideration\n\nis not necessarily accurate. As an example, the \"intended area\" could have been devised by an entity in the business of enjoyment and recreation, such as a private park. The person who deliberately walks in (regardless of whether he read the poster) certainly receives a consideration, which is the amusement or recreation for which the park was designed.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A company puts up a poster in a public area stating that anyone who walks through the area consents to the commercial use of their likeness without payment. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the legal validity of this claim?\n\nA) The poster creates a binding contract for anyone who walks through the area, regardless of whether they read it.\n\nB) The poster is only binding for those who read it and choose to walk through the area anyway.\n\nC) The poster is likely not legally enforceable due to lack of consideration and issues with knowing and willful consent.\n\nD) The poster is legally binding but only for adults, not for unaccompanied minors.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C because the poster likely does not create a legally enforceable contract. There are several issues with this scenario:\n\n1. Lack of consideration: As mentioned in the original text, there is no clear consideration given to the individuals walking through the area, which is a key element of a valid contract.\n\n2. Absence of knowing and willful consent: People may not have a reason to read every poster they see, and simply walking through a public area does not necessarily imply consent to terms they may not be aware of.\n\n3. Unclear boundaries: If the geographical limits of the area covered by the poster are not clearly defined, it becomes difficult for individuals to knowingly consent or choose an alternative route.\n\n4. Public policy concerns: Such broad claims of rights over people's likenesses without clear consent or compensation may be considered against public policy.\n\n5. Covenant of good faith and fair dealing: The one-sided nature of the terms, heavily favoring the company, may violate this principle of contract law.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because it assumes universal binding without knowledge or consent. Answer B is problematic because it doesn't address the lack of consideration or other issues with the contract's validity. Answer D is incorrect because the enforceability issues apply to both adults and minors in this scenario."}, "57": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/70538/why-is-julian-assange-in-jail", "docs_id": 70538, "title": "Why is Julian Assange in jail?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Further to [another question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39108/what-would-be-julian-assanges-expected-punishment-on-the-current-english-crimi/39109) asked on these boards:\n\nJulian Assange was [sentenced to 50 weeks](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/julian-assange-prison-jail-time-weeks-bail-embassy-a8894326.html) for jumping bail on 1 May 2019  \n\nPresumably, his jail term began immediately upon sentencing, in which case he finished serving his sentence 68\\+ weeks ago.\n\nHe was [held for several months pending](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/14/julian-assange-to-remain-in-jail-pending-extradition-to-us) extradition hearings, which itself does not make complete sense: presumably, the extradition hearings should have been conducted while he was serving the actual sentence.\n\nWhy is he still being held in Belmarsh?\n\nI understand that after a very pro\\-extradition1 judge, overseen by one with serious conflicts2, [struck down](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/world/europe/assange-extradition-denied.html) the American request for extradition, the [Americans are appealing](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/12/us-government-appeals-uk-ruling-against-julian-assanges-extradition-joe-biden-wikileaks).\n\n**Larger question**\nHowever, my understanding is that if a judge finds someone guilty then they go to jail right away.

In general it is intended as a last ditch measure, and the circumstances of the case must be considered.\n\nIn this case, after Assange spent several years holed in at Ecuador's embassy in the UK, and given that he did not surrender himself voluntarily, it is not that unreasonable to believe that he would try again to flee, as the matter is not still settled and he is still at risk of being extradited.\n\nI do not know about England, but in some countries (e.g. Spain) if you are kept in preventive custody but later found to be innocent you are automatically entitled to an indemnity.\n\nAlso, for the larger question, that is not true either at least in some countries. After a guilty veredict a judge may postpone incarceration while appeals are reviewed (again considering things like flight risks). Of course, if you have condemned someone who has not been given bail due to being considered too risky, they remain in jail during the process.\n\nAlso `Presumably, his jail term began immediately upon sentencing`. In many jurisdictions, the time served before the sentence is counted towards the sentence. If you spent 4 weeks in jail before the sentence, you have already passed 4 weeks of your sentence.\n\nIf the time already spent is close to the time you would have been sentenced, the sentence specifies that you are condemned \"to time served\" and released immediately.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: In the context of Julian Assange's legal situation, which of the following statements is most accurate regarding preventive custody and extradition proceedings?\n\nA) Preventive custody is only used after a guilty verdict and never during extradition proceedings.\n\nB) If a judge denies extradition, the accused must always be released immediately, regardless of pending appeals.\n\nC) Preventive custody during extradition proceedings is justified primarily to prevent the accused from committing new crimes.\n\nD) Preventive custody can be used during extradition proceedings if there's a significant flight risk, even if the initial extradition request is denied.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is correct because the documentation indicates that preventive custody can be used to deny the accused the opportunity of fleeing, which is particularly relevant in Assange's case given his history of seeking asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy.

The management company retracted some fines but still shows express hate and hostility toward her and fines her whenever they can.\n\nMy friend has requested a meeting with the HOA board many times in email to the manager, which have all been ignored or denied. Then an extremely discriminatory and hateful thing against her happened. With her access to the board blocked, she had no choice but to write an open letter to other residents, asking for their help, and leave the letters at their doors. A few weeks later the management company found out and slapped her with several other fines, claiming her act of distributing an open letter constituted a violation. (Funny thing is the section they cited in the Condominium Bylaw in regard to the violation doesn't even exist.)\n\nAre open letters protected under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution? Are there other specific clauses on the federal and/or state level that are relevant in this case?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **No.**\n\nIt is an often repeated misconception that \"Freedom of Speech\" means that no one can restrict speech ever. This is not the case. Let us look at the US Consitution's First Admendment, which contains the \"Freedom of Speech\" clause:\n\n> **Congress shall make no law** ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...\n\n(Emphasis mine)\n\nAs one can see, the First Amendment only restricts government actions. (It also stops other branches of government from restricting speech, because those branches are innately weak with very few powers granted to them by the constitution; the majority of executive or judicial branches powers are granted to them by a law passed by Congress, and Congress cannot give a power to another party that they do not possess).\n\nA Home Owner Association (HOA) is not a government or government agency; it is a private organization (and it is not the same as the \"private management company\" that manages the condominium, which is probably in the employ of the HOA; which also means that emailing the manager is not emailing the HOA board). Their power stems from a contract, one that your friend signed when they bought the property (one of the conditions agreed to is that a member who sells or gifts their HOA\\-member property can only do so to someone who also agrees to the contract).\n\nThat said, HOAs can be horribly abusive and many states have laws that restrict what kinds of rules and penalties can be applied by an HOA.

HOAs derive their authority from contractual agreements with property owners, not from governmental power.
