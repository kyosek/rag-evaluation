Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: A software company has been using an open-source library in their commercial product for the past 18 months. The library was released under a permissive license allowing commercial use. Recently, one of the original authors of the library filed a patent on the technology and added a warning to the repository prohibiting commercial use. What is the most appropriate course of action for the company?\n\nA) Immediately cease using the library and remove it from their product\nB) Continue using the library as before, ignoring the new warning\nC) Negotiate a licensing agreement with the patent filer\nD) File an objection to the patent application citing prior art\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This scenario requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. The software was released as open source with a permissive license allowing commercial use two years ago. This public release constitutes prior art.\n\n2. Patents cannot be granted for inventions that are already in the public domain (prior art). The fact that the software was publicly available for two years before the patent application means it should not be patentable.\n\n3. The original license allowing commercial use takes precedence over the later added warning, as licenses cannot be retroactively changed for existing users.\n\n4. Filing an objection to the patent application citing the prior art (the open-source release) is the most proactive and legally sound approach. It helps prevent an invalid patent from being granted, which could cause issues for all users of the software.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company has been legally using the software under the original license terms. Option B, while potentially defensible, ignores the developing legal situation and could lead to future complications. Option C is unnecessary and potentially validates an invalid patent claim. Option D addresses the root of the problem by challenging the patent's validity based on prior art."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59744/why-call-a-contract-an-agreement", "docs_id": 59744, "title": "Why call a Contract an &quot;Agreement&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [In my personal contract](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/57710), just \"Agreement\" appears, never \"Contract\".

The document uses the term \"Agreement\" throughout and includes details on investment amount, equity stake, and voting rights. However, it lacks a specific clause about the intention to create legal relations. In a legal dispute, how would a court likely view this document?\n\nA) As a fully enforceable contract, since all essential terms are included\nB) As a non-binding agreement, due to the absence of the word \"Contract\"\nC) As a potentially binding contract, subject to proving intention to create legal relations\nD) As an informal memorandum of understanding with no legal weight\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from contract law. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. The document contains essential terms of an agreement (investment amount, equity stake, etc.), satisfying the requirement for certainty.\n2. The use of \"Agreement\" instead of \"Contract\" is not determinative, as the legal substance matters more than the label.\n3. Consideration is likely present (money for equity).\n4. There's no mention of specific form requirements.\n5. The critical missing element is explicit intention to create legal relations.\n\nIn commercial contexts, intention to create legal relations is usually presumed. However, the absence of a specific clause might raise questions.

In particular if the responsible party had car insurance with reasonable (but not infinite) coverage for third party.\n\nIn practical terms, let's say I have car insurance, which covers around 50k local monetary units in damages to third parties. Then I hit a very expensive luxury car, say a Ferrari, which for the purpose for this example is worth ten million local monetary units. Totaling 8 million in repairs costs. I readily call my insurance to reimburse the Ferrari owner.

After a certain amount, the owner of the Ferrari should be aware that he cannot reasonably expect that a regular person would or should have the means to repair his damages, hence after some amount it should be his problem. \n\nIn that case, for each of these countries, would I have to spend the rest of my life with debt?

This is correct because the documentation mentions that if a person has debts they cannot pay, they may choose bankruptcy as an option. While bankruptcy is described as \"painful,\" it's presented as potentially less painful than carrying an unpayable debt for life. This option balances the reality of full liability with the practical consideration of bankruptcy as a legal recourse for overwhelming debt.

Is that true?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Under [17 USC 507](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/507), the limit depends on whether this is criminal prosecution versus a civil action. Criminal prosecution must be \"commenced within 5 years after the cause of action arose\". A civil action must be \"commenced within three years after the claim accrued\". The courts do not entirely agree on what that means, in particular whether that means 3 years from discovery of the infringement (the majority opinion: the \"discovery rule\" see [Warren Freedenfeld Assocs., Inc. v. McTigue](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1468111/warren-freedenfeld-associates-inc-v-mctigue/), 531 F.3d 38\\), or from the infringing act (the \"injury rule\" which has been employed in the 2nd Circuit and perhaps only there, see [Auscape Int'l v.

If the plaintiff did not know until recently (someone just emailed them the info), that would be within the limit, in the majority of jurisdictions. \n\n(One other complication is whether the limit would be extended under the doctrine of equitable tolling, but that seems unlikely given the circumstances described: the plaintiff was not prevented from pursuing a remedy, there was no concealment by the author).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a question based on the provided LawStackExchange documentation:\n\nQuestion: An university professor created an unauthorized derivative work of a textbook six years ago and shared it with students.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The statute of limitations for civil copyright infringement cases is generally three years.\n2.

In this scenario, the publisher discovers the infringement today and can prove it was published online two years ago, which is within the three-year statute of limitations.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, under the discovery rule, the clock starts at discovery, not creation.

Code \u00a7 44\\-8\\-7\\.\n\n**Added after comments**\n\nUnder WV law, it does not matter that you were bequeathed your mother\u2019s house. The law gives debtors priority over heirs. This means debtors are paid before any heir. Heirs are \u201cpaid\u201d from *whatever is left* in the estate *after* the debts are paid.

A negative answer does not affect the legality of the arrest.\n\nThere is also a law imposing on medical professionals a [duty to report](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?chapter=2.&part=4.&lawCode=PEN&title=1.&article=2.), which is fairly wordy, but does not seem to directly require reporting the fact that a person is publicly intoxicated. However, attending circumstances could have suggested one of the triggering causes for mandatory reporting (wounds, for example). Again, it does not matter (to a point) if, in the light of close scrutiny, the doctor's conclusions were mistaken. When doctors are required to report facts to the police, reasonable over\\-reporting is not penalized. There is also no law against calling 911 to report a potential DUI (the usual public\\-campaign focus is on those actually driving). So calling the police under the circumstances falls between \"allowed\" and \"required\".\n\nThe [HIPAA privacy rule](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf) could be relevant because *that* theoretically could block the doctor from making the call. (Note that the doctor, and not the patient, is bound by the confidentiality requirements). \u00a7160\\.203 allows exceptions to the confidentiality requirement if \"necessary... For purposes of serving a compelling need related to public health, safety, or welfare\", so an exception may have been granted. If this was done within the scope of a mandatory reporting law, it is legal to disclose PHI; under [\u00a7164\\.512](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/ocr/privacy/hipaa/administrative/combined/hipaa-simplification-201303.pdf) it is allowed, \"to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public\".\n\nA confidentiality agreement would *not* increase your chances of being arrested. If the doctor's confidentiality statement were less restrictive than HIPAA, HIPAA prevails (the law trumps contract terms). If it is the same as HIPAA, it has no effect (and simply states what HIPAA says \u2013 the normal case). If the agreement were *more* restrictive, it is possible that the doctor calling the police would be a breach of contract, unless the call was required by law. You would have to see what in the agreement would have prohibited calling the police. But that would not affect the validity of the arrest.\n\nTo re\\-phrase the matter: the arrest was because you were found to be intoxicated in public. The police were there and could judge your state (probable cause). They were there by permission of the property owner, so the arrest was not unlawful for lack of a warrant. That is as far as one can go in searching for an illegality to the arrest itself. One *might* go further and ask whether the doctor has committed an actionable wrong by calling the police with her suspicions. This could go either way: it really depends on the full set of details, regarding your condition. If the doctor suspected that your actions fell under one of the mandatory reporting categories, she had to report, and otherwise it is not prohibited under HIPAA.\n\nIf a person is intoxicated and answers the question \"Would you normally proceed to drive home in this state?\" in the affirmative, then it is a reasonable inference that the person *will* do so. An answer \"No, absolutely not\", on the other hand would work against the \"public danger\" inference: that has no effect on the arrest, but could have an effect in a suit against the doctor (violation of the privacy rule). In such a suit, the doctor's defense would presumably be that despite the answer, she still had a reasonable belief that you were a public danger. Then the matter would reduce to what other facts she knew of that would support a public danger conclusion.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A patient visits a doctor's office while intoxicated and admits they would normally drive home in their current state. The doctor calls the police, resulting in the patient's arrest for public intoxication. Which of the following best describes the legal implications of this scenario?\n\nA) The doctor's actions were illegal due to a breach of doctor-patient confidentiality, invalidating the arrest.\nB) The arrest was lawful, but the doctor may be liable for violating HIPAA privacy rules.\nC) The doctor's actions were likely legal under both mandatory reporting laws and HIPAA exceptions, and the arrest was valid.\nD) The scenario constitutes entrapment, making both the doctor's actions and the arrest unlawful.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves complex interactions between medical confidentiality, public safety, and law enforcement. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The arrest itself was lawful. The patient was found intoxicated in a place accessible to the public (the doctor's office), which satisfies the elements of public intoxication under California Penal Code 647f. The police had probable cause based on their observations.\n\n2. The doctor's actions in calling the police were likely legal under multiple provisions:\n   a) HIPAA allows disclosure of protected health information \"to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health or safety of a person or the public\" (\u00a7164.512).\n   b) There may be applicable mandatory reporting laws, and even if not directly applicable, reasonable over-reporting by doctors is generally not penalized.\n   c) The patient's admission of potentially driving while intoxicated creates a compelling public safety concern.\n\n3. While doctor-patient confidentiality is important, it does not increase the odds of arrest. Rather, exceptions exist for public safety concerns.\n\n4. This scenario does not constitute entrapment, as the doctor did not induce the patient to commit a crime they weren't already predisposed to commit.\n\n5. The arrest's validity is not affected by the doctor's decision to call the police, even if that decision were later found to be inappropriate.\n\nThis question requires integration of multiple legal concepts, application to a real-world scenario, and analysis of the interplay between medical ethics, confidentiality laws, and public safety considerations.

They will likely have minimal PPE and the police have a duty of care to not endanger their officers beyond what is required for the job in the ordinary course of duty.

Do I need to Restore old page?\n\nYou seemingly do. This is equivalent to taking your drivable car to the mechanic for maintenance or improvements. If the contract is cancelled for whatever reason, it would be unacceptable that the mechanic returns you the car in a condition worse enough that you can no longer drive it.\n\nThe transfer of domains \\& credentials to your server supports the presumption that you are responsible for the contents and functionality of the site for as long as the domains \\& credentials are under your control. To the act of returning what was given to you is attached the expectation that you would restore it to its former state if the contract is cancelled or rescinded.\n\nAn alternative scenario helps making the point. Suppose you cancelled the contract upon realizing you are not proficient enough to create the website. It would be nonetheless reasonable to expect you to bring his site back to its original state. Absent a clause addressing the event of cancellation or rescission otherwise, there is no reason why your responsibility in this regard would depend on the cause for rescission.\n\nFurthermore, the formation of the initial \\[verbal] contract tends to indicate that you are more proficient in the matter than the client. This places on you the burden of taking sufficient precautions by directly securing a backup or at least requiring your client to create one. The fact that your backup got corrupted is rather tantamount to not having done a backup at all.\n\nSomething that might favor your position is the *common practice* that many IT service providers recommend that users always have a backup, whence at this point average person \"should not\" (?) need to be reminded to do backups when transferring his data or systems to a provider. This argument might not be strong enough to release you from your responsibility to secure a backup for yourself, though. The stronger the client's expertise in IT matters, the likelier that his failure to produce a backup will release you from having to restore the site (the mere fact that the client asked you to create a website does not conclusively preempt the possibility that he might also be proficient in the matter).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A web developer verbally agreed to create a website for a client at a fixed price.

The client disagreed, and the project was cancelled. The client's domain is on the developer's server, and the developer's backup of the client's original site is corrupted. What is the developer's most likely legal obligation in this scenario?\n\nA) The developer has no obligation to restore the original site, as backups were not explicitly agreed upon in the verbal contract.\nB) The developer must restore the original site to its exact previous state, regardless of the difficulty or cost involved.\nC) The developer is only responsible for transferring the domain back to the client, with no obligation regarding the site's content.\nD) The developer should make a reasonable effort to restore the original site, based on the implied responsibility of temporary custodianship.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of the complex situation presented, integrating multiple legal and ethical concepts. The correct answer is D because:\n\n1. While there was no explicit agreement about backups or site restoration, the developer assumed a degree of responsibility by taking control of the client's domain and hosting the site on their server. This creates an implied duty of care for the client's property (in this case, the website).\n\n2. Option A is incorrect because even without an explicit agreement, there's an implied responsibility when taking control of someone else's digital assets. The lack of a written contract doesn't negate all obligations.\n\n3. Option B is too extreme, as it doesn't account for the practical difficulties the developer is facing with the corrupted backup. The law typically requires reasonable efforts, not perfection at all costs.\n\n4. Option C is insufficient, as it ignores the implied responsibility for the site's content while it was under the developer's control.\n\n5. Option D strikes the right balance, acknowledging the developer's responsibility while also recognizing the practical limitations. \"Reasonable effort\" is a common legal standard that takes into account both the obligation to the client and the realities of the situation.\n\n6. This aligns with the top answer's analogy to a mechanic, where returning a car in a non-functional state would be unacceptable, even if the original agreement fell through.\n\n7.

For example, [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909000&ref_=footer_cou) says:\n\n> The Order Confirmation E\\-mail is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when we dispatch the product to you and send e\\-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched the product to you (the \"Dispatch Confirmation E\\-mail\").\n\nSo, here, two things have to happen before Amazon and you have a contract: they have to physically dispatch the goods *and* they have to send you an email saying they have. If they do one without the other, there is no contract. If your vendor has similar terms, you don't have a contract with them and are not entitled to contractual damages.\n\nYou would not have a case in equity because they were clear that there was no contract until these things happened.\n\nYou *might* be able to argue negligence if they sent the email without dispatching the goods but your damage basis would be different. Tort damage is calculated on a restoration basis, not an expectation basis, so you can recoup your losses but not claim any lost profits. It makes no difference here but if you had had a buyer who was going to pay you twice the price you paid, in contract you are entitled to the lost profit, in tort, you aren't.\n\nHowever, if the contract has a dispute resolution clause, that would normally have to be complied with before you can go to court. In some cases, this may prevent going to court at all, for example, if the dispute resolution clause included binding arbitration or expert determination.\n\nIf there is a choice of law clause then this will usually be binding, however, if this is a consumer contract in New Zealand then NZ consumer law will apply in addition.\n\nSimilarly, courts will usually observe a choice of venue clause.\n\n> With what reasonable time lapse between (false) shipment notification of the original order and placing the eBay order?\n\nA reasonable time.

He now seeks damages from the UK store.

Option C is the most appropriate because:\n\n1. It acknowledges the importance of reviewing the store's terms and conditions, which likely contain a dispute resolution clause. Many e-commerce platforms include binding arbitration clauses, which must be followed before court action.\n\n2. It recognizes that the formation of a contract may be contingent on more than just the shipment notification, as outlined in the example of Amazon's terms in the documentation.\n\n3. Seeking arbitration allows for a potentially quicker and less costly resolution, while still preserving the ability to claim damages for the price difference.\n\n4. It avoids jurisdictional complications of filing in either New Zealand or the UK courts without first following agreed-upon dispute resolution procedures.\n\n5. The claim for both the price difference and logistical inconvenience addresses the full scope of potential damages under contract law.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it assumes a valid contract based solely on the shipment notification, which may not be the case. Option B focuses on negligence rather than contract law, which may limit the recoverable damages. Option D is less appropriate as it doesn't directly address the contractual nature of the dispute and may not provide the desired remedy.

But, even then the U.S. Constitution had some narrow provisions that were applicable to the states including a ban on religious tests for public office that also applied to state and local governments. Also, most states also separated church and state in their own state constitutions, often in language parallel to the First Amendment, but sometimes stronger.\n\nFor example, the parallel provision adopted in Colorado's Bill of Rights when it became a state in 1876 stated:\n\n> Section 4\\. Religious freedom. The free exercise and enjoyment of\n>  religious profession and worship, without discrimination, shall\n>  forever hereafter be guaranteed; and no person shall be denied any\n>  civil or political right, privilege or capacity, on account of his\n>  opinions concerning religion; but the liberty of conscience hereby\n>  secured shall not be construed to dispense with oaths or affirmations,\n>  excuse acts of licentiousness or justify practices inconsistent with\n>  the good order, peace or safety of the state. **No person shall be\n>  required to attend or support any ministry or place of worship,\n>  religious sect or denomination against his consent. Nor shall any\n>  preference be given by law to any religious denomination or mode of\n>  worship.**\n\nThe [Treaty of Tripoli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli) (1796\\), for example, made clear that Christians and Muslims were equal and that the government favored neither, and was not a Christian nation. At that time, France (an ally of the United States) was pretty much the only other country in the world without an established national church. \n\nMany of the notable Founders were [deists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism).\n\nIn all or most of the Southeast United States. there was never an established church. The last established churches in the United States (in New England, see, e.g. [here](http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195399677.001.0001/acprof-9780195399677-chapter-4)), were disestablished before the Civil War. The successor denominations to the established churches of New England are the Congregational churches, the United Church of Christ, and the Unitarian Church (which later merged with the Universalist Church, a church which was never an established church but had similar doctrines).\n\nThe Bill of Rights eventually started to be applied to state and local governments relying doctrinally on authority granted in the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution adopted during the Reconstruction era (specifically, in 1868\\). The incorporation doctrine applying the Bill of Rights to the states via 14th Amendment was [first applied in 1897](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights). Portions of the First Amendment had been incorporated not later than 1925\\. The free exercise clause of the First Amendment was incorporated in 1940\\. *[Cantwell v. Connecticut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantwell_v._Connecticut)*, 310 U.S. 296 (1940\\). It was all but inevitable that *Everson* (see below) would be decided that way that it was when it eventually came before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1947, many years before the U.S. Supreme Court made that ruling. Like all major U.S. Supreme Court rulings, this ruling was preceded by lower court rulings reaching the same conclusion.\n\n> Black wrote the majority opinion in the 1947 US Supreme Court case\n>  Everson v Board of Education which redefined the separation of church\n>  and state as a barrier to church/state cooperation \u2013 reversing over\n>  150 years of legal precedent in which it had been recognized as a\n>  facilitator of church influence in government.

Board of Education* (U.S. 1947\\) followed already well established law and doctrine. There has never been a time in U.S. history after disestablishment in which facilitation of church influence in government was recognized. This is fake history produced by [Christian Dominionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_theology) to further their own political ends.\n\nThis isn't to say that *Everson v. Board of Education* wasn't an important holding. But, it was not a sharp departure for prior law. It was merely clarification of the details of existing law that was well established in particular stark and quotable terms. \n\nTo quote a brief portion of the Atlantic article linked in the question:\n\n> The attack on separation began as an attack on a letter by Thomas\n>  Jefferson to the Danbury Baptist Association, dated Jan. 1\\. 1802\\. \n>  Jefferson assured the Baptists that \"I contemplate with sovereign\n>  reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that\n>  their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of\n>  religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a\n>  wall of separation between Church \\& State.\" In 1985, then\\-Justice\n>  William Rehnquist wrote that \"unfortunately the Establishment Clause\n>  has been expressly freighted with Jefferson's misleading metaphor for\n>  nearly 40 years.\"\n> \n> \n> But this argument ignores a historical fact.

The correct answer is B, contributory copyright infringement.\n\nContributory copyright infringement occurs when a party knowingly induces, causes, or materially contributes to copyright infringement by another. In this case, StreamAll.com is not directly hosting the copyrighted content (ruling out option A), but it is providing links and facilitating access to infringing material on third-party sites. This behavior likely meets the criteria for contributory infringement.\n\nOption A (direct infringement) is incorrect because StreamAll.com is not actually hosting or distributing the copyrighted content themselves.\n\nOption C (vicarious infringement) is less applicable here because it typically requires the defendant to have the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and also directly profit from it. While StreamAll.com might profit indirectly, they don't have direct control over the third-party sites hosting the content.\n\nOption D (fair use defense) is incorrect because fair use is a defense against copyright infringement claims, not a basis for legal action against a website.

As explained in the top answer, the law typically treats such advertisements as invitations for customers to make offers, rather than as binding offers that can be accepted to form a contract. \n\nThis principle protects businesses from being bound by every advertisement they make, especially over long periods.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. In employment law, multiple policies can coexist unless one explicitly replaces another.

Without knowing which country you're speaking of, it's impossible to be specific about possible consequences.\n\nThe first question would be whether using a VPN to access content outside of the US is a violation of Netflix (US) terms of service. The [TOS](https://help.netflix.com/legal/termsofuse) states\n\n> You may view Netflix content primarily within the country in which you\n>  have established your account and only in geographic locations where\n>  we offer our service and have licensed such content.

Additionally, \"household\" does not mean \"any relative\", so arguably any sharing of the account between siblings who live in different countries is a violation of the TOS. The fact that your brother is paying doesn't matter, nor does his citizenship matter. What does matter the most, to them, is that they have to license content from others, and the copyright holders may well impose prohibitions on distributing content outside a particular geographical zone. So they may have permission to distribute a film only in the US, and they are liable if the film is also distributed outside the US. \n\nBecause your brother has allowed you to access this content, they might terminate his account. They might also take you to court for copyright infringement, since any watching / downloading of video requires copying, and all copying requires permission (granted under the terms of service). You do not have any permission to watch stuff on Netflix. If they sue you in Delaware, they would have to get the judgment enforced in Tanzania (picking a hypothetical country), so the question is whether Tanzania would enforce infringement judgments. Or, they could sue you in Tanzania (since Netflix has actual presence in most countries).\n\nIt is impossible to know in advance whether Netflix would actually sue a person for illegally accessing content with a VPN, rather than just thwarting your attempt.

Terms of Service Violation: Netflix's TOS explicitly states that content should be viewed \"primarily within the country in which you have established your account\" and \"only in geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed such content.\" Using a VPN to access content not licensed for the viewer's country violates this term.\n\n2. Account Sharing Violation: The TOS specifies that the service is for \"personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household.\" Sharing between siblings in different countries violates this clause.\n\n3. Potential Copyright Infringement: By accessing content not licensed for their country, the sibling may be infringing on copyright. Netflix licenses content for specific geographical regions, and circumventing these restrictions could be seen as copyright violation.\n\n4. Legal Risks: While the prevalence of piracy in the sibling's country doesn't make the action legal, it could affect the likelihood of prosecution.

It starts at the whiteboard.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-is-hiring-broken-it-starts-at-the-whiteboard-34b088e5a5db/)\n\n[Tech Hiring Has Always Been Broken.

An article titled [You're testing them wrong: Whiteboard coding interviews are 'anti\\-women psychological stress examinations'](https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/15/it_hiring_whiteboard/), published in July of last year by the Register says about the study:\n\n*As a consequence, whiteboard interviews may fail to assess coder competency. Rather, the researchers argue, they measure how well job candidates handle anxiety.*\n\n*The researchers found that stress hinders interview performance, with participants in the traditional technical interview exhibiting higher cognitive load, lower scores, and higher stress levels. In essence, social anxiety took otherwise qualified job candidates out of the running because of the circumstances of the interview.*\n\n*What's more, whiteboard technical interviews appear to favor men over women.*\n\n*'We also observed that no women successfully solved the problem in the public setting, whereas all women solved it correctly in the private setting,' the paper says.*\n\nThis is a [link to the study](http://chrisparnin.me/pdf/stress_FSE_20.pdf). There is also [another article](https://news.ncsu.edu/2020/07/tech-job-interviews-anxiety/) published by the university that summarizes the results of the study.\n\nCurrently, [just 14% of software developers in the US are women](https://builtin.com/women-tech/women-in-tech-workplace-statistics). This study suggests that one of the primary reasons for this poor representation is because of sex discrimination.\n\nSo, is this new study enough to encourage legal experts representing large corporations to at least worry about sex discrimination lawsuits from women that have failed whiteboard interviews? If you are a corporate attorney and it was your job to minimize legal risks to that company, would you recommend to human resources that whiteboard interviews are now too legally risky and the company should avoid them, or do you believe instead that it is nothing to worry about and it is okay to do business as usual?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Barrister to instructing solicitor: \u201cAm I working for the plaintiff or defendant?\u201d\n\nPlaintiff\n---------\n\nYour honour, this excellent study and the expert testimony you have heard from the authors, clearly demonstrates that whiteboard testing is sexual discrimination by another name. The clear correlation between the gender of the interviewee and their ability to perform this task, which is unrelated to the job and is actually a test of how good the person is at handling performance anxiety, is being used to prejudicially and unlawfully screen out female applicants.\n\nDefendant\n---------\n\nYour honour, this discredited paper and the inconsistent testimony of the author clearly demonstrated that the methodology was flawed and the conclusions are unsupportable. When pressed, it turned out that the number of females encompassed by the catch\\-all word \u201call\u201d was 6 \\- hardly a sample big enough to draw any meaningful conclusions from. Further, it turned out that the number of men who also improved was unknown because *they didn\u2019t test them*! So we have the authors of a study with gender discrimination in its very methodology drawing asinine conclusions from it about gender discrimination!\n\nIt may be that whiteboard testing is better at finding competent actors than programmers and this may make it a terrible recruitment tool.

[8 Delaware Code \u00a7 166](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc05/index.html).\n\n**Application To Hypothetical Facts**\n\n> Using 3 out of 5 board seats, investor B then fired the founder and\n> CEO, whose shares, it's revealed, have a vesting schedule.\n> \n> \n> My question is: who owns the company at this point (assuming a\n> negligible fraction of the shares vested)? Wouldn't investor A's 10%\n> stake trump investor B's 5% and give him the right to elect all board\n> members?\n\nCorporations formed under Delaware law have very broad discretion to tailor their terms to the wishes of the parties, and most of the statutory provisions are merely default rules of law that apply when not displaced by the governing documents of the corporation.\n\nIf the governing documents provide that particular investors get board seats, then, notwithstanding the share ownership of the investors and shareholders, those investors get board seats. With respect to directors, this authority is formally expressly primarily at [8 Delaware Code \u00a7 141(a)](https://delcode.delaware.gov/title8/c001/sc04/index.html).\n\nControl of a corporation doesn't have to align with beneficial economic ownership of a corporation under Delaware law (or for that matter, in for profit corporations in most U.S. jurisdictions).\n\nIt isn't uncommon in a Delaware corporation for control of a corporation to be vested in shareholders (and even some non\\-shareholders) who control only a minority of the economic value of a corporation's shares.\n\nThere are several different ways that this can be documented from a nuts and bolts legal perspective, but the bottom line is that he who controls the board controls the corporation, and that selection of the board of directors can be varied by agreement as expressed in the governing documents (always a certificate of incorporation, usually bylaws, and sometimes also some sort of shareholder's agreement or voting trust).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation about corporate governance in Delaware, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A Delaware-incorporated startup has three investors: A (10% stake, 1 board seat), B (5% stake, 3 board seats), and the founder (85% stake, 1 board seat).

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this situation?\n\nA) Investor A can block the founder's removal due to having the largest non-founder stake in the company.\nB) The founder cannot be removed as CEO because their unvested shares still count towards voting rights.\nC) Investor B can likely remove the founder as CEO but cannot claim ownership of the founder's unvested shares.\nD) The removal decision must be unanimously approved by all shareholders, regardless of board composition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple concepts from Delaware corporate law. The key points are:\n\n1. Board control: Investor B has 3 out of 5 board seats, giving them majority control of the board. Under Delaware law (8 Delaware Code \u00a7 141(a)), the board generally has the power to manage the corporation, including hiring and firing the CEO.\n\n2. Share ownership vs. board control: Delaware law allows for a disconnect between economic ownership and control. The fact that Investor A has a larger stake (10%) than Investor B (5%) is irrelevant to board voting power if the corporate documents allocate board seats differently.\n\n3. Vesting schedules: The founder's shares being subject to a vesting schedule doesn't affect board composition or voting rights of current board members. However, unvested shares typically can't be claimed by other parties if the founder is terminated.\n\n4. Shareholder rights: There's no requirement for unanimous shareholder approval for CEO removal in standard Delaware corporations. The board typically has this power.\n\nTherefore, Investor B, controlling the board majority, can likely remove the founder as CEO (addressing the critical thinking aspect of board control vs. ownership). However, they cannot claim ownership of the founder's unvested shares, as vesting schedules are typically protected (addressing the real-world application of equity vesting in startups).\n\nOptions A and B represent common misconceptions about shareholder rights and vesting, while D introduces an incorrect assumption about unanimous consent requirements, serving as plausible distractors."}, "37": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/25371/are-employees-in-the-eu-more-protected-than-in-the-us-for-sexual-harassment", "docs_id": 25371, "title": "Are employees in the EU more protected than in the US for sexual harassment?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: For example, I know someone who was hired in the US for companyX.

Option D is the most likely scenario to create a legally binding agreement because it combines several elements that could constitute a contract or create a situation of promissory estoppel:\n\n1. Verbal agreement: While not typically binding for tenancy agreements on its own, it shows initial intent.\n2. Payment of a holding deposit: This demonstrates a concrete action and commitment from the prospective tenant.\n3.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. While the contract contains a choice of law clause (Nevada), courts don't automatically enforce these clauses without consideration of other factors.\n\n2. The scenario involves multiple jurisdictions (Florida, California, New York, Texas, and Nevada), triggering a conflict of laws analysis.\n\n3. In complex cases like this, courts often use the \"most significant relationship\" test from the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws. This test considers various factors to determine which jurisdiction's law should apply.\n\n4.

In fact, the Constitution has very little to say about the Speaker's role in day-to-day operations.\n\nOption B is incorrect. While the Clerk of the House does have some administrative duties, they do not automatically assume the role of acting Speaker.

The correct answer is C, based on the Supreme Court's ruling in Zadvydas v. Davis (2001). The Court established that the Due Process Clause applies to all \"persons\" within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent. This means that undocumented immigrants have constitutional protections once they are physically present in the country, including the right to sue the government for injuries sustained while in detention.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it contradicts the Supreme Court's ruling, which explicitly states that unlawful presence does not negate constitutional protections.

Your hypothetical seems to match the facts of that case:\n\n> Aereo, Inc., sells a service that allows its subscribers to watch television programs over the Internet at about the same time as the programs are broadcast over the air. When a subscriber wants to watch a show that is currently airing, he selects the show from a menu on Aereo\u2019s website. Aereo\u2019s system, which consists of thousands of small antennas and other equipment housed in a centralized warehouse, responds roughly as follows: A server tunes an antenna, which is dedicated to the use of one subscriber alone, to the broadcast carrying the selected show. A transcoder translates the signals received by the antenna into data that can be transmitted over the Internet. A server saves the data in a subscriber\\-specific folder on Aereo\u2019s hard drive and begins streaming the show to the subscriber\u2019s screen once several seconds of programming have been saved. The streaming continues, a few seconds behind the over\\-the\\-air broadcast, until the subscriber has received the entire show.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that Aereo infringed the copyright owner's exclusive right to transmit or communicate a work to the public.\n\n[Here is more background on this case from SCOTUSblog](http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/american-broadcasting-companies-inc-v-aereo-inc/).", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A startup company plans to launch a service that captures free-to-air satellite TV signals and redistributes them to subscribers over the internet.

Broad. Cos. v. Aereo, Inc.\nC) It's legal if the company obtains explicit permission from each individual broadcaster\nD) It's illegal only if the company charges subscribers for the service\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question directly relates to the Am.

The startup's proposed service closely mirrors Aereo's business model, which was found to infringe on copyright owners' exclusive right to transmit or communicate work to the public. \n\nOption A represents a common misconception that merely changing the delivery method (internet vs. satellite dish) would make the service legal. However, the Supreme Court ruled that the technological differences in how the signals are captured and retransmitted do not change the fundamental nature of the copyright infringement.\n\nOption C is a distractor that seems plausible but goes beyond the scope of the Aereo decision. While obtaining permission from broadcasters might potentially make such a service legal, it wasn't a factor in the Aereo case.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the Court's decision didn't hinge on whether Aereo charged for its service.

A trademark protected in France, say may well not be protected in the US and vice versa.\n\nDomain registration is a different thing, and are not necessarily tied to a trademark (although registering a domain that infringes an existing trademark will often be disallowed).\n\nThe [Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2012-02-25-en) (UDRP) is applied in disputes over the ownership of domain names. It states in section 2 that:\n\n> By applying to register a domain name, or by asking us to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby represent and warrant to us that (a) the statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; (b) to your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party; (c) you are not registering the domain name for an unlawful purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. It is your responsibility to determine whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone else's rights.\n\nIf you have registered a domain name, and another person or firm complains that the name is \"confusingly similar\" to an existing name or to a valid trademark, you might be required to participate in an arbitration proceeding under the UDRP, or else forfeit the registration. Note that noting happens if no one complains.\n\nSection 4(s) of the policy reads:\n\n> You are required to submit to a mandatory administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a \"complainant\") asserts ... that\n> \n> \n> * (i) your domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and\n> * (ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and\n> * (iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.\n> \n> \n> In the administrative proceeding, the complainant must prove that each of these three elements are present.\n\nNote that\n\n\"Bad faith\" can be shown by evidence that you obtained the domain for purposes of selling or renting it, not for use; that you intended ti prevent a valid trademark owner from obtaining the name, and have engaged in a pattern of such conduct; that your purpose was to disrupt the business of the other; that you intended to attract users who were looking for the other site.\n\nNote also that the complainant bears the burden of proof of the elements of the complaint, including the bad faith in use of a domain. Evidence of actual use for legitimate purposes will be relevant to this. But note that a valid trademark from any jurisdiction will be considered in a n arbitration under the policy, not just US marks.\n\nNote that an arbitration is not a court case, and court rules do not apply. But under section 4k of the policy:\n\n> The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded.\n\nSo the case may become a court case.\n\nIn an actual trademark case, the first user of the mark in the relevant jurisdiction often has a key advantage. In domain name disputes, this is less true. However, having had the name registered before it began to be used by a complainant can be evidence of lack of bad faith, which can be very important.\n\nThe UDRP is generally included in all contracts to register a domain name, so you are almost surely a party to this agreement already.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the provided documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A U.S.-based entrepreneur has owned and used a domain name for their business for 16 years, without a public web presence.

Which of the following statements most accurately describes the legal situation and potential outcomes?\n\nA) The entrepreneur has absolute rights to the domain due to prior registration and use in business.\nB) The European company's earlier European trademark gives them superior rights to the domain in the U.S.\nC) The case would likely be subject to UDRP arbitration, where the entrepreneur's lack of bad faith could be a strong defense.\nD) U.S. courts would automatically rule in favor of the European company due to their established brand recognition.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of domain name and trademark law. The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. The case would likely fall under the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), which governs many domain name disputes.\n\n2. In a UDRP proceeding, the complainant (European company) must prove three elements: the domain is identical or confusingly similar to their trademark, the registrant has no legitimate interests in the domain, and the domain was registered and is being used in bad faith.\n\n3. The entrepreneur's prior registration and business use of the domain for 16 years, predating the U.S. trademark, could be strong evidence against bad faith registration and use.\n\n4. The lack of public web presence doesn't negate the entrepreneur's legitimate interest if they've been using it for business purposes.\n\n5. While the European company has trademark rights, including in the U.S., this alone isn't sufficient to win a UDRP case without proving bad faith.\n\nA is incorrect because domain registration doesn't confer absolute rights, especially against trademark holders.

This doctrine allows law enforcement to enter a property without a warrant when there is an urgent need to prevent imminent danger to life or serious damage to property, or to prevent the imminent destruction of evidence.\n\nIn this case, several factors contribute to the exigent circumstances:\n\n1. The user admitted to overdosing on an illegal drug, indicating the presence of illegal substances in the home.\n2.

The situation was time-sensitive, as evidence (additional drugs) could be quickly destroyed or removed.\n\nWhile option B (plain view doctrine) might seem plausible, it typically applies to evidence visible from a lawful vantage point, not as justification for entering a premises. Option C (consent exception) is incorrect because implied consent in emergencies usually doesn't extend to allowing a full search of the premises. Option D (community caretaking function) is less applicable here as the primary concern was related to potential criminal activity and evidence preservation rather than general welfare checks.\n\nThe exigent circumstances doctrine provides the strongest legal basis for the actions taken, allowing for a warrantless entry to secure potential evidence and ensure public safety in the immediate aftermath of a drug-related medical emergency."}, "52": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/84500/can-the-police-make-it-a-crime-to-put-your-hands-in-your-pockets", "docs_id": 84500, "title": "Can the police make it a crime to put your hands in your pockets?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: [It is in the news](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/sep/20/met-handcuff-peaceful-anti-bolsonaro-protester-to-delight-of-brazils-far-right) that the police handcuffed a woman claiming she \"reached\" towards her pockets after being told not to.

The police have the power to enforce existing law, but not the power to create new crimes. Part of police power is the power to use force to enforce laws. If a person is trying to kill another (which is a crime), the police can use force to stop the person from committing this crime.\n\nPolice power can be statutorily encoded (Parliament passes a law saying what police can and cannot do), or it could be part of common law. As for laws regulating a suspect, there may be a specific statutory prohibition \u2013 \"you may not reach into your pocket\" \u2013 or there is a common law inference to be made, that if the police have the power to order you to not reach into your pocket you may be forced to comply.\n\nThe subtle distinction here is that if it is a crime to reach into your pocket when told not to, you can be prosecuted and imprisoned. If there is no such crime, you just have the consequence that you can be roughed up to some extent for disobeying the police order.\n\nOne act of Parliament is the [Offences against the Person Act 1861](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/24-25/100/section/38) \u00a738 which says\n\n> Whosoever . . . shall assault any person with intent to resist or\n> prevent the lawful apprehension or detainer of himself or of any other\n> person for any offence, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and being\n> convicted thereof shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to\n> be imprisoned for any term not exceeding two years,\n\nNB \"assault\" does not require physical contact: creating apprehension suffices. Another law is the [Police Act 1996](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/89) \u00a789 which says\n\n> Any person who resists or wilfully obstructs a constable in the\n> execution of his duty, or a person assisting a constable in the\n> execution of his duty, shall be guilty of an offence and liable on\n> summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month\n> or to a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale, or to both\n\nThese laws do not exhaustively list all of the things that are forbidden (e.g. they do not say \"may not bite. nor scratch, nor kick...\"), instead, the prohibitions fall under the general rubric of assault and resisting.\n\nUnder the circumstances, it is possible that the person could be criminally prosecuted, but even in lieu of a prosecution, it is strongly probable that the police use of force in this instance was lawful.

If the protester disregards this instruction and reaches for her pocket, which of the following legal implications is most accurate?\n\nA) The protester has committed a specific statutory offense of disobeying a police order\nB) The police can use reasonable force to restrain her, but she cannot be criminally charged for the pocket-reaching action alone\nC) The protester's action is protected under freedom of movement laws and cannot result in any consequences\nD) The officer must first issue a formal written warning before taking any physical action\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple legal concepts and their real-world application. The correct answer is B because:\n\n1. There is no specific statutory offense mentioned in the documentation for reaching towards one's pockets after being told not to by a police officer. This eliminates option A.\n\n2. However, the police do have the power to use reasonable force to enforce laws and maintain public safety. The Police Act 1996, Section 89, makes it an offense to willfully obstruct a constable in the execution of their duty.

Which of the following scenarios is most likely to be approved by the Landlord and Tenant Board?\n\nA) A 15% rent increase applied immediately, citing the high cost of renovations as justification\nB) A 3% above-guideline increase for three consecutive years, with proper documentation and tenant notification\nC) A 5% increase for security system costs, applied separately from capital expenditure increases\nD) A 10% increase phased in over two years, without a formal hearing process\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the rent increase guidelines and application process. Option B is the most likely to be approved because:\n\n1. The 3% limitation rule states that the maximum annual increase allowed for capital expenditures or security services is 3% above the guideline.\n2. When more than a 3% increase is justified, it can be taken in subsequent years, up to a maximum of two additional years at 3% each year.\n3. The landlord must follow proper procedures, including making an application to the Board at least 90 days before the effective date of the proposed rent increase.\n4. Documentation must be provided to tenants, and there's typically an oral hearing for capital expenditure-based increases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a 15% immediate increase far exceeds the allowed limits.

The correct answer is B because the documentation explains that the \"or later\" clause can be legally structured as a known agreement with conditional terms.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. It aligns with the principle that legislation stands on its own once enacted, independent of its authors.\n2.

The correct answer is C because:\n\n1. As stated in the documentation, marriages are controlled by state law, not federal immigration law. There is no automatic cancellation of marriage due to immigration violations or expired visas/green cards.\n\n2.

I am familiar with at least one setup where each cardholder is issued a card **in their own name** to be used as a charge card, pending reimbursement from central accounts for approved expenses.\n\nFor that organization, each cardholder is responsible for paying off their card balance each month (one can claim expenses mid\\-trip, if necessary), and failure to pay it off is a hit on their personal credit \\- which would explain why the bank needs the home address for each cardholder. Essentially, they have a card which is only authorized for official expenses, but any mistakes made (eg, improper charges, failing to file an expense report in a timely manner, etc) fall to the cardholder to remedy. I think this is meant to provide more incentive for proper management of funds, as they are also rather aggressive at searching out misconduct and fraud among those provided with charge cards.\n\nFor that organization, the answer to your second question (how can I stop that) would be to return the card to the credit card issuer. Doing so may not be without consequences. However, as I mentioned, each card which goes to an individual's address is also in that individuals name. The very few cards not associated with an individual are strictly limited and each charge more rigorously checked (eg, fleet cards used to refuel and maintain the vehicles, where the mileage is tracked to make sure someone isn't filling up their own car, too).

Agreement A delegates threshold questions such as the \"applicability, existence, scope, or validity\" of the agreement to the arbitrator. Agreement B does not.\n\nOne party goes to court and asks for a declaration that Agreement A is applicable to the arbitration and Agreement B is not, relying on the language of the agreements.

But if Agreement B is applicable, then the court has authority to decide the request, but the request is necessarily moot.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Judicial estoppel prevents a party from arguing two opposite positions\n> in separate proceedings. Is there a similar doctrine that applies to\n> argumentation in the same brief?\n\nNo.\n\nThe general rule is that a party is permitted to argue inconsistent positions in the alternative within a brief. When a party does so without expressly saying so, it is assumed that they are arguing in the alternative unless the party clearly indicates otherwise (and is just being illogical).\n\nBut the law in the context of arbitration is a special case that doesn't align perfectly with the general rule, and makes different distinctions sometimes.\n\nUnder the substantive law of arbitration clause validity, sometimes a party can be forced to arbitrate even if there is a possibility that the underlying contract is unenforceable, with the arbitrator making that decision. But, a party cannot be forced to arbitrate in every case where the validity of the underlying alleged agreement is in doubt, simply because an agreement, on its face, contains or references an arbitration agreement.\n\nUnder the Federal Arbitration Act, certain preliminary decisions are vested in the courts even if a written arbitration purports to provide otherwise, if a party choses to raise those issues. A dispute over which of two significantly different competing arbitration agreements applies to an issue between the parties could be such a circumstance.\n\nThus, a term that provides that \"delegates threshold questions such as the 'applicability, existence, scope, or validity' of the agreement to the arbitrator,\" is partially void as a matter of public policy under the Federal Arbitration Act, although some of its retains its validity.\n\nFor example, you can't delegate the question of the existence of an arbitration agreement to an arbitrator if that question is disputed, even if the contract says otherwise.\n\nIn arbitration cases, there is a rather elaborate jurisprudence governing what issues are for a court to decided and what are for an arbitrator to decision when the right of a party to arbitrate, and/or the validity of the underlying contract, are disputed, that makes some very fine distinctions between different kinds of arguments.\n\nFor example, if a party claims that he never had dealings with a party that presents an unsigned document that is a contract and also asserts that this party is bound to an arbitration agreement, that question can be decided by a court.\n\nBut, if a party signed an agreement with a plain vanilla arbitration clause but claims it is unenforceable because it was induced by duress or undue influence, the arbitration will usually go forward with the arbitrator deciding the validity of the contract.\n\nWhen a decision is decided by a court, or by an arbitrator, is not easily summarized or manifestly obvious without a review of the relevant case law which is voluminous and intricate. *See, e.g., Samson v.

For example, if the good not yet purchased was damaged through the negligence of the buyer, or was custom built for the buyer, the risk of loss would be on the buyer due to exceptions to the general rule. The cause of the damage would also matter in terms of analysis of the buyer's warranty rights that might be setoff against a claim from the seller.

The key issue is determining who bears the risk of loss for goods damaged after selection but before purchase. The applicable rule, derived from the Uniform Commercial Code, states that risk of loss passes upon transfer of title, which occurs at the time of actual sale. \n\nIn this case, despite the customer's selection and handling of the item, an actual sale had not yet occurred.

As the person who owns the actual photos, what are my rights? Do I own the copyright, and if I post them online, do people need permission from me to use them? Thanks.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The only way you could own the copyright (as a non\\-creator) is if you have purchased or inherited that right. You might have inherited the right to a photo taken by Aunt Tillie, but there would have to be an explicit transfer of ownership of the right from the former owner to you.\n\nFailing that, the question is what the copyright status of the photo is. The first question is whose law you are dealing with: US? UK? France? Under US law, there is a higher probability that copyright has expired. Assume these are US photos. Then the next question is whether the photo was published: let's assume it was not (it if had been published that could work to your advantage because but you would have to prove that it was published). Then you must determine whether it was registered: again, assume it was not. The point is that copyright could have expired under certain conditions, under US law. Unregistered unpublished works are protected according to the provisions of [\u00a7302 of US copyright law](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/302) (as specified in [\u00a7303](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/303)), where the rule is \"70 years after the author's death\". Then you have to know when the author (photographer) died. If it was before 1949, the work is not protected by copyright.\n\nIn short, you have to know a lot of facts about a work, in order to be able to know whether it is still protected.

The correct answer is B because it addresses two critical factors: the creation date of the works and the death of the authors. \n\nUnder US copyright law, for unpublished and unregistered works, copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years.

The correct answer is D because it accurately reflects the nuanced legal situation described in the documentation.\n\nThe key points to consider are:\n\n1. Minors do have First Amendment rights, especially in public schools, as established by Tinker v. Des Moines.\n2. However, schools can restrict speech if they can demonstrate \"substantial interference with school discipline or the rights of others.\"\n3. The Schoenecker v. Koopman case specifically dealt with Second Amendment-supportive apparel in schools, finding that vague allegations of disruption were insufficient to justify restrictions.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the school's demand may indeed be unconstitutional, immediate lawsuit is not necessarily the most appropriate first step. Legal action should typically be a last resort after attempting to resolve the issue through other means.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it overstates the school's authority. Schools do not have \"unlimited\" power to restrict student speech, as evidenced by the Tinker standard.\n\nOption C is incorrect because it misrepresents the rights of minors.

It might get you into trouble in a divorce proceeding, but the laws that still exist addressing it are largely dead letters.\n\nI assume you're asking more about polygamy, or having more than one one spouse at a time. I was surprised to learn that there hasn't been much activity in this area since [*Obergefell*](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/14-556/opinion3.html), at least not a lot that has led to development of the arguments you're asking for.\n\nThe most on\\-point case I can find is [*Collier v. Fox,* No. CV 15\\-83\\-BLG\\-SPW\\-TJC, 2018 WL 1247411 (D. Mont. Feb. 22, 2018\\)](https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20180312b26), where a married couple and another woman sued the state because its criminal and civil laws prohibited the second woman from entering into the marriage. The court tossed the challenge to the criminal prohibition based on the parties' standing, saying that there was not a sufficient threat of criminal prosecution, and it dismissed the challenge to the civil restrictions based on [*Reynolds v. U.S.*, 98 U.S. 145 (1878\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/98/145/case.html), where the Supreme Court said that each state has the right \"to determine whether polygamy or monogamy shall be the law of social life under its dominion.\"\n\nThere was no appeal, so the decision was never reviewed.\n\nThe only other case I've seen directly challenging the laws was [*Sevier v. Thompson*, No. 2:16\\-CV\\-659\\-DN\\-EJF, 2018 WL 1378803 (D. Utah Jan. 26, 2018\\)](https://ecf.utd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?216cv0659-109), where some anti\\-gay activists tried to overturn *Obergefell* by suing to force Utah to let one of them marry a computer and three of them marry each other. If you can't guess how this ends, I'll tell you that it does not end well. The plaintiffs all admitted that they didn't actually want the relief they were asking for, so the court threw the case out on standing.\n\nThe same dude also tried to intervene in a lawsuit ([*United States v. North Carolina*, No. 1:16CV425, 2016 WL 7335627 (M.D.N.C. Dec. 16, 2016\\)]](https://ecf.utd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_public_doc?216cv0659-109)) over the North Carolina bathroom bill, saying that a man trying to marry a machine or marry multiple people belonged in the same category as a man trying to marry a man or a man who identifies as a woman. I'm sure you won't be surprised to learn that the court told him to go to hell again. \n\nBecause these were all tossed at the very early stages, there wasn't much development of the arguments for or against polygamy, though it was clear that everyone was basically talking about an extension of *Obergefell*'s recognition that \"the right to marry is a fundamental right inherent in the liberty of the person.\" \n\nThere have been several scholarly articles, though, addressing the issue. A few that popped up include:\n\n* A [Yale law professor](https://www.cardozo.yu.edu/sites/default/files/Stein.UMKC_.2016_0.pdf) considering whether plural\\-marriage bans could survive a challenge based on equal protection rather than due process;\n* A [Loyola Marymount professor](http://docplayer.net/69251569-Down-the-slippery-slope-does-the-fundamental-right-to-marry-protect-polygamous-marriage.html) reviewed several post\\-*Obergefell* books considering the future of plural marriage and concludes that (1\\) Western condemnation of plural marriage is strongly informed by racism and xenophobia, (2\\) legal reactions against plural marriage may do more to harm the people they are meant to protect, and (3\\) whatever benefits may accompany plural marriage, banning it does not entail the same kinds of harms as bans on gay marriage; and\n* A William \\& Mary law student [published an article](http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol24/iss2/7/) running through the different ways a court might analyze the question and argued that Obergefell should generally permit polygamy, regardless of which test a court applies.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a challenging multiple-choice question that meets the specified criteria:\n\nQuestion: Following the Obergefell v.

Likewise, the historical rule for transfer of real property before ownership registration was established for it, was \"signed, sealed, and delivered\" meaning that a deed had to be signed by the seller, notarized, and delivered to the buyer or the buyer's agent, for title to be transferred.\nGenerally speaking, when property is represented by an ownership certificate or is intangible, transfer of the certificate or relevant document, rather than physical possession, governs transfer of title (before real property records were formalized and bureaucratized, one had to deliver constructive possession of real property with \"livery of seisen\" by handing over a rock or dirt or twig from the real property to the buyer to signify delivery of possession of real property, the modern equivalent of which would have been to hand over keys to a building).\n\nBut, the Finance Act and the associated regulations and forms seem to make clear that you need to have both parties, rather than merely the seller (under this historical rule and the rule in most U.S. jurisdictions), sign the relevant form to transfer title.\n\n> The question is, at what point does the car actually become mine?

There is probably a \"tail\" provision that extends the previous owner's insurance coverage until the registration is processed if it is processed within a reasonable time. But, I don't have the full text of an Irish car insurance policy contract at my disposal to review in order to confirm that fact.\n\nYou could probably read the terms of your current car insurance policy contract, if you have one, and determine the answer, as this is likely to be effectively uniform for all car insurance policies in Ireland.\n\nOr, as @chepnor notes in the comments, \"if you call your insurance company ahead of time and tell them you will be purchasing the car.

Here it is (emphasis mine):\n\n> Every one commits an offence who, knowing that a recording was obtained by the commission of \\[a voyeurism offence], prints, **copies**, publishes, distributes, circulates, sells, advertises or makes available the recording, or has the recording in his or her possession for the purpose of printing, **copying**, publishing, distributing, circulating, selling or advertising it or making it available.\n\nYour question (3\\) is definitely illegal, questions (1\\) \\& (2\\) I believe come down to the interpretation of the word \"copy.\" If this was copyright law, I wouldn't hesitate to say that both are illegal (since browsing on the internet creates at least a temporary copy on your computer). However, interpreting copying in this way seems to set it apart from the other activities in this list. The list instead seems focused on preventing dissemination, or more broadly preventing someone from \"spreading,\" or potentially spreading the original recording.\n\nIn that sense, I don't think (1\\) is illegal since you aren't actively spreading the original recording, the fact that a transient copy is being made is an incidental technical detail and I think doesn't fit the legislative intent as demonstrated by the other actions in the given list (though the internet host is clearly distributing a recording to you and is themself committing a 162(4\\) offence).

The correct answer, C, is the most promising strategy because:\n\n1. The top answer emphasizes the need to \"prove that clinical mistakes were made,\" which can potentially be done by scrutinizing the original report.\n\n2. Option A is incorrect because current mental state doesn't prove anything about past conditions, as mentioned in the answer: \"your friend's mental state has now changed and it is likely impossible for another psychologist to determine what it was at the time.\"\n\n3. Option B, while potentially helpful, is less likely to succeed without concrete evidence of malpractice or procedural errors.\n\n4. Option D is problematic because character witnesses' recollections from years ago would be considered less reliable than professional documentation.\n\n5. Analyzing the original report (option C) could potentially reveal \"evidence that the psychologist and/or social workers lied or made mistakes,\" which the top answer suggests might be necessary for a successful challenge.\n\nThis question tests critical thinking by requiring integration of multiple concepts: the difficulty of proving past mental states, the primacy of professional documentation in legal challenges, and the need for concrete evidence of errors rather than subjective arguments.

As long as you are not in occupation after the end of the tenancy (which means moving out *before* it ends), that's it. For example, [this page from Shelter](http://england.shelter.org.uk/legal/security_of_tenure/assured_shorthold_tenancies/ending_an_assured_shorthold_tenancy/how_to_end_an_assured_shorthold_tenancy) says:\n\n> The general rule is that the tenant can leave on the last day of a fixed\\-term tenancy without giving notice, and this will end the tenancy.\\[2] If the tenant remains even a day longer than the last day of a fixed\\-term tenancy, a statutory periodic assured shorthold tenancy will arise, which the tenant can end by serving a valid notice to quit.\n> \n> \n> \\[2] Right d. Flower v. Darby (1786\\) 1 T.R. 159; Cobb v Stokes (1807\\) 8 East 358\\.\n\nThis is extremely bad news for landlords, who don't (necessarily) get any notice that they have a void. In general, I would say you ought to give a month's notice (full disclosure, I am a landlord), on the other hand, if they haven't fulfilled their responsibilities perhaps not (but you may have an exaggerated idea of their responsibilities).\n\nIf you do this, don't expect to get a good reference from your landlord! (Which is going to make it harder to find somewhere else to live). You should also anticipate difficulties in recovering your deposit (you are legally entitled to it back, but that doesn't mean your landlord can't be difficult about it \\- possibly even requiring you to sue for it).\n\n---\n\nI have just noticed the second part of your question.\n\nIf you do nothing (in other words, stay in residence), at the end of your Assured Shorthold Tenancy you will switch to a periodic tenancy. The landlord can't force you to switch to another six\\-month contract, but on the other hand, if you *don't*, they are perfectly entitled to give you two months notice. If they are smart, they will give you this notice *now*, so that you can only stay for two months on the periodic tenancy.\n\nNote that the letting agent has an incentive to get you and the landlord to sign another contract (they can charge the landlord a fee for it), so they may not be being entirely honest about whether a periodic tenancy is an option. (On the other hand, a poor landlord may be more interested in locking a tenant in for six months.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Based on the given documentation, here's a high-quality multiple-choice question:\n\nQuestion: A tenant in the UK is nearing the end of their six-month Assured Shorthold Tenancy (AST). The landlord has not fulfilled some responsibilities, and the letting agent claims another six-month contract is mandatory. The tenant's contract states, \"The Tenant is obligated to give notice in writing to vacate the property 1 full tenancy month before the last date of their contract.\" Given this scenario, which course of action best balances the tenant's rights with potential consequences?\n\nA) Leave without notice on the last day of the fixed-term, citing the landlord's unfulfilled responsibilities\nB) Give one month's notice as per the contract clause, but negotiate for a periodic tenancy\nC) Agree to another six-month contract to avoid potential legal issues\nD) Remain in the property without action, automatically transitioning to a periodic tenancy\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: This question requires analysis of multiple aspects of the situation and application of legal knowledge. Option B is the most balanced approach for several reasons:\n\n1. While the tenant legally doesn't need to give notice at the end of a fixed-term AST (as stated in the Shelter guidance), the contract does include a clause requiring one month's notice. Although this clause might not be legally enforceable, ignoring it entirely (as in option A) could lead to disputes and difficulties in recovering the deposit or obtaining a reference.\n\n2. Giving notice shows good faith and professionalism, which can be beneficial for future rentals, even if the landlord hasn't fully met their responsibilities.\n\n3. Negotiating for a periodic tenancy addresses the letting agent's claim about another fixed-term being mandatory, which is not true. The tenant has the right to transition to a periodic tenancy if they remain in the property.\n\n4. This approach avoids the potential negatives of option A (no notice), the unnecessary commitment of option C (another fixed-term), and the passivity of option D (which could result in the landlord serving a two-month notice immediately).\n\n5. It allows the tenant to maintain their rights while minimizing potential conflicts, balancing legal entitlements with practical considerations like references and deposit returns.\n\nThis solution requires critical thinking about the interplay between legal rights, contractual obligations, and real-world consequences, making it a suitable L3+ question on Bloom's taxonomy."}, "99": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/1770/being-paid-for-preparation-time", "docs_id": 1770, "title": "Being Paid for Preparation Time", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The question:\nIf I am missing time at work, and spending free time, to do research to free myself from a 'crime' I didn't commit, can I sue 'the plaintiff'?\n\nThe background:\nA rental car company is accusing me of doing \\~2000 dollars worth of damage to the locks on one of their cars, they said that I must have locked myself out and trashed the door trying to break in.\n\nI have hours of footage of the car in the hotel lot where I parked it, pictures showing the car in the condition it was returned, and the car was inspected when dropped off.

The correct answer, C, is the most appropriate and legally sound approach because:\n\n1. Gathering evidence (such as footage, pictures, and inspection reports) is crucial for disputing the claim.\n2. Sending a formal dispute letter is a necessary step in documenting the customer's position and giving the company a chance to rectify the situation.\n3. Reporting to consumer protection agencies is a measured response that can create pressure on the company without immediately resorting to legal action.\n\nOption A is incorrect because suing for lost wages and emotional distress would likely be premature and difficult to prove at this stage. Option B is inappropriate as filing a police report for fraud would require clear evidence of intentional deception, which isn't established yet. Option D is also premature, as small claims court should typically be a last resort after other attempts to resolve the dispute have failed.\n\nThis question tests the ability to analyze a complex situation, understand legal and consumer rights, and choose the most appropriate course of action based on the given information and common legal practices."}}
