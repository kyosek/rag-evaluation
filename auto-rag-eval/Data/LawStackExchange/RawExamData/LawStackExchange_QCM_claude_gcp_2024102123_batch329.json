Don't criminal cases vary significantly in complexity? How is this addressed with respect to public defender compensation?\n\n(1\\) as opposed to \"per defendant\", but that's besides the point.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The answer depends on the jurisdiction, the court, and how the public defender system is set up. This answer addresses state court indigent defense at the trial level.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, state courts are organized by counties. In many of these counties, particularly larger and urban counties, public defenders are a department of county government (like the district attorneys who prosecute, or public works, or the tax assessor). These defenders are county employees, and paid a wage. They are not compensated \"by the case.\"\n\nIn other jurisdictions, there may be no county\\-level public defenders. Courts there will appoint private attorneys to defend indigent defendants, and will compensate the defenders pursuant to a fee schedule promulgated by the court, or the judge's whim. The fee schedule may be time\\-based or flat fee, and usually provides differentials for type of case, amount of time required, investigative and witness fees, and often allows the lawyer to seek additional compensation if the lawyer thinks it's warranted. The court may decline the lawyer's motion, of course, at the risk that the lawyer won't take future appointments, a serious difficulty for the court which must, under the law, provide counsel for indigent defendants who face incarceration.\n\nMore than this, it's tough to generalize. The setup in Los Angeles County, California, for instance, will be different than the experience in Alliance, NE, or a small county in another state.\n\nThe same challenges face the federal courts. I'm only familiar with the California federal courts at the trial level, where a parallel system applies, with defenders on salary and employed by the federal government.\n\nWhile some states provide representation on appeal using defenders employed by the state government, other states rely on individual lawyers being appointed, rather like the trial\\-level system.\n\nSource: I'm a prior county public defender and private attorney in California."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A newly appointed judge in a rural county is tasked with revising the compensation system for court-appointed attorneys representing indigent defendants.

I find *proper means* to be a bit vague here. Take the following scenario;\n\nIn my country (Norway), it is illegal to cut power to someone who isn't paying their electrical bills if a resident is a minor.\n\nIn a minor\\-free residence, a company making the threat \"if you don't pay up, we will cut your power\", satisfies (a) and (b). However, if they make the same threat to a residence that houses a minor, (a) is still satisfied. As for (b), I am not quite sure; is threatening to do something illegal an \"improper\" way of inforcing the demand? It wouldn't surprise me, but I interpreted \"proper\" more to mean, \"the thing you're threatening to do is the best way of maximizing the likelihood that you get what you want\". If this interpretation is correct, then it would be improper for the company to orally deliver the threat to a resident that is blind, deaf and at the moment of deliverance, without other people to relay the message. It is improper, because the use of the menaces weren't the best way; heck, not a way at all; to inforce the demand.\n\nHowever, maybe legality is a criterium for the use of menaces to be proper? A threat requires there to be the promise of a harm or loss to a person or their property. However, when the person fail to pay the electrical bills, the electricity running to their house is no longer their property. So, when the company says they'll cut the power to this minor\\-housing residence, they aren't threatening them (since they don't own the electricity anymore), but they are saying that they'll do something illegal. Does the fact that the act of which they're saying they'll do is illegal, make their speech constitute threats, and thus their act constitute extortion?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: In Washington state, the term \"threat\" is [defined](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.110) as follows:\n\n> \"Threat\" means to communicate, directly or indirectly the intent: (a)\n> To cause bodily injury in the future to the person threatened or to\n> any other person; or (b) To cause physical damage to the property of a\n> person other than the actor; or (c) To subject the person threatened\n> or any other person to physical confinement or restraint; or (d) To\n> accuse any person of a crime or cause criminal charges to be\n> instituted against any person; or (e) To expose a secret or publicize\n> an asserted fact, whether true or false, tending to subject any person\n> to hatred, contempt, or ridicule; or (f) To reveal any information\n> sought to be concealed by the person threatened; or (g) To testify or\n> provide information or withhold testimony or information with respect\n> to another's legal claim or defense; or (h) To take wrongful action as\n> an official against anyone or anything, or wrongfully withhold\n> official action, or cause such action or withholding; or (i) To bring\n> about or continue a strike, boycott, or other similar collective\n> action to obtain property which is not demanded or received for the\n> benefit of the group which the actor purports to represent; or (j) To\n> do any other act which is intended to harm substantially the person\n> threatened or another with respect to his or her health, safety,\n> business, financial condition, or personal relationships;\n\nHowever, the illegality of a \"threat\" comes from specific statutes declaring a particular type of threat to be illegal, and a statute may require a narrower set of conditions, for instance [RCW 9\\.61\\.160](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.61.160) which is a class B felony (second most severe degree) requires that a person specifically threaten to\n\n> bomb or otherwise injure any public or private school building, any\n> place of worship or public assembly, any governmental property, or any\n> other building, common carrier, or structure, or any place used for\n> human occupancy...\n\nA misdemeanor variety of threatening (legally subsumed under the rubric [\"harrassment\"](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9A.46.020)) if you knowingly and without lawful authority threaten\n\n> (i) To cause bodily injury immediately or in the future to the person\n> threatened or to any other person; or (ii) To cause physical damage to\n> the property of a person other than the actor; or (iii) To subject the\n> person threatened or any other person to physical confinement or\n> restraint; or (iv) Maliciously to do any other act which is intended\n> to substantially harm the person threatened or another with respect to\n> his or her physical or mental health or safety\n\nAs it happens, in Seattle, it was until the end of February to evict a tenant for non\\-payment of rent: but it was not illegal to communicate an intent to evict (it was simply legally futile to do so). Such a communication doesn't fall within the scope of harrassment\\-type threats because it does not damage person or property, or to confine a person. A fanciful interpretation of clause (iv) is precluded because the \"threat\" must be \"malicious\", which by definition\n\n> import\\[s] an evil intent, wish, or design to vex, annoy, or injure\n> another person. Malice may be inferred from an act done in willful\n> disregard of the rights of another, or an act wrongfully done without\n> just cause or excuse, or an act or omission of duty betraying a\n> willful disregard of social duty\n\nwhereas the intent is plainly to collect past\\-due rent.

While the landlord has a legitimate claim for unpaid rent, the methods threatened (shutting off utilities and changing locks) are illegal forms of \"self-help\" eviction in Washington state. Even though demanding rent payment itself is legal, threatening illegal actions to enforce the demand makes this communication unlawful.\n\nOption A is incorrect because, while the threat doesn't fit some of the more serious categories in Washington's threat definition, it likely falls under section (j) of the definition, which includes acts intended to harm someone's financial condition.\n\nOption B is incorrect because shutting off utilities or changing locks doesn't necessarily cause physical damage to property.\n\nOption C is incorrect because, although the landlord may have reasonable grounds for demanding rent, the legality of the demand doesn't justify threatening illegal actions to enforce it.\n\nThe question tests understanding of the nuances in threat and harassment laws, particularly in the context of landlord-tenant relationships and the limits of enforcing legitimate claims."}, "3": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/85994/why-do-us-lawmakers-attach-amendments-to-the-us-constitution-instead-of-directly", "docs_id": 85994, "title": "Why do US lawmakers attach amendments to the US Constitution instead of directly changing its text?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The US Constitution now has [27 amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_amendments_to_the_United_States_Constitution). I noticed that these amendments are \"attachments\" to the original US Constitution. Why don't the constitutional amendments directly modify the text of the original US Constitution? This seems to be different from how other laws are modified, where bills propose to modify the text of existing laws. Is there a legal or historical reason for this?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The best explanation is \"tradition\", followed by \"Congress does *not* actually rewrite laws\" (it passes laws whose effect changes what counts as the law). Traditionally, Congress would enact some law, then it could later enact a law which effectively modifies existing laws. That modification could be implicit, by stating a new legal fact, which \"corrects\" some earlier legal fact. For instance, the [6th Congress](https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/amlaw/lwsllink.html) enacted a law (session I, p. 4: Ch. III in second volume) entitled \"An Act supplementary to the act, intituled 'An Act to provide for the valuation of Lands and Dwelling Houses, and the enumeration of slaves, within the United States'\", which was enacted by the 5th Congress Ch. LXIX, p. 580\\. The amendment added a power to the commissioners created by the first act \"to revise, adjust and vary valuations\". This is done by simply stating a new power, and does not require re\\-writing the entire earlier text \u2013 it was understood that the new act \"overrides\" the old act.\n\nContemporary statutory practice (as opposed to constitutional practice) is that congressional acts which revise older laws will state, in some fashion, how the previous law should be edited. Officially speaking, the law \"is\" the historical sequence of acts of Congress and therefore Congress does not actually rewrite laws (except on some occasions where it does).\n\nAn example of an editing instruction enacted by Congress is an amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act which states that\n\n> (n) IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT.\u2014 (1\\) Section 411(b) of the\n> Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1521(b)) is amended by\n> striking \"and under the general policy guidance of the United States\n> Coordinator for Refugee Affairs (hereinafter in this chapter referred\n> to as the 'Coordinator')\" and inserting \"the Secretary of State\".\n\nIt is very difficult to keep track of the hundred of thousands of acts of Congress making up the Statutes at Large, therefore we also have the US Code system which effectuates the various historical changes. For the most part, the codified (re\\-written) laws accurately reflect the complex sequence of statutes passed by Congress. though there was a whoops\\-moment when\nThe Act of Sept. 7, 1916, 39 Stat. 753 [\u00a792](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/12/92) was omitted from inclusion of the US Code because it was mistakenly thought that that section had been repealed ([sorted out](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/508/439/) in 1993\\).\n\nGiven how few and how autonomous the amendments to the US Constitution have been, there is no compelling need to adopt a \"wholesale rewrite\" model of amendments for the Constitution, though the election of POTUS is one area where it might make sense to delete previous text (still, it's not difficult to read the whole document, as opposed to reading the entirety of the Statutes at Large).\n\nA wholesale rewriting of the US Constitution *is* possible, and [happened in 1787](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation).

As such I'm not demanding a perfectly definitive answer, I suspect there is no absolute answer, I'm more asking to better understand how choice of law decisions are made by applying a very specific use case I have run into not trying to get legal advice on rather or not to use such contracts.\n\nI already asked, and got a pretty good answer, on the generalities of how choice of law are applied [here](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/77757/if-one-state-respects-a-contract-and-another-doesnt-how-do-we-know-if-it-will-b/77763#77763). I think I understand the generalities, but I'm not sure which state has the more substantial claim in case of child support and what constitutes a 'public policy' strong enough for a forum state to refuse to respect the other states precedent.\n\nSo to give context known sperm donors are a thing, where a man agrees to donate sperm to a women without involving a doctor, to cut down on the extensive cost of doctor involvement. Generally it's agreed that a women will give up any claim to child support, and the donor give up on visitation rights, as part of this agreement. However, this will not always be supported by state law. In California donor contracts are fully supported, and there are a few states that explicitly do not support these contracts, the general claim is usually that a parent cannot sign away the child's rights to financial support or visitation, and the vast majority of states don't have any precedent either way. Given this the general advice given is usually that recipients should always get contracts 'just in case', and that donors should always understand that there is no guarantee such a contract will provide any legal protection, unless they all happen to live in CA obviously.\n\nGiven all that It makes me curious what happens if one person were lived in CA, the only state that definitely supports these contracts, and another person lived in a state that explicitly does not support these contracts what will happen? Can the people signing the contract simply say \"CA law applies\" and be certain their covered? Or is it possible that if the case is brought in the other state that state will refuse to respect this because they consider the signing away of child support to be violating it's public policy.\n\nTo further complicate things while it's possible to sign a contract in person and do the donation the same way it's also possible for donor sperm to be shipped across state lines, meaning that there may not be any clear answer as to where the contract was sign or the donation took place since both acts happened across state lines.\n\nSo, what is the probability that one could ensure CA law applies under these sort of circumstances? and if someone didn't explicitly state what state's laws should apply how would they decide which state's laws should apply?\n\nIf one person lived in a state without clear precedent and another in a state with a clear precedent would the fact that one state's laws are more explicit be a factor in deciding who should handle the dispute?\n\nI'm mostly asking about child support being signed away, as claims against donors for child support are far more common then donors trying to force visitation, sometimes states will even force recipients who didn't want to claim child support to do so before they can get other forms of disability/welfare. Still I am curious if the rules would be any different for a dispute over visitation then for child support.\n\nI'm also assuming the sperm donation was through artificial insemination done at home.

The court will look at XE law and decide if there are elements of (or the entire) contract that are invalid under XE law. This might be because XE law contains certain provisions with a \u201cno contracting out\u201d clause or because the particular contract is against public policy in XE. If there are, those elements of the contract will be excised and what remains, if anything, will have CA law applied to it.\n\nThe legal principle here is that contracts are made *under* the law and that, if a XE court decides it has jurisdiction then XE law applies *around* the contract but CA law applies *within* the contract \\- for want of better terms."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A sperm donor from California (which supports donor contracts) enters into a contract with a recipient from State X (which does not support such contracts).

This means the minor could choose to enforce or void the guarantee if the company were to be wound up before they turn 18.

It starts by saying\n\n> YOU ARE COMMANDED to produce at the time, date, and place set forth\n> below the following books, papers,documents, data, or other objects\n\nIt is basically irrelevant how many nanoseconds it takes to obtain the data being subpoenaed. Legally relevant variables are (1\\) whether a motion to quash the subpoena is filed \u2013 if so, step 1 takes a long time, (2\\) whether the ISP is cooperative or not. Apparent non\\-cooperation by the ISP can take many forms, for example they may be mostly cooperative but they receive thousands of subpoenas every day and it takes a few days to get to any particular subpoena. Alternatively, the ISP may be actively resistant and file motions, which will delay the process. Other variables are the \"caution\" used by the ISP (verifying the LEA, method of supplying the results, extent of the search actually required, e.g. \"all users in the Atlanta airport\" versus \"this residential user\"). If the specified due date is unreasonable, the ISP can make the case in court; if they don't comply in a timely fashion, they might be found in contempt, but that is not automatic. There might also be a jurisdiction\\-specific timeline.\n\nWhat you want is not a legal answer, but an empirically\\-derived \"typical timeframe\".\n\nAs for why an ISP would require a subpoena or resist police requests for information, there are numerous political reasons (either they resist the government's underlying agenda, or they know that over\\-voluntary compliance will be unpopular and detrimental to their business). The main legal reason is that they may have a contractual duty to protect customers' information to the full extent of the law. They will never have a legal obligation to violate the law to protect information, so ultimately they will have to give in if their motion to quash is not granted. In the US, there is no obligation to delete data, but there may be such an obligation in other jurisdictions, so there's possibly a complex interaction between subpoena law and GDPR in the EU, which is a separate question."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: When law enforcement requests subscriber information from an Internet Service Provider (ISP) via subpoena, which of the following factors is LEAST likely to significantly impact the time it takes for the ISP to respond?\n\nA) The ISP filing a motion to quash the subpoena\nB) The technical complexity of the search required to find the requested information\nC) The number of nanoseconds it takes to retrieve the data from the ISP's database\nD) The ISP's level of cooperation and existing backlog of subpoena requests\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because filing a motion to quash can significantly delay the process, potentially leading to lengthy legal proceedings.\n\nB is incorrect as the complexity of the search (e.g., finding a specific user vs. all users in a large area) can impact the time required to fulfill the request.\n\nC is correct because the actual time it takes to retrieve the data once located is typically negligible compared to other factors.

There is a question over at [Travel Stack Exchange](https://travel.stackexchange.com) that makes it clear that some Schengen countries do not stamp the documents of third\\-country nationals who have a residence permit from a Schengen country: [Which Schengen countries don't stamp passports of ordinary residence permit holders?](https://travel.stackexchange.com/q/157743/19400)\n\nThe stamping requirement is stated thus:\n\n> 1. The travel documents of third\\-country nationals shall be systematically stamped on entry and exit. In particular an entry or exit stamp shall be affixed to:\n> \n> \n> (a) the documents, bearing a valid visa, enabling third\\-country nationals to cross the border;\n> \n> \n> (b) the documents enabling third\\-country nationals to whom a visa is issued at the border by a Member State to cross the border;\n> \n> \n> (c) the documents enabling third\\-country nationals not subject to a visa requirement to cross the border.\n\n(There are some additional provisions that do not apply to the hypothetical circumstances under discussion contained in 11(2\\) through 11(5\\). I would note that a \"residence permit\" is distinct for these purposes from the \"residence card\" provided for in the free movement directive [2004/38/EC](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02004L0038-20110616).)\n\nIt is perhaps to be argued that \"third\\-country nationals not subject to a visa requirement\" includes residence permit holders who would need a visa if they didn't have a residence permit, but let us assume for the sake of argument that it does not. In that case, none of the examples enumerated in 11(1\\) covers those people. But none of the subsequent exceptions covers them either. It would seem therefore that the general requirement established in the first sentence of 11(1\\) should apply to them.\n\nSome countries appear to have concluded the contrary: that because such people are not covered by the \"in particular\" list in 11(1\\), their passports do not need to be stamped.

Simply, there is some space left for some unusual cases which have not even been identified yet.\n\nTherefore, arguing that passports of third\\-country citizens with residence card (not Article 10, 20 of EU 2004/38/EC) shall/may not be stamped because it does not fall into \"in particular\" is according to me not correct. On the contrary, travel documents of third\\-country citizens shall always be stamped as long as it is technically possible (maybe even on a separate paper given by border guards like visa is special cases).\n\nBtw. At Madrid Barajas airport, they stamp even passport of EU citizens. Once we entered via Madrid Barajas with a group of 20 of reduced mobility with assistance (my wife injured her leg). They took passports of the whole group, my wife gave them new passport, old passport, residence card (Article 10 EU 2004/38/EC) in a passport format. Eventually, she got stamps in all 3 documents. Meaning that they did not even count number of \"passports\" and people and they did not care that my wife and me were exempt of stamps.

The phrase \"in particular\" indicates that the list provides examples but does not limit the application of the general rule.

Do I simply need to state that IP addresses are logged but are deleted after a week? Not sure if there is anything else that needs to be included, specifically for GDPR. As the user is choosing to send me an email, do I need to state anything about the email communication between us both)?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: When you collect or process personal data, you must provide information to data subjects. The required information is listed in Art 13 GDPR, though most privacy notice also include the items from Art 14 GDPR (if there are third party data sources) and Art 15 GDPR (which simplifies responses to data subject access requests). The ICO has provided detailed explanation and a checklist [here](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-be-informed/). The list seems fairly long, but for such a simple site it will mostly be boilerplate.\n\nNote that if you engage third parties to process personal data on your behalf, you need to sign a data processing agreement with them. This may be a separate document or may be part of the normal terms of service, but must fulfil the requirements in Art 28 GDPR. Importantly, the data processor must only use the data as instructed by you, and not for their own purposes.\n\nThat the logs are routed through US servers is very unfortunate since this is an international transfer of personal data. Such transfers are allowed, provided that there are suitable safeguards. The Privacy Shield was considered a safeguard, but in 2020 was ruled to be invalid due to concerns about mass surveillance and the rule of law in the US. Any notices about Privacy Shield in your hoster's documentation are of purely historical significance. Transfers can continue if there's another safeguard, such as Standard Contractual Clauses. However, SCCs are ineffective if the recipient can't legally comply with them. If it was impossible for an US\\-based company to provide for an adequate level of data protection under Privacy Shield, they likely won't be legally able to sign SCCs as well. This can be fixed by supplemental security measures such as end\\-to\\-end encryption, but that's not really feasible in a cloud context.\n\nAll of this is a complicated way of saying: you can either find another hoster that doesn't transfer personal data into the US, or adopt an interpretation that the Schrems II case doesn't apply to your circumstances. My personal non\\-lawyer opinion is that while the first solution is obviously the correct one, a risk analysis could indicate that a purely static site (that does not process any personal data other than the necessary connection data) is of such low risk that the transfers may continue for the meanwhile. But this is a bet on the ICO's goodwill.\n\nThe privacy notice on your website must first deal with processing activities relating to the website. It's OK if you don't explain how you'll process emails. For a portfolio site, there might be an argument that email communication is out of scope for the GDPR, since nearly all communication would be of purely personal nature."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A UK-based individual is creating a personal website hosted by a US company with servers in Europe.

Even for a simple personal website, GDPR compliance requires a comprehensive privacy notice. This notice should include details about data processing activities (including IP address logging), information about third-party involvement (the hosting company), and crucially, information about international data transfers, especially given the complexities introduced by the invalidation of the EU-US Privacy Shield. The notice should also cover the requirements outlined in GDPR Articles 13, 14, and 15. Additionally, the website owner needs to consider the implications of data being routed through US servers and potentially find alternative hosting solutions or adopt appropriate safeguards.

What if there is difference in how money laundering is defined in Colombia and in Netherlands, or a difference in what constitutes legally obtained funds? Are Colombian citizens supposed to know and obey Dutch law?\n\nI could understand this if Binance were a Dutch company, and/or if they included in their ToS a clause like \"all disputes between the Conpany and the Customer will be decided according to the Dutch law by Dutch courts\". But this is not the case \\- ToS mention law of Hong Kong (<https://www.binance.com/en/terms> , section X.2\\)\n\nSo the main question is: on what basis could the Dutch claim their jurisdiction? Or could it be that the Dutch did not request the freeze in a legally binding way, they just advised Binance to comply? But according to the article, Binance had to freeze the funds.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Countries have jurisdiction in criminal matters primarily because either (1\\) the crime affects people in their country, or (2\\) the crime is carried out in their country.\n\nThe Netherlands is well within established norms of criminal jurisdiction to enforce money laundering laws that impact commerce in or with the Netherlands, which appears to be what happened in this case.\n\nAlso, the locus of where a crime that takes place on the Internet occurs is also somewhat nebulous. If Dutch residents are parties to those transactions, and the transactions constitute money laundering under Dutch law, there is a fair argument that the money laundering transactions take place in the Netherlands for legal purposes.\n\nThe main issue, as a practical matter, is what the Netherlands can do in order to force Binance to comply with its orders if Binance fails to do so.\n\nThe political and legal reality is that as long as the Dutch courts have the practical ability to enforce their orders, the Netherlands has jurisdiction to enforce those orders from a legal perspective if the Dutch courts agree that they have the power to do so.\n\nI lack the technical level understanding of the operations of Binance to know precisely what the Dutch government could do in this case, however. Someone with a deeper technical understanding will have to address that issue. It could simply be that the Dutch government is confident that it could successfully extradite Binance officials who willfully disobeyed its orders from whatever countries they reside in.\n\nUsually extradition is available, if there is an extradition treaty in force, if both countries have laws criminalizing the same basic type of conduct with similar degrees of seriousness. So, if the country where the Binance officials are located has a money laundering law that is in broad outline similar to that of the Dutch money laundering law, and if the two countries have an extradition treaty, the Dutch threat to have the offenders outside the Netherlands arrested and extradited to the Netherlands is a credible one.\n\n[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binance):\n\n> **Binance** is a cryptocurrency exchange which is the largest exchange in the world in terms of daily trading volume of cryptocurrencies.

But, multinational business executives can be greatly hampered if warrants for their arrest are outstanding in much of the world.\n\nAlso, China, while it is prone to ignore business corruption for extended periods of time, every now and then embarks on harsh, mass, anti\\-corruption campaigns in which large numbers of allegedly corrupt business people are executed or imprisoned with little or no formal due process in short order and with little warning. So, Chinese based executives of the company know that if they become too much of a problem to the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China, that they can be \"thrown under the bus\" in a manner much more literal than the way that this term is usually used.

Option A is incorrect because Spotify does not clearly qualify as a \"radio station\" under the conventional understanding of 47 USC 508, which was written with traditional radio broadcasting in mind. Option B is too absolute, as there may be potential legal implications even if they're not explicitly stated. Option D is incorrect because the FCC doesn't have specific regulations for this practice on streaming platforms. Option C is the most accurate, reflecting the current legal uncertainty.

If due to unforeseen circumstances or for certain reasons, if any of the Parties wish to terminate the assignment while it is still in progress, the invoice will be for fees on the basis of time spent, as well as OPE, upto the date of communication of termination of engagement*\". \n\n**The problem:**  \n\nFirstly, since these people didn't even type my mobile number correctly, I'm uneasy about them drafting a legal agreement for me, where I wanted each and every clause to be thoroughly checked. I'm not confident of them being thorough.  \n\nHow do I tell them that I do not need their services? Does their sending of an engagement letter mean that I pay them for their time of drafting the letter? I wasn't expecting an engagement letter. I was expecting something like an ordinary email which said something like \"this is our approximate hourly fee\".\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No. \n\nAn engagement letter is a written confirmation that you have hired a lawyer which also sets forth the contractual obligations of the parties (i.e. the basis upon which attorneys' fees will be charged in the case). \n\nInstead of serving as an \"estimate\" or \"approximate quote\" of the fees to be charged, it is evidence that there is an attorney\\-client relationship and it sets forth the contractual terms of that relationship.\n\nUnless the engagement letter is for a fixed fee (which is uncommon but not unheard of), it only sets forth a method for determining what legal fees are owed and does not predict in advance what those fees will be.\n\nAn engagement letter often does set forth a \"retainer\" amount that must be paid when the lawyer is hired, but a \"retainer\" is more akin to a security deposit on a lease than an estimate of what the total charges for the representation will be.\n\nLawyers are required as a matter of professional ethics to put these things in writing.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be improper for an engagement letter to include an estimate of the fees that will be charged in a representation as well as the other matters described above. But, that would be rather unusual.\n\n> Firstly, since these people didn't even type my mobile number\n>  correctly, I'm uneasy about them drafting a legal agreement for me,\n>  where I wanted each and every clause to be thoroughly checked. I'm not\n>  confident of them being thorough.\n\nThis certainly doesn't make a great first impression, although it reflects more on the quality of the office staff than on the legal acumen of the lawyers. I wouldn't blow a simple typo in writing a phone number out of proportion.\n\n> How do I tell them that I do not need their services?\n\nAdvise them by telephone, or better yet by letter, email or text, that you have decided not to retain their services. \n\n> Does their sending of an engagement letter mean that I pay them for\n>  their time of drafting the letter?\n\nThe firm probably could charge you, but it is customary not to charge for drafting an engagement letter.\n\n> I wasn't expecting an engagement letter. I was expecting something\n>  like an ordinary email which said something like \"this is our\n>  approximate hourly fee\".\n\nLawyers, as you might expect from their line of work, need to be more formal as a result of their legal ethics requirements, so this is very normal. The engagement letter constitutes a contract between the parties if the engagement is commenced. An informal communication, followed by a formal one, could lead to confusion over which one applies and could lead to mistakes where someone given an informal communication never received the required formal engagement letter.\n\n> their hourly fees (which does not look reasonable to me)\n\nLawyers are expensive, and good lawyers are worth it.

The client can decline the services without any financial obligation to the law firm. The engagement letter does not constitute a binding agreement until it is accepted and signed by the client. While it's normal for law firms to send formal engagement letters, the client is not obligated to proceed with their services. The client can simply inform the firm that they have decided not to retain their services, preferably in writing.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's customary for law firms not to charge for drafting engagement letters, even though they technically could.\n\nOption B is incorrect because an engagement letter only becomes binding when both parties agree to it, usually through the client's signature.\n\nOption D is incorrect because sending an engagement letter is a standard and ethical practice for law firms, even if the client only requested a fee quote.

You don't need to place a copyright notice, but it is desirable as protection against a defence of innocent infringement.\n\nThe format of copyright notices for visual works is governed by [17 U.S.C. \u00a7 401](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/401) :\n\n> (a) General Provisions.\u2014 Whenever a work protected under this title is published in the United States or elsewhere by authority of the copyright owner, a notice of copyright as provided by this section may be placed on publicly distributed copies from which the work can be visually perceived, either directly or with the aid of a machine or device. \n> \n> \n> (b) Form of Notice.\u2014 If a notice appears on the copies, it shall consist of the following three elements:  \n> \n>  (1\\) the symbol \u00a9 (the letter C in a circle), or the word \u201cCopyright\u201d, or the abbreviation \u201cCopr.\u201d; and  \n> \n>  (2\\) the year of first publication of the work; in the case of compilations, or derivative works incorporating previously published material, the year date of first publication of the compilation or derivative work is sufficient. The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and  \n> \n>  (3\\) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner. \n> \n> \n> (c) Position of Notice.\u2014 The notice shall be affixed to the copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of works that will satisfy this requirement, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive. \n> \n> \n> (d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.\u2014 If a notice of copyright in the form and position specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant\u2019s interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in the last sentence of section 504 (c)(2\\).\n\nYou'll notice that the wording of the law is broad, except that it gives the Register of Copyright the power to prescribe positioning of notice.\n\nA notice that falsely claims a later first publication year does not extend the term of copyright protection \u2014 if you first published an article on your website in 2010, a copyright notice that states 2015 does not extend the protection.\n\nSo:\n\n* You don't need a copyright notice at all, but it's helpful\n* [You can put a later year on the notice, but this doesn't protect it for longer](http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ03.pdf)\n* Each of your examples would have the same effect. As pointed out, they don't designate an author. For some reason, I had mentally inserted them. However, for works published after March 1, 1989, copyright protection is automatic and no corrective steps are required. This may mean that a defence of innocent infringement may succeed.\n\nOh, and also \\- *All rights reserved* has a different meaning, essentially addressed in the question [What is the effect of saying \"we reserve our (client's) rights\" when writing to another party to a dispute?](https://law.stackexchange.com/q/1584/58)"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A website owner wants to add a copyright notice to their site.

However, including a notice can be beneficial as it helps prevent defendants from claiming innocent infringement in potential lawsuits.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the law does not require all these elements for a valid copyright notice. The notice should include the copyright symbol (or word), year of first publication, and name of the copyright owner, but including the current year is not mandatory.\n\nOption B is false because \"All rights reserved\" is a separate phrase with a different legal meaning and does not provide additional protections beyond standard copyright law.\n\nOption C is incorrect because falsely claiming a later publication date in a copyright notice does not extend the term of copyright protection.

After moving out someone complained that the (shared) glove for removing hot items from the oven was missing. I had my own glove that I took and when I checked I now have two. They look almost the same so I guess I took theirs.\n\nMy ex\\-landlord (who is actually just the lease holder with the owner) is looking for all kinds of reasons not to return my damage deposit. In general money was always a source of conflict and both of us believe the other owes more money. Though I hope not, I suspect I'm going to have to take the ex\\-landlord to court. \n\nI had a desk which belonged to me. I left it in a shared storage area. The ex\\-landlord had taken it to his room to use. Upon moving out I told the ex\\-landlord he could keep it for $40 or put it by the door and I will take it. He never returned it. (though I only know he took it because he verbally said it once, so I can't prove it). When someone asked if I took it I replied \"I thought it was mine\". I also messaged the ex\\-landlord \"you still have my desk, if you agree I can keep the glove I'll consider this resolved\". He replied with a lie saying the desk is his. \n\nSo what should I do with the oven glove? I can return it by leaving it in the mailbox. Could \"admitting\" to this leave me open for legal attacks if we go to court? One oven glove is slightly nicer than the other so I'd like to know which is his. How can I find this out? Should I bring up the desk and say something like \"you need to agree to return my desk if I return the oven glove\"? Probably not worth thinking about but since it was a shared oven glove, I don't know if there is an \"owner\". Should I ask for a receipt?\n\nThe ex\\-landlord claimed the oven glove was $40 but I suspect it's more like $20 especially considering it's used. He also started complaining a hall near my room was left in a messy state. This hall was shared and I was never asked to clean it. I don't recall it being messy when I left. If it really is a concern I could go back to sweep it out. \n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If you innocently took the oven glove by mistake there is no possibility of criminal consequences. Now that you know it is not yours, you must return it as soon as possible.\n\nYou *may* be liable for the losses caused by taking the glove, and that could extend as far as some fraction of the cost of a replacement glove if they have already replaced it.\n\nYou cannot (legally) hold his glove hostage for the return of your desk.\n\nDeciding which glove is which is tricky. Given the cost of new oven gloves, I would go round with both and ask him which is his. Even if he takes the nicer one which isn't his, you are only down a few dollars.\n\nThe messy hall should be a separate question (and risks being closed as asking for specific legal advice \\- I think you need your own paid\\-for lawyer for that)."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: Based on the legal advice provided, which of the following actions would be the most appropriate for the person who accidentally took the oven glove?\n\nA) Keep both gloves and demand the return of the desk before considering returning either glove.\n\nB) Return the glove anonymously by leaving it in the mailbox to avoid any potential legal issues.\n\nC) Go to the ex-landlord with both gloves, ask them to identify which one is theirs, and return it immediately.\n\nD) Offer to pay $40 for the glove and consider the matter resolved without returning it.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. The legal advice suggests that the person should return the glove as soon as possible now that they know it's not theirs. The most appropriate action is to go to the ex-landlord with both gloves and ask them to identify which one belongs to them. This approach is honest, straightforward, and minimizes the risk of further disputes. It also aligns with the advice to resolve the glove issue separately from other matters like the desk or damage deposit.

Sometimes this is done to inform judges regarding the original intent of constitutional provisions in that era by providing non\\-binding but persuasive context for the language in the constitution.\n\nSometimes, it is part of a common law legal tradition of precedents that was not displaced by the American Revolution.\n\nAlso, state and local legislation can and often does displace pre\\-Revolutionary era English common law precedent. Indeed, this is much more common than Congressionally enacted laws doing so, because most subjects for which there is English common law precedent are matters of state law and not matters of federal law.\n\n> Otherwise how do you end up with the scotus citing the right of\n> eminent domain etc?\n\nEminent domain is expressly provided for in the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution. Precedents in place in 1791, when it was enacted, merely provide context for what was meant when the 5th Amendment was adopted.\n\n> What is the basis for this continuation of English common law and how\n> did it come to be?\n\nEnglish common law was the law in force at the time of the American Revolution and was not displaced. The status quo was merely continued. And, in the 18th century, the prevailing legal theory saw common law as largely a form of natural law that was \"discovered\" in much the way that a scientific law might be, rather than being a policy choice made by a judge. This legal theory of the common law, however is no longer current.\n\nThese days, many states have statutes that expressly make the common law of England in the year 1776 (or some other year established by law) the default rule of law in circumstances where there is no other legal guidance.\n\nFor example, Section 2\\-4\\-211 of the Colorado Revised Statutes states that:\n\n> The common law of England so far as the same is applicable and of a\n> general nature, and all acts and statutes of the British parliament,\n> made in aid of or to supply the defects of the common law prior to the\n> fourth year of [James the First](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_VI_and_I) \\[i.e. 1607 CE], excepting the second section of the\n> sixth chapter of forty\\-third Elizabeth, the eighth chapter of\n> thirteenth Elizabeth, and the ninth chapter of thirty\\-seventh Henry\n> the Eighth, and which are of a general nature, and not local to that\n> kingdom, shall be the rule of decision, and shall be considered as of\n> full force until repealed by legislative authority.\n\nIn practice, however, as U.S. common law courts have developed a large body of common law precedents, resort to English common law cases as a binding rule of decision is almost non\\-existent. I doubt that even one in a hundred appellate court decisions in the U.S. refer to it as binding law, perhaps one in a thousand cases is closer to the mark.\n\nInstead, the most common modern practice, when a particular state encounters a question upon which the state's appellate law has no relevant precedents on a question reserved for the common law is to look to the most recent \"Restatement\" of the law, a series of non\\-binding code\\-like summaries of various common law legal subjects that is a mishmash of majority rules and \"better rules\" when there is more than one rule used in state courts, prepared by eminent legal scholars called \"reporters\" in a process supervised by the American Bar Association, or to look at the precedents adopted by courts making common law rules of decisions in other states presented with the same issue.\n\n> What parts of the English jurisprudential and legislative mechanisms\n> were done away with and which were kept? Why?\n\nWhile Congress and state legislatures were informed by English legislative mechanisms in devising their own laws, English legislative mechanisms were immediately dispensed with at the time of the American Revolution in 1776\\.\n\nEnglish jurisprudence continued in continuity in substantive common law everywhere but Louisiana (which had a French civil law tradition that persists with modification to this day) and Puerto Rico (which has a Spanish civil law tradition that continues to this day with modification), since it was the status quo. But it developed largely independently of English law since then, as American precedents were developed. As a result, there are now very few areas (all obscure) where American precedents are not on point to provide a rule of decision, making resort to English jurisprudence unnecessary.\n\nStill, when a concept, doctrine, or legal term originates in English common law, it isn't unheard of for American courts to elucidate the English origins of the idea as part of the process of explaining the modern meaning of the legal idea or term in question, as much for \"color commentary\" as for a source of binding law.\n\nIn some areas, like property law, parts of the United States that were formerly part of Mexico likewise continue Mexican private law traditions and jurisprudence. There is some residual Dutch jurisprudence in New York State that had a Dutch colonial period. And, as mentioned before there is a primary French legal foundation of private law in Louisiana and a primarily Spanish legal foundation of private law in Puerto Rico."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: Which of the following statements best describes the current status and application of pre-revolutionary English common law in the United States legal system?\n\nA) It is the primary source of law in all states except Louisiana and Puerto Rico, and is frequently cited in federal cases.\n\nB) It has been completely replaced by American statutory and case law, and has no relevance in modern U.S. courts.\n\nC) It serves as a default rule of law in many states when there is no other legal guidance, but is rarely used as binding precedent in modern court decisions.\n\nD) It is only used to interpret the original intent of the U.S. Constitution and has no other application in American jurisprudence.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. While pre-revolutionary English common law does continue to have some influence in the American legal system, its direct application as binding precedent is rare in modern court decisions. Many states have statutes that make English common law from a specific year (often 1776) the default rule when there is no other legal guidance. However, as the U.S. has developed its own extensive body of common law precedents, resort to English common law as a binding rule is almost non-existent. It's estimated that perhaps only one in a thousand appellate court decisions in the U.S. refer to it as binding law.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because while English common law did influence most states, it is not the primary source of law today and is not frequently cited in federal cases. Answer B is wrong because English common law hasn't been completely replaced and still has some relevance, albeit limited.

While holding dual high-level positions is generally against university policy and could lead to termination, the strict legality depends on various factors including specific university policies, state laws (for public universities), and the nature of the contracts involved. The answer acknowledges that such arrangements are typically problematic but avoids absolute statements about legality, recognizing the complexity of the situation.

Copyright does not preclude others from using the ideas or information revealed by the author\u2019s work. It pertains to the literary, musical, graphic, or artistic form in which the author expressed intellectual concepts. Section 102(b) makes clear that copyright protection does not extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work. Some concern has been expressed lest copyright in computer programs should extend protection to the methodology or processes adopted by the programmer, rather than merely to the \u201cwriting\u201d expressing his ideas. Section 102(b) is intended, among other things, to make clear that **the expression adopted by the programmer is the copyrightable element in a computer program, and that the actual processes or methods embodied in the program are not within the scope of the copyright law**. Section 102(b) in no way enlarges or contracts the scope of copyright protection under the present law. Its purpose is to restate, in the context of the new single Federal system of copyright, that the basic dichotomy between expression and idea remains unchanged.\n\nThe corollary here is that the copyrightable element in the standard is the arrangement of the information and the listed reasoning, but not the data itself.\n\nIn [Feist Pubs., Inc. v. Rural Tel. Svc. Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340 (1991\\)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/) the US Supreme Court held that \"the fundamental axiom of copyright law is that no one may copyright facts or ideas.\" stating:\n\n> A compilation is not copyrightable per se, but is copyrightable only if its facts have been \"selected, coordinated, or arranged in such a way that the resulting work as a whole constitutes an original work of authorship.\" \u00a7 101 (emphasis added). Thus, the statute envisions that some ways of selecting, coordinating, and arranging data are not sufficiently original to trigger copyright protection. **Even a compilation that is copyrightable receives only limited protection, for the copyright does not extend to facts contained in the compilation. \u00a7 103(b).**\n\nIn *Feist*, the Court held that the raw data in Rural's white pages was not copyrightable, however, Rural would have a copyright in the work as a whole because of information outside the raw facts.\n\nAs for standards like Building Codes, Plumbing Codes, Electrical Codes, they are protected by copyright.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether this changes in the future considering the recent [Georgia v.

The explicitness of your prior leases overrides the statutory variations that might exist among jurisdictions in this regard.

See [893\\.43](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/893/IV/43). *Statute of limitations* means the lapse of time upon which claims of certain type are no longer actionable.\n\nThus, you would only be able to recover the fees of the latest 6 years except for this year's lease, since your current lease no longer specifies that the landlord will cover that cost.\n\nFor more information on small claims courts, see [chapter 799](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/799) of the Wisconsin statutory law."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given information:\n\nQuestion: A tenant discovers that for the past 7 years, they have been paying utility bills that their lease explicitly stated were the landlord's responsibility.

To be safe, you should either obtain a license, or restrict yourself to public domain material, or create similar\\-sounding snippets your self.\n\nWithin the limits of copyright law, only the copyright holder has the right to decide over public performances or reproductions of their work. Copyright does have limits, so there are some exceptions. For example, limited reproductions for educational purposes are typically fine. However, this does not imply a general permission to use a work just because your use is non\\-commercial or just because you gave attribution.\n\nSpecifically in the US, the *fair use doctrine* provides a broad copyright exception, though fair use should be understood more as a possible defense when accused of infringement than as a clear right. A fair use analysis must consider four factors:\n\n* purpose and character of the use, for example whether the use is commercial or nonprofit educational\n* nature of the work\n* amount of the work used\n* effect of the use on the potential market of the copyrighted work\n\nIt will probably not be fair use just because the use is non\\-commercial. However, other factors might help with the fair use defense.\nA highly transformative use (remixing the audio snippets)\nfor noncommercial purposes,\nusing only short audio snippets that are unlikely to have any effect on the value of the original work (your performance doesn't compete with the original TED talk)\nmight indeed make it possible to rely on a fair use defense.\n\nIndeed, music sampling is a common phenomenon, and there is a [long history of debate on the question whether sampling is fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use#Music_sampling). However, most (but not all) instances of sampling will require a license.\n\nNote that other countries have completely different copyright exceptions. Fair use is an US\\-specific phenomenon.

While non-commercial use is one factor that can support a fair use defense, it alone does not guarantee protection from copyright infringement claims. The fair use doctrine considers multiple factors, including the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount used, and the effect on the potential market for the original work. A transformative, non-commercial use of short snippets might have a strong fair use argument, but it's not guaranteed protection and could still potentially be considered infringement.

If the mooring doesn't already exist then you need licences and/or permissions and/or consents from the relevant authorities/owners to make it.

Does the jetty already exist or must it be built? Is there additional infrastructure to be built, such as parking, utilities (electricity, water, gas, sewerage), 24/7 security etc?

As Wikipedia explains:\n\n> Private defence of property\n> \n> \n> This defence is available when a person uses force to defend an\n>  interest in property: for example,\n> \n> \n> * to prevent a would\\-be thief or robber from taking his own property, or that of another;\n> * to prevent someone from damaging or destroying his own or another\u2019s property; or\n> * to prevent an intruder from entering his own or another\u2019s property. This would include the use of such preventive devices as spiked fences\n>  and electrified fencing.\n> \n> \n> The requirements for private defence of property are similar in many\n>  respects to those for private defence of persons, but there are\n>  certain differences. The following are conditions relating to the\n>  attack. There must be evidence that the property was:\n> \n> \n> * presently\n> * in danger of damage or destruction\n> * that was unlawful.\n> \n> \n> The defence of property must be:\n> \n> \n> * directed against the attacker;\n> * necessary to avert the danger; and\n> * a reasonable response to the attack.\n> \n> \n> In *Ex parte Die Minister van Justisie: in re S v Van Wyk*, the\n>  Appellate Division held that the onus is on the State to rebut private\n>  defence of property, just as it carries the onus to rebut private\n>  defence of person.\n> \n> \n> The property should not be of negligible value. In *S v Mogohlwane*,\n>  Mogohlwane had been robbed by the deceased, who had been armed with a\n>  tomahawk, of a bag containing his clothing, shoes and food. Mogohlwane\n>  then went to his home, nearby, fetched a knife and returned to recover\n>  his property. When Mogohlwane tried to take back his bag, the deceased\n>  resisted and again threatened him with the tomahawk. Mogohlwane then\n>  stabbed him with the knife, causing his death. Mogohlwane was charged\n>  with murder. The court held that, in determining whether or not the\n>  property is of trivial value, it could be taken into account that the\n>  accused (as was the case in casu) might not be richly endowed with\n>  earthly possessions. What may be of little value to a wealthy person\n>  may be of great value to a poor person. Given Mogohlwane\u2019s financial\n>  circumstances, the stolen items were of value to him. Mogohlwane was\n>  justified in his conduct, because his attempt to recover his property\n>  was close enough in time to the robbery to be part of the same chain\n>  of events. The State had not proved that there was a less dangerous\n>  and more effective means or method reasonably available to the accused\n>  to defend himself against the act of robbery, so it was decided that\n>  Mogohlwane had acted in private defence and therefore lawfully.\n\nThere is no real question in this case that justification for some private defense of property was present, and in both the scenarios presented, it is directed at the attacker.\n\nSo, the question under South African law would be whether the force was \"necessary to avert the danger\" and whether it was \"a reasonable response to the attack.\"\n\nGenerally speaking \"deadly force\" is not going to be justified to protect property in a smash and grab, although in the first scenario when someone is in the car, there may be an implied threat to a person that would justify a greater level of force than would be the case otherwise.\n\nThere is, however, no easy answer. It is a judgment call that must be evaluated for necessity and reasonableness on a case by case basis, and probably has to be evaluated in light of other alternative options. If your 300 pound muscled bouncer friend could just grab him instead, it was probably not necessary to smash his legs or use a taser. In other circumstances that might be the best available option.\n\nSimilarly, under *Mogohlwane* it would be appropriate to consider if the victim had insurance and how much of an economic impact this would have on the victim and what the property being stolen was. Protecting one's life savings (or better yet, a medical device or medicines necessary to stay alive) might justify action that would not be appropriate when protecting a cheap pair of sunglasses in a car about to be junked anyway."}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In South Africa, a driver is sitting in their parked car when a thief smashes the passenger window and attempts to grab the driver's laptop bag.

In South African law, private defense of property is permitted, but it must meet certain criteria. The action must be necessary to avert the danger, directed against the attacker, and be a reasonable response to the attack. The legality of the driver's actions would depend on several factors:\n\n1. The necessity of the action: Was this the only way to prevent the theft?\n2.

China's campaign to enforce real-name verification online has a long history, dating back to 2009. However, the formalization of these requirements came with the Network Security Law, which was further clarified by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) in August 2017.
