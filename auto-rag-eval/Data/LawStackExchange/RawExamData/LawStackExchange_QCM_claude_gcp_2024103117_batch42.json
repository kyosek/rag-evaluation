This is regardless of whether the student writes the code for fun, or for a thesis. If a student is hired to write that code, then it kind of depends on the university rules, and who hires the student. In the case of a \"work for hire\", the employer owns the copyright. However, it is non\\-trivial to determine whether that principle is applicable in the case of a student hired by the university. In part, it depends on which country this is in because work for hire laws are not exactly the same everywhere, and in part it depends on the details of the employment my a university. In a typical US institution RA appointment, it would come down to university policy \u2013 some universities declare that copyright in all student\\-written software is retained by the student. You would need to look for something resembling an \"IP Policy\" \u2013 [here is a sample](https://tco.osu.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/IP-Policy.pdf), note that such policies are subject to revision.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A graduate student, Sarah, develops a novel software application as part of her thesis work. She is also employed by the university as a Research Assistant. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true regarding the copyright ownership of the software?\n\nA) The university automatically owns the copyright because Sarah is a student.\nB) Sarah's thesis supervisor can claim copyright ownership due to their supervisory role.\nC) Sarah owns the copyright, unless university policy specifically states otherwise for work done by Research Assistants.\nD) The copyright is automatically shared equally between Sarah, her supervisor, and the university.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The general rule is that the author of the software owns the copyright, which would be Sarah in this case. Her status as a student doesn't automatically transfer copyright to the university or her supervisor. However, her position as a Research Assistant complicates matters. In a \"work for hire\" situation, the employer (the university) could potentially claim ownership. The key factor here is the university's specific IP policy regarding work done by Research Assistants. Many universities have policies that allow students to retain copyright of their work, but this isn't universal. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Sarah likely owns the copyright, unless the university's policy explicitly states otherwise for work done by Research Assistants. This highlights the importance of university IP policies in determining copyright ownership in academic settings."}, "1": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/78145/how-does-unionization-in-the-usa-work", "docs_id": 78145, "title": "How does Unionization in the USA work?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I can't seem to be able to find and simple explanation as to how unionization in the USA works.\n\nI watched the documentary \"American Factory\" and the workers basically rejected unionization plans.\n\nMy question is, how often can unionization votes be held?\n\nIf one vote fails today, can another vote be held tomorrow?

If not, when can a vote to disband the union be held, and who is allowed to organize such a vote?\n\nAlso, the worker population of a company is constantly changing. Basically like the Ship of Theseus. I think, none of the founding members of the UAW union in 1930 are alive today. But the union is still alive and well. So, was there any vote in the interim 90 years to reaffirm the union? Or is it that once a union is formed, it is un\\-disbandable?\n\n---\n\nI also read about Stabucks workers forming unions.

But this person wants to negotiate directly with Starbucks and does not want anything to do with the Union. Then this person cannot be hired?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: First of all, the question seems to misunderstand what \"union elections\" are about. They do not involve forming or joining a union. Under [29 USC 157](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/157) all employees have the right to form or join any union at any time. No election is needed. 29 USC 159 provides that:\n\n> Employees shall have the right to self\\-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any or all of such activities\n\nThe above section is part of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935, as amended and updated. It is found in \\[Chapter 7 of 29 USC] ([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter\\-7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/chapter-7))\n\nA union is formed as the voluntary act of its members. A union generally has a constitution that controls its operations. This will specify under what conditions the union will be dissolved. An individual may leave a union at any time.\n\nElections, such as those mentioned in the question, are held by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when employees desire that a union become the designated collective bargaining representative for a bargaining unit (which is a group of employees deemed to have a \"community of interest\"). There is considerable flexibility in just which employees shall be designated as a bargaining unit. In the event of a dispute, this is resolved by the NLRB. (see 29 USC 159(b)). Elections may also be held when there is a desire by some workers to change representatives.\n\nA petition requesting a representation election can be filed by a union, a worker, or an employer.\n\nUnder [29 USC 159](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/159)(a) the representatives for a bargaining unit: \"shall be the exclusive representatives of all the employees in such unit for the purposes of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment, or other conditions of employment\". That is what representation elections are about.\n\nA union, or other organization, is supposed to be recognized or designated as the bargaining representative for a bargaining unit (BU) only if a majority of the workers in that BU who make a choice want that representative.\n\nIn addition to being certified by the NLRB after winning an election, a union can be recognized as the representative voluntarily by the employer on the request of a majority of the employees. Or such a request can trigger a secret ballot election.\n\n> My question is, how often can unionization votes be held?\n\nRepresentation elections are normally held no more often than once a year in any BU. Specifically, 29 USC 159(c)(3\\) provides that:\n\n> No election shall be directed in any bargaining unit or any subdivision within which in the preceding twelve\\-month period, a valid election shall have been held.\n\nCases recently in the news where a second election has been ordered or proposed in a shorter period of time involve cases where it has been held, or alleged, that the previous election was **not valid** because of unfair labor practices.\n\nAn election can also be held to decertify the bargaining representative, or to substitute a new representative. In all these cases a majority of the workers voting must agree for any change to be made. The \"no more than once per year\" rule applies to all these elections.\n\nIf there are more than two choices on the ballot (for example, if several different unions are proposed, perhaps along with \"no union\") and no one choice gets a majority, a runoff is held between the two choices with the largest number of votes. This is specified in 29 USC 159(c)(3\\)\n\nAll representation elections are held under the authority of, and are regulated by, the NLRB.\n\n> So when a union is formed, a company is no longer allowed to hire any worker outside of the union?\n\nThis is not correct. That is what is known as the \"closed shop\", and it is illegal under the NLRA. Arrangements that **are** legal (when they are part of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)) under the NLRA are:\n\n* The \"union shop\". On being hired, an employee must join the union within a specified time (which must be at least 30 days, but may be longer). This is specifically permitted by [29 USC 158](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/29/158)(a)(3\\). However, many states have by state law prohibited union shop agreements.\n* An \"agency shop\". No employee need join any union, but any employee must pay the designated bargaining representative a fee (normally less than the union membership dues) for its efforts in representing the workers of that BU, and that worker specifically. Some states have by state law prohibited or limited agency shop agreements.\n* An \"open shop\". No worker need pay any dues or fee to any union or other representative., But if the representative is a union, its policies are set by the union members, and to become and remain a union member, a worker must pay union dues.\n\nAside from any shop agreement included in a CBA, 29 USC 158(a)(3\\) provides that it is an unfair labor practice (ULP) for an employer:\n\n> by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization ...\n\nIt is also a ULP (under 29 USC 158(a)(2\\)) for an employer to:\n\n> dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it ...\n\nThe provisions of the NLRA and some proposals that have been made to change it are summarized and explained in [\"The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA): Union Representation Procedures and Dispute Resolution\"](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL32930.html#fn54) from the Congressional Research Service (CRS).

According to the National Labor Relations Act, specifically 29 USC 159(c)(3), no new election can be held within 12 months of a valid election in the same bargaining unit. However, if the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) determines that the previous election was invalid due to unfair labor practices, they may order a new election sooner.

(4\\) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution\\[.]\n\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f922(g) is the law on possession:\n\n> It shall be unlawful for any person ... (4\\) who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\n\nThe wording of the laws is past tense\u2014any person who \"has been\" committed\u2014meaning that there's a strong textual case for a lifetime ban. While not binding, the Supreme Court seems to agree:\n\n> A person adjudicated as a mental defective may later be adjudged competent, and a person committed to a mental institution later may be deemed cured and released. Yet Congress made no exception for subsequent curative events. The past adjudication or commitment disqualifies. Congress obviously felt that such a person, though unfortunate, was too much of a risk to be allowed firearms privileges.\n\n[*Dickerson v. New Banner Inst.*](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/460/103.html), 460 U.S. 103, 116 (1983\\) (not binding because the case dealt only with persons who had served lengthy prison terms rather than those who had been involuntarily committed).\n\nMore importantly, Congress seems to agree. It allows states to receive certain federal grants only if they establish programs that provide an avenue for \"relief\" from the lifetime ban of \u00a7\u00a7\u202f922(d)(4\\), 922(g)(4\\). For example, \u00a7\u202f105 of the [NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007](https://www.congress.gov/110/plaws/publ180/PLAW-110publ180.pdf), 121 Stat. 2559, describes a state's program as qualifying in the following way: \n\n> (a) Program Described.\u2014 A relief from disabilities program is implemented by a State in accordance with this section if the program\u2014\n> \n> \n> \n> > (1\\) permits a person who, pursuant to State law, has been adjudicated as described in subsection (g)(4\\) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code, or has been committed to a mental institution, to apply to the State for relief from the disabilities imposed by subsections (d)(4\\) and (g)(4\\) of such section by reason of the adjudication or commitment;\n> > \n> > \n> > (2\\) provides that a State court, board, commission, or other lawful authority shall grant the relief, pursuant to State law and in accordance with the principles of due process, if the circumstances regarding the disabilities referred to in paragraph (1\\), and the person's record and reputation, are such that the person will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest; and\n> > \n> > \n> > (3\\) permits a person whose application for the relief is denied to file a petition with the State court of appropriate jurisdiction for a de novo judicial review of the denial.\n> \n> \n> (b) Authority To Provide Relief From Certain Disabilities With Respect to Firearms.\u2014 If, under a State relief from disabilities program implemented in accordance with this section, an application for relief referred to in subsection (a)(1\\) of this section is granted with respect to an adjudication or a commitment to a mental institution or based upon a removal of a record under section 102(c)(1\\)(B), the adjudication or commitment, as the case may be, is deemed not to have occurred for purposes of subsections (d)(4\\) and (g)(4\\) of section 922 of title 18, United States Code.\n\nMichigan, however, wasn't one of the states that implemented a relief program.

If you get found and the owner tells you to leave (whether or not they get a court order), or if they say \"I'll let you stay for a while\", or they do a bit of landscaping, then you can't take the land (or, the clock restarts).

The year date may be omitted where a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, with accompanying text matter, if any, is reproduced in or on greeting cards, postcards, stationery, jewelry, dolls, toys, or any useful articles; and\n> \n> \n> (b)(3\\) the name of the owner of copyright in the work, or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation of the owner.\n> \n> \n> (c) Position of Notice.\u2014The notice shall be affixed to the copies in such manner and location as to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright. The Register of Copyrights shall prescribe by regulation, as examples, specific methods of affixation and positions of the notice on various types of works that will satisfy this requirement, but these specifications shall not be considered exhaustive.\n> \n> \n> (d) Evidentiary Weight of Notice.\u2014If a notice of copyright in the form and position specified by this section appears on the published copy or copies to which a defendant in a copyright infringement suit had access, then no weight shall be given to such a defendant\u2019s interposition of a defense based on innocent infringement in mitigation of actual or statutory damages, except as provided in the last sentence of section 504(2\\).\n\nNote that this section lists the three elements in the order 1\\) symbol or word, 2\\) year, 3\\) owner's name. However, it does not explicitly require this order. As the notice is no longer required at all, and as the sole purpose is \"to give reasonable notice of the claim of copyright\" and to defeat a defense of \"innocent infringement\", the order is probably not significant. But I would follow the text of the law and list the elements in teh same order that 17 USC 401 (b) does, that is, word or symbol fist, year second, name third. For example\n\n> Copyright \u00a9 2022 Jane Jones\n\nBut other forms probably have identical legal significance.\n\nNote that \"Copyright \u00a9\" is a redundancy and perhaps I should not have used it in the example here. But it is what I in fact use, and many commercial publishers do the same. I do it because I think the word will be clearest to many English\\-speaking people, but the symbol will be clearest internationally,\n\nNote also that a notice is no longer legally required. Under US law, until 1 January 1978 (the effective date of the 1976 Copyright Act) any publication without a notice caused the work to enter the public domain at once. After that, until 1 March 1989, any publication without a notice caused the work to enter the public domain in five years, unless the work was registered within that time. Once a work enters the public domain, there is no copyright in that work at all.\n\nEver since 1 March 1989, omission of a notice never causes a work to enter the public domain under US law, and currently, to the best of my understanding, a notice is not legally required in any country in the world, although it has some legal value under US law.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a difficult multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: According to U.S. copyright law (17 USC 401), which of the following statements is most accurate regarding copyright notices?\n\nA) Copyright notices must always be in the order: symbol, year, owner's name, to be legally valid.\nB) The omission of a copyright notice on works published after March 1, 1989, results in the work entering the public domain after five years.\nC) Including both the word \"Copyright\" and the symbol \u00a9 in a notice is legally required for international recognition.\nD) While not mandatory, a properly formatted copyright notice can help defeat a defense of \"innocent infringement\" in copyright lawsuits.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most accurate statement based on the information provided.

The phrase \"please consider\" suggests a request rather than a requirement, and the primary stated intent is to ensure she's \"taken care of.\" This lacks the clear quid pro quo necessary for an offer to contract.

By crossing out undesirable clauses, writing in new language, and initialing the changes, the developer creates a clear record of the modifications. If the agency also initials and signs these changes, it becomes a legally binding agreement. This approach strikes a balance between protecting the developer's interests and maintaining a cooperative negotiation process. Options A and D are too extreme and may harm the relationship, while option B lacks legal enforceability."}, "22": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/43166/are-police-legally-allowed-to-confiscate-a-camera-and-phone-over-suspicious-act", "docs_id": 43166, "title": "Are Police legally allowed to confiscate a Camera and Phone over &quot;suspicious activity&quot;?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: A photographer is recording from a public sidewalk when he is confronted by Police.

If this ruling stands, officers acted legally, although they might still be required to return the phone with the images.\n\nWhether there is probable cause for an arrest (or a search) is always a very fact\\-based issue. I have not found the judge's actual decision, only a news summary of it, which can often be misleading. Specific facts about exactly what Robbins did or said may be important in determining whether there was in fact probable cause.\n\nIt appears that Robbins intends to appeal this decision. If he does there may be an opinion from a Circuit Court of Appeals expanding on whether there was probable cause or any violation of rights, and why.\n\nPrevious cases have established that normally there is no reasonable expectation of privacy for acts performed in public; that one my photograph or video record such public acts legally from anywhere that one may legally be; that there is a right photograph or record police officers engaged in official actions or the use of police powers; and that laws attempting to forbid such recording are unconstitutional when so applied. However, it seems from the news story that here the police officers were off\\-duty and not engaging in any official acts or use of police powers. That might change the ruling.\n\nI rather expect the district court's decision to be overturned, but there is no case exact;ly on point that i know of, and one can never be absolutely sure what a court will do in a particular case. I can see why police officers may have felt threatened, and why the Judge may have been inclined to sympathize with them, although I think the decision was incorrect. But a Judge of the Appeals Court might possibly feel the same way. Until the Appeals Court rules, one cannot be sure what the law in this matter will finally be. (It is possibly, but statistically a bit unlikely, there there will eventually be a ruling from the US Supreme Court on this case.)\n\n[This article from Nolo Press](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/recording-the-police-legal.html) discusses the issue of recording police, primarily in the context of police who are performing their official duties. It says:\n\n> Almost every court to consider the issue has determined that the First Amendment gives you the right to record (pictures, video, and audio) police officers in public while they are performing their duties. But that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re allowed to record if you\u2019re doing so surreptitiously (secretly), interfering with the officer, or otherwise breaking the law.\n> \n> \n> The courts' primary rationale for allowing police officer recording is that the First Amendment includes the right to freely discuss our government, and the right of freedom of the press and public access to information. Given the prevalence of personal filming devices, more and more \u201cnews\u201d is being gathered and disseminated by members of the public. The courts have found that freedom of the press applies to citizen journalists and documentarians just as it does to formal members of the press. (See, for example, [*Glik v. Cunniffe*, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011\\)](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-1st-circuit/1578557.html).)\n\nThe Nolo article goes on to discuss whether a Section 1983 Federal suit against police officers who arrest someone recording their actions will succeed, indicating that this will depend on the specific facts of the case.\n\nThe Nolo article mentions that one is not allowed to interfere with an officer during process of recording.

If the internal audit of a company doesn't do due\n> diligence by not properly auditing the financial documents of the\n> company who is legally accountable for the lack of oversight of the\n> internal audit? The CEO and the CFO or just the CFO?\n\nThis answer is prefaced with a lot of context and discussion of possible fact patterns, because it contains some implicit assumptions about how liability for inaccurate financial statements works.\n\n**Context**\n\nPublicly held companies, non\\-profit organizations with certain kinds of grants, and some privately held companies with large unsecured bank loans, are required, as a matter of law, or as a contractual requirement, to prepare financial statements that are audited by a third\\-party certified public accountancy firm.\n\nThis kind of audit is one of the few accounting functions that can only be performed by a CPA, even though, in practice, most more sophisticated accounting tasks are performed by CPAs.\n\nThe process for conducting this kind of audit is established by industry standards adopted by a CPA industry non\\-profit organization called the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).\n\nThe Sarbanes\\-Oxley Act of 2002 requires the CEO of a publicly held company to certify that the financial statements of the company are materially true to the best of the CEO's knowledge, and that the CEO has reviewed the internal controls in the company and that they are either adequate, or that they have flaws which are expressly disclosed.\n\nFederal law also requires publicly held company to periodically change their outside CPA firms and regulates the governance requirements for such firms in connection with hiring and evaluating outside CPA firms.\n\nThe inclusion of a knowingly false or misleading statement about a matter that is material to a potential investor in a publicly held firm's financial statements or other public disclosures is one form of securities fraud. Someone who participates in securities fraud may have civil or criminal liability as a result, although civil liability requires a showing that a particular investor who is suing suffered damages caused by the false or misleading statement.\n\nThe inclusion of a knowingly false or misleading statement about a matter that is material to a lender or grant provider who contractually requires an internal audit of a privately held profit or non\\-profit firm is a breach of the lending agreement or grant agreement, that could have contractually determined penalties, and could sometimes, but not alway, constitute criminal fraud, or justify a civil lawsuit for fraud by the aggrieved lender or grant provider. These misstatements could also be a ground for making the breach of contract debt not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\nAnother reason that firms sometimes conduct an internal audit would be for management to hire a CPA firm to investigate, forensically, a suspicion that fraud or misconduct has taken place within the firm, by someone at a lower level in the organization or affiliated with the organization, when management doesn't know for sure if something is amiss or not. This could happen in any kind of firm, but is most common in a large privately held company in which there is strong overlap between the group of senior managers of the company and the owners of the company.\n\n**What Can Go Wrong?**\n\nLegal accountability is something that is necessary only when the processes in the company to produce its financial disclosures and other disclosures are inaccurate for some reason.\n\nThere are a variety of people who could have legal accountability, and who is legally accountable depends upon why the disclosures were inaccurate.\n\nMost often, the firm that commissioned the audit may have legal liability to the people for whom the audited financial information was prepared. In the case of a publicly held company, this firm is called the \"issuer\" and the financial statements are prepared for the benefit of the holders of publicly traded stock and corporate bonds of the issuer.\n\nIn the case of a non\\-profit, this would be the grant issuer who imposed the audit requirement (and also the state attorney general, who has general supervisory authority over all non\\-profits in a state). In the case of a commercial lender to the firm, this would be the lender.\n\nUsually, the liability of an issuer for disclosing audited financial statements or disclosures that are inaccurate comes to be in the form of a civil lawsuit for money damages from someone who alleges that they were harmed by the inaccurate disclosure against the issuer.\n\nA civil lawsuit could also name, as co\\-conspirators or additional defendants directly in fraud claims, anyone who participated in preparing the financial statements and knowingly did something wrong in the process with an intent to mislead the person to whom the statements were directed.\n\nThis liability could arise because the CEO certified that the financial statements were accurate knowing that they were not accurate, or certified that there were adequate internal controls in place knowing that there were not adequate internal controls in place.\n\nThis liability could arise because some other officer or employee of the company knowingly manipulated the accounting records of the company, or knowingly set up an inaccurate reporting system to generate accounting records of the company, producing the wrong results. This could take the form of actual fake entries or omissions from accounting business records. It could also take the form of characterizing and aggregating data in accounting business records in a manner inconsistent with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) that are established by the FASB.\n\nThis liability could arise because the same kind of misconduct or negligence of some kind was committed by the CPA firm hired to conduct the audit. The issuer whose financial statements were inaccurate might sue the CPA firm for malpractice (effectively to indemnify it for the liability it incurred to others), or a third\\-party who relied upon the audited financial statements to its detriment could sue the CPA firm that conducted the audit as a third\\-party beneficiary of the representation from the CPA firm that the financial statements were materially accurate.\n\nAny of the people above, if they engaged in intentionally defrauding the intended audience of the financial statements with an intent to deceive (and not mere negligence) could also be prosecuted criminally for securities fraud.\n\nFor example, when a CPA at the national accounting firm of Arthur Anderson intentionally destroyed records with an intent to cover up misconduct, and prepared misleading financial statements for the failed oil and gas firm Enron, the firm was prosecuted criminally for that conduct, convictions were obtained against individuals and the firm, and the firm ceased to exist while the appeal of its conviction was pending. The conviction was ultimately overturned on appeal, but for reasons that don't change the basic concept that accountants and accounting firms can be prosecuting criminally for intentionally and knowingly misleading investors in a publicly held company that it audits with an intent to mislead the public about the audited firm's finances.\n\nAnyone who was in on the fraud and not deceived themselves could also have criminal liability, from a low level book keeper faking data entry records, to a CFO who, for example, intentionally reports the proceeds of loans owed by the company as purchase of stock in the company, in order to make it look like the company has less debt than it actually does.\n\nBut, suppose that the CEO relies upon information from the CFO and the CPA firm conducting the audit that the financial statements are correct and has no reason to suspect otherwise. In that case, even if the CEO certified that the financial statements were correct and was inaccurate in making that certification, the CEO would have no civil or criminal liability.\n\nCriminal liability for inaccurate financial statements or disclosures requires knowledge that they are inaccurate accompanied by a statement to the contrary, or knowing participating in conduct that causes the statements to be inaccurate (and not mere negligence).\n\nSometimes, there is civil liability, but not criminal liability, for \"negligent misrepresentation\" when there are inaccurate financial statements or disclosures, the person states that they are accurate, and due to that person's negligence (but not knowledge or intentional misstatement) the financial statements or disclosure are actually not accurate in a material way that harms someone. The damages available and the legal treatment of the debt in bankruptcy are much more serious for intentional or knowing misstatements than they are for negligent misrepresentations. Negligent misrepresentation liability is limited to actual economic harm and can be discharged in bankruptcy. Securities fraud liability can include punitive damages and is usually impossible to discharge in bankruptcy, and securities fraud debts may be collected from certain kinds of assets that are otherwise exempt from creditor's claims.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: In a publicly held company, an internal audit fails to detect significant financial misstatements due to inadequate procedures. The CEO, unaware of these issues, certifies the financial statements as accurate. Who is most likely to face legal accountability in this scenario?\n\nA) Only the CEO, as they certified the statements\nB) Only the CFO, as they oversee financial operations\nC) The internal audit team exclusively\nD) Multiple parties, potentially including the CEO, CFO, and internal audit team, depending on their knowledge and actions\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. Legal accountability in this scenario could potentially extend to multiple parties, depending on their knowledge, actions, and level of negligence:\n\n1. The CEO may face liability if it's determined they didn't exercise due diligence in reviewing the internal controls before certification, even if they were unaware of the specific issues.\n\n2. The CFO could be held accountable if they were aware of or should have been aware of the inadequate audit procedures or misstatements.\n\n3. The internal audit team may face consequences for failing to perform their duties adequately.\n\n4. The company itself (the \"issuer\") may face civil liability to investors or other stakeholders who relied on the inaccurate financial statements.\n\nThe extent of liability for each party would depend on factors such as their level of knowledge, intent, and the degree of negligence involved. Criminal liability would typically require knowing and intentional misconduct, while civil liability could result from negligence.

Owning shares in a company does not grant shareholders direct rights to use, copy, or distribute the company's intellectual property.

So lets say an Asian person sees a house rented out with a \"no Asians\" condition. Would it be legal for them to \"mask\" themselves as a White person, tell the landlord they're White, sign a paper saying they're White and then proceed to rent the place?\n\nNow... they'd be outright lying but at the same time what they're lying about is not supposed to have been asked in the first place. So does one wrong (discrimination) trump another (lying) in a court of law?\n\nUpdate: since it\u2019s not clear, I\u2019m talking about a scenario where the \u201cAsian\u201d person is willing to admit they lied in a court of law. This isn\u2019t a question on how race is legally defined.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Lying may be wrong, but it in the United States, it is generally not illegal. [*United States v. Alvarez*, 132 S. Ct. 2537 (2012\\)](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-alvarez).\n\nFor a lie to be illegal, it generally needs to fall into one of a few specific categories, usually involving either [fraud](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1341) or the frustration of legitimate government activities (as in [perjury](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621), [falsification of records](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1519), or [lying to a federal agent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001)).\n\nIn any of these cases, the First Amendment is generally going to prohibit any penalties unless the false statement is material, i.e., it had the potential to change the outcome of the event in which it was uttered. As you noted, it is generally illegal to discriminate against Asians, so I would expect a court to treat the tenant's ethnicity as immaterial and require the landlord to honor the rental contract.\n\nOf course, this assumes that the landlord is prohibited from disciminating against Asians, which is not always true. The Fair Housing Act has [exemptions](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3603) for (a) private clubs; (b) for buildings with four or fewer units, one of which the landlord occupies; (c) for single\\-family homes that the landlord is renting without the help of an agent; and (d) for religious organizations.\n\nIn such a case, the landlord may be actually be permitted to disciminate against Asians, so the tenant's false statement about their ethnicity would become material the transaction, and a court may therefore permit the landlord to rescind the contract.\n\n(Note, though, that even though the FHA permits *discrimination* in those limited situations, it does not permit *advertising* discriminatory preferences. The landlord's \"No Asians\" language is therefore illegal, whether it is communicated on a sign in the window or in a classified ad or by word of mouth.)", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided information:\n\nQuestion: A landlord advertises a rental property with a \"No Asians\" condition. An Asian person disguises themselves as white, signs a rental agreement stating they are white, and moves in. The landlord discovers the deception and attempts to evict the tenant. Which of the following statements is most likely to be true in a U.S. court of law?\n\nA) The tenant's lie about their race is illegal and voids the rental agreement, allowing the landlord to evict them.\n\nB) The landlord's discriminatory policy is illegal, but the tenant's lie makes the contract voidable at the landlord's discretion.\n\nC) The tenant's lie is considered immaterial, and the landlord must honor the rental agreement despite the deception.\n\nD) Both the landlord and tenant have committed illegal acts, resulting in a null and void contract.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. In this scenario, the landlord's discriminatory policy is illegal under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race in housing. The tenant's lie about their race would likely be considered immaterial by a court, as race should not have been a factor in the rental decision in the first place. \n\nCourts generally do not penalize lies unless they fall into specific categories like fraud or perjury, and even then, the false statement must be material to the case. Since discriminating against Asians is illegal, the tenant's ethnicity is irrelevant to the legality of the rental agreement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because lying is generally not illegal unless it constitutes fraud or interferes with government activities, which is not the case here. \n\nOption B is wrong because the landlord's policy is illegal and the tenant's lie would likely be considered immaterial.\n\nOption D is incorrect because while the landlord's discriminatory policy is illegal, the tenant's lie is not necessarily illegal in this context and wouldn't automatically void the contract."}, "39": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/68179/do-i-still-need-to-check-if-users-are-inside-of-eea-uk-for-gdpr-consent-if-my-an", "docs_id": 68179, "title": "Do I still need to check if users are inside of EEA/UK for GDPR consent if my Android app is ONLY released in countries outside of EEA/UK?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Example:\n\n* A US user downloads the Android app from the US Google Play Store\n* The user does not view any consent form and begins using the app and viewing ads\n* The user then travels to EEA/UK and continues viewing ads\n\nWould a consent form be required to adhere to GDPR in this instance, even if personalised ads are disabled for EEA/UK users?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The GDPR roughly applies in the following scenarios:\n\n* Art 3(1\\): you have an establishment in Europe\n* Art 3(2\\): you do not have an european establishment, but\n\t+ Art 3(2\\)(a): offer goods or services to persons in Europe\n\t+ Art 3(2\\)(b): monitor the behaviour of people who are in Europe\n\n(where *Europe* means EU/EEA/UK as appropriate).\n\nArt 3(1\\) does not seem to apply for you. Art 3(2\\)(a) does not apply, since you're not actively targeting people in Europe. At the point in time where you are offering the app to users, those users are in the US.\n\nArt 3(2\\)(b) could apply if you collect some kind of tracking data, in particular (but not limited to) location data. But if you temporarily shut down collection of new data for personalisation while the user is in Europe, that's probably going to be reasonably safe. It might not be necessary to disable ad personalisation if that personalisation is based on data collected outside of Europe. In practice, unless your app is specifically targeted at travellers, no one will care about what your app does outside of the US.\n\nFor detailed guidelines on the territorial scope of the GDPR, consider reading [EDPB guidelines 3/2018 (PDF)](https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/guidelines/guidelines-32018-territorial-scope-gdpr-article-3-version_en). The document contains some relevant examples, but since it's official guidance they won't explicitly say that GDPR won't apply in a scenario like yours. The closest is Example 8:\n\n> An Australian company offers a mobile news and video content service, based on users\u2019 preferences and interest. Users can receive daily or weekly updates. The service is offered exclusively to users located in Australia, who must provide an Australian phone number when subscribing.\n> \n> \n> An Australian subscriber of the service travels to Germany on holiday and continues using the service.\n> \n> \n> Although the Australian subscriber will be using the service while in the EU, the service is not \u2018targeting\u2019 individuals in the Union, but targets only individuals in Australia, and so the processing of personal data by the Australian company does not fall within the scope of the GDPR.\n\nAlso relevant is Example 10, which says that app downloads in the EU might not be subject to GDPR:\n\n> A U.S. citizen is travelling through Europe during his holidays. While in Europe, he downloads and uses a news app that is offered by a U.S. company. The app is exclusively directed at\n> the U.S. market, evident by the app terms of use and the indication of US Dollar as the sole currency available for payment.

In this case, the app is continuously monitoring the behavior of a person who is now permanently residing in the EU (falling under Article 3(2)(b) of GDPR). The ongoing collection of location data and behavioral information for a user now based in the EU would likely trigger GDPR obligations.\n\nOption A is less likely to require compliance as it's a temporary visit and the app wasn't targeting EU users.\n\nOption B doesn't trigger GDPR as the download occurred in the EU but usage is primarily in the US.\n\nOption C is a grey area, but since the app isn't marketed to EU users and was downloaded outside the EU, it's less likely to fall under GDPR scope.\n\nOption D represents the clearest case for GDPR applicability due to the permanent relocation and ongoing data collection within the EU."}, "40": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28128/can-lawyers-senate-public-commitee-meetings-ask-questions-which-might-be-covered", "docs_id": 28128, "title": "can lawyers/senate public commitee meetings ask questions which might be covered by NDA&#39;s", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I'm just taking the recent Mark Zuckerberg Senate hearings which were held in the open in the United States.

That means, I would have to compile a large data set containing all or most of the works of Seuss, and store it all in a text file, or series of files. For simplicity's sake let's say 1 file containing all the books/poems concatenated together. All copyrighted, all intellectual property (IP) of someone else.\n\nHere's a precursor question:\n**Is it legal to even create that document, for personal/educational/fair use?**\n\nAssuming it is, even vaguely, then imagine a case where I create said document, and plug it into a neural network to generate Seuss\\-like works, and now I want to share the application on GitHub, publically, so other people can train their own Seuss neural network. That would mean sharing the IP dataset too, because I can't very well expect everyone who wants to clone my repository to generate their own Seuss dataset, because that's not a trivial thing to do.\n\nThe last question (which I linked above) told me that no, sharing it in this way is sketchy and ambiguous at best, if I wanted to claim fair use.\n\n---\n\nSo then it became, \"How can I do what I want to do, but without copyright infringement?\" I had a couple of ideas on that, relating to encrypting the IP dataset.\n\nOne idea was to write a batch processing script that would do a simple en/decryption on a plaintext file, and include that with the repo.\n\nAnother idea was to encrypt the data initially before putting it in the repo, and include the decrypt script, as a subprocess to be run each time the neural network generates \\[samples] some original\\* data.\n\n\\*original being used loosely here, as poorly managed neural nets are prone to overfitting, or providing samples which are not unique enough to be considered original data...\n\nThis was sort of a crazy idea to me, to think that I could potentially train a NN on encrypted (seemingly junk) data, and then when it generates its own gobbledygook, being able to run the decrypt script on it which would turn out to be accurate, legible, and coherent. But it lines up perfectly with what I am trying to do. (**Is encrypted intellectual property still intellectual property in this case?**) \n\nWithin the repo, the encrypted IP data is junk, meaningless and without context. Within the neural network, which would be training on the encrypted data, it's also arguably meaningless. At least, is not utilizing or infringing on any intellectual property in any straightforward way. Only when the user tells the neural network to generate some Seuss\\-like text, it spits out what it has learned. But what it has learned will be, for all intensive porpoises, an illegible layer of encrypted nonsense. Only after running the output through the decrypt will it even remotely resemble the works of Seuss.\n\nSo... what about all that? :) **Does any of this resemble something legal?** Or are they just pipe dreams with little basis in the reality of law?\n\nAgain, remember that due to overfitting, the sort of black\\-box system I've described could potentially output data that decrypts into verbatim Seuss intellectual property. But in reality, the level of 'closeness' to Seuss falls along a spectrum, which I informally call 'variable likeness.' If the sample is too exact, its overfit (which is a bad thing unless the user just wanted a really complicated program to print out exact Seuss stuff all along). On the other hand, if it is incomprehensible or nonsensical, it needs to keep learning, or start learning differently.\n\nAlso remember that the decrypt script would still exist somewhere in the repo, and someone could potentially use it or modify it to decrypt the actual IP dataset. But to be fair, that's their potential infringement, not mine.\n\nFinal question, which may seem weird: Does the copyright holder of Dr. Seuss' work also hold the copyright to anything resembling the 'variable likenesses' of Seuss as I have described? In other words, **could decrypted samples generated from this network constitute Seuss IP, seeing as all the machine learned on was encrypted Seuss IP in the first place**?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: If it is fair use to copy it *en clair* then it is fair use to copy it enciphered.

What are the measures that I need to take to ensure it's legal?\n\nAnd one extra question: If I want introduce the ability for my users to login and comment on my website, will I be able to use a US database to store user emails and comments?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'd rather not, but this might be compliant if you make sure that the personal data under your responsibility remains secure and protected even if it is processed abroad.\n\nSince the UK has left the EU, it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between implications of the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR. These are functionally equivalent, but in the matter of international data transfers the practical details have diverged.\n\nIn [my answer](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/77286) that you cited, I argued that any website processes personal data, and is thus potentially in\\-scope for the GDPR. If you cause another organization to process this personal data outside of the UK, you are performing an international data transfer (called \u201crestricted transfer\u201d in UK guidance). For example, such non\\-UK processing occurs if you use cloud services that run outside of the UK.\n\nThe UK ICO has [guidance on international data transfers](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/#adequacy). As in an EU GDPR context, you can only perform the transfer if the data remains suitably protected, or one of the exceptions applies. The data remains suitably protected if the target country was attested and \u201cadequate\u201d level of data protection, or if you have implemented appropriate safeguards.\n\nAs of 2022, the list of countries considered adequate is generally equivalent to the EU list of adequacy decisions. Notably, the US is no longer on that list after the Schrems II decision that invalidated the Privacy Shield Agreement. Since this decision was made before Exit Day, it also applies in the UK.\n\nThis leaves \u201cappropriate safeguards\u201d for UK\u2192US restricted transfers. In the linked ICO page, read the section [Is the restricted transfer covered by appropriate safeguards?](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-transfers-after-uk-exit/#appropriate). In brief, you will need to perform a Transfer Impact Assessment, and sign Standard Contractual Clauses with the US data importer.\n\n* In a Transfer Impact Assessment (TIA), you check that the data remains protected despite the transfer into a country without an adequate level of data protection.\n\nThere is no official guidance on conducting a TIA, but the [IAPP has a template](https://iapp.org/resources/article/transfer-impact-assessment-templates/) and the EU EDPB has [recommendations on supplemental measures to protect data transfers](https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/default/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf), which might reduce the risk and affect a TIA in your favor.\n\nIt's worth noting that the EDPB recommendations were written in the wake of the Schrems II ruling, and can be summarized as \u201ccompliance is impossible when using US\\-based cloud services\u201d. But this is your assessment, and TBH it seems the UK is a bit more relaxed than the EU in this regard.\n* The Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) are a pre\\-formulated contract that binds the foreign data importer to handle the data properly. In essence, this translates relevant aspects of the UK GDPR into contract law.\n\nMany service providers already provide a Data Processing Agreement that includes SCCs by reference, but you'll have to make sure that these contracts have been entered in a legally binding manner. Sometimes these apply automatically as part of the terms of service, sometimes you need to explicitly sign these documents.\n\nBut SCCs are one detail where UK GDPR compliance and EU GDPR compliance diverges a bit. The old EU SCC templates from 2004/2010 can no longer be used and have been replaced.\n\nFor compliance with the EU GDPR, the new [2021 SCCs](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en) must be used.\n\nFor compliance with the UK GDPR, you have [two options](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/). You can either use the 2022 International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA), or you can use the 2021 EU SCCs along with the 2022 UK International Data Transfer Addendum which modifies the EU SCCs in some details.\n\nDon't want to deal with TIAs and SCCs?

However, it's not sufficient on its own.\n\nB) Signing Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) with the US data importer is an important measure to ensure legal compliance. The UK GDPR allows for either the 2022 International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) or the 2021 EU SCCs with the UK International Data Transfer Addendum. However, SCCs alone are not enough.\n\nC) Obtaining explicit consent from website users for data transfer to the US is NOT sufficient on its own to ensure GDPR compliance. While consent can be a legal basis for processing data, it does not override the need for appropriate safeguards in international data transfers, especially to countries deemed \"unsafe\" like the US.\n\nD) Switching to a hosting provider that processes data only in the UK or countries with adequacy decisions would indeed solve the international data transfer issue, as it would eliminate the need for additional safeguards. However, this is not the only solution and may not be practical for all website owners.\n\nThe correct approach would involve a combination of measures, including conducting a TIA and implementing appropriate safeguards such as SCCs, rather than relying on user consent alone."}, "46": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/48568/handling-immeasurable-abstract-concepts-in-a-contract", "docs_id": 48568, "title": "Handling immeasurable / abstract concepts in a contract", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: Professional negligence is somewhat related in the sense that it's generally recognizable in extremes, but is overall too abstract to define with much granularity.

If you want somebody to be \"reasonably kind\" you need to spell out what that means so that there is no question when it comes to breaking the contract. \n\nFor example, your contract should state something like:\n\n> I (Seph Reed, herein \"me\") will be John Doe's friend and provide\n>  snacks (defined in Section B) as long as John Doe:\n> \n> \n> * Does not call me names\n> * Invites me to at least 1 social activity per week\n> * etc...\n\nThe contract needs to be specific because if you want to ever break the contract you need to be able to prove a breach. Specifically in the above if \"John Doe\" texted that you are a \"STUCK\\-UP, HALF\\-WITTED, SCRUFFY\\-LOOKING NERF HERDER\", you could break your contract for a breach of item 1\\. \n\nHaving vagueness in a contract invites a lawsuit, one which may be expensive for you.

On May 15th, the landlord informs the tenant that the property is being sold. On June 1st, the tenant is notified that the house has been sold and is given 30 days to vacate.

The new owner typically purchases the property subject to any existing lease agreements. Therefore, the tenant likely has the right to stay until the end of their lease (October 1st) despite the property's sale. The 30-day notice to vacate may be illegal if it contradicts the terms of the existing lease.\n\nRegarding the security deposit, its return is generally dependent on the condition of the property when the tenant moves out, not on the circumstances of the lease termination. The laws governing security deposits can vary by jurisdiction, but typically, the deposit should be returned minus any legitimate deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are incorrect as they misrepresent the tenant's rights or the handling of the security deposit under most common-law systems.

What is a reasonable price is a question of fact dependent on the circumstances of each particular case.\n\nAccording to the Statute, that means that the agreement you entered into either had a **fixed** price of $42 \\+ GST, or a **non\\-fixed price**. If it had a fixed price, then the price must be $42 \\+ GST. If it is not a fixed price, then per (2\\), you (the buyer) must pay a 'reasonable price'.\n\nReally this probably mirrors the Common Law. In a contract, when a valid agreement is made, one party cannot unilaterally vary the terms of the contract. That means they cannot unilaterally change the price, UNLESS there is a term in the contract that allows them to do so. Alternatively, in the event that price is silent, the contract would either be void for being uncertain, or a reasonable price would be implied.\n\nTo answer your question succinctly then, I'd say you probably had a contract with a fixed price, and therefore the seller is under a duty to sell you the goods at $42 \\+ GST, and so you are NOT obliged to pay the new price.", "date": "N/A"}, "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the given documentation:\n\nQuestion: A customer orders a product online for $100 + 10% tax.

Which of the following is most accurate regarding the legal obligations in this situation?\n\nA) The customer must pay the new price of $150 + 10% tax, as the company has the right to correct pricing errors at any time before delivery.\n\nB) The original order is void due to the pricing discrepancy, and neither party has any obligation to proceed with the transaction.\n\nC) The customer can insist on the original price of $100 + 10% tax, as this was likely a fixed price contract that cannot be unilaterally changed by the seller.\n\nD) The customer must pay a \"reasonable price\" to be determined by a court, regardless of either the original or new price quoted.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: According to the principles outlined in the Sale of Goods Act and common law contract principles, when a valid agreement is made with a fixed price, one party cannot unilaterally vary the terms of the contract. In this case, the original order at $100 + 10% tax likely constitutes a fixed price contract. The seller's attempt to change the price after the order was placed and confirmed would generally not be legally binding, unless there was a specific term in the contract allowing for price adjustments. The customer can typically insist on the original agreed-upon price, making option C the most accurate response.\n\nOption A is incorrect because sellers generally cannot unilaterally change fixed prices after an order is placed. Option B is incorrect because a pricing error doesn't automatically void a contract if the terms were clear at the time of agreement. Option D is incorrect because a \"reasonable price\" typically only applies when the original contract did not specify a fixed price, which is not the case here."}, "56": {"documentation": {"source": "https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/59274/in-the-uk-can-a-private-limited-company-have-as-its-only-shareholder-a-juridica", "docs_id": 59274, "title": "In the UK, can a private limited company have as its only shareholder a juridical person?", "section": "N/A", "start_character": "N/A", "end_character": "N/A", "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: The reason I'm asking is that a bank refused to open a business current account for us upon me divulging the information in the title during the application process.

Banks, like any other business, have the right to choose who they will and won't do business with.

If he successfully contests paternity, he may be able to avoid child support obligations.
