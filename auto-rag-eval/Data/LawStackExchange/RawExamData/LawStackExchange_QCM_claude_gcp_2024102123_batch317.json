This has also been done by a professional association for the professional title \"Realtor(R)\".\n\nSimilar approaches are used for vendor certifications such as UL for Underwriter's Labs and BBB for Better Business Bureau approved.\n\nIn the absence of other legislation governing professional regulation in the field, no government approval is necessary to set up the scheme. But, there are some regulated professions (e.g. law and medicine) which routinely regulate the advertising of specialities and certifications by members of their professions who are regulated.\n\nNone of these would be proper to use on an official identification card in most cases.\n\nThis is much less strict than, for example, Germany, where this kind of thing is tightly regulated.",

Which of the following steps is NOT typically necessary for the company to legally establish this certification in the United States?\n\nA) Obtain a trademark for the \"CAI\" designation\nB) Create a licensing system for certificate holders\nC) Develop a system to monitor and enforce proper use of the designation\nD) Seek approval from a federal regulatory body\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: \nA is incorrect because obtaining a trademark for the designation (in this case, \"CAI\") is a common and important step in establishing a certification program. This protects the designation from unauthorized use.\n\nB is incorrect as creating a licensing system for certificate holders is typically part of the process. This allows the company to control who can use the designation and under what conditions.\n\nC is incorrect because developing a system to monitor and enforce proper use of the designation is crucial to maintain the integrity and value of the certification.\n\nD is the correct answer because, according to the information provided, there is usually no need to seek approval from a federal regulatory body to establish a certification program in an unregulated field. The question specifies that this is not in a highly regulated area like healthcare or education.\n\nThis question tests the understanding that in the United States, creating a certification program in an unregulated field generally doesn't require government approval, but does involve trademark protection, licensing, and enforcement measures."

You then have to do everything else. The seller does not normally go the the DMV with you, but you have to be sure that the title is properly transferred. You don't need an SSN to actually buy property, but that doesn't mean that you won't need one for a later purpose related to the car. Writing a false sale amount is a legal red flag. Liability insurance is mandatory, so you should have the vehicle insured per the state rule before you drive it. That is the summary. Now the details.\n\nIn California, the seller must notify the state of the transfer within 5 days. The buyer must do their part within 10 days. For the buyer, this means providing the original title, bill of sale if the seller is not the person on the title, smog certificate (perhaps) and odometer reading (perhaps). There are also fees. [This page](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/titles/title-transfers-and-changes/) gives you the relevant forms. A notary may be required for some forms (meaning the owner/seller has to go somewhere), for example to apply for a duplicate title (if they lost it)\n\n[This page](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-registration/insurance-requirements/) describes the liability requirements in California. You must be insured if you drive or park on California roadways, which implies that you have to get insurance before or at the time you buy the car.

This aligns with the information provided that the buyer must complete their part within 10 days and submit required documents.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the seller does not typically go to the DMV with the buyer. The seller's responsibility is to notify the state of the transfer within 5 days, separately from the buyer's process.\n\nOption B is incorrect because insurance is required before driving the car on California roadways. The information clearly states that you must be insured if you drive or park on California roadways, implying that insurance should be obtained at or before the time of purchase.\n\nOption D is incorrect because according to CVC 1653.5, an applicant for a driver's license must provide a social security account number.

I was approved and the assistance I will be receiving is much more than I expected. My landlord has no objections to me making some improvements and replacing the oven with a better one.\n\nWhat phrasing is appropriate in my lease for this? Basically, I want all future rent and rent increases to be commensurate with the rent I am paying now, before I make the improvements?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: We don't give specific legal advice and one might VTC, but I think your phrasing is not quite right, and you are just curious about the possibility of binding the landlord to a term across leases.\n\nThe first thing that a term in a contract has to so is say exactly what must be done by whom (or not done). You need to describe more precisely what it means for all future rent and rent increases to be commensurate with the current rent. You can think of conditions like \"no more than 2% per annum\" or \"no more than 15% per annum\", and then you can figure out what number is acceptable to the two of you. I would be surprised if you could come up with an agreeable number.\n\nSecond, you'd have to make this limit \"perpetual\", which is pretty much impossible. You *could* negotiate the terms of the next lease today which would prevent an increase of rent by more thay you're happy with, but until governmental controls say exactly what a legal rent increase is, the property owner has the right to raise the rent by a million dollars, and you have the right to move elsewhere. It's as hard to permanently lock a landlord into an arrangement as it is to lock a tenant into renting a specific residence. Every year, you have the right to terminate the lease if the rent goes too high for you, and every year the landlord has the right to raise the rent if the current arrangement isn't sufficiently profitable.\n\nIncidentally, you might want to check with [AHFC](https://www.alaskahousingrelief.org/resources/ahfc-safety-net-program) to see if you can actually do this. Your expectations don't determine what relief they provide, just make sure that you provided accurate answers to their questions and reported all income that you're required to report.",

The documentation states that it's \"pretty much impossible\" to make such limits perpetual. The landlord retains the right to adjust rent with each new lease term, and the tenant has the right to decide whether to accept the new terms or move elsewhere.\n\nOption A is incorrect because permanently locking in rent rates is not feasible, as explained in the documentation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the documentation doesn't mention AHFC allowing such use of funds. In fact, it advises checking with AHFC about the permitted uses of the assistance.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the documentation does not mention any such governmental rent control in Alaska.

In the United States, employers have broad discretion in their hiring practices, with few exceptions. While there are protected characteristics (such as race, sex, national origin, and disability status) that cannot be used as a basis for discrimination in hiring, a history of legal action against the company is not one of these protected categories. Therefore, it would be legal for a company to decline to hire someone because they had previously sued the company, even in small claims court. This highlights a potential imbalance in the legal system, where the act of seeking justice for a relatively small amount in small claims court could potentially have much larger consequences in terms of future employment opportunities.

Which of the following responses from the hotel would most likely comply with the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008?\n\nA) The hotel denies any pest issues, stating they have a perfect record.\nB) The hotel discloses the bed bug report but doesn't mention the swift resolution.\nC) The hotel provides a vague response, saying they occasionally receive pest reports but handle them promptly.\nD) The hotel discloses the recent bed bug report, the immediate action taken, and the confirmation that the issue was resolved.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: Option D is the most compliant with the regulations. It provides material information that an average consumer would need to make an informed decision, without omitting or hiding relevant facts. It considers the full context, including the swift resolution of the issue. Options A and B involve misleading omissions, while C is potentially unclear or ambiguous. Option D balances transparency with the full context, allowing the consumer to make an informed choice without likely causing undue concern given the prompt and effective resolution of the issue."

The purchaser signed a simple one\\-page contract. The dealer accepted the offer and a deposit of earnest money. The contract was as follows:\n\n1. Contains full agreed on price and agreement to purchase as is, no odometer reading stated\n2. Contains pickup location and states that the purchaser will arrange shipping, no dates given\n3. Contains a standard (to the dealer) used equipment warranty\n4. Specifically states they are obligated to provide the equipment, but are released from liability where supply, shipping or manufacturing difficulties occur.\n5. Has no arbitration or attorney fee clause\n\nThe purchaser also received odometer picture same day implying I am buying equipment with x hours on it (the purchaser specifically requested this).\n\nState of dealership: Minnesota\n\n6 weeks goes by. The equipment is not ready to ship yet. The reason given by the dealer: The old owner consigning this does not want to let it go until he receives a new unit from South Korea and it is taking longer than expected due to covid! Furthermore, the purchaser discovers the equipment is back at the original owner's farm though, they \"claim\" they are not using it. Dealership informed the purchaser of an option to back out.\n\nTher season is now into the spring and it's impossible to get anything at all till fall. Ther purchaser will incur approximately $15k\\-$20k in rental fees for the summer \\+ many hours lost dealing with this dealership and has not been searching for another similar equipment due to already being under written contract on this one.\n\nFurthermore, what would be a logical (to a judge) judgement? Simply the amount of rental fees \\+ the earnest money? Time and cost additional to dealing with a rental and taking them to court \\+ attorney fees? Difference in price for something that is readily available / similar equipment?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> what would be a logical (to a judge) judgement? Simply the amount of rental fees \\+ my earnest money?\n\nThis depends on when consignment ended. If the equipment was still on consignment at the time the dealership received the earnest money (or perhaps even when you two entered the contract, if earlier), the dealership's allegation of \"supply difficulty\" would fail because the equipment was under dealership's control. By receiving the earnest money, the dealership incurred a duty to preserve your rights pursuant to the contract.\n\nThe allegation about owner's refusal to release the equipment is devoid of merit. The Covid mess began long before you and the dealership entered the agreement. This means that the owner had plenty of time to end or rescind the consignment in order to prevent the equipment from being offered and sold. The owner failed to rescind the consignment timely. Altogether the owner's belated whim falls short of \"supply difficulty\".\n\nBy contrast, if the equipment no longer was on consignment by the time you paid, the dealership may avail itself of item 4 of the contract on grounds of supply difficulty. Consequently, that would preclude multiple concepts for which you intend to pursue relief, such as rent and the expenses from having to look elsewhere. The only relief to which you are entitled would be in the form of either specific performance or reimbursement of earnest money.\n\nConsignment aside, an award for the \"*\\[d]ifference in price for something that is readily available*\" can be ruled out. Your depiction of the contract purports no clause or material assumption in the sense of committing to offer you the lowest price (that is, compared to competitors). Although you might persuade the dealership to pay the difference in price as part of a settlement, that item in and of itself is not premised on the contract.",

The dealership had a duty to preserve the buyer's rights, and the owner's refusal doesn't qualify as a \"supply difficulty\" under the contract. \nD) is incorrect because it's too limited if the dealership was at fault; however, this could be the outcome if the consignment had ended before the sale.\n\nThe correct answer is C because rental fees for substitute equipment plus the return of earnest money represent actual damages incurred by the purchaser due to the dealership's failure to deliver the equipment as agreed, assuming the dealership was at fault for the non-delivery."

Furthermore, uploading and disseminating the digital copy to an unspecified and unlimited number of recipients in return for consideration, is also not covered, as the rental store only paid for renting out a physical copy. The maximum number of viewers per year is therefore about 365, which allows an estimation of the adequate royalties to be paid by the rental store.

I was furious, naturally, and insisted in multiple conversations with my lawyer that these guys were fraudsters, but my lawyer (who didn't seem to believe me) kept telling me \"Nah, this is in good faith, just pay up and settle and move on.\" So I did.

Board of Education (347 U.S. 483, 1954) in an academic article using author-year in-text citations, which of the following is the most appropriate approach?\n\nA) (Warren, 1954), as Earl Warren delivered the opinion of the Court\nB) (USSC, 1954), using the abbreviation for United States Supreme Court\nC) (Brown v. Board of Education, 1954)\nD) Do not use author-year format; instead, cite as \"Brown v Board of Education 347 U.S. 483\"\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: According to the documentation provided, it's best not to try to force court opinions into an author-year format. Instead, the recommended approach is to use a standard legal citation. The Chicago Manual of Style, as well as MLA and APA, defer to The Bluebook for legal citations. For Supreme Court cases, the basic format is to cite the case name, volume, source, and page number. In this case, \"Brown v Board of Education 347 U.S. 483\" would be the appropriate citation. \n\nOption A is incorrect because citing the delivering justice as the author is not standard practice for legal citations. \nOption B is incorrect because using an abbreviation like USSC is not a recognized format for citing court cases. \nOption C, while closer to the correct format, still attempts to force the citation into an author-year format, which is not recommended for legal citations. \nOption D is the most appropriate as it follows the standard legal citation format recommended by multiple style guides for academic writing."

There is no scope for dispute here.\n\nIf it wasn't, then one has to ask how has Company B been using it for 7 years? There is scope for dispute here.

If Company A owned the domain and the entire company was sold, then the new owner (Owner B) would have clear rights to all assets of the company, including the domain. This situation leaves no room for the former owner to claim personal ownership or licensing rights over the domain.\n\nOption A could lead to disputes over the terms and duration of the license agreement.\nOption B, while potentially favorable for Owner B, still leaves some room for dispute over the terms of the asset transfer.\nOption D would likely result in a complex legal dispute, as the domain ownership was not clearly transferred in the sale of business assets."

However, if it doesn't meet fair use criteria, YouTube's terms of service come into play. These terms grant certain licenses to YouTube and other users, but they don't automatically allow for republication outside of the platform. The journalist would need to ensure their use complies with these terms or seek additional permissions.

See my answer to another question about [double recovery](https://law.stackexchange.com/a/26335/5045) for more about the general principles that apply when a plaintiff attempts to recover the same loss from multiple defendants.\n\nIn the specific context of insurance, there will normally be terms in the insurance contract as well as local statutes which require the claimant to notify the insurers of one another\u2019s existence, and determine the extent to which the insurer who paid can recover [contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contribution_claim_(legal)) from the insurer who didn\u2019t.

The homeowner has separate car insurance and home insurance policies, each with a $500 deductible. Assuming both policies cover the incident, what is the maximum amount the homeowner could legally receive from filing claims with both insurance companies?\n\nA) $20,000, as they can claim the full amount from each policy\nB) $10,000, as they can only recover the total loss once\nC) $9,000, as they must pay the deductible for each policy\nD) $9,500, as they only need to pay one deductible\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: This scenario involves \"double insurance,\" where multiple insurance policies cover the same loss. The key principle is that while the homeowner can file claims with both insurance companies, they can only recover the actual loss once. In this case, the total loss is $10,000. However, each policy has a $500 deductible, which the homeowner must pay. Therefore, the maximum amount they could receive is $9,000 ($10,000 minus $500 from each policy). Answer A is incorrect because it would constitute illegal double recovery. Answer B doesn't account for the deductibles. Answer D is incorrect because the homeowner must pay the deductible for each policy they claim against. The correct answer, C, accounts for both the principle of single recovery and the application of both deductibles."

This means that the President can pardon individuals convicted of crimes committed in Washington, D.C., including serious felonies like murder, as long as they were prosecuted in the Superior Court or federal courts.

This is because the company has sought government protection against its creditors, and in return, it must follow certain rules and procedures overseen by the court. The court ensures that the company's actions are in the best interest of all parties involved, including creditors. Therefore, the company needs to obtain court approval before liquidating its stores. Option A is incorrect because the company cannot act unilaterally in this situation. Option B is wrong because while creditors' interests are considered, the court, not the creditors, gives the final approval. Option D is also incorrect as the company cannot close stores at will and must get pre-approval, not just inform the court afterwards."

If a renter paid the damage deposit, and rent, and upon leaving the landlord refuses to return the damage deposit, how can the renter prove that he did in fact live there in court? Even if rent and damage deposit was paid through internet etransfer, it doesn't necessarily show it was for rent.\n\nI know a person this happened to and he had to move out because the other tenants were doing drugs and the landlord refused to kick them out.

If it was paid by cash, there's probably no recourse without additional facts.\n\nHowever, if it was paid electronically, then even if there's no narration (description) that claims that the payment was for rent, it is still possible that you would be able to file a summons requiring the recipient bank to produce the information relating to the entity that holds the account the money was sent to.\n\nThe information they have may be limited, but generally this would include:\n\n* Name\n* Address\n* Date of birth (for natural persons)\n* Phone number\n\nThe above information is typically required under anti\\-money laundering and counter\\-terrorist funding legislation.\n\nAdditionally, if it was paid electronically, the regularity of the payments and the regular amounts may be persuasive.\n\nFinally, it's not proof, but you can swear an affidavit or a statutory declaration attesting to the truth of your assertions, but without additional evidence (the aforementioned transaction information), it doesn't really hold weight on its own.",

Reverse engineering involves taking an executable you get when you buy the game, and seeing where the code stores information.\n\nBased on this information, you can make a program to access the information you found while reversing, and modify it to give you an advantage. \n\nI've only read some stuff on the DMCA, but I am unsure if this qualifies for it. Most games have an \"anti\\-cheat\" which try to detect people who use cheats and ban them from the game. As a cheat developer, you have to bypass these counter measures, and sometimes these counter measures are present in the executable in the form of packing / obfuscation which just makes it harder to analyze.\n\nIf I take information from an executable given to me since I bought a game, and make a game cheat based on the information then sell, is this illegal?\n\nIf you have any questions, let me know. I live in the United States.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Yes\n---\n\nThe relevant legal concepts are [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright), [contract law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract) and the [Computer Fraud and Abuse Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act). You are liable to be sued by the people affected for damages and/or be prosecuted by the government for the felony under either or both laws.\n\nLet's start here: \"I bought a game\". **No, you didn't**; you bought a licence to use the software in accordance with the terms of service (licence) that you freely agreed to. **All modern ToS will not allow you to reverse engineer the software.** \n\nIf you breach those terms of service then you have broken a contract \\- that is what allows them to sue you. They will no doubt argue that the prevalence of cheat routines developed by people like you reduce the number of people willing to play the game \\- say 100,000 users x $10/month \\* 12 months \\= $12,000,000\\. They will also ask the court to impose punitive damages to discourage this sort of thing.\n\nWhich brings us to the copyright violation. You are allowed to copy their software provided you comply with the ToS. But you didn't. Therefore you are in breach of the Copyright Act and subject to additional civil and criminal sanctions.\n\nFinally, your \"cheats\" access their servers in a way that the ToS doesn't authorize. This puts you in breach of the CFFA \\- breaking this carries serious jail time penalties. Not to mention that in the US, a criminal conviction will preclude you from many jobs, including, naturally, any with access to company computer systems.\n\nPutting aside the illegalities, cheats are unethical and ruin the game experience for hundreds of thousands of people who don't use cheats.\n\n**You are a criminal \\- stop being one!**",

The documentation clearly states that developing and selling game hacks likely violates multiple laws:\n\n1. Copyright law: By reverse engineering the game software in violation of the Terms of Service, the developer is breaching copyright.\n\n2. Contract law: The Terms of Service that come with purchasing a game license typically prohibit reverse engineering, so creating hacks violates this contract.\n\n3. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA): Accessing game servers in unauthorized ways (as hacks often do) can violate this act.\n\nAnswer A is incorrect because merely purchasing the game does not grant rights to reverse engineer or modify it.\n\nAnswer B is partially true but incomplete, as it only addresses the CFAA violation and ignores copyright and contract law issues.\n\nAnswer C is incorrect because both creating and selling the hacks can be illegal under the mentioned laws."

It also opens the person up to criminal liability, although enforcement of non\\-commercial copyright infringement is relatively rare. Using bittorrent once could make a person liable for felony copyright infringement depending on the value of the work and the number of copies made with the assistance of the person's bittorrent client.\n\nMost technology used for piracy is also insecure\\-\\-bittorrent, for example, works by sending out advertisements to many people saying that you would like to copy their file, and could they please send you a small bit of it. Although the book publishing companies do not usually spend much time worrying about this, the other media publishing companies do (and hire investigators to be those other people you sent messages to). Book publishing companies can change their minds. Generally, piracy is a bad idea.\n\nMentioning it not only provides evidence against the defendant if the publisher chooses to sue (possible) or the police choose to arrest them (unlikely but possible), but also raises the possibility of harm to reputation or not getting a job in the future. \n\nFor example, a major movie reviewer in 2009 reviewed a workprint copy of Wolverine and was immediately fired.\n\nBut openly discussing past criminal activity is also usually a sign of bad judgment that employers will not look on with understanding. If a simple google search shows the employee discussing his criminal history, even if it is over a relatively controversial area of law such as copyright violation, many employers will move on to the next applicant.",

Which of the following is the MOST likely consequence of John's actions?\n\nA) John will be immediately arrested by the police for copyright infringement.\nB) John will face a criminal trial and potential jail time for piracy.\nC) John may have difficulty finding employment in the future due to his online admission.\nD) John will receive a warning letter from his Internet Service Provider.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: While downloading copyrighted material without permission is illegal and can lead to both civil and criminal penalties, the most likely immediate consequence in this scenario is option C. The documentation emphasizes that openly discussing past criminal activity, even for controversial areas like copyright violation, shows poor judgment that many employers would view negatively. A simple internet search revealing John's admission could cause potential employers to reject his application.\n\nOption A is unlikely, as the documentation states that enforcement of non-commercial copyright infringement is relatively rare. Option B, while possible, is also unlikely for the same reason. Option D, while a possibility, is not specifically mentioned in the given information and is less likely to have long-term consequences compared to the reputational damage described in option C."

According to the documentation, taking nude photographs of babies is generally legal, as long as they are not obscene or pornographic. However, sharing such photographs, even with innocent intent, can potentially lead to legal troubles. There have been cases where parents were charged with sexual exploitation of a minor for sharing nude pictures of their children. Therefore, while taking the photos for a private family album is likely legal, sharing them on social media or other public platforms could potentially result in criminal charges. \n\nOption A is incorrect because taking non-sexual, non-obscene nude photographs of babies is not inherently illegal. \nOption C is overly broad, as even private photographs could potentially raise legal issues if discovered or shared.\nOption D is incorrect because there is no specific age cutoff mentioned in the documentation for when such photographs become illegal."

What's more correct to write than \"no contract\"?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Thus how ought these advertisements be rectified? What's more correct\n> to write than \"no contract\"?\n\nWords don't mean the same thing in every context.\n\nIn the world of cell phone contracts, the well accepted meaning of \"no contract\" is that you are getting cell phone service on a month to month basis and may cancel at the end of any given month with no penalty, in contrast to the previous norm in the industry that you needed to continue service for a period of one or more years before you could cancel or you would pay a penalty for discontinuing it early. This usage has spread to Internet service as well.\n\nThere is no need to correct or rectify this. Nobody believes that there is no agreement governing the cell phone company\\-customer relationship. They aren't confused or misled.\n\nMcKendrick is simply using a different sense of the word than CanNet.\n\nIn the same way, the word \"company\" can mean a legal entity, but can also mean, the people whom you have with you at a given time, even though they have the same root meaning.\n\nLikewise, sometimes \"sex\" means \"male or female\" and sometimes it means something you do for enjoyment and procreation. But people manage to keep the two senses of the word, which are related to each other, straight, even in statutes.\n\nContext prevents confusion. There is no need for words to have only one meaning in all contexts and even within the law, many words mean different things in different situations. This is especially true in common law systems where words are given definitions in a piecemeal case by case manner, rather than due to a single person or committee making a top down decision on what a word's legal meaning should be in all contexts.",

In the context of ISP and cell phone service advertisements, \"no contract\" has come to mean that the service is provided on a month-to-month basis and can be cancelled at any time without penalty. This is in contrast to long-term contracts that require customers to commit to a specific period of service.\n\nOption A is incorrect because there is still a legally binding agreement between the customer and the ISP, even if it's not a long-term contract. The term \"no contract\" doesn't mean there's no legal relationship at all.\n\nOption C is incorrect because personal information is still required for service provision and billing purposes, regardless of the contract type.\n\nOption D is incorrect because ISPs still have terms of service that customers must adhere to, even in \"no contract\" arrangements.\n\nThis question tests the understanding of industry-specific terminology and the importance of context in interpreting legal language. It also highlights the difference between colloquial usage of terms in advertising and their strict legal definitions."

It was my first day and although I didn't help with making most of the teas (since they hadn't taught me yet) I thought it was a lot of work for \"unpaid training\".

In the UK, employers are required to pay at least the National Minimum Wage for all hours worked, including training periods. The arrangement described in the question, where a young worker is expected to complete 80 hours of unpaid work before being eligible for paid employment, would be considered illegal under UK labor laws. Even if the worker consents or if other employees have undergone similar unpaid training, it doesn't make the practice legal. Short unpaid trial shifts of a few hours may be permissible in some circumstances, but extended unpaid \"training\" periods like the one described are not legal. It's important to note that internships or work experience programs affiliated with educational institutions may have different rules, but this doesn't appear to be the case in the given scenario."

In addition, they did not collect any taxes or issue a pay stub. They deposited the money in my checking account via wire transfer.\n\nNow I am with no income and unable to file for unemployment. In addition, I will now have to pay back taxes and don't even have a job.\n\nDo I have any legitimate cause for filing a lawsuit against this employer?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: **Summary**\n\nIf they didn't steal your withholding, it depends a great deal. But if your employer stole your withholding, the IRS will sue them on your behalf. You will absolutely have grounds to sue them, and because tax law is so cut and dried in these situations, in that case, you will almost certainly win.\n\n---\n\nYou need to contact the IRS immediately and advise them what your employer has done. This is more important than anything else because until you do, you can't be sure the IRS will figure out what happened (they might. They're really good at tax stuff).\n\nIf your employer didn't advise you that you are now responsible for paying your own quarterly estimated income taxes, the IRS will almost certainly grant you relief from penalties for failure to file timely and they could potentially abate interest as well, depending on the circumstances. They are especially likely to grant penalty and possibly interest abatement if you've never filed 1099 before.\n\nIf your employer withheld tax from your pay that they then failed to turn over to the IRS, good news for you \\- bad news for them. The IRS takes no mercy whatsoever on employers who steal tax withholding from employees. Advising the IRS that this may have been the case is all you should need to do \\- the IRS can check its own records, your employer's records, etc. They will let you know once they've determined whether your money is where it's supposed to be; if anything is out of order, rest assured they will already be pursuing the case against your employer. In this case, the IRS will waive all penalties and interest that may have been assessed as a consequence of your employer's failure to turn over your withholding.\n\nIf you are currently unable to pay, that's not the end of the world. Make the IRS aware of your current financial circumstances and your inability to pay due to unemployment. They have installment agreements you can request, or if that won't work, they can temporarily suspend collection action while you get things straightened out. There's a bunch of paperwork they'll ask for, and penalties and interest will continue to accrue, but as long as you let them know the situation, they will apply a dramatically reduced rate to reflect your efforts to comply.",

What is the MOST important immediate action the employee should take?\n\nA) File a lawsuit against the employer for wrongful termination\nB) Apply for unemployment benefits in Ohio\nC) Contact the IRS to report the employer's actions\nD) Hire a tax attorney to negotiate with the employer\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The most important immediate action is to contact the IRS to report the employer's actions. This is crucial because:\n\n1. It allows the IRS to investigate the situation and potentially provide relief from penalties and interest.\n2. If the employer withheld taxes but failed to remit them, the IRS can pursue action against the employer.\n3. The IRS can advise on proper filing procedures and potential relief options for the employee's current tax situation.\n4. It establishes a record of the employee's attempt to comply with tax laws despite the employer's actions.\n\nOption A is premature without first addressing the tax implications.

There is no office in the U.S. It has nothing to do with U.S. except:\n\n* The owner of the offshore company is a non\\-resident alien in U.S, running the business on the laptop in U.S.\n* Its servers are based in U.S\n\nSo if the owner of the business runs this business outside U.S, no tax at all, but does being in U.S. bring any tax responsibilities? If the owner runs the company in U.S. without being an employee or getting salary, does he have to pay any tax?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: The company probably owes U.S. and state corporate income taxes because income from services performed in the United States are usually considered \"effectively connected\" with the United States. \n\nThe fact that the servers are located in the U.S. is pretty much irrelevant, relative to the fact that the services are performed while located in the United States. I can't think of a single tax case that has ever turned on the location of the servers in a company.\n\nUnlike a U.S. company, a foreign company is not taxed by the U.S. on its worldwide income, nor is the individual, a non\\-resident alien (having an F\\-1 visa rather than a green card) taxes on the individual's worldwide income. But, a non\\-U.S. person is still taxed on income that is effectively connected with the United States.\n\nGenerally speaking income from property is not effectively connected with the United States merely because it is managed by someone located in the U.S., so if the company had owned an apartment in Brazil that it received rental income from, for example, that would not be subject to U.S. taxation.\n\nAlso income from intangible property (like interest payments on loans or dividends on publicly held stock) is generally not subject to U.S. taxation if paid to a non\\-resident, non\\-citizen of the U.S.\n\nBut, generally speaking, income from the performance of services is taxable in the place where the services are performed. For example, Colorado can impose state income taxes on income earned by a Texas baseball player while playing at a stadium in Denver.\n\nThe lack of a salary or employee status shouldn't change the fact that the income received by the company from performance of services in the U.S. is effectively connected with the United States. When the owner performs services in the U.S., the company is performing services in the U.S. and so it is subject to taxation in the U.S.\n\nDividend payments from the offshore company probably wouldn't be subject to U.S. taxation in this scenario, but the company itself would be subject to corporate income taxes in the U.S. from the profits it earned from the services performed in the U.S.",

The offshore company likely owes U.S. corporate income tax on profits derived from services performed in the U.S., as these are considered \"effectively connected\" with the U.S. This is true even if the owner is not a formal employee or doesn't receive a salary. The physical presence of the owner in the U.S. while operating the business is the key factor, not the offshore incorporation or server location. However, as a non-resident alien, the owner personally is not subject to U.S. taxation on worldwide income or on dividend payments from the offshore company. Option A is incorrect because it ignores U.S. tax obligations for services performed in the U.S. Option C wrongly assigns personal tax liability to the owner for all company profits. Option D incorrectly applies worldwide income taxation to both the company and the owner."

I'm writing guide and reference books (Amazon short\\-reads) aimed at people who aren't tech\\-savvy with the goal of improving their tech literacy. I've seen books like the one linked below which are guides to an existing product that don't seem to come with any sort of official seal of approval. I'm wondering if these are just sitting ducks in a legal grey area, or if these are protected by fair use or some other legal defense.\n\n[Here](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B08LCZS49M) is an example of what I'm talking about.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: There are two main kinds of Intellectual property (IP) that might be relevant in writing such a guide: Trademark and Copyright.\n\nTrademark Protection\n====================\n\nA Trademark protects against the use of an identifying word, phrase, design, logo or symbol in the course of advertising or trade by someone who is not the trademark holder without permission from the holder. Specifically, one may **not** use a trademark to make it appear that goods or services are produced, authorized, or endorsed by the trademark holder. One may not use or imitate a trademark in such a way as to confuse consumers or potential consumers about the source of a product or service. If, for example, you use an apple logo on a computer product. and you are not Apple Inc, nor have permission from them, you may well have committed infringement. Infringers may be sued, and significant damages recovered.\n\nThere are, however, some key limits to trademark protection.\n\nNominative use\n--------------\n\n**[Nominative use](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/42273/how-are-programming-books-written-if-language-names-are-trademarked/42289#42289)**, also known as \"nominative fair use\" in the US, is the use of a trademark to identify the product or service being referred to. It is not an infringement to use a trademark to refer to another's goods or services, provided that consumer confusion does not occur.\n\nSpecifically, [15 U.S.C. 1125 (Section 43 of the Lanham Act)](https://www.bitlaw.com/source/15usc/1125.html) (Paragraph (c)(3\\)) provides that the following are *not*\\* infringements:\n\n> (A) Any fair use, including a nominative or descriptive fair use, or facilitation of such fair use, of a famous mark by another person other than as a designation of source for the person's own goods or services, including \u2026\n> \n> \n> \n> > (i) advertising or promotion that permits consumers to compare goods or services; or (ii) identifying and parodying, criticizing, or commenting upon the famous mark owner or the goods or services of the famous mark owner. (B) All forms of news reporting and news commentary. (C) Any noncommercial use of a mark.\n\nIn the US court case [*New Kids on the Block v. News Am. Pub., Inc.*, 971 F.2d 302 (9th Cir. 1992\\)](https://cyber.harvard.edu/metaschool/fisher/domain/tmcases/newkids.htm) the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals held that\n\n> a commercial user is entitled to a nominative fair use defense provided he meets the following three requirements: First, the product or service in question must be one not readily identifiable without use of the trademark; second, only so much of the mark or marks may be used as is reasonably necessary to identify the product or service; \\[FN7] and third, the user must do nothing that would, in conjunction with the mark, suggest sponsorship or endorsement by the trademark holder.\n\nThe footnote (\\#7\\) says:\n\n> Thus, a soft drink competitor would be entitled to compare its product to Coca\\-Cola or Coke, but would not be entitled to use Coca\\-Cola's distinctive lettering.\n\nThus the general rule that [Logos don't constitute nominative use](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/46531/why-cant-logos-of-companies-be-used-by-referring-to-nominative-fair-use). This limitation on nominative use may be different outside the US.\n\n### Compatibility\n\nA specific form of nominative use is using the trademarked name of a product to show that the product being advertised or sold is compatible with the referenced product.\n\n> WonderBatteries can be used with BrandX tools.\n\nSuch a statement may be made without permission of the trademark holder on \"BrandX\".\n\n### Comparative advertising\n\nA claim such as:\n\n> BrandA provides a better user interface than BrandX.\n\nMay be made while marketing BrandA and is not an infringement of the trademark on \"BrandX\", provided that it is made clear that BrandA is not supported or endorsed by BrandX.\n\nUse Not in Trade\n----------------\n\nA publication, such as a user's guide, or a third\\-party (independent) review, which is not selling or advertising a product, may use trademarks to refer to the products that they represent without infringing those marks, because trademarks only protect against the use of the marks \"in trade\". This is rather like nominative use, but is broader. If the person using the mark is not selling or advertising anything, there is no protection at all, and graphic marks may be used as well as mere names. So a Book \"All about Windows 10\" could only be advertised with the name \"Windows 10\", but the book itself could make use of the windows or Microsoft logos, provided that the book is not itself advertising any product or service.\n\nUS First Amendment limitations on Protection\n--------------------------------------------\n\nIn *Matal v. Tam*, The IS Supreme Court ruled that trademark protection, as a restriction on speech and writing, is limited by the US First Amendment. This means that many traditional \"dilution\" and \"tarnishment\" actions will no longer stand up under US law. See sources cited in [What is trademark tarnishment or dilution under US law?](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/39072/what-is-trademark-tarnishment-or-dilution-under-us-law). Such limits apply only under US law.\n\nCopyright Protection\n====================\n\nThe author of a guidebook must also be concerned with copyright protection. Short phrases, such as titles of books, and the names and slogans of products, are not protected by copyright at all.\n\nPassages of significant length, however, are generally subject to copyright protection. Facts and ideas are not protected, but the language used to express facts and ideas often is protected. Unless permission has been secured, an author may not copy extensively from a source, nor closely paraphrase the source. The author must rewrite in original language, although the ideas my be taken from a source or sources.\n\nFair Use or Fair Dealing\n------------------------\n\nLimited quotations, which should normally be clearly marked as quotations, and clearly attributed to their authors, may be used without permission under the concepts of **Fair Use** (in the US) or **Fair dealing** (in several Commonwealth and European countries). The exact scope of these exceptions to copyright protection is different in different countries, and is highly fact\\-based, so that there is no clear formula which will mark out legitimate fair use from infringement. Short quotes, clearly attributed, which would not substitute for the source nor harm the market for the source are likely to be considered as fair use or fair dealing.",

Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding potential legal issues?\n\nA) The author cannot use the Windows logo or screenshots without explicit permission from Microsoft, as this would violate both trademark and copyright laws.\n\nB) The author can freely use the Windows logo and screenshots in the book, but cannot use them in advertising or on the book cover without permission.\n\nC) The author can use screenshots in the book under fair use, but cannot use the Windows logo anywhere without permission.\n\nD) The author can use both the Windows logo and screenshots in the book itself, but should only use the name \"Windows 10\" (without the logo) in advertising or on the cover.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is D. This scenario involves both trademark and copyright considerations. \n\nFor trademark: The author can use the name \"Windows 10\" in advertising and on the cover under nominative use, as it's necessary to identify the subject of the book. However, using the logo in advertising might suggest endorsement, so it's safer to avoid that.\n\nFor copyright and trademark within the book itself: Since the book is not selling or advertising a product (it's just about Windows 10), it falls under \"Use Not in Trade\" for trademarks. This means the author can use the Windows logo inside the book. Screenshots can be used under fair use doctrine for copyright, as they are being used for educational/informational purposes and are unlikely to harm Microsoft's market.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it's overly restrictive. Option B is incorrect because it misunderstands the rules about logos in advertising. Option C is partially correct about screenshots but wrong about the logo use inside the book."

Turned right on highway access road and the vehicle following me turned right across 3 lanes of traffic to follow me. Vehicle behind me hit their lights and with fake police today, like there are, I raced home (which was 3 blocks away.) I figured if it was not the police, I could get home before them and they would not know where I lived. If it truly was the police, they knew where I lived and would come to my house. I pulled into my driveway and waited in the car. The police did show up and approached me asking why I ran from them. I told them just what I said above. The sheriff then said, well you were following all traffic rules until you took off. The sheriffs then ordered me out of the car, asked if there were any drugs in the car, and then proceeded to search the car. When my roommate heard the sheriff yelling out front and saw the lights, she opened the front door and the sheriff told her to not come out of the house and to shut the door. I was arrested for \"evading arrest\" and after the police car that I had been put in left my house, the sheriffs had my car towed. CAN THEY DO THAT?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Assuming, pending information about the jurisdiction, that this happened in the US, the answer is it depends. As described in Justia's [Vehicular Searches](https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/amendment-04/16-vehicular-searches.html) article and Wikipedia's [Motor vehicle exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_exception) article, Under US law police can search a motor vehicle without a warrant if they have probable cause. This doctrine was first stated by the US Supreme Court in [*Carroll v. United States* 267 U.S. 132 (1925\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_v._United_States) and later modified or repeated in *Husty v. United States*, 282 U.S. 694 (1931\\); *Scher v. United States*, 305 U.S. 251 (1938\\); *Brinegar v. United States*, 338 U.S. 160 (1949\\). All of these cases involved contraband, but in *Chambers v. Maroney*, 399 U.S. 42 (1970\\), the Court broadened the rule to evidentiary searches. See also *Coolidge v. New Hampshire*, 403 U.S. 443, 458\u201364 (1971\\)\n\nIn *Preston v. United States*, 376 U.S. 364 (1964\\) the Court ruled that the search must be reasonably contemporaneous with the stop, so that it was not permissible to remove the vehicle to the station house for a warrant\\-less search at the convenience of the police. \n\nSubsequent cases have widened the scope of the exception, although the probable cause requirement has remained, and stops must have at least \"articulable and reasonable suspicion\". In the case of an ordinary traffic stop, the police may conduct a *Terry*\\-type search, based on \"articulable suspicion\". However, if the police arrest the driver, that is grounds to search the car under *Atwater v. City of Lago Vista*, 532 U.S. 318 (2001\\) and *New York v. Belton*, 453 U.S. 454 (1981\\)\n\nUnder *Michigan v. Thomas*, 458 U.S.(and *Chambers v. Maroney*, 399 U.S. 42 (1970\\); *Texas v. White*, 423 U.S. 67 (1975\\); *United States v. Ross*, 456 U.S. 798, 807 note 9 (1982\\).) police may remove the car for a search elsewhere if they have probable cause to believe that there is contraband (such as alcohol, drugs, or weapons) in the car.\n\nThus the arrest justified a search, as described in the question. It might not have justified the tow if there was not probable cause to suspect contraband. But that depends on the detailed facts, and judging those is beyond the scope of this site.\n\nIn [*Collins vs Virginia* (2018\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_v._Virginia) the Court ruled that a warrant\\-less search of a car parked on the owner's property and within the curtilage was not justified. (The \"curtilage\" is the area near the house which gets additional Fourth Amendment protection, almost as if it were inside the house). However, in that case no arrest was made at the time of the search, and the search was based on an officer recalling the car having been used to elude arrest some *two months* previously, not just a few minutes before, so that case may not apply in the situation described above.\n\nIf there was no probable cause, any evidence found might be subject to suppression, and a suit for damages under sec 1983 might be brought against the officers and the police force, but that would depend on the specific facts, and would in practice require a lawyer skilled in such matters.",

The car being in the driveway doesn't fully protect it under the curtilage doctrine (unlike if it were in a closed garage), especially given the immediate nature of the events. Most importantly, the police having reason to suspect drugs provides the crucial element of probable cause, which is required for a warrantless vehicle search under the motor vehicle exception established in Carroll v. United States and subsequent cases.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a car parked inside a closed garage would likely be considered within the home's curtilage and thus require a warrant, as per Collins v. Virginia. \n\nOption B is problematic due to the significant time delay, which violates the \"reasonably contemporaneous\" requirement.\n\nOption D, while potentially legal, lacks the explicit probable cause element that makes C the strongest answer."

On the face of it, there was no force involved: he asked, she rejected and walked away \u2014 something that routinely happens all the time. Were there any laws broken?\n\n**Clarification**\n\nAs the answers and comments point out, the news article may well be omitting details/evidence that would affect whether any laws were broken. However, this question does not aim to find out whether any laws were broken in that particular incident. It aims to discuss a **hypothetical case** where all that happened is what described in the article, nothing more nothing less. Specifically, let's assume:\n\n1. A guy in his 30s\\-40s driving a car stops by a 16\\-year\\-old girl and asks for directions;\n2. He then asks her inappropriate questions;\n3. Finally, he opens the passenger door and asks her to get in;\n4. The girl quickly walks away.\n\nAt no point the guy threatens or tries to force her in, and at no point she has to \"fight back\" as the police communicates what happened.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Broadly speaking no crime was committed.\n----------------------------------------\n\n---\n\nI don't know if harassments is a crime in New Zealand. If it is, then he committed it.\n\nBeing a creepy pervert to people above the age of consent is not a crime. As long as he didn't expose himself. (sadly).\n\nThe young girl in question was 16 which is the age of consent in New Zealand, and it seems like the guy didn't press further when rejected, and was rather open about his intentions. So I would say it would be hard to prove that he had intentions to kidnap the girl.\n\n### That being said\n\nI think this individual needs help. And a warning from an officer about what is/isn't acceptable behavior could prevent this individual from doing somethin bad. This is called proactive law enforcement. As knowing that the law has their eye on you can curb bad behavior.\n\n### On what you are really asking\n\n> This question is basically about whether it was just to presume that the man indeed had criminal intention \\-\\- Greendrake\n\nI think you are confused about something... the police wanting to speak to you in no way implies that they presume that you have committed a crime.\n\nYou do not have have committed a crime to be a person of interest to the police. The police are allowed to look for people who committed a crime, were a witness to a crime, or just need a little heart to heart talk to remind them of the straight and narrow way.\n\nTo put it another way... The police wanting to speak to someone **does not mean that they think the person has committed a crime**.\n\n### What do I think of this incident?\n\nThe polices response, is good. Exactly what they should do. I would hope that the police would try to find an older individual who is driving around town and asking inappropriate questions/making what sounds like sexual suggestions to young teenage girls... Regardless of said teenage girls being over the age of \"consent\". Sounds like this individual is a bit of a pedophile... And I do not use that term lightly. Frankly, I don't think that someone should behave that way any lady regardless of age, manner of dress, etc... And hope to live in a place/time where crime is low enough that the police can address that sort of harassment.\n\nI would not want such an individual driving around in my neighborhood.",

The man did not use force or threats.\n\nB is incorrect because while the actions may not be strictly illegal, they are concerning enough to potentially warrant police attention or investigation.\n\nC is correct because based on the information provided, no clear crime was committed (the girl was of legal age of consent and no force was used), but the behavior is concerning enough that police might want to speak with the individual as a preventative measure or to gather more information.\n\nD is incorrect because the passage does not definitively state that harassment is a crime in New Zealand, and even if it were, this single incident might not meet the legal threshold for criminal harassment."

The district manger happened to be in the store, therefore the cashier asked her. She explained and then we ordered. When we began eating the burger it tasted different. I walked up to the cashier and asked was this a veggie burger? He said no. I stated that was what I ordered. He said he would make a new burger. My husband and I complained to the manger. After we left, my daughter who was still in the restaurant reported that they started laughing at my husband and me. My daughter asked why were they laughing, when her parents were in the car sick from eating meat. They stopped laughing. My daughter asked for the corporate headquarters phone number.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: \n> Can I sue If I was served a real burger after requesting a veggie\n>  burger\n\nI agree that this inquiry significantly overlaps with the post of which this one is marked by NuclearWang as [possible duplicate](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/26950/can-i-sue-a-restaurant-for-serving-me-meat-in-vegetarian-dish). Thus, the answers (such as why breach of contract is inapplicable) and comments provided there largely apply here. I will only address the slight differences.\n\n> I walked up to the cashier and asked was this a veggie burger? He said\n>  no. I stated that it was I ordered. He said he would make a new\n>  burger.\n\nA claim of *fraud* would fail in court because you will be unable to prove that the restaurant *knowingly misrepresented* to you (that is, *despite knowing it to be false*) that it was serving you a veggie burger with the *intention that you would rely* on that representation. Two hints indicate that the restaurant didn't act with that fraudulent intention: \n\n(1\\) When asked, the cashier told you that yours was not a veggie burger; and \n\n(2\\) he promptly indicated his intention to mend their mistake by telling you that he would make a new burger.\n\nA claim of Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED) would also fail. You wrote:\n\n> After we left, my daughter who was still in the restaurant stated that\n>  they started laughing at my husband and I.\n\nThe fact that the employees waited till you and your husband left reflects that they refrained from intentionally inflicting any emotional distress. A significant factor that will favor them is the fact that they stopped laughing once your daughter asked them why they were laughing:\n\n> My daughter asked why were they laughing, when her parents were in the\n>  car sick from eating meat. They stopped laughing.\n\nEven if you genuinely feel disrespected by their subsequent laughter, there are no legal remedies because their laughter insofar an expression was neither obscene nor disparaging nor threatening/harassing. Laughter can be an understandable way, and possibly a psychological need, to relieve the stress from a situation like this in a context of hours of hard work in exchange for low wages with which to pay their bills.\n\nMoreover, the same fact \\[that they waited till you and your husband left] contradicts the allegation that they laughed \"*at*\" you. Strictly speaking, the restaurant could viably sue your daughter for defamation if the restaurant incurs any losses (including court\\-ordered sanctions against the restaurant) as a result of falsely attributing to it the hostile or belittling behavior implied by the particle *at*. By this I intend to illustrate how certain actions under pretext of extreme \"sensitivity\" can backfire.\n\nPeople elsewhere are victims of much worse misconduct or offenses that have detrimental effects and long\\-lasting ramifications. The court system is \\-\\-if only in theory\\-\\- intended to redress wrongs which are more serious than a mistaken order at a burger restaurant.",

The claim made by IAFOR is contradictory and likely unenforceable. Creative Commons licenses are designed to grant non-exclusive rights to anyone who complies with the license terms. By claiming to offer a Creative Commons license while simultaneously asserting exclusive rights, IAFOR is contradicting the fundamental nature of Creative Commons licensing. \n\nFurthermore, Creative Commons explicitly states in their trademark policy that modifications to their licenses which restrict or condition the rights granted are not allowed. An exclusive license would necessarily modify and restrict the rights granted under a standard Creative Commons license.\n\nOption A is incorrect because a truly exclusive license is incompatible with the open nature of Creative Commons. Option C is wrong because no entity has the right to unilaterally modify Creative Commons licenses. Option D is incorrect as authors should be concerned about such contradictory terms that could affect their rights and the proper use of Creative Commons licensing."

Can I refuse to provide an updated passport?** (they had my valid passport \\- that eventually expired \\- on file)\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Obviously you can refuse, nobody can force you to give them a new passport. There may be consequences.\n\nThe worst: The company's country likely has laws that require the company to make sure you have the right to work there, and to have evidence of it. If you are an EU citizen in an EU country, a valid EU passport would be that evidence. When your passport expires, the company might not have anything that is legally sufficient to allow you working for them. They could have the choice between breaking the law, risking a fine, or firing you.\n\nThis will depend on the exact laws of the country, and likely somewhere deep in the small print of the laws :\\-) In the UK, where this isn't relevant anymore, the laws were changed in 2014 to require that you have a *valid* passport. So in the last seven years you would have had to give them a valid passport.\n\nBTW. Having a copy of your valid passport can make it possible for your employer to buy you flight tickets for foreign countries, for example, which could be useful. I was once in a situation away from home where I unexpectedly needed a copy of my passport (privately), called HR, and they emailed me a copy of it, so that was also useful.",

        "answer": "Here's a multi-form question based on the provided documentation:\n\nQuestion: An EU organization is requesting an employee to provide their new passport for updating employee profiles. The employee's previous passport, which the organization had on file, has expired. The employee is currently working in a different country due to Covid and may not have the proper permit. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the employee's options?\n\nA) The employee has no legal obligation to provide the new passport and can refuse without any consequences.\n\nB) The employee must provide the new passport immediately or face termination, as it's a universal legal requirement.\n\nC) The employee can refuse, but there may be consequences, including potential termination if the company cannot legally prove the employee's right to work.\n\nD) The employee can provide any government-issued ID instead of the passport, and the company must accept it as an equivalent.\n\nCorrect Answer: C\n\nExplanation: The correct answer is C. As stated in the documentation, the employee can refuse to provide the new passport, as nobody can force them to do so. However, there may be consequences to this refusal. The company may be required by law to have evidence of the employee's right to work in the country. Without a valid passport on file, the company might not have legally sufficient documentation to continue employing the individual. This could put the company at risk of breaking the law or facing fines. As a result, the company might have to choose between breaking the law, risking fines, or terminating the employee's contract. The exact consequences would depend on the specific laws of the country in question.\n\nOption A is incorrect because while the employee can refuse, there may be significant consequences.\nOption B is too extreme and not accurate, as the requirement isn't universal and immediate termination isn't guaranteed.\nOption D is incorrect because the company may specifically need passport information for legal compliance, and other forms of ID may not be sufficient."

            "text": "\\#\\#\\# User: I have been looking for open source versions of the bible written in Hebrew, with annotations, such as the literal english meaning of each Hebrew term, the definition of each Hebrew term, the part of speech, etc.. Some things I've found:\n\n* **Hebrew bible text**: There is a **public domain** codex for the Hebrew bible available online in text format.\n* **Hebrew bible dictionary**: There is the \"Strong's Hebrew Dictionary\" which is **public domain** as well, made in the late 1800's.\n* **Interlinear translation**: I found the [Berean Bible](http://berean.bible/terms.htm), which is not public domain, that link takes you to the license which says you can use it in software but can't sell it directly basically, as long as you attribute them. Interlinear translation are basically the literal meaning of each Hebrew word in English.\n* **Part of speech mapping**: The [OpenScriptures](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb/blob/master/LICENSE.md) project has mapped the Hebrew bible text with the Hebrew dictionary, which I think you can do pretty easily automatically given the two data sources are public domain and online in text format usable by software. But they put a [CC v4 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) on it (attribution but commercial use is okay).\n* **Combining it all**: The [OpenHebrewBible](https://github.com/eliranwong/OpenHebrewBible) project combines all of that stuff into one package, and puts a [CC v4 non\\-commercial license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) on it, partly because the interlinear translation says something to that degree in the free rendition of their product.\n\nNow, the first part of my question is, say I want to create the same thing as \"Combining it all\", but I also want to release it as **public domain**. I can use the public domain Hebrew bible text and dictionary to get started, mapping words to definitions basically. But I can't use the interlinear translation. But **I could hire some people** to make an interlinear translation, and it would probably end up being pretty close to the Berean Bible, because interlinear translations mean like 1\\-3 word translations per word, and so you are going to have a lot of same translations. Then we have the part of speech mapping which I could hire people to help write for each word.\n\nSo say I hired people to make an interlinear version, and part of speech tagging, and I released it as public domain. How is that any different than just using the \"Combining it all\" project, and releasing *that* as public domain? I mean, just the data (not any software related to it).\n\nSecond part of the question is, isn't all this type of stuff marked as \"generic data\" in legal terms, stuff which is \"public common knowledge\" and so isn't copyrightable? For example, the part of speech tagging is common knowledge to anyone who speaks Hebrew. And the interlinear English translation is *pretty much* common knowledge to any translator, although you could have translators come up with different end results.\n\nSo I don't understand how I can safely/effectively go about creating a public domain version of the annotated bible written in Hebrew, given this data is common knowledge and yet there are projects which have put licenses on various aspects of this common knowledge. What are the laws or high\\-level factors to consider in such a dilemma?\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: Limiting this to the legal question, it is actually extremely simple. The Hebrew Bible is in the public domain, end of story. Therefore you can freely create a derivative work, a translation to English if you like, based on that original text. You may have to use some copyrighted aids, such as a dictionary, but that's okay, because \"using a dictionary\" is not copyright infringement. You may want to use some copyrighted software to format the result, but again using software is not itself copyright infringement. It would be infringement to lift someone else's protected English translation, but it would not be infringement to consult competing translations as a means of better understanding the original text.\n\nIt is true that in the case of a translation from language to language, there is going to be a substantial similarity in translations to a particular language. This is especially true when dealing with a text that has been independently translated to English hundreds of times. You may therefore have to prove that there is only one possible English translation of \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u0596\u05d9\u05ea \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b8\u05a3\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u0591\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05b5\u05a5\u05ea \u05d4\u05b7\u05e9\u05b8\u05bc\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u0596\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd \u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05a5\u05ea \u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b8\u05bd\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5\u05c3\nand that there are only two or three reasonable translations of \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b8\u05d0\u05b8\u0597\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05d4\u05b8\u05d9\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05a5\u05d4 \u05ea\u05b9\u0599\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc\u0599 \u05d5\u05b8\u05d1\u05b9\u0594\u05d4\u05d5\u05bc \u05d5\u05b0\u05d7\u05b9\u0596\u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05da\u05b0 \u05e2\u05b7\u05dc\u05be\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05a3\u05d9 \u05ea\u05b0\u05d4\u05b9\u0591\u05d5\u05dd \u05d5\u05b0\u05e8\u05a3\u05d5\u05bc\u05d7\u05b7 \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u0594\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05d7\u05b6\u0596\u05e4\u05b6\u05ea \u05e2\u05b7\u05dc\u05be\u05e4\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05a5\u05d9 \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b8\u05bc\u05bd\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd\u05c3\nin other words that the similarity is a necessary coincidence, given the subject matter.",

The easy cases:\n\n1. In the United States, it's in the public domain for lack of a copyright notice.\n2. In countries that are parties to neither the [Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention) nor the [TRIPS Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIPS_Agreement), it's in the public domain because those countries don't recognize anyone else's copyrights.\n3. In countries that have adopted the [rule of the shorter term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_the_shorter_term), it is in the public domain because the image was never copyrighted in the country of origin.\n\nIn the remaining countries, it is likely but not certain that the photo is in the public domain. [Article 18 of the Berne Convention](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Convention_for_the_Protection_of_Literary_and_Artistic_Works/Articles_1_to_21#Article_18) provides that:\n\n> (1\\) This Convention shall apply to all works which, at the moment of its coming into force, have not yet fallen into the public domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the term of protection.\n> \n> \n> (4\\) The preceding provisions shall also apply in the case of new accessions to the Union...\n\nSo in theory, since it was in the public domain in the United States as of March 1, 1989 (the date the United States [ratified the Berne Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_Implementation_Act_of_1988)), it's in the public domain in all Berne countries.

The agreement has one clause which states:\n\n> **Clause\\-x:** Any IP generated in this Project will be jointly owned by UNIVERSITY\n>  and COMPANY.\n\nAnother clause says:\n\n> **Clause\\-y:** COMPANY will be offered first the right to avail of the exclusive\n>  right to commercially exploit the IP generated. If COMPANY\n>  wishes to avail of the said offer then both parties \n>  will enter into a separate agreement detailing the terms. \n> \n> \n> **Clause\\-z:** If COMPANY is not willing to avail of the offer then UNIVERSITY\n>  will be free to offer non\\-exclusive rights on the IP to third \n>  parties, based on consent from COMPANY, which shall not be\n>  unreasonably withheld.\n\nThe part that confuses me is this bit. Does this mean:\n\n1. Company is always allowed to exploit the IP for itself (after all, it is the joint owner in this IP!) but the \"separate agreement\" mentioned is only if the company desires exclusivity. i.e. The ability to block University from licensing the IP to others by paying a fee. In other words, as co\\-owner of the IP, the right to exploit the technology for itself always existed with the Company \\& is not what is being offered (for sale) here via Clause\\-y. What is being offered by University to Company (for payment) is for the University to forfeit its licensing rights as a co\\-owner OR\n2. Even for self\\-exploitation of the IP the company will need to sign a \"separate agreement\" with the University (and presumably pay it money / royalty)?\n\nWhat's the right interpretation of this? I tent to think it is \\#1 but I'd love opinions. \n\n**PS.** At some points the lawyers will come in \\& decide but since I saw the agreement I was curious to interpret it.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: I'm sure you've solved this by now, but your \"option 1\" is the situation.\n\nAs joint owner, you have rights to act with your property in a natural way. You could exclusively license the IP, for instance. However, the university is not bound to do the same, which could undermine the value of your exclusive license. (e.g. If you misrepresented this fact in a prospectus, bond, or note, you could be held liable.)\n\nThe university will forfeit its interests, at a price, or based on any other negotiation element which you may bring to the table and win.\n\nThe part about \n\n> based on consent from COMPANY, which shall not be unreasonably withheld\n\nIs a guard against situations where you may have certain forms of precedent to act with the joint property. A common one that happens is when the university has done nothing with their rights, but you / your company have put the IP into practice and have sales at market. \n\nIf the university now attempts to license and act independently, without discussing with you prior or doing other diligence, it could be held as not acting in good faith. This would give you increased leverage for restitution.\n\nIn that situation, you would be reasonable to withhold consent until negotiations were finalized.",

According to the agreement, which of the following scenarios is most accurate?\n\nA) The company must always enter into a separate agreement with the university, even for self-exploitation of the jointly owned IP.\n\nB) The company has the right to exploit the IP for itself without a separate agreement, but must enter into one if it desires exclusivity.\n\nC) The university can freely offer non-exclusive rights to third parties without the company's consent.\n\nD) The company has no say in how the university licenses the IP to third parties.\n\nCorrect Answer: B\n\nExplanation: \nOption B is correct because as a joint owner of the IP, the company inherently has the right to exploit the technology for itself without needing a separate agreement. The \"separate agreement\" mentioned in Clause-y is specifically for when the company desires exclusivity, i.e., to prevent the university from licensing the IP to others.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the company, as a joint owner, doesn't need a separate agreement for self-exploitation.\n\nOption C is incorrect because Clause-z clearly states that the university needs the company's consent to offer non-exclusive rights to third parties.\n\nOption D is incorrect because the agreement specifies that the university needs the company's consent for offering rights to third parties, and this consent \"shall not be unreasonably withheld.\"\n\nThis question tests understanding of joint IP ownership, exclusive rights, and the nuances of the clauses in the agreement."

The damages for breach of contract are for them to be restored to the position they would have been if the contract had been completed.\n\n**If you have a contract *for* service**\n\nHere you are contracted to perform a particular service: build a building, write a program, cut some hair etc. you are being paid for what you produce, not for your labour.\n\nThe damages for this breach would be the expected value that they would have received. For example, if you were contracted to repair a classic car for $10,000 that they had a buyer willing to pay $100,000 for and that buyer pulled out as a result of your breach. The damages would be $100,000 they expected \\- $10,000 they would have paid you \\= $90,000 less whatever the market value of the unrepaired car is.\n\n**If you have a contract *of* service**\n\nThis is a traditional employment contract or any contract where you are paid by the hour/day/week/year rather than for producing a specified outcome.\n\nFor an employee, there will be required notice periods that you must observe or you are liable for paying in lieu of giving notice. In the circumstances, an employer is unlikely to sue for this.\n\nFor a contractor, the damages could be the cost of finding a replacement through an agency (say $2,500\\) and the difference in rates \\- so if you were being paid $50/hour for 12 weeks of 40 hours ($24,000\\) and the cheapest suitable replacement is $65/hour ($31,200\\) then you could be held liable for the difference.

Two weeks before his start date, he receives a better offer elsewhere. The original contract doesn't mention any clauses about cancellation before the start date. If John cancels the original contract, which of the following is most likely to occur?\n\nA) John cannot be sued as the contract hasn't started yet.\nB) John can be sued, but only for the cost of finding a replacement contractor.\nC) John can be sued for the full value of the 6-month contract.\nD) John can be sued for the difference in rates if a more expensive replacement is hired, plus recruitment costs.\n\nCorrect Answer: D\n\nExplanation: While it's unlikely the company would actually sue, legally they could. This is a contract for service, where John is paid for his time rather than a specific outcome. The company could potentially claim damages for the cost of finding a replacement (e.g., agency fees) and any difference in rates if they have to pay more for a replacement contractor. They wouldn't be able to claim for the full contract value as they haven't incurred that loss, and the contract starting or not is irrelevant - the agreement itself is binding. Option A is incorrect as a valid contract exists. Option B understates the potential damages, while C overstates them. D most accurately reflects the potential legal consequences based on the information provided."

The moment you are placed under arrest you are handcuffed and detained. Not only for officer safety, but also for that very reason (so you cannot destroy or secret away evidence).\n\n> The officer asks me to produce the evidence, and I refuse. Consider several scenarios:\n> \n> \n> 1. Do I have grounds to refuse to produce it because it would be incriminating; I am under no obligation to incriminate myself?\n\n**No.** If the officer is searching you pursuant to arrest (and under your scenario he need not get a warrant as there is evidence in plain view, although he could begin cursory search and have a warrant executed and brought over within an hour, just to be safe). Regardless, you are not consulted as to whether it's OK or not, hence no right to refuse. Further, your 5th amendment right against self incrimination gives you the right not to answer, but you can expect your dwelling to be completely destroyed if they know there is evidence there. Since we are supposing: suppose you actually did get away from the police, before they cuffed you, and were able to get to evidence before being searched and without getting shot (unlikely). They would tear your place apart and would find it.\n\n> 2. The officer, perhaps not knowing the risk involved, attempts to retrieve the evidence and fails, causing the evidence to be destroyed. If the officer can show that I knowingly put the (alleged) evidence in such a situation and allowed him to destroy it, what might the repercussions be after the fact?\n\nYou would be charged with destruction of evidence, on top of whatever you were originally arrested for that they saw in plain view. Further, forensics would almost certainly find some trace of what you were hiding. This scenario is highly unlikely.\n\n> 3. The officer, perhaps understanding the risk, goes to a court and asks them to compel my cooperation. Could this happen and, if so, how?\n\nThe officer, if he knew it, would just find a way to get at it that wouldn't allow for its destruction. They can literally take out pieces of walls, pipes, whatever. They have the resources to get to anything. If the search would become unreasonable lest the Court knew of your dastardly plan, they would just expand the scope of the search via the warrant.\n\n> 4. Suppose I intend to cooperate but accidentally cause the evidence to be destroyed. What might the repercussions be for me, and who would bear the burden of proof?\n\nSame result. You hid it. You destroyed it. You decided to potentially destroy it when you put it in that place, so the outcome is not different.\n\n> 5. Suppose the device has another function which produces some other items which are not incriminating. Suppose the officer retrieves these instead of the real evidence. Am I under any obligation to tell the officer whether those are the only items to be found, if I am hiding other items, etc.?\n\nYour only obligation if you're being searched is to *be quiet*! You have no obligation to help, nor should you help, with the search of your property. But this is not something out of James Bond or Batman. What? Your secret device turns cocaine into sugar? Seriously, this wouldn't happen. If the police thought evidence to be in a place, they wouldn't stop looking because they found something innocuous. They would take whatever it's in apart revealing all its contents.\n\n> 6. Can the mere possession of such a device be used by the prosecution to show criminal intent (e.g., a crowbar, flashlight and ski mask in my trunk)?\n\nWhat device? Now I'm really confused. If you are being searched on suspicion of burglary or robbery for example, the tools a burglar would use or if the robber wore a mask are all viable as potential evidence and would all be seized as such.",

As I understood it, a single senator can call the Senate to order and then immediately adjourn the session. While there is not a quorum of senators present, a quorum is presumed to exist unless someone makes a quorum call; and so one senator can call the Senate to order and adjourn it so long as they \"don't notice\" that there's nobody there.\n\nWould it be possible for another senator to throw a monkey wrench into the works in the following scenario?\n\n1. After an adjournment of three days, Senator A calls the Senate to order for they assume to be a pro forma session. Senator B is sitting in the back row. No other senators are present.\n2. Senator B immediately raises a point of order: the Senate cannot be called to order without a quorum. This session cannot occur without 51 senators present.\n3. The president, noting that an adjournment has lasted longer than three days, argues that the Senate is *de facto* not in session, and makes a whole passel of recess appointments.\n\nI'm sure that the answer is \"this wouldn't work\", or someone would have tried it; one could easily imagine a scenario in which the President \\& Senator B were in the same party and agreed to pull a stunt like this. So my questions are:\n\n* Would Step 2 work? Can a senator block the Senate from being calling to order via a quorum call?\n* If Step 2 would work, would the \"de facto\" argument in Step 3 work? (This is obviously a heavier lift.)\n\nThis is related to [this question](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/60032/could-senators-convene-congress-by-objecting-to-the-closing-of-a-pro-forma-sessi), but that one was asking about whether a pro forma session could be turned into a \"real\" session by making a quorum call. My question is whether a senator could effectively \"cancel\" a pro forma session by making a quorum call, and whether this could give a President the power to make recess appointments.\n\n \\-\n\n\\#\\#\\# Top Answer: No\n--\n\nThe lack of a quorum prevents the Senate from conducting [business](https://www.senate.gov/reference/reference_index_subjects/Rules_and_Procedure_vrd.htm), however, it is still in session.",

Everything else pretty much depends on the contract. As an example, on a web page, an exhortation \"Free Shipping!\" is not false advertising when they charge for shipping, because that exhortation doesn't mean \"we always ship everything for free\", it means that free shipping is a possibility. When you look at the details of the contract, it will specify when there is free shipping. Some state might enact a very strict deceptive practices law that prohibits advertisement that says \"Free Shipping\" unless there are no conditions attached to getting free shipping, but that isn't the way it is now.\n\nOnce you actually have an agreement, then the parties can be held to that agreement. Whether you actually have a legal agreement can be a little murky with online sales: you may instead have an invitation to treat. A website is an advertisement, not an offer, so you have to investigate to determine what constitutes an offer and acceptance. Clicking something doesn't necessarily count. Actually paying generally does; entering a credit card does not (was the charge just pending?). An express acceptance counts. This would be the primary legal question \u2013 do you have an actual offer and acceptance (and how would you know)? I presume that there was a step where you had to check a box and click \"submit\", and the check box said that you agree to the terms of sale. There should be something in there that addresses what constitutes an agreement (should be, but might not be).\n\nYou could try suing the company to get a court order requiring them to send the goods for the agreed on price (\"specific performance\", but the courts are unlikely to do that, instead they will order \"compensation\", i.e. a refund. You can read up on Chinese contract law [here](https://www.ilo.org/dyn/natlex/docs/ELECTRONIC/52923/108022/F1916937257/CHN52923%20Eng.pdf), to see how your situation is addressed.",

The statement \"Free Shipping!\" on a website is generally considered an advertisement, not a binding offer. The formation of a contract depends on the specific steps taken during the purchasing process, such as agreeing to terms of sale, clicking submit buttons, and whether payment was actually processed or just pending. The ability to enforce the agreement or seek compensation would be based on these factors, as well as the specific terms of sale agreed upon during the transaction.
